He contends that there was insufficient evidence to disprove his claim of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 On Christmas Eve 2010, Victim went to a party with his girlfriend (Girlfriend). The party was hosted by Girlfriend's uncle (Uncle) and included about two dozen guests, mostly Girlfriend's family. Uncle also invited Doyle, who attended the party with two friends. Girlfriend knew Doyle growing up, but Victim had never met him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 While Doyle, Girlfriend, and Victim were together in Uncle's kitchen, Girlfriend introduced Victim and Doyle. Victim, who had been keeping to himself, looked up as Girlfriend introduced him as her \"old man.\" Victim smiled and said, \"Hello,\" and Doyle responded, \"Are you looking at me funny?\" or, \"You looking at me crazy fool?\" Victim shook his head and said, \"No,\" looking down to avoid a confrontation. According to Girlfriend, all three of them looked away and she thought they \"were all cool.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The next thing Victim remembered was waking up on the kitchen floor. He did not remember getting punched but felt pain \"shooting through [his] eye and the left side of [his] face.\" At trial, Girlfriend recalled that Doyle \"cold clocked\" Victim after they had all looked away. The punch knocked Victim \"out cold,\" and Girlfriend testified that Doyle started hitting and kicking Victim while he lay unconscious on the floor. Girlfriend tried to stop the assault, but Doyle's two friends joined the attack and she was eventually pulled out of the kitchen by her cousin. In the fracas, Girlfriend was punched and had a tooth knocked out, but she did not know who hit her. Girlfriend later testified that the beating of Victim lasted for, what seemed to her, two to three minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The other partygoers heard the commotion coming from the kitchen, and Girlfriend's family rushed to the scene and helped Victim. As people moved out of the kitchen, Uncle confronted Doyle to figure out what happened. Doyle was \"hyped up\" and \"[r]eally aggressive\" and told Uncle that Victim had disrespected him and \"was giving him dirty looks\" when the two were introduced. Doyle did not claim that Victim had acted aggressively toward him or that Doyle was defending himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Girlfriend's cousin also confronted Doyle, asking him if he hit Girlfriend. Doyle made \"some cocky ass response\" like, \"You know I did.\" Sensing additional impending trouble, another partygoer (J.G.) stepped between them to prevent another fight. But when J.G. turned his back to Doyle, Doyle punched him in the back of the head. Another fight started, and Doyle's two friends again joined the fray. Someone called the police, and Doyle and one of his friends left, leaving the other friend behind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Doyle was not gone for long. J.G. went outside to escape the \"craziness\" with his girlfriend, who was eight months pregnant. As she and J.G. were talking, Doyle and his friend approached them and started \"talking crazy.\" J.G. and the pair again exchanged blows, and the friend took a swing at the girlfriend's stomach. J.G. was able to block the swing but was knocked down. Doyle yelled, \"I'm going to try to catch a murder charge,\" and then he jumped in the car with his friend and left. The police arrived less than one minute later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Victim later returned home, deciding not to go to the hospital that night because it was Christmas Eve. The next morning, he woke up and had Christmas with his kids but was in \"an extreme amount of pain.\" Girlfriend took him to the emergency room, where he was referred to a plastic surgeon (Doctor). Doctor found that Victim had suffered numerous bone fractures around his\n   left eye, but delayed surgery for more than two weeks due to swelling. When Doctor was able to perform the surgery, it took eleven hours to repair the damage to Victim's face and position three permanent titanium plates and one biodegradable plate. Doctor later testified at trial that, although it was possible Victim's injuries were caused by a single punch, it would have required a \"significant amount of force.\" Based on his experience, Doctor was ultimately unsure how many times Victim was hit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Due to his injuries, Victim did not return to work for nearly two months, lived off a liquid diet for two weeks, and was unable to communicate without pain and discomfort. To this day, Victim suffers from migraines and vision loss, conditions he never had before the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The State charged Doyle with aggravated assault resulting in serious bodily injury, a second degree felony, and included an in-concert enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, Doyle argued self-defense, claiming that Victim threatened him with a beer bottle. Doyle testified that immediately after Girlfriend introduced them, Victim \"turned around and grabbed a bottle off the counter\" and raised it above his head in a threatening manner. To defend himself, Doyle hit Victim one time and then was \"jumped\" by Girlfriend's family. At the end of trial, Doyle moved for a directed verdict, arguing that the State did not meet its burden of disproving self-defense. The trial court denied the motion and found that there was a \"disputed issue\" as to self-defense that should go to the jury. The court instructed the jury on self-defense, explaining that the prosecution had the burden to \"prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense [did] not apply.\" After a two-day trial, the jury found Doyle guilty of aggravated assault but rejected the in-concert enhancement. Doyle appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Doyle asks us to reverse his conviction for aggravated assault, contending that the trial court should have granted his motion for a directed verdict because there was insufficient evidence to disprove his claim of self-defense. \"We review a trial court's ruling on a motion for directed verdict for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Preservation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 Doyle's insufficiency challenge has two components: first, that the evidence supporting his conviction and disproving his self-defense claim was \"inconclusive and speculative\"; and second, that in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence against Doyle, the trial court should have disregarded Girlfriend's testimony as \"inherently improbable.\" The State counters that these issues were unpreserved. It acknowledges that Doyle moved for a directed verdict in the trial court but argues that he did not preserve his sufficiency challenges \"because his blanket objections below ... were not specific to the claims he now raises.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 To preserve an issue for appeal, a party must present it \"to the trial court in such a way that the trial court has an opportunity to rule on that issue.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

As in\n   <em>\n    Gallegos\n   </em>\n   , Doyle's arguments on appeal merely present the self-defense argument from below \"with more flesh on the bone.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%20112\">\n    2018 UT App 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570546\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/578/\">\n    427 P.3d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In his motion for a directed verdict, Doyle argued that the State had the burden to disprove self-defense and that it had to \"present more than [it] ha[d]\" to meet that burden. In Doyle's view, his testimony that he was threatened by Victim was never disproven. These arguments were tersely made, but were presented in context of the two-day trial in which self-defense was an important issue. In his motion, Doyle did not identify every perceived defect in the State's evidence, but it was clear he was arguing that the evidence presented was too inconclusive and speculative to disprove self-defense. This basic theory-that the State did not disprove that Doyle acted in self-defense-has not changed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Inherent Improbability\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 We reach a different conclusion, however, on Doyle's inherent-improbability argument. Under\n   <em>\n    State v. Robbins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996296\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/210/288/\">\n    2009 UT 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996296\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/210/288/\">\n    210 P.3d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a court may disregard testimony that is \"inherently improbable\" when determining whether there is sufficient evidence for a conviction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. The inherent improbability doctrine has very limited applicability and comes into play \"only in those instances where (1) there are material inconsistencies in the testimony and (2) there is no other circumstantial or direct evidence of the defendant's guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In support, he asserts that Victim's injuries were inconsistent with Girlfriend's version of events: Victim had injuries only to the face with no other injuries to his body. According to Doyle, if Girlfriend's account were true-that Victim was punched and kicked for two to three minutes by three attackers-Victim would have had more serious injuries. In addition, Doyle asserts that Girlfriend's testimony was \"patently false\" and \"uncorroborated.\" For these reasons, he maintains that Girlfriend's testimony cannot sustain the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b619 This goes far beyond what was argued in the motion for a directed verdict.\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   may be a component of an insufficiency challenge, but not every insufficiency challenge raises a\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   issue. Doyle's contention that the trial court should have evaluated the sufficiency of the evidence without Girlfriend's testimony does not merely add \"more flesh on the bone.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Instead, it introduces a new legal theory: that the insufficiency should be reviewed only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Girlfriend's testimony is ignored as \"inherently improbable.\" And unlike the arguments above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part I.A., it would not have been clear from context that the motion for a directed verdict was making a\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   challenge. Instead, the motion centered on the State's burden of proof and its alleged failure to disprove Doyle's testimony that he acted defensively based on all of the evidence presented. There was never any argument that Girlfriend's testimony was so inherently improbable that it should be disregarded before analyzing the sufficiency of the State's evidence. Thus, this particular challenge was not presented to the trial court and was not preserved for appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gallegos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%20112\">\n    2018 UT App 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570546\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/578/\">\n    427 P.3d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   II. Plain Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b620 Alternatively, Doyle contends that the trial court committed plain error by considering Girlfriend's testimony in reviewing his motion for a directed verdict. \"The plain error doctrine serves as an exception to our long-standing rule that issues cannot be raised on appeal if they were not argued below at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Only when testimony is \"inherently improbable,\" that is, \"incredibly dubious and, as such, apparently false,\" can the issue be taken from the jury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b622 Here, it is not obvious that the inconsistencies in Girlfriend's testimony \"run so counter to human experience\" that it renders her testimony \"inherently improbable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. As to Victim's injuries being inconsistent with Girlfriend's testimony, Doctor testified that Victim's significant injuries may have been caused by a single blow, or by many. Ultimately, Doctor could not say how many times Victim was hit. Thus, this question properly went to the jury. Doyle also asserts that Girlfriend's testimony that she\n   had a tooth knocked out during the melee is inconsistent with her statement to police several hours after the incident, where she did not report that fact. But \"pre-trial inconsistent statements do not render [a witness's] testimony 'apparently false.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, they present routine credibility questions for a jury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Next, Doyle attacks Girlfriend's estimation that the attack lasted two to three minutes, saying this estimation is patently false because \"none of her approximately twenty family members intervened\" and \"even the [prosecutor] acknowledged that [Girlfriend] was wrong to testify that the incident lasted for two to three minutes.\" Yet the record shows that Girlfriend's family\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   intervene-even Doyle claimed that he was \"jumped\" as soon as he hit Victim. And besides, how long the attack lasted is irrelevant; the question is whether Doyle assaulted Victim-be it for three seconds or three minutes. This is not an obvious basis to disregard Girlfriend's entire testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   III.

In addition, Doyle contends that the evidence is speculative because \"Doyle's behavior after the incident\" does not speak to Doyle's actions in regard to Victim. We conclude both contentions lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b626 First, there was at least one witness to the incident. Victim testified that (1) his memory of before he was hit was \"[v]ery clear,\" (2) when Doyle asked him if he was looking at him funny, he looked away to avoid a confrontation, and (3) he \"did not want to confront [Doyle].\" Further, when asked whether he made \"any threats toward Mr. Doyle\" or did \"anything aggressive towards Mr. Doyle before [he] got punched,\" Victim said, \"No.\" And even assuming that Girlfriend did not witness the initial hit because she momentarily looked away after Victim and Doyle were introduced, she testified that, based on her observations and impressions, Doyle \"cold clocked\" Victim and\n   that Doyle continued to hit and kick Victim while he was unconscious. At any rate, eyewitness testimony is not required to disprove self-defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake City v. Carrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845581\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/358/1067/\">\n    2015 UT 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845581\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/358/1067/\">\n    358 P.3d 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Circumstantial evidence alone may be sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused.\" (quotation simplified) ).

In this regard, Doyle misapprehends the distinction between speculation and reasonable inference. This distinction was explained by our supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Carrera\n   </em>\n   : \"In short, the difference between an inference and speculation depends on whether the underlying facts support the conclusion. A jury draws a reasonable inference if there is an evidentiary foundation to draw and support the conclusion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845581\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/358/1067/\">\n    2015 UT 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845581\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/358/1067/\">\n    358 P.3d 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Victim testified that he did not want to fight Doyle and looked away before being punched. Girlfriend also testified that Victim looked away after the tense introduction. The fact that Victim looked down supports the reasonable inference that Victim did not grab a bottle off the counter to attack Doyle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b628 Moreover, J.G. testified that Victim is \"such a nice guy\" and a \"nonviolent kind of guy.\" In contrast, J.G.'s girlfriend testified that Doyle was \"hyped up\" and \"[r]eally aggressive.\" This is borne out by Doyle's actions throughout the night of the party. Doyle and his friends started several fights-with Victim, with J.G., and with a woman who was eight months pregnant. And when confronted by Uncle about the events in the kitchen, Doyle did not say Victim had threatened him. Instead, more consistent with Victim's and Girlfriend's accounts, Doyle told Uncle that Victim had \"giv[en] him dirty looks\" and \"had disrespected him.\" These facts support a reasonable inference that, while Victim was nonviolent, Doyle was aggressive. They also support the further inference that Doyle did not defend himself in response to an unprovoked attack from Victim, but that Doyle felt disrespected and hit Victim as Victim was looking away. In short, there is \"some evidence ... from which a reasonable jury could find\" that Doyle did not act in self-defense.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882000\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1168/\">\n    2015 UT 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882000\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/1168/\">\n    345 P.3d 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).
