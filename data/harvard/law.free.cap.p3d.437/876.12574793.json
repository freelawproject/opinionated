Although\n   <em>\n    Koelsch\n   </em>\n   provides guidance on how to equitably divide retirement benefits at dissolution, it does not authorize a post-judgment alteration to the spouses' agreed-upon distribution. Additionally, where the non-employee-spouse agrees that the community-property portion of retirement benefits will be paid upon distribution to the employee-spouse in a consent decree and stipulated domestic relations order (DRO), the employee-spouse's decision to work past initial retirement eligibility does not justify relief from the agreement under Arizona Rule of Family Law Procedure 85(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore affirm the order denying Wife's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Husband cross-appeals the order denying his request for an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) \u00a7 25-324(A). Because the court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm the order denying fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In September 2009, the parties' eleven-year marriage was dissolved via consent decree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the decree, the parties agreed to divide the community-property portion of Husband's pension with the Arizona Public Safety Retirement System (APSRS) pursuant to a separate DRO. The DRO, which was signed by both parties and entered the same day as the decree, awarded Wife \"as sole and separate property a pro-rata share of [Husband]'s pension [p]ayable directly by the System at the same time and in the same manner payments are made to [Husband].\" By its terms, the DRO may be amended \"only for the purpose of establishing or maintaining its acceptance to [APSRS] and to supervise the payment of retirement benefits as provided in the Order.\" Neither party appealed from entry of the decree or DRO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Although Husband became eligible to retire in late 2014, he continues to work and contribute to APSRS and plans to do so through at least 2024. In October 2016, Wife petitioned to \"enforce\" the division of retirement benefits, arguing Husband's decision to delay his retirement impermissibly \"blocked [her] from accessing her sole and separate property\" and that she was entitled to immediate and direct compensation for that deprivation. After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the family court denied Wife's request and ordered the parties to bear their own attorneys' fees and costs. Both parties timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and -2101(A)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Here, the DRO states that Wife will receive her share of the pension paid \"by the System at the same time and in the same manner payments are made to [Husband].\" And, the DRO can be modified only to facilitate these terms. Wife nonetheless argues that an employee-spouse who chooses to work past initial retirement eligibility is required, as a matter of equity, to indemnify the non-employee-spouse for the loss of his or her share of otherwise-available retirement benefits. Wife's contention, which essentially calls for a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   modification of the otherwise unambiguous decree and DRO, is inconsistent with Arizona law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 When the division of assets is based upon an agreement of the parties, \"entry of the decree shall thereafter preclude the modification of the terms of the decree and the property settlement agreement, if any, set forth or incorporated by reference.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 25-317(F).

While it is true that\n   <em>\n    Koelsch\n   </em>\n   largely disapproved of an arrangement that would grant the employee-spouse sole discretion to determine when the non-employee-spouse received his or her share of community property retirement benefits, the issue there arose on direct appeal from a decree of dissolution entered\n   following a contested hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1471844\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/148/176/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1471844\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/148/176/\">\n    at 178-79, 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1471844\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/148/176/\">\n    713 P.2d at 1236-37, 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, the court's uncertainty regarding the procedural posture of Wife's request does not contradict its finding that she acted reasonably in pursuing a claim otherwise available to her under Rule 85(b).
