During the eviction, Harmon obtained an ex parte order staying enforcement of the judgment. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973 (RLTA) prohibited such an order. We hold that the RLTA does not apply to tenants, like Harmon, who contest entry of a default judgment in unlawful detainer actions; these actions are governed by the Civil Rules. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision, including the award of appellate attorney fees and costs to Reynolds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 In February 2016, Harmon began renting an apartment managed by Randy Reynolds &amp; Associates (Reynolds). On July 11, 2016, Reynolds served Harmon with a notice terminating her tenancy and directing her to vacate the apartment by the end of the month. Harmon did not leave her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 On August 15, 2016, Reynolds filed an eviction summons and unlawful detainer complaint. The summons indicated Harmon must respond in writing to the landlord's attorney by September 15, 2016, if she wished to defend herself against the lawsuit. Although Harmon responded to the complaint and sent it to Reynolds' attorney by certified mail on September 14, the day before the specified deadline, the response was not timely received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 On September 15, 2016, Reynolds moved for an order of default judgment, including a writ of restitution against Harmon for failure to appear or defend against the complaint. The next day, the superior court commissioner entered the default judgment and granted the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 On September 19, the Thurston County sheriff posted the writ at Harmon's home, requiring her to vacate within 72 hours or be subject to physical eviction. That same day, Harmon moved ex parte to stay execution of the writ of restitution. The commissioner granted the stay, finding good cause existed because Harmon alleged that she answered Reynolds' complaint before the case was filed and default judgment was entered. A show cause hearing was scheduled for September 23, 2016. The stay order waived any requirement for Harmon to post a bond until a hearing on the merits of the motion could be held. Harmon did not post a bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 At the show cause hearing, the commissioner found that Harmon failed to prove Reynolds received her response before the deadline and thus had no basis to lift the default\n   judgment. The commissioner lifted the stay and entered a judgment with attorney fees and costs in favor of Reynolds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 On September 29, 2016, the writ was executed. Harmon was evicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 During the eviction process, Harmon was in crisis. Her health had declined since moving into her apartment. She suffered left foot neuropathy\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   caused by spinal damage and a groin hernia for which she would undergo surgery and was diagnosed with heart failure. Harmon lived alone, had no income, received rental assistance, and had a pending Social Security application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Although Reynolds prevailed at the trial court and evicted Harmon, the landlord nevertheless sought appellate review. The Court of Appeals commissioner allowed\n   Reynolds to \"supplement the record with declarations\" from two attorneys involved in the case. Br. of Appellant at 4 n.3 (Wash. Ct. App., No. 49588-1-II). The Court of Appeals recognized that the issues raised were moot and that it could not offer relief but reached the merits of the case under the public interest exception.\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v. Harmon\n   </em>\n   , 1 Wash. App. 2d 239, 244-46,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=404%20P.3d%20602\">\n    404 P.3d 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). The court held, in a published decision, that the superior court commissioner violated CR 5(a) and RCW 59.18.390(1) by granting the ex parte stay without providing notice to Reynolds and waiving the bond requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 246-49, 250-52,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=404%20P.3d%20602\">\n    404 P.3d 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

She again found herself without counsel at the Court of Appeals. She did not file a brief and her motion for reconsideration was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 Harmon petitioned this court for review. She argued that the issues Reynolds raised below were moot, the Court\n   of Appeals incorrectly considered evidence from outside the trial record, and the superior court's inherent equitable authority gave it the power to issue the order staying execution of the writ of restitution. Reynolds opposed review and, in the alternative, asked the court to consider whether the waiver of a bond pending a show cause hearing violated RCW 59.18.390(1). We granted review of all issues and asked for supplemental briefing on whether Reynolds qualified as an aggrieved party pursuant to RAP 3.1.\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v.

First, it fails to address the fact that Reynolds prevailed on every issue raised below. At the trial court, the landlord obtained a default judgment and writ of restitution, obtaining \"all of the relief it sought-full rent for August and September and the right to\n   amend the judgment to recoup damages to the premises that occurred during litigation.\" Pet'r's Suppl.

First, the question of whether the RLTA applies to tenants contesting default judgments is an issue of statutory interpretation. Matters of statutory interpretation tend to be more public, more likely to arise again, and helpful to public officials. Procedurally, this case presents issues implicating our rules on appellate procedure that, like matters of statutory interpretation, are more public in nature.\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1179775\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/111/445/#p448\">\n    111 Wash.2d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=759%20P.2d%201206\">\n    759 P.2d 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jafar v.

Second, our determination of a potential limitation on ex parte stay orders for writs of restitution and the ability of a commissioner to waive the filing of a bond under RCW 59.18.390 will guide future trial and appellate courts. Third, unlawful detainer actions are, unfortunately, routine occurrences and so similar questions are likely to recur. Fourth, the level of adversity between the parties favored the landlord.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21 On balance, the four factors support reaching the merits of this case. Thus, the Court of Appeals properly applied the substantial public interest exception to mootness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   3. The Court of Appeals properly considered additional evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22 We next consider Harmon's argument that new evidence considered on appeal violated the rules of appellate procedure. The Court of Appeals commissioner granted Reynolds' motion to supplement the record with two declarations from the landlord's attorneys.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comm'r's Ruling,\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v. Harmon\n   </em>\n   , No. 49588-1-II (Wash. Ct. App. Feb. 17, 2017) (permitting declarations from Michael G. Gusa and\n   Mary Ann Strickler). Harmon asserts that the declarations constitute new evidence outside the record and should not have been admitted pursuant to RAP 9.10 or 9.11. Surprisingly, Reynolds contends neither rule is applicable. Reynolds instead offers RAP 1.2 as the ground for admitting the declarations. Although RAP 1.2 does not provide a freestanding mechanism to admit new evidence, its direction to liberally read these procedural rules guides our interpretation of RAP 9.10 and 9.11. In light of RAP 1.2, Reynolds' declarations were properly admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 23 Turning first to RAP 9.10, a motion to supplement the record under this rule allows a party to request that additional portions of an already existing trial record be transmitted to the appellate court. RAP 9.10 ;\n   <em>\n    Buckley v. Snapper Power Equip. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1729483\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/61/932/#p941\">\n    61 Wash.

The declarations offered by Reynolds were not part of the trial record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 24 Reynolds' motion would have been more properly brought under RAP 9.11. RAP 9.11 is a limited remedy under which a court may direct additional evidence be taken, provided certain prerequisites are met. RAP 9.11(a) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Ziegler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1169925\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/114/533/#p541\">\n    114 Wash.2d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=789%20P.2d%2079\">\n    789 P.2d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). The rule restricts the use of new evidence to only instances when the evidence is directed to \"the merits of the case,\" among other requirements. RAP 9.11(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 25 The new evidence in Reynolds' declarations does not expressly concern the merits of its case. The declarations assert that granting the ex parte stay of the writ of restitution was likely to recur, one of the criteria for determining whether an issue is of substantial public interest. This assertion does not implicate the substantive issues but does address the legal question of mootness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 26 A strict reading of RAP 9.11 counsels against application of this rule. However, it is clear from RAP 1.2 that an appellate court may exercise its discretion to consider cases and issues on their merits. RAP 1.2(a). In this case, mootness posed a procedural hurdle to be overcome\n   in order for the Court of Appeals to weigh in on the substantive questions. To reach the merits of Reynolds' case, as RAP 1.2 directs, new evidence addressing mootness was required. Reading RAP 9.11 liberally would permit the introduction of Reynolds' additional evidence. The Court of Appeals did not err in admitting the declarations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   4. RCW 59.18.390 does not prohibit the stay of a writ of restitution after entry of a default judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   a. Residential Landlord Tenant Act, ch. 59.18 RCW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 27 Turning now to the merits, Harmon argues that RCW 59.18.390 does not limit the ability of a court to stay execution of a writ of restitution after a default judgment is entered. Central to Harmon's argument is the procedural posture of her case, namely, that subsection .390(1) applies to situations in which a tenant seeks to remain in a premises after a writ of restitution is issued and\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to a trial on the merits. In Harmon's case, a default judgment was entered and no trial occurred. She sought not to stay the writ pending trial but to contest entry of default and execution of the writ. Harmon argues that .390(1) does not apply to actions contesting default judgments. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28 The meaning of a statute is a question of law reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Ecology v.

Application of the RLTA to this case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 36 Harmon argues the language of subsection .390(1), as well as its statutory scheme, illustrate that the provision does not apply to tenants seeking to contest default judgments.

To be properly understood, it must be read with the preceding statutes. Taken together, these provisions set out the step-by-step process by which a landlord evicts a tenant who has unlawfully held over. The unlawful detainer provisions detail an eviction process in which a tenant defends herself and proceeds to a trial on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   RCW 59.18.380 (\"The court shall also enter an order directing the parties to proceed to trial on the complaint and answer in the usual manner.\").

CR 55 governs default and judgment. A party that fails to appear, plead, or otherwise defend against a claim may be placed in default, and a judgment may be entered against that party. CR 55. A motion for default may be brought against such a party. CR 55(a)(1). Reynolds followed this procedure when Harmon did not appear or defend against the unlawful detainer complaint-the landlord moved for an order of default and judgment, albeit not specifically referencing any civil rule in the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 41 CR 55(c) states that for good cause shown and on terms the court deems just, the court may set aside default in accordance with CR 60(b), which details the procedure on vacation of judgment. CR 55(c)(1) ; CR 60(e)(1)-(3) (motion, notice, and service). CR 62 governs stays of proceedings to enforce a judgment. Subsection (b) explains that a court may, in its discretion, stay the enforcement of a judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 42 Harmon sought to stay the writ pending a hearing on the merits of her motion to vacate judgment.

The commissioner properly stayed execution of the writ of restitution\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 43 We conclude that tenable grounds exist for the superior court commissioner to have stayed the default judgment under the Civil Rules. Reynolds argues that even if subsection.390(1) does not apply to Harmon, the superior court nevertheless erred by granting the stay. Unfortunately, the record does not show the grounds under which Harmon sought a stay of execution of the writ or a transcript for the September 23, 2016 show cause hearing. Because\n   no trial occurred, neither section .380 nor section .390 applies to Harmon's case. Effectively, therefore, Harmon's motion to stay the writ and default judgment was a motion to set aside default judgment under CR 62(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 44 CR 62 explicitly gives a trial court \"discretion\" to grant or deny a motion to stay and permits the court to condition stays \"for the security of the adverse party as are proper.\" CR 62(b). Harmon alleged that she filed an answer before the deadline and that the multiple addresses on Reynolds' pleadings caused confusion.

Therefore, the plain language of the rule requires every motion to be served on a party unless it is \"\n   <em>\n    permitted\n   </em>\n   \" to be heard ex parte; and, if an ex parte motion is permitted, there must logically be some source of authority allowing it.\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   , 1 Wash.

In a perfect world, Harmon would have had representation or titled her motion specifically as moving to vacate a default judgment under CR 62.

This argument incorrectly assumes .390(1) applies to tenants seeking to vacate a default judgment. As discussed in detail above, this provision does not apply to Harmon; she moved to stay execution of the writ and default judgment, which is governed pursuant to CR 55, 60, and 62. Had the default judgment not been entered and the unlawful detainer action set over for a trial on the merits, .390(1) would have been triggered. Harmon would have been required to post a bond and give notice to Reynolds in order to stay in her home until trial. RCW 59.18.390(1). Because Harmon contested the default judgment, .390(1) does not apply. She was therefore not required by that statute to post a bond or abide by .390(1)'s notice and hearing requirements.

Nor is it restricted to situations involving the specific implied powers at issue in the cases the majority cites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 60 Absent any articulated limiting principle in its reasoning, the majority's affirmation of the superior court's inherent authority risks spilling beyond the context of this case and undermining the orderly procedures set forth in well-considered court rules. The risk of the unintended consequences that may follow is not worth taking, given that this case is so readily resolved on the narrow, basic rule that only an \"aggrieved\" party may appeal from a judgment. As we all agree, Reynolds is not an aggrieved party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 61 The court should not use this case to announce a sweeping new holding about the superior court's inherent powers. The more\n   prudent course of action is to grant Harmon the remedy she initially sought in her petition to\n   this court and to which she is entitled: vacation of the Court of Appeals' decision under RAP 3.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Johnson, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Fairhurst, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Madsen, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Pet. for Review (arguing only that the Court of Appeals' decision should be vacated; not requesting reversal on the merits); Suppl.
