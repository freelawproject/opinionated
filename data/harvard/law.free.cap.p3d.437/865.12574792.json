In this special action, we hold that \u00a7 40-285(A) does not give the Commission power over a city's exercise of eminent domain. Accordingly, we vacate the portion of the Commission's March 30, 2018 order requiring the public utility to apply for Commission approval of the proposed condemnation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 In October 2017, the City of Surprise (\"City\") entered into a letter of intent with Circle City Water Company, L.L.C. (\"Circle City\"), documenting the City's intent to condemn substantially all the assets of Circle City, including the right to almost four thousand acre-feet of water per year from the Central Arizona Project (\"CAP\"). Pursuant to statute, Surprise voters authorized the condemnation and the Surprise City Council approved the filing of a condemnation action. A residential developer contends that Circle City is obliged under an existing contract to allocate its CAP water for a planned development. Upon inquiry by the developer, the City advised that it has no obligation to provide water under the existing contract. The developer then asked the Commission to enter an order preventing the sale of Circle City's CAP allocation to the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 The Commission opened an investigation. On March 30, 2018, the Commission ordered Circle City to file an application under \u00a7 40-285 and Arizona Administrative Code (\"A.A.C.\") R14-2-402(D), seeking Commission authorization \"to abandon, sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise dispose of its utility.\" At the time of the order, the Commission was aware that the negotiations between the City and Circle City were intended to result in condemnation, not a sale. Circle City filed the application under protest. Commission staff determined that Circle City did not fully comply with the March 30 order by failing to include a copy of the draft condemnation agreement between Circle City and the City. At the Commission's direction, Circle City provided a copy of the draft agreement under seal. The Commission then required Circle City to confirm in writing whether the City would assume Circle City's water contract with the developer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 Shortly thereafter, the City filed this special action, alleging the Commission acted\n   without jurisdiction in entering the March 30 order. This Court stayed further administrative proceedings pending resolution of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 We accepted jurisdiction over this special action to clarify the scope of the Commission's authority over eminent domain proceedings pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 40-285(A). We have jurisdiction pursuant to article 6, section 5(1) of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-2001 and 12-2021.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

But special action jurisdiction is not appropriate when parties have an \"equally plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 Here, the scope of Commission authority involves a purely legal question of statutory interpretation: whether the Commission has exceeded its statutory authority. The City cannot presently appeal the Commission's order because it is not a party to the administrative proceedings, and the City has no other means to challenge the Commission's actions. For those reasons, special action review is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz. Corp. Comm'n v. State ex rel.

Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b68 The Commission asserts that the City lacks standing to bring this action and the City's case is not ripe for decision. This Court is \"not constitutionally constrained to decline jurisdiction based on lack of standing\" because the Arizona Constitution, unlike the Federal Constitution, contains no \"case or controversy\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    Sears v.

But its March 30 order requiring Circle City to file an application pursuant to \u00a7 40-285\"for authority to abandon, sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise dispose of its utility\" in the face of the City's proposed condemnation constitutes an injury to the City. While facially directed only at Circle City, the assertion of authority under that statute, if valid, would give the Commission the authority to void the City's condemnation action. Further, standing is suggested by Arizona's declaratory judgment statute, which provides that a party whose \"rights, status or other legal relations are affected by a statute\" may seek declaratory relief regarding the statute's construction.

Commission Authority Over Condemnation Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b611 The Commission argues it has authority to regulate condemnations under \u00a7 40-285(A) and A.A.C. R14-2-402(D). Section 40-285(A) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A public service corporation shall not sell, lease, assign, mortgage or otherwise dispose of or encumber the whole or any part of its railroad, line, plant or system necessary or useful in the performance of its duties to the public ... without first having secured from the commission an order authorizing it so to do. Every such disposition, encumbrance or merger made other than in accordance with the order of the commission authorizing it is void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A.A.C. R14-2-402(D)(1) provides that \"[a] utility shall not abandon, sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise dispose of its facilities or operation without first obtaining authority therefor from the Commission.\" The City argues \u00a7 40-285(A) does not apply because the statutory language does not reference condemnation proceedings and because a condemnation is neither a sale nor other voluntary transfer, as the statute otherwise contemplates. The Commission asserts that the phrase \"or otherwise dispose of\" is sufficiently broad to include a transfer resulting from a condemnation. Because \u00a7 40-285(A) does not expressly include transfers through condemnation proceedings, we must decide whether condemnations are included by the phrase \"or otherwise dispose of.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b612 The Commission's interpretation of \"otherwise dispose of\" is inconsistent with the context of the statute. \"[S]ell, lease, assign\" and \"mortgage\" are all voluntary transactions; a condemnation, in contrast, is an involuntary governmental taking of assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Water N.M., Inc. v.

Nonetheless, relying on dicta in a case from another jurisdiction, the dissent draws a line between contested and uncontested condemnations, giving the Commission authority over the latter but not the former. Effectively, the dissent empowers the Commission to veto a municipal corporation's eminent domain decision based only on the determination that it is not sufficiently adversarial. This approach makes sense only if we accept the dissent's selective use of dictionary definitions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42 (defining the power of eminent domain by selecting one of six entries for a term, ignoring the more relevant entries with contrary implications), and its strained application of the general terms canon,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Scalia &amp; Garner,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 101-03 (general terms canon instructs that terms like \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   persons\" and \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   property\" not be arbitrarily limited, but does not apply when context provides \"\n   <em>\n    some indication to the contrary\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added)).

Under the dissent's expansive view, if the condemnee-utility fails to object to either the inevitable condemnation or the amount of the City's monetary offer, the City must obtain Commission approval for the sale. But by drawing a line between contested and uncontested condemnations, giving the Commission authority over the latter but not the former, the dissent misconstrues the power of eminent domain. The government has the right to condemn property for public use irrespective of the condemnee's mindset. And this makes sense: why should a condemnee's willingness to sell his property limit the government's inherent power (and here, the City's express statutory right,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9-516(B)) to condemn\n   it?

However, the Court goes further to divest the Commission of authority to protect the interests of water consumers in the event the transfer of the water utility here is actually a voluntary transaction dressed up as an exercise of eminent domain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b631 The majority correctly identifies the usual dividing line regarding which governmental acquisitions of private water facilities\n   require Commission approval: if they are voluntary transactions, they do; if they are involuntary transactions effectuated through eminent domain, they do not. Unfortunately, the majority ignores the more difficult question that may be presented here: what happens when the acquisition is voluntary\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   consummated through eminent domain? The majority holds that the moment a municipality announces its intention to use eminent domain, the Commission's authority to protect water consumers dissolves. I cannot join that holding for it elevates form over substance and defeats important statutory objectives underlying the Commission's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b632 I wish I could share the majority's certitude that this scenario is resolved through clear statutory language. But neither the statutes creating the Commission's authority to protect water consumers nor those pertaining to a municipality's eminent domain authority speak directly to this circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b633 When two sets of statutes address a situation, we should endeavor to harmonize them and give effect, if possible, to all the provisions.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Section 9-515(A) provides that before \"constructing, purchasing, acquiring or leasing\" a facility for customers who are already served by a public utility, the municipality \"shall first purchase and take over the property and plant of the public utility.\" Regardless of how the acquisition is effectuated, \"[t]he fair valuation of the public utility shall be the equivalent of the compensation to be paid for\n   the taking of private property for public use,\" as determined by agreement between the municipality and the public utility, by arbitration, or by a court in the eminent domain context. \u00a7 9-515(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b637 The best explanation of how the Commission's authority relates to the acquisition of private water companies is provided by a 1962 Attorney General opinion, which although not legally binding is illuminating, especially in the absence of directly applicable Arizona case law.

The concept of friendly condemnation encompasses not only situations where the parties agree to the terms of condemnation, which happens frequently, but also the far more troubling situation where the parties agree to invoke eminent domain to divest the Commission of its duty and authority to protect utility consumers' water rights. In the latter situation, the transaction as a whole is\n   <em>\n    entirely\n   </em>\n   voluntary (even if some terms are disputed) yet clothed in the fa\u00e7ade of a government power that otherwise is by its nature coercive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, a friendly condemnation bears the indicia of a voluntary sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b642 In contrast, eminent domain is \"the sovereign right of the state to\n   <em>\n    appropriate\n   </em>\n   private land for the public good, subject to the constitutional limitation that the property owner is justly compensated.\"\n   <em>\n    Calmat of Ariz. v.

The verb \"appropriate\" commonly means \"to take without permission.\"\n   <em>\n    Appropriate\n   </em>\n   , Webster's Third New International Dictionary (3d ed. 2002). If the exercise of the power of eminent domain means to take private property without permission, then a voluntary agreement by the parties to use eminent domain simply cannot be viewed as a true condemnation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b643 A decision by the New Mexico Supreme Court that I, like the majority, deem highly persuasive, appears to be the only decision to expressly contemplate this scenario. In\n   <em>\n    United Water New Mexico, Inc. v. New Mexico Public Utility Commission\n   </em>\n   , the court applied a statute similar to \u00a7 40-285(A), construing the terms \"sell, lease, rent, purchase or acquire\" as \"address[ing]\n   <em>\n    voluntary acts\n   </em>\n   by a public utility.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1566590\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/121/272/\">\n    121 N.M. 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1566590\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/121/272/\">\n    910 P.2d 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 909-10 (1996). The court held that a \"forced condemnation of a utility by a municipality is not a voluntary, affirmative act of that utility,\" and therefore the public utility commission had no authority over it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1566590\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/121/272/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast to the apparent situation here, the utility in that case vigorously contested the condemnation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 911. In fact, the court premised its decision entirely on the involuntary nature of the transaction, and expressly reserved \"the issue of a utility agreeing with a municipality to submit willingly to a condemnation action in lieu of a consensual sale simply to avoid\" commission approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 909 n.4. Like the New Mexico Supreme Court, we should not foreclose a case where the use of eminent domain may constitute a wholly voluntary transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b644 I agree with the majority that if the acquisition here is involuntary, the Commission has no authority to veto the acquisition. But if the public utility and the City agreed to use eminent domain to avoid a contractual liability, the transaction cannot properly be\n   characterized as involuntary. It was, and still is, unclear whether the City intended to condemn Circle City's public utility assets with or without Circle City's agreement. In other words, as far as the Commission knew, what the City and Circle City were really proposing was a voluntary, arms-length transaction to purchase Circle City under the guise of a condemnation. Section 40-285 assigns to the Commission the responsibility and authority to protect consumers' rights where a public utility seeks to voluntarily transfer its assets. The Commission has the power to investigate to meet this responsibility, and its jurisdiction over a public utility is not extinguished until the transfer is complete. Without the power to investigate, there is no way for the Commission to determine whether a transfer is voluntary-and thus subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under \u00a7 40-285-or involuntary, which would take the transfer out of the Commission's jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b645 The upshot of the majority's decision is this: a municipality may evade the Commission's authority to protect consumers' water rights by substituting an entirely consensual contract with an entirely consensual exercise of eminent domain. But \"[l]aw reaches past formalism.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Weisman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480868\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/577/#p595\">\n    505 U.S. 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480868\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/577/#p595\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480868\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/577/#p595\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). The majority errs in holding that an exercise of a municipality's eminent domain power categorically evaporates the Commission's consumer protection authority even if the transaction is voluntary and designed to eliminate valuable water rights. The parties vigorously dispute whether those rights exist, and the record does not yet illuminate whether the transfer of assets here is truly involuntary. That is because the City launched a preemptive strike to foreclose the Commission's inquiry into that very question. The majority vindicates the City's actions by short-circuiting the Commission's jurisdiction over the public utility which otherwise would have continued until the acquisition was consummated. With great respect to my colleagues, I dissent from the majority's decision to prematurely terminate the Commission's inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Although the eminent domain power is broad, it is not boundless, as the majority observes,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 17.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ariz.
