In response to a motion brought by IGES pursuant to rule 54(b) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, the district court entered an order characterizing the previously entered order of dismissal as \"a final order, thus starting [the] time for appeals should there be any, from the date this Order is signed and entered.\" Given the text of the district court's order, and in light of our Supreme Court's recent decisions in\n   <em>\n    First National Bank v.
