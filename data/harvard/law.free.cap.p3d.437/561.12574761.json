Because the sign locations were within 500 feet of an interchange, violating the Utah Outdoor Advertising Act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2072-7-505\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 72-7-505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(c)(i)(A) (LexisNexis Supp. 2017),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   UDOT denied both applications. Evans nevertheless erected the two signs. The district court ordered Evans to remove them, and Evans appealed that decision to this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spanish Fork City v.

We affirmed, holding that both signs were \"illegal and ... subject to removal\" because they were constructed without a permit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Following UDOT's 2008 denial of Evans's applications, UDOT reconfigured Exit 257 as part of its I-15 Core Project. Exit 257 now gives drivers the option of leaving I-15 southbound to connect to either U.S. Highway 6 (US-6) or Spanish Fork Main Street (SR-156). It has three exit lanes: two of those lanes form a bridge to cross over I-15 and connect to US-6 eastbound, and the other lane continues parallel to I-15 until it connects to SR-156.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In 2012, following this reconfiguration, Evans once again applied for two sign permits for essentially the same locations. UDOT denied those applications because it determined that the proposed signs were still within 500 feet of the interchange at Exit 257. Evans challenged this decision in the district court. Affirming UDOT's denial of the applications, the district court determined that the signs violated the Utah Outdoor Advertising Act because the Act's purpose \"is to protect the 500 foot area around an interchange from advertising signs.\" Evans appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Evans's primary contention is that the district court misinterpreted the meaning of an \"intersecting highway\" under the statutory definition of \"pavement widening\" in the Utah Outdoor Advertising Act. \"We review questions of statutory interpretation for correctness, affording no deference to the district court's legal conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Bank of America v.

The Parties' Interpretations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 The Act does not define an \"intersecting highway,\" and the parties offer competing interpretations of this term. UDOT contends that the Bridge is an intersecting highway because Title 72 of the Utah Code (the Transportation Code) defines \"highway\" as \"any public road, street, alley, lane, court, place, viaduct, tunnel, culvert, bridge, or structure laid out or erected for public use,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2072-1-102\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 72-1-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7) (LexisNexis 2009), and the Bridge is \"both a public bridge and a public road that crosses over Interstate 15.\" This interpretation would support the district court's conclusion that, although I-15 and US-6 do not intersect, the interchange does intersect with I-15 \"for the purposes of interpreting the statutes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 In contrast, Evans contends that, because an interchange is defined as an area channeling traffic off and onto \"another federal, state, county, city, or other route,\" the Legislature intended \"intersecting highway\" to mean that \"other route.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2072-1-102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 72-7-502(11) (Supp. 2017).

Because the Bridge is an off-ramp and therefore part of the interchange,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah Admin. Code R933-2-2(2), UDOT contends that an \"intersecting highway\" can include the interchange itself. But such an interpretation would render the entire 2,640-foot limit unnecessary because the interchange would always intersect the interstate highway at the exit. The statute clearly states that the distance is to be measured from the pavement widening to \"the center line of the intersecting highway\n   <em>\n    of the\n   </em>\n   interchange.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2072-7-502\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 72-7-502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (22) (Supp. 2017) (emphasis added). We recognize that the preposition \"of\" is susceptible to varying interpretations,\n   <em>\n    see generally Of\n   </em>\n   , Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1565 (1993), but, to give effect to every word of the statute, the only reasonable interpretation of this statutory provision is that the pavement widening must be within 2,640 feet from the centerline of\n   <em>\n    the highway intersecting the interchange\n   </em>\n   -not components of the interchange intersecting each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 Furthermore, the language of the Act does not support such an expansive interpretation of \"highway\" for this purpose. Section 505 uses the phrase, \"streets, roads, or highways\" several times, demonstrating that \"highway\" is not considered a street or road.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2072-7-505\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 72-7-505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(d) (LexisNexis 2009). Because \"intersecting highway\" does not have the same expansive meaning as \"highway\" in section 102 of the Transportation Code, UDOT's interpretation is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Evans also incorrectly interprets the statute, arguing that by inserting the statutory definitions of \"interchange\" and \"pavement widening\" into the 500-foot prohibition statute, the Legislature clearly intended \"intersecting highway\" to mean \"other route.\" While this view is logical, Evans fails to point to anything in the statute that supports the claim the Legislature intended such a meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II. Definition of \"Intersecting Highway\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Because the Act provides no specialized meaning for \"intersecting highway,\" we turn to the plain and ordinary meaning of these terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because an interchange is not a main-traveled way, and an intersecting highway clearly has a center line under the statute, the interchange is not a \"primary highway.\" For the Act and the Agreement to be in accord, the interchange must be the road that enters directly into or exits directly from \"the main-traveled way of the primary highway,\" or as the Legislature put it: \"the intersecting highway.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b622 Because an \"intersecting highway\" must be a \"primary highway,\" and the Act does not define \"primary highway,\" we look to the Utah-Federal Agreement, and the federal statutes out of which it arises, to ascertain its meaning.

Therefore, an interstate highway is not a primary highway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b625 Rather, to be in harmony with the statutory context of the Act, an \"intersecting highway\" is a primary highway on the federal-aid primary system as of June 1, 1991, or on the NHS. Interpreting this term otherwise would put the Act at odds with legislative intent to adhere to the terms of the Agreement, which states that only streets, roads, and highways that directly intersect the main-traveled way of a primary highway are considered intersecting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2072-7-515\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 72-7-515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (stating that provisions of the Act \"shall be superseded by conflicting provisions of the Utah-Federal Agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b626 Accordingly, we conclude that an \"intersecting highway\" under section 505 of the Act is a primary highway that directly intersects the interchange in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   III. US-6 and SR-156\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b627 Because US-6 is a federal-aid primary highway and SR-156 is part of the NHS system of highways, they are both primary highways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But neither primary highway intersects the interchange within 2,640 feet of the pavement widening at Exit 257.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b628 UDOT calculated the distances to the intersecting highways by measuring from the point of the gore to the intersections of US-6 and SR-156 with I-15. This calculation is incorrect because a pavement widening is measured from the center line of the primary highway intersecting the interchange-not from where the primary highway intersects the interstate. In any event, neither US-6 nor SR-156 intersect the interchange within 2,640 feet of the point of the gore. US-6 begins at the \"Moark Connection Interchange of Route 15 easterly through Spanish Fork Canyon,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2072-4-106\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 72-4-106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (LexisNexis Supp. 2017), which is more than four miles from the interchange at I-15.

Utah Admin. Code R933-2-2(2) (defining acceleration and deceleration lanes as \"speed change lanes created for the purpose of enabling a vehicle to increase or decrease its speed to merge into, or out of, traffic on the main-traveled way\"). Accordingly, the point of the gore occurs where there is no deceleration lane, only an off-ramp, and where there is a deceleration lane, the pavement widening occurs where the intersecting lane ceases to parallel the other lanes of traffic.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2072-7-502\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 72-7-502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (22) (LexisNexis Supp. 2017). In this case, one of the three exit lanes for Exit 257 is clearly an off-ramp, not a deceleration lane, because it immediately diverges from I-15 without allowing a vehicle to \"merge into, or out of, traffic.\" For that reason, Evans is correct that pavement widening occurs at the point of the gore.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    UDOT has repeatedly argued that the 2,640-foot limit is contrary to the Utah-Federal Agreement, and Utah would therefore be in violation of that agreement to allow signs within 500 feet of an interchange.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Young\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8976699\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/110/1118/\">\n     2005 UT App 169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 9 n.4,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8976699\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/110/1118/\">\n     110 P.3d 1118\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Essentially, the 2,640-foot limit hinders UDOT's enforcement of the 500-foot prohibition of signs around an interchange in some circumstances.
