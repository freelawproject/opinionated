Wasatch County sought a stay from the Board, which was denied. Wasatch County then issued the conditional use permit and the power transmission towers were constructed. Wasatch County did not seek a stay from this court, nor did it delay issuance of the permit or otherwise seek to stop the construction. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that this proceeding for judicial review has been rendered moot and, therefore, we dismiss it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Rocky Mountain obtained an easement over property (the Property) owned by Promontory Investments LLC (Promontory). The Property sits in both Summit and Wasatch counties. Prior to the events giving rise to this case, Rocky Mountain's transmission line ran through a portion of the Property located entirely within Summit County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Rocky Mountain supplies power to one of the fastest-growing regions of Utah, of which Summit and Wasatch counties are part. Based on projected growth of the region, Rocky Mountain has undertaken an ongoing project to increase transmission capacity and create alternative transmission pathways (the Project). Part of the Project requires building a sixty-seven-mile transmission line. Only 0.26 miles of the proposed line would sit in Wasatch County, on Promontory's land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The changed location-from the previous transmission line location in Summit County to the new location in Wasatch County-resulted from a request by Promontory after Rocky Mountain approached it about upgrading the current transmission line to a higher capacity one. Promontory asked Rocky Mountain \"to consider alternative siting locations on\" the Property. It is Rocky Mountain's practice to accommodate such a request from landowners, provided the landowner pays the cost of relocation and the new location is acceptable to Rocky Mountain. Accordingly, Rocky Mountain and Promontory considered five alternative locations for the transmission line. Promontory agreed\n   to grant a new easement and pay additional costs associated with constructing the new line in Promontory's preferred location along the south and east perimeters of the Property-including the 0.26 miles of Wasatch County land. The agreement between Promontory and Rocky Mountain included a provision stating that if Rocky Mountain were unable to obtain necessary permits, it could terminate the agreement and leave the transmission line in its then-current location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 In its quest to obtain authorization for the construction of the transmission line segment located in Wasatch County (the Segment), Rocky Mountain was in frequent contact with Wasatch County officials, planning staff, and nearby property owners. Wasatch County consistently expressed concern about the Segment's compliance with existing ordinances aimed at limiting structures that protrude above the visual ridgeline. In its application for a conditional use permit,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rocky Mountain \"included four options for the proposed alignment of the transmission line in Wasatch County.\" The Wasatch County Planning Commission (the Planning Commission) denied the permit, concluding that none of the four options were acceptable, as \"there was no way to mitigate the impacts of [the Segment] on neighboring properties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Rocky Mountain appealed the denial of the permit to the Wasatch County Board of Adjustment (the Board of Adjustment), which agreed with the Planning Commission. The Board of Adjustment concluded that the proposed transmission upgrade violated Wasatch County's ridgeline ordinance and likewise denied the permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Rocky Mountain then appealed to the Board, which determined that the Segment was \"needed to provide safe, reliable, adequate, and efficient service\" to Rocky Mountain customers and ordered Wasatch County to issue the permit within sixty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Wasatch County asked the Board for a stay of its order. After the Board denied the request, Wasatch County issued the conditional use permit to Rocky Mountain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wasatch County then sought judicial review of the Board's order in this court, but did not ask this court for a stay of that order pending the outcome of judicial review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After briefing and oral argument before this court, we issued a decision and the Board filed a petition for rehearing. In the briefing associated with the petition for rehearing, the parties informed this court-for the first time-that while the proceeding for judicial review had been pending, the conditional use permit had been issued, the new transmission lines had been constructed on the Segment, and the lines were now in use. This court then ordered supplemental briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The supplemental briefing makes clear that the remedy Wasatch County seeks is a determination that the conditional use permit be rescinded and that the transmission towers be dismantled and moved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 In our view, Wasatch County's requested remedy is no longer available, and therefore the dispute has been rendered moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I.

App. Dec. 29, 2005), the appellate court was faced with a suit where a neighbor appealed a determination by the board of zoning appeals to issue a zoning permit to a landowner for construction of a new structure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The appellate court affirmed the district court's dismissal because, at the time of appeal, the structure had already been substantially constructed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. The appellate court stated that \"when an appeal involves the construction of a building and the appellant fails to obtain a stay of execution of the [district] court's ruling, and construction commences, the appeal is rendered moot.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 Accordingly, abundant case law supports the proposition that once construction (of, for instance, buildings or power lines) has commenced, an appellant must avail itself of all avenues of preserving the pre-construction status quo or risk the construction rendering the appeal moot. Here, Rocky Mountain sought a conditional use permit so that it could construct the new transmission lines and towers. The Board issued the permit, and Wasatch County did not even seek, much less obtain, a stay from this court. As a result, the construction is complete and the presence of the completed power lines, coupled with Wasatch County's failure to seek a stay, has rendered this proceeding for judicial review moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II. Unavailable Remedy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 We also conclude that under the circumstances of this case, the specific remedy Wasatch County seeks-revocation of the conditional use permit-is simply unavailable. Wasatch County points to its county code, specifically Wasatch County Code 16.23.06(D), and asserts that the conditional use permit that it issued can be revoked and the transmission poles and lines currently supplying power to customers can yet be removed. Wasatch County notes that the Planning Commission can revoke or modify a conditional use permit if it finds that the use permit was obtained by mistake of fact, misrepresentation, or fraud. However, Wasatch County does not point to any facts or allegations demonstrating that the conditional use permit here was obtained by mistake of fact, misrepresentation, or fraud. Accordingly, the county code provision on which Wasatch County relies is inapplicable, and these circumstances bolster our conclusion that this\n   proceeding for judicial review has been rendered moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621 The remedy Wasatch County seeks is no longer available, and, therefore, the proceeding for judicial review is dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    We issued an opinion in this case on January 5, 2018.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wasatch County v.
