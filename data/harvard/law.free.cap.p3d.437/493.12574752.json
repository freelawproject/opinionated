Pyper brought various claims against Defendants Uriah Kennedy and John Reil, who were both present when Pyper signed the documents, alleging that they defrauded him. Pyper also brought a negligence claim against Defendant Meridian Title Company, who acted as the escrow agent for the transaction. The district court granted summary judgment to Meridian and dismissed Pyper's claim against it. After a bench trial on the remaining claims, the district court entered judgment against Kennedy but dismissed Pyper's claims against Reil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Pyper raises two issues on appeal. First, he contends that the district court erred in concluding that he had not proven his claim for civil conspiracy against Reil. Second, he contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Meridian on the ground that Meridian, as the escrow agent, had no duty to stop Pyper from entering the deal even if it knew or suspected fraud was occurring. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 In October 2012, Plaintiff Pyper pledged real property as collateral for a loan to another entity in the amount of $445,401.50. Defendant Kennedy promised Pyper that in exchange for his pledge of collateral, Pyper would be paid $5,000 monthly until the loan was fully repaid to the lender. Kennedy also promised Pyper that he would receive $250,000 after the loan's repayment. The purported purpose of the loan was to fund the acquisition of a company called Seaich Corporation, and Pyper understood that the loan proceeds would be invested in that company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Defendant Reil cosigned the loan as a borrower with Pyper. Reil also believed that he was helping to obtain a loan to fund the acquisition of Seaich. Pyper and Reil never met or communicated before or after meeting on October 19, 2012, to close the loan transaction. Reil's representations to Pyper at the October 19 closing were limited to general assurances that \"[e]verything will be ok\" and that \"[t]his will work out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Defendant Meridian Title Company was the escrow agent for the transaction. A representative of Meridian was present at the October 19 closing, along with Pyper, Kennedy, and Reil. At the closing, Pyper executed a note in the amount of $445,401.50 and a trust deed conveying his property securing the note. Following the lender's instructions, Meridian wired $400,000 to the specified account. The recipient of the funds was an unrelated company called Agro Chem Tech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The principal amount of the loan was never repaid and Pyper received no repayment bonus. Similarly, Pyper never received the promised monthly payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Pyper filed a lawsuit arising out of the failed transaction, contending that he was the victim of breach of contract, undue influence, civil conspiracy, and securities fraud by Kennedy and Reil. He also brought a negligence\n   action against Meridian. Pyper did not challenge the loan itself but rather alleged that the funds were invested inappropriately in another company, and that Kennedy and Reil promised to repay him for the loan. He also alleged that Meridian acted negligently in closing the loan transaction and disbursing the funds to another company when, based on what Pyper alleges the Meridian representative observed, Meridian should have recognized that a fraud was occurring. As a basis for his claim against Meridian, Pyper asserted that Meridian owed him two specific duties: (1) the duty \"to safeguard and preserve the loan proceeds and assure that those funds were transferred according to a lawful contract and for a lawful purpose,\" and (2) the duty \"to protect [Pyper] from entering into a verbal agreement for the delivery of the loan proceeds to a third party\" when it \"knew or should have known\" that Pyper \"was the victim of fraud or undue influence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Meridian moved for summary judgment, arguing that it did not owe Pyper a duty to protect him from fraud. Meridian contended that the duty it owed to Pyper as the escrow agent was limited to following the escrow instructions, which it did. And it urged the court to reject the suggestion in\n   <em>\n    Schoepe v. Zions First National Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7392211\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/750/1084/\">\n    750 F.Supp. 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Utah 1990), that an escrow agent owes the \"additional duty\" of informing a principal to a transaction that he \"was being defrauded by his partners.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 In his opposition to summary judgment, Pyper argued that the standards developed by the title insurance industry established the duty of care Meridian owed him, and that the parties' experts (as well as the court in\n   <em>\n    Schoepe\n   </em>\n   ) accurately described the scope of the duty, which included a duty \"to disclose fraud that the escrow agent should have detected during the course of the transaction.\" Pyper then asserted that Meridian \"breached the duty of care that it owed\" to him and that the various facts related to the closing established that a \"reasonable escrow agent\" would have concluded that Pyper \"did not understand the transaction and that a fraudulent activity was occurring.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 After hearing arguments, the district court granted Meridian's motion. It accepted Pyper's argument that, as part of the escrow agent's fiduciary role, the agent had a duty to disclose facts \"that would reasonably indicate a fraud was occurring.\" Nevertheless, the court observed that \"recognizing a duty to disclose facts indicating fraud does not equate to a duty to halt a transaction where fraud is known or suspected,\" and it determined that, by arguing breach based solely on Meridian's knowledge of facts suggesting fraud and Pyper's general lack of understanding, Pyper sought to impose on an escrow agent a duty beyond disclosure-specifically, a duty \"to interpose its informed judgment for a principal's, or to perform the principal's due diligence.\" The court rejected the existence of such a duty, concluding that an escrow agent \"is not required to prevent a suspicious transaction when the principal is equally aware of all the facts,\" or to \"exercise independent judgment and decline to follow [closing and disbursement] instructions\" that are signed by the principal. The court concluded that Meridian had \"no duty to police how Pyper spent the loan funds\" and that Pyper could not \"hold Meridian liable for following his instructions.\" Accordingly, the court concluded that Pyper's negligence claim against Meridian failed as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Pyper's remaining claims were eventually tried to the bench. Kennedy was not present at trial and no one appeared on his behalf. Following the trial, the court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law. Among other things, the court found that Kennedy, in some capacity, promised Pyper the repayment of the loan principal to the lender, along with additional monthly payments to Pyper of $5,000 until repayment, and $250,000 to Pyper out of profits following repayment. The court further found that Reil \"believed that he was helping to obtain loans in order to fund the acquisition of Seaich\"; that \"[t]here are no facts establishing a conspiracy or any actionable conspiracy\"; and that Pyper \"has not proven by clear and convincing evidence that John Reil was part of a conspiracy as alleged. There is not sufficient evidence of an unlawful purpose or any agreement on such purpose by John Reil.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Based on those and other findings, the court concluded that Pyper \"ha[d] not proven any claim for conspiracy against John Reil.\" The court further found that Pyper had not proven any other of his claims and dismissed them with prejudice. Additionally, the court entered judgment against Kennedy. Pyper appeals, challenging the district court's decisions with regard to Meridian and Reil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 Pyper contends that the district court erred in concluding that he had failed to prove his conspiracy claim against Reil. Because Pyper does not challenge the court's findings of fact but instead contends only that the court failed to analyze the facts under the proper legal standard, we review the district court's ultimate conclusion for correctness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Purkey v.

Pyper's Conspiracy Claim Against Reil\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 Pyper contends that the district court erred in concluding that he had not proven his claim against Reil for civil conspiracy. In particular, Pyper attacks the district court's conclusion that \"Reil's actions in furtherance of the [pertinent] transaction ... did not amount to a conspiracy between Reil and Kennedy on the basis that Reil's actions with respect to ... Pyper did not involve an independent fraudulent misrepresentation of fact by Reil to Pyper that would be actionable under ... the federal securities laws.\" We conclude that Pyper has not shown error in the district court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 The tort of civil conspiracy requires proof of five elements by clear and convincing evidence: \"(1) a combination of two or more persons, (2) an object to be accomplished, (3) a meeting of the minds on the object or course of action, (4) one or more unlawful, overt acts, and (5) damages as a proximate result thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Pohl, Inc. of Am. v.

App. 1987) (recognizing a defendant's potential liability for civil conspiracy based not on the defendant's own actions but on the actions of a co-conspirator).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Pyper contends that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard to reach its conclusion that Pyper had failed to prove his claim against Reil for civil conspiracy. Specifically, Pyper argues that the district court erroneously assumed that for Reil to be liable for conspiracy, \"he himself must personally have engaged in a tortious act against [Pyper],\" and that on that basis the district court rejected Pyper's conspiracy claim. We reject Pyper's arguments for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 First, we disagree with the underlying premise that the district court misunderstood the law. Pyper claims that the district court \"asserted that if John Reil did not himself make a fraudulent statement to [Pyper] then John Reil would not be liable with respect to the conspiracy.\" We see no record support for this claim. During the bench trial, the court inquired about Pyper's assertions that Reil made false statements to Pyper, but the court never expressed the view that Pyper's conspiracy claim failed if he could not demonstrate that Reil personally made fraudulent statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, in its written order, the court did not conclude that Pyper's claim failed solely on the ground that Reil himself did not make a fraudulent misrepresentation to Pyper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 Second, even if the district court had erroneously believed that a conspiracy could not be proven absent an unlawful act by Reil, Pyper has not challenged the court's separate determination that the conspiracy claim failed because there was no meeting of the minds on an unlawful purpose. As noted above, to succeed on a claim for conspiracy, a plaintiff must prove the existence of all five elements of the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b616. Pyper's challenge focuses on only one of those elements, namely, the unlawful, overt act. Because Pyper has not demonstrated any error in the district court's determination that he failed to prove another element-a meeting of the minds on the unlawful purpose-his challenge necessarily fails.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Federated Capital Corp. v.

Meridian's Duty of Care\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 Pyper argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Meridian on his negligence claim. In particular, he faults the court for failing to recognize a duty, based on title insurance industry standards, for Meridian to \"stop\" the apparently fraudulent transaction occurring in its presence-even apparently in contravention to closing and disbursement instructions provided and signed by the parties to the transaction. As explained below, Pyper's contention asks us to extend the law regarding an escrow agent's fiduciary duty. We conclude that Pyper has not provided sufficient argument to persuade us that it is appropriate to expand the scope of an escrow agent's well-settled fiduciary duty, and we therefore affirm the district court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621 \"The threshold question in a negligence claim is whether the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Mower v.

Thus, the question was not directed toward the conspiracy claim. Second, the court asked counsel to \"[p]oint [it] to an unlawful act that Mr. Reil committed.\" While the question related to the conspiracy claim, it does not, standing alone, suggest that the court was mistaken about the law. Pyper argued that Reil had committed unlawful acts (i.e., securities fraud) in furtherance of the conspiracy, and thus it is unsurprising that the court inquired on this point. Further, in explaining its reasons for rejecting the conspiracy claim, the district court made no mention of the absence of an unlawful act by Reil and instead referred to the lack of agreement on Reil's part of an unlawful objective.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    We recognize that, in rendering its decision, the district court adopted the escrow agent's duty as described in\n    <em>\n     Schoepe v.
