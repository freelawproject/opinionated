GALLEGOS, Appellant.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  No. 20150688-CA\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Court of Appeals of Utah.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  Filed October 4, 2018\n </decisiondate>\n <p id=\"p-5\">\n  Opinion\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-6\">\n   MORTENSEN, Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   \u00b61 A group was busy spray-painting a wall when Victim interrupted their evening activity. Upset by the intrusion, one of the group members stabbed Victim twice in the chest and once in the back, while others threw rocks and beer cans and unleashed two dogs to attack Victim. Police, with the help of Witness, later identified defendant John E. Gallegos as the one who stabbed Victim and arrested him that night. Upon arresting Gallegos, police found blood on Gallegos's shirt, pants, and ear, as well as on a folding knife in his pocket. Victim survived the attack and, after viewing a photo lineup at the hospital, identified Gallegos as the person who stabbed him. While in custody at the police station, Gallegos kicked and spit at a police officer and also used a chair to smash a hole in a wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b62 For his involvement in the stabbing, Gallegos was convicted of attempted murder, possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person, using a dangerous weapon in a fight, graffiti, and consumption of alcohol by a minor (the Stabbing Charges). For his actions at the police station after his arrest, Gallegos was also convicted of assault by a prisoner, propelling a substance or object at a peace officer, and damaging a jail (the Police Station Charges). He appeals, arguing that (1) trial counsel was ineffective for not moving to sever the Stabbing Charges and Police Station Charges and (2) police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him the night he was arrested. Gallegos also seeks remand pursuant to rule 23B of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure. We deny the rule 23B motion and otherwise affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 Victim's RV, in which he was staying, had broken down. With the permission of a library security officer, Victim parked the RV at the library lot for the night. Later that evening, Victim heard someone using a spray can outside. Intending to pay the vandals twenty dollars to leave his RV alone, Victim left his RV and approached the bathroom of a nearby park, where he saw someone spray painting the wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 As Victim approached, a group of men emerged from behind the bathroom and surrounded him. Gallegos began yelling at Victim and threw what Victim thought were punches at his chest. But when Victim suddenly began struggling to breathe, he realized he had been stabbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 The other men joined in the attack, throwing rocks, cans, and other debris. As Victim tried to escape, a large rock hit him on the head. Someone in the group yelled \"Attack,\" and two dogs lunged at Victim, biting his leg. Victim continued to retreat, dragging along the dog that had clamped\n   down on his leg. Gallegos again stabbed Victim, this time in the back. Just before losing consciousness, Victim crawled to a nearby truck and asked for help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 Witness, who was one of the truck's occupants, testified that he saw a group of men and dogs chasing Victim. Witness saw Gallegos standing roughly ten feet in front of the group and swinging something at Victim. The rest of the group stood back and threw cans at Victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Witness exited the truck and confronted Gallegos. Witness further testified that Gallegos approached Witness with something shiny in his hand. Gallegos came within ten feet of Witness and yelled, \"You want some too homey? Get the fuck back in the truck.\" The attackers fled when they realized one of the truck's passengers had called the police. Witness tended to Victim until the police arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b67 The police first interviewed another witness (Bystander) who had been at the park. Bystander reported seeing several Hispanic men wearing white jerseys with dark numbers run toward a nearby dead-end street, where a Toyota Camry shortly emerged and headed away from the scene. After reporting this information to the police, Bystander saw the Camry return to the same street. Nearby officers were alerted to look for Hispanic men, wearing white jerseys or shirts, in a Camry on a dead-end street. Only later did the police receive a more detailed description from Witness-who had stood ten feet away from and was threatened by Gallegos-that Gallegos was actually wearing dark clothes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b68 An officer arrived at the dead-end street and saw a parked Camry with a man, Gallegos, wearing dark-colored clothes, standing nearby with two women. Without activating the patrol car's overhead lights, the officer parked and got out. The three people near the Camry began walking away and were about to go behind a house. The officer, with his flashlight on, yelled, \"Hey, come back and talk to me.\" The officer testified that he yelled so Gallegos could hear him but did not command Gallegos to comply. Gallegos returned to speak with the officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b69 Not realizing that Gallegos was, in fact, the suspect in the stabbing, the officer asked Gallegos what he was doing in the area. Gallegos responded that he was on his way to a friend's house. The officer noticed tattoos on Gallegos's hands and asked if he was in a gang. Gallegos told the officer that he used to be a member of the South Side Colonia\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chiques. When another officer arrived, the first officer ran a warrants check on Gallegos. The warrants check confirmed Gallegos's membership in the South Side Colonia Chiques. The officer asked Gallegos if he was carrying any weapons, and Gallegos answered that he was not. Responding to a request from the officer, Gallegos agreed to be searched. The officer found a five-inch folding knife in Gallegos's back pocket. At the time, the officer did not notice any blood on the knife, which was folded closed. Having determined during their discussion that Gallegos was intoxicated, the officer said, \"Being in your state right now, being a gang member, you probably shouldn't be carrying a knife.\" Gallegos responded, \"Well, you can keep it.\" The officer offered to hold the knife at the police station until Gallegos was sober, whereupon Gallegos could pick it up. Gallegos agreed and left in the direction he had been walking earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b610 Having concluded his encounter with Gallegos, the officer drove to the park where the stabbing occurred. There, the officer learned from other officers that the attacker was, in fact, a member of the South Side Colonia Chiques gang and wore dark clothing instead of white. Realizing that Gallegos matched the updated description, the officer inspected Gallegos's knife more closely, unfolding it and finding blood on the blade. The\n   officer reported his encounter, and Gallegos was apprehended shortly thereafter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b611 Upon arresting Gallegos, the officers found drops of blood by Gallegos's ear and on his hands, along with blood stains on his shirt and pants. He also had blue residue on his hands. Gallegos explained that he had been boxing that day and had also fallen while running away from police earlier that night. While all of the blood samples were not tested, lab results showed that the blood on Gallegos's knife, shirt, pants, and ear matched Victim's DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b612 While in custody at the police station, Gallegos noticed photographs of fellow gang members on the wall. Gallegos became angry and, while in handcuffs, started to walk away from officers. An officer caught him at the door, and Gallegos kicked the officer in the leg before being subdued. Officers led Gallegos to an interview room where he spit in an officer's face. Alone in the room, Gallegos began yelling and banging on the walls. Officers returned to the room to find chairs overturned and a fresh hole in the wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b613 The next day, officers went to the hospital to interview Victim about the stabbing and to show him a photo lineup. Victim had not taken medication for five hours and confirmed to the officers that he was thinking clearly during the interview. Based on the photo lineup, Victim identified Gallegos as the man who stabbed him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b614 The State charged Gallegos for his involvement in the stabbing and for his violent behavior at the police station. The case proceeded to trial, and Gallegos moved to suppress evidence stemming from the encounter Gallegos had with the officer on the dead-end street, arguing that the officer lacked reasonable suspicion to stop Gallegos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b615 The trial court ruled that Gallegos's conversation with the officer was a consensual encounter and thus did not require the officer to have reasonable suspicion. In doing so, the court acknowledged that \"under certain circumstances an officer yelling at someone to stop ... immediately conveys a sort of Level 2 ... scenario,\" but that an encounter with police is \"entirely fact intensive and [yelling] hey come back and talk to me isn't necessarily stop, police.\" Rather, it \"actually invites a voluntar[y] return.\" The court concluded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [W]hen you look at the entire circumstances in addition to [the police officer's statement to Gallegos], that he was talked to, he wasn't placed in custody, there weren't lights going on, there weren't sirens, he didn't have his gun drawn, there weren't other officers around, [and] his ingress and egress wasn't blocked by a show of force ... this was a consensual encounter ... even to the point where [Gallegos] allows the officer to search him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court further reasoned that it was \"consensual to the point where the officer established enough of a rapport with [Gallegos] to say you shouldn't be carrying this knife in your condition and ... instead of arresting him for possession of a weapon while intoxicated or something like that he gave him the option of just coming down to the police station the next day and picking it up.\" And the fact that Gallegos told the officer to just keep the knife, in the view of the court, \"convey[ed] nothing more than a consensual conversation between the two individuals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b616 Prior to trial, Gallegos personally addressed the court regarding issues he was having with his trial counsel and his desire to sever the charges against him. Because all of the charges stemmed from \"one joint act,\" Gallegos's trial counsel believed the charges could not be severed. The trial court agreed to hear Gallegos but explained to him that it \"usually will not consider severing charges unless grounds can be stated for severance.\" Gallegos explained his frustration with counsel, but his counsel argued that Gallegos wanted the charges severed because there was little evidence on some of the charges, such as his graffiti charge. The court denied the motion to sever and explained, \"It may actually even be that prior to submission to the jury, the Court may determine that there [is] a reasonable doubt on the graffiti charge and it may not send that to the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b617 After the court denied the motion to suppress and the motion to sever, the case went to trial, and Gallegos was convicted on all charges. Gallegos appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618 Gallegos raises three issues for our review. First, Gallegos filed a motion for remand under rule 23B of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure. \"A remand under rule 23B is available only upon a nonspeculative allegation of facts, not fully appearing in the record on appeal, which, if true, could support a determination that counsel was ineffective.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Rule 23B Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 Gallegos has filed a motion for remand under rule 23B of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure, seeking remand for five issues: (1) failure to call an eyewitness expert who had been retained and who had submitted a report; (2) failure to call a forensics expert; (3) failure to move to sever the Stabbing Charges from the Police Station Charges; (4) failure to move to \"sever\" evidence of gang association; and (5) an opportunity to \"explore\" a variety of other complaints contained in an affidavit of Gallegos (including claims of excessive force, lost blood evidence, failure to provide unspecified documents, improper closing arguments by the prosecutor, and arguing that the prosecutor \"visibly, but not audibly\" coached witnesses).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b622 We have reviewed Gallegos's motion, the associated affidavits, and the State's response.

Because there is strong evidence against the charged conduct, our confidence in the outcome of the trial is not undermined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b646 First, the evidence against Gallegos in relation to the Stabbing Charges was overwhelming. On the night of the stabbing, Gallegos was arrested with Victim's blood on his clothes and behind his ear. An officer found a knife covered in Victim's blood in Gallegos's pocket. Victim identified Gallegos as the person who stabbed him based on a photo lineup. We admit that evidence of\n   Gallegos spitting at an officer, kicking an officer, and putting a hole in a wall at the police station would certainly not endear Gallegos to a jury. But evidence of Gallegos's violent behavior at the police station could not reasonably have impacted Gallegos's conviction on the Stabbing Charges in the sense that it made the difference in the jury's decision to convict; the evidence against him was simply too great. And Gallegos offers no persuasive explanation of how severing his charges would have produced a different outcome at trial, further supporting our conclusion that severing the charges would not have made a difference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hallett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10384097\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/796/701/#p706\">\n    796 P.2d at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b647 Second, we similarly conclude that evidence of the Stabbing Charges did not prejudice Gallegos in his convictions stemming from the Police Station Charges. Even though the Stabbing Charges are more gruesome and serious, the evidence supporting convictions for the Police Station Charges was overwhelming. Multiple officers witnessed Gallegos's violent behavior at the police station, and Gallegos points to no meaningful dispute of that evidence. Thus, even though those charges were tried in conjunction with another potentially inflammatory set of charges, the amount of evidence against him, coupled with the apparent lack of any meaningful disagreement concerning that evidence, sustains our confidence in the ultimate outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b648 Because Gallegos has not shown that a more favorable outcome at trial was likely had the charges been severed, we reject his ineffective assistance of counsel argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   III. Reasonable Suspicion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b649 Gallegos argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because it \"base[d] its finding on whether [Gallegos] was arrested, where the critical inquiry was whether the officer had reasonable suspicion to make the stop.\" We disagree.

Nevertheless, he was (1) standing next to a Toyota Camry, (2) on the dead-end street where the attackers had fled and where the Camry returned, and (3) engaged with the officer within minutes of the officer receiving an instruction from dispatch to investigate the area.

Here, the officer knew, based on eyewitness reports, that (1) he was looking for Hispanic males who had recently fled down the dead-end street, (2) a Camry had picked up the suspects, and (3) the Camry had just returned to the dead-end street. These are articulable facts giving rise to reasonable suspicion that Gallegos-who is Hispanic and was right next to the Camry, on the dead-end street, minutes after the officer had received the report-was involved with the fleeing suspects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because Gallegos identifies no specific evidence and offers no explanation as to how the evidence would inform the issue of ineffective assistance, the only purpose of remand on this issue would be to establish that his attorney had not met with him-a fact that the dissent ably points out is already in the record,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b661, and therefore is not a proper basis for remand,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Griffin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20UT%2018\">\n     2015 UT 18\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 18, --- P.3d ----.

In other words, in order to win reversal, Gallegos does not have to convince us that there is a greater than 50% chance that the outcome of his trial would have been different. Instead, he must simply raise issues that undermine our confidence in the outcome of Gallegos's trial, and persuade us that there is a \"significant possibility\" of a different result. At this point in the proceedings, before a court adjudicates the issues Gallegos has raised in his rule 23B motion, my confidence in the outcome of Gallegos's trial is not solid enough to warrant affirmance under this standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b660 Aside from the one irregularity that the majority and I agree upon-counsel's failure to seek severance-I am also concerned with two of the issues\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gallegos raises in his rule 23B motion, and I would accordingly grant that motion and remand for resolution of those two issues. First, I am concerned that counsel did not pay enough attention to this case. Second, I am concerned with counsel's failure to introduce expert testimony regarding the infirmities inherent in eyewitness identification testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b661 With regard to the first issue, Gallegos avers in his rule 23B affidavit that his trial counsel was appointed to represent him in August 2014, but that counsel did not meet with him (outside of a handful of brief discussions in the courthouse holding cell) until May 18, 2015, less than three weeks before trial. In this case, it is impossible to dismiss these averments as the self-serving statements of an imprisoned defendant, because\n   trial counsel himself admitted to these facts on the record at a pretrial hearing just a few weeks prior to trial. After Gallegos complained to the court that he had only spent a grand total of \"five[ ] [or] six minutes in ten months\" with his counsel, despite having \"tried sending him letters\" and \"calling him,\" trial counsel did not dispute Gallegos's account, stating on the record that he had been busy with a capital murder case and that \"[j]ust because I haven't met with him doesn't mean I'm not prepared for trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court then ordered counsel to meet with Gallegos, astutely noting that \"sometimes defendants have a keener apprehension of the facts than anyone else because they were present or at least allegedly present when the matter occurred,\" and that failing to give the defendant the opportunity to \"go over all the discovery\" and otherwise participate in the preparation of the case \"can disable the defense.\" On May 18, 2015, a few days after the court ordered him to meet with his client, trial counsel held his first substantive meeting with Gallegos. This was less than three weeks prior to trial. It should go without saying that failure to hold even one substantive meeting with one's client for nine months following retention, and postponing any such meeting until less than three weeks prior to trial-and only after it was ordered by the court- is substandard attorney conduct in a case as serious as this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b662 With regard to the second issue, some of the most powerful evidence at the State's disposal was the eyewitness accounts of both Victim and Witness, who both (in varying ways) identified Gallegos as the stabber. Witness did so at a police \"showup\" that took place on the night in question, in which Gallegos was the only potential suspect for Witness to choose from. Victim did so the next day, by way of a photo lineup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b663 Our supreme court has acknowledged that eyewitness identification evidence can be problematic, because jurors tend to overvalue it while overlooking its inherent flaws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ramirez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049871\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/817/774/#p784\">\n    817 P.2d 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 784 (Utah 1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b668 One of Gallegos's previous attorneys had identified and retained an expert who could testify at trial and explain to the jury the limitations of eyewitness identification testimony. Trial counsel, however, elected not to call that (or any other) expert regarding eyewitness identification testimony, apparently because trial counsel determined that the expert would not be helpful. In its opinion, the majority speculates about some of the reasons why counsel might have reached this conclusion but, at least at this point, I find those potential reasons unconvincing. We simply do not know, on this record, why trial counsel elected not to call the expert, and in a case like this one where both (a) eyewitness identification testimony was so important and (b) there are legitimate questions about trial counsel's level of preparedness, I would grant the rule 23B motion so that more information can be gained about trial counsel's reason for making what might seem to be a questionable decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341161\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/997/\">\n    2017 UT App 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 16-24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341161\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/997/\">\n    392 P.3d 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting a rule 23B motion, but eventually determining-after a remand in which the trial court had made a factual finding that counsel had \"made an informed, reasonable strategic decision\" based on many factors \"that an eyewitness identification expert would not be helpful to the defense but would instead likely end up hurting it\"-that counsel had not acted ineffectively (cleaned up) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b669 Finally, I am persuaded that the jury, in determining Gallegos's guilt on the Stabbing Charges, was-at least to some degree-affected by hearing the evidence of the Police Station Charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gallegos's primary defense to the Stabbing Charges was that he was present at the scene of the stabbing, but that he was not the stabber. The jury heard testimony from several police officers that, after he was apprehended, he kicked a police officer, tried to run away from a police officer, yelled and screamed at police officers, spit on police officers, and gouged a large hole in the wall of one of the rooms at the\n   police station by throwing or kicking a chair into the wall. This evidence-which the trial court should have severed and kept from the jury deciding Gallegos's guilt on the Stabbing Charges-no doubt made it easier for the jury to believe that Gallegos was a person inclined to violence, and no doubt had some effect on the jury's decision to convict Gallegos on the Stabbing Charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b670 I am not necessarily persuaded that the prejudicial effect of the failure to sever, standing alone, would have raised a \"significant possibility\" of a different outcome, given the relative strength of the State's evidence. But I am not comfortable definitively answering the \"prejudice\" question in this case until after the rule 23B motion is resolved. Even the majority acknowledges that Witness's identification of Gallegos at the police showup \"is problematic.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b610 n.3. It is possible that Gallegos might be able to demonstrate a \"significant possibility\" of a different result, depending upon the outcome of his rule 23B motion. If Gallegos is eventually able to demonstrate that his attorney was unprepared, or that his attorney acted ineffectively by failing to call an eyewitness identification expert, the contours of the \"prejudice\" inquiry may look a lot different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b671 Accordingly, I cannot join in the result that the majority reaches here. I would grant the rule 23B motion and, after reviewing the outcome of the proceedings on remand, at that point revisit the question of prejudice-that is, whether there is a \"significant possibility\" of a different outcome, and whether my confidence in the outcome of the trial is undermined.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    I agree with the majority's analysis with regard to the other three issues raised in the rule 23B motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Gallegos has also produced an affidavit from another attorney who worked with trial counsel on the same capital murder case by which counsel was supposedly distracted, and this other attorney avers that trial counsel failed to do the work assigned to him on that capital murder case and that as a result \"his contract ... to provide indigent defense services has been terminated.\" The majority downplays this affidavit, on the ground that \"[e]vidence of substandard performance by Gallegos's counsel in another case\" sheds no light on his performance in this case, and because ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be established by evidence of an attorney's poor general reputation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b626 n.8. But this was not merely a reputational issue; indeed, according to trial counsel's own statement to the court, counsel's performance in the two cases are directly connected, because counsel's explanation for not meeting with Gallegos in this case was that he was ostensibly too busy with the other one.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    I agree with the majority's analysis,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b647, that there is not a reasonable probability that the outcome of a severed trial on the Police Station Charges would have been different, because the evidence of Gallegos's guilt on the Police Station Charges was overwhelming.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
