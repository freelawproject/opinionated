We affirm and restate the issue on appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Did the District Court err by granting a preliminary injunction without a finding of \"great or irreparable injury?\"\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The facts herein are taken from the record as developed only for purposes of the District Court's consideration of a preliminary injunction. The dispute concerns access to one of two pieces of adjacent property located in Wise River, Montana, owned respectively by BAM and the Schiffermans. In 2003, before improvements were made to the properties, Schiffermans purchased their lot, which then lacked physical access. In 2004, in an apparently fortuitous development, the Montana Department of Transportation completed an improvement project for Montana Highway 43, which ran along the southern border of the properties, and, during the project, added a paved apron extending from the highway toward the border of the properties\n   and installed a \"green gate\" nearby. Since 2004, Schiffermans have used these improvements to access their lot, and further improved the\n   access by installing an elevated driveway with culverts. In 2005, Schiffermans built a 1200 square foot garage on their lot, and constructed a house there in 2016. They also had a cattle guard installed near the gate. Construction contractors and suppliers used the apron and driveway to access the property. During these years, Schiffermans believed the access was on their lot, and received no objections about its use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In 2017, BAM purchased the lot adjacent to the Schiffermans' lot, and uses its property to host disabled veterans for recreational activities. BAM's principal, Noah McMahon, believed Schiffermans' driveway ran across the corner of BAM's property, so he fenced off the driveway with temporary fencing and removed Schiffermans' cattle guard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Schiffermans removed part of BAM's fencing and began driving across an unimproved grass and dirt area to access their driveway. As of the preliminary injunction hearing, Schiffermans had attempted to improve this altered route but found it did not provide comparable access. An expert testified it would take approximately two days and $ 7,000 to build a comparable access across the new route to the existing driveway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 BAM initiated this action in quiet title to resolve the question of property ownership of the disputed area. The Schiffermans disputed the boundaries allegations in their answer, and counterclaimed for a prescriptively acquired easement over the access route. Schiffermans have acknowledged that \"at least a portion\" of their property's access is located on BAM's property and, pertinent here, sought injunctive relief under \u00a7 27-19-201(1) - (3), MCA, based on their claim of a prescriptive easement, to bar BAM from restricting access to their lot across the original route pending outcome of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 After the hearing, the District Court determined Schiffermans had made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing of their claim for prescriptive easement, and granted them a preliminary injunction pursuant to \u00a7 27-19-201(1), MCA. Although the District Court agreed with BAM's argument that Schiffermans had not established irreparable harm, and that money damages could not be considered irreparable harm, because \"money damages may be recovered in an action at law without resort to equity,\" citing\n   <em>\n    Caldwell v.

The provision was originally enacted as Section 112 of the old Civil Practice Act by the Montana Territorial Legislature, sitting in Virginia City, on December 23, 1867. For historical context, Montana's adoption of the Civil Practice Act\n   occurred contemporaneously with the ongoing impeachment controversy of President Andrew Johnson, about two years after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Remarkably, the entire substantive text of Section 112 remains to this day within \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, constituting the first three subsections of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1867 Mont. Laws \u00a7 112, at 154. It has been a challenge for courts to interpret and apply the dated language of these provisions consistently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b614 However, as we have often recognized, the subsections of \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, are written disjunctively. Demonstration of\n   one, and not all, of the subsections suffices to authorize a court to grant equitable, preliminary injunctive relief, when its discretion is so moved.

Specifically, subsection (2) authorizes relief when it appears that commission or continuation of an act during the litigation would produce \"a great or irreparable injury\"-that is, an injury so significant it could not later be repaired even by means of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b616 However, while only mentioned explicitly by subsection (2) in terms of a great or irreparable injury, the prevention of some degree of harm or injury is an overlapping concept that is implied within all of the subsections of the statute. Under subsection (1), when it appears an applicant has established entitlement to relief under a legal claim that consists of \"restraining the commission or continuance of [an] act,\" injunctive relief is authorized to stop the continuing illegal act, as well as the harm that is implicitly being done thereby. Under subsection (3), when a continuing or threatened act would violate \"the applicant's rights\" and tend to render \"the judgment ineffectual,\" injunctive relief is authorized to prevent the act and the implied harm that would result from such circumstances. Subsection (4) authorizes relief to\n   prevent the threatened removal or disposal of \"the adverse party's property with intent to defraud\" and the obvious harm such actions would cause. Likewise, without mentioning \"harm\" or \"injury,\" subsection (5) nonetheless protects against threatened harm by authorizing relief to protect applicants from economic loss and from physical abuse or intimidation in domestic and order of protection proceedings. While our cases have not always used precise language, collectively they correctly stand for the principle that all requests for preliminary injunctive relief require some demonstration of threatened harm or injury, whether under the \"great or irreparable injury\" standard of subsection (2), or the lesser degree of harm implied within the other subsections of \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA.

Under subsection (1), the applicants could not establish that the relief they sought consisted of \"restraining the commission or continuance of an act\" where they had contracted for that very act-scoria mining-to be performed on their property, the status quo was that the other party was engaged in the contracted-for mining activity, and the dispute was over contract compensation.\n   <em>\n    Caldwell\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 25-27 (\"That the Caldwells have requested injunctive relief to prevent terms of the contract from being enforced, does not transform this action into one of equity.\"). Under subsection (3), the applicants could not establish any of their contractual rights were being violated because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"the record is devoid of any facts which would support a conclusion that the Sabos are threatening to not pay for the scoria sold.\"\n   <em>\n    Caldwell\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b618 In the case at bar, the District Court concluded the Schiffermans did not establish, under subsection (2), that they would\n   apparently suffer an injury so great or irreparable it could not be addressed and compensated within the litigation. Nonetheless, upon making a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing of prescriptive easement, which is not contested on appeal, Schiffermans established they would suffer continuing harm by not being able to access their property, while the litigation was pending, by way of the access route they had used for many years, and thus satisfied subsection (1). Consequently, the purpose of equitable injunctive relief was here fulfilled, that is, to \"preserve the status quo and minimize the harm to all parties pending final resolution on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24 (emphasis omitted). The \"status quo\" is \"the last actual, peaceable, noncontested condition which preceded the pending controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Benefis\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. The noncontested condition preceding the current controversy was the Schiffermans' use of the access created by the Department of Transportation and improved by them. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion by entering the preliminary injunction permitting Schiffermans to continue to use the access pending the outcome of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b619 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   INGRID GUSTAFSON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Apparently, prior attempts between the parties to informally resolve the access issue were unsuccessful.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
