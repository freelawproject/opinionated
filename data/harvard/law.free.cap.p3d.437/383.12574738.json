The district court reduced Casper's sentence to ten years to life, noting that his mental-health status warranted a reduction, but that the aggravating circumstances precluded the court from reducing it further. The court also ordered both sentences to be served consecutively. Casper appeals his sentences, contending his defense counsel was ineffective in failing to argue that the court should have considered the proportionality requirement articulated by our supreme court in\n   <em>\n    LeBeau v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904141\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/254/\">\n    2014 UT 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904141\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/254/\">\n    337 P.3d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because we conclude there was a reasonable tactical basis for counsel not to direct the court to consider\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   's proportionality requirement, counsel did not perform deficiently. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Casper was charged with three counts of first-degree aggravated sexual abuse of a child for acts he perpetrated against a seven-year-old victim (First Victim). When the police interviewed him, Casper admitted that he had sexually abused First Victim. The State later charged Casper with another count of first-degree aggravated sexual abuse of a child for acts perpetrated against an eight-year-old victim (Second Victim). The victims each reported that Casper threatened to hurt them if they told anyone what he had done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 While the cases were being investigated, Casper threatened to kill anyone who tried to help the victims' families with the case. He said he would \"put their heads down on a table[ ] and snap their heads off.\" After Casper underwent a competency evaluation, the evaluators determined that he was competent to stand trial despite exhibiting the following conditions: mild autism or Asperger's syndrome, anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and impulse control disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Casper agreed to plead guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, one for each victim. In exchange, the State agreed to dismiss the two remaining charges and recommend a sentence of two consecutive terms of six years to life in prison, rather than the presumptive fifteen years to life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-404.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (LexisNexis 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Adult Probation and Parole prepared a presentence investigation report (the PSI Report). The PSI Report contained a statement from Casper that \"explained his version of what happened.\" He said that First Victim attempted to seduce him and that he \"lost [his] ability to gain control of [the] situation,\" while at the same time expressing remorse for First Victim. Casper did not express any remorse for the acts he perpetrated against Second Victim. Casper also acknowledged that he was aware of \"the cyclical patterns of this crime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 In other reports filed with the court, Casper admitted that he had previously put his hand down a female neighbor's pants and touched her \"private parts.\" He also acknowledged that he has impulse control disorder, which one of the evaluators explained is \"characterized by the repeated inability to refrain from performing a particular action that is harmful to oneself or others.\" One of his mental health providers said that Casper \"has a history of being violent, aggressive[,] and having explosive behaviors.\" He also tested high on the sexual addiction scale and, at the time of the evaluation, continued to \"experience[ ] excessive thinking about sexual behavior, [have] opportunities to view pornography, and entertain[ ] sexual fantasies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 At the sentencing hearing, the court was provided with the PSI Report and letters from the victims' family members, Casper, Casper's family members, and one of Casper's therapists. The court also heard statements from the victims' parents about the impact of Casper's conduct on the victims. Casper's mother spoke on behalf of her son, and Casper spoke on his own behalf. Casper explained that he had a difficult childhood and was often \"teased.\" He then expressed remorse for his conduct and explained\n   that he had recently become more spiritual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 \"[A]fter carefully reviewing\" all of the information provided to the court relevant to sentencing, the court concluded that, \"in the interest of justice,\" it would reduce Casper's sentence to ten years to life on both counts to run consecutively with each other. The court explained that the sentence could be reduced from the presumptive fifteen years to life because of Casper's mental-health status, but that the court could not reduce it to the six years to life that the State and defense counsel recommended because of the following aggravating circumstances: \"substantial physical or psychological injury to the victims,\" the number of victims involved, and Casper was in a position of authority over the victims. Casper appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 On appeal, Casper contends he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel because defense counsel failed to \"present evidence of proportionality-an essential prong of the interests-of-justice framework articulated under\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   ...

In\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   , the court stated that \"sexual crimes, particularly those involving children, represent an especially heinous form of bodily insult\" and that sexual crimes \"intrude on the fundamental bodily integrity of the victim like no others short of murder.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904141\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/254/\">\n    2014 UT 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 49-50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904141\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/254/\">\n    337 P.3d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Had counsel directed the court to\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   , the court would have considered that language in light of Casper's conduct, including the aggravating circumstances, and could have determined that Casper should be sentenced to the presumptive fifteen years to life imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 Casper claims that the court did not provide aggravating circumstances to support the sentence. But the court was not required to find any aggravating circumstances to support the sentence, because aggravated sexual abuse of a child carries the presumptive sentence of fifteen years to life.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-404.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (LexisNexis 2017). Instead, the court was required to find mitigating circumstances that would justify the reduction of Casper's sentence, which it did.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-404.1(6). In any event, the court specifically noted that it was \"adding [the] aggravating circumstances of causing substantial ... psychological injury to the victims. [The crimes] involve two or more victims, and [Casper was] in a position of authority.\" These circumstances directly correlate to the circumstances identified in the sexual abuse of a child statute that provides that a defendant's conduct becomes aggravated when, among other circumstances, the defendant: \"caused bodily injury or severe psychological injury to the victim during or as a result of the offense;\" \"prior to sentencing for this offense, was previously convicted of any sexual offense;\" or \"occupied a position of special trust in relation to the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-404.1(4)(b), (e), (h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 The court then stated that \"it will be the order and judgment of the Court then on these two first-degree felonies that the maximum penalty be imposed,\" but \"in the interest of justice,\" the court reduced his sentence to ten years to life based on a mitigating circumstance-Casper's mental health. It was therefore reasonable for defense counsel to avoid comparing aggravated sexual abuse of a child to murder,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904141\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/254/\">\n    2014 UT 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 49-50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904141\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/254/\">\n    337 P.3d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or other crimes with different sentences, and instead focus on the mitigating circumstances-such as Casper's mental-health status, his lack of a prior criminal history, his willingness to engage in treatment, and his remorse -and the State's sentencing recommendation of a sentence of six years to life imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 A second tactical basis for counsel's decision is apparent from the record in that Casper and the State negotiated a plea deal in which part of the agreement for Casper to plead guilty to the two counts was for the State to recommend a reduced sentence of two consecutive terms of six years to life. Counsel therefore reasonably could have determined that he should focus the court's attention on the State's recommendation and that the recommendation could have been undermined if counsel directed the court to\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   and the proportionality analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618 A third tactical basis for counsel not to ask for a proportionality analysis is that the court would then be required to consider\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   's second factor regarding Casper's rehabilitative potential.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. This would have required the court to consider that Casper had admitted to previously putting his hand down a female neighbor's pants and touching her \"private parts.\" Casper said he was aware of the \"cyclical patterns of [his] crime[s].\" He also acknowledged that he has impulse control disorder, and one of his therapists explained that Casper tested high on the sexual addiction scale and continues to \"experience[ ] excessive thinking about sexual behavior, [have] opportunities to view pornography, and entertain[ ] sexual fantasies.\" All of this information would have alerted the court to Casper's poor rehabilitative potential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b619 We therefore conclude that defense counsel made a reasonable tactical decision not to ask the court to engage in a proportionality analysis under\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   and to instead focus on the mitigating circumstances and the State's recommendation of a reduced sentence of two consecutive terms of six years to life imprisonment. Because Casper has failed to establish that his counsel performed deficiently, we do not address his prejudice argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

We therefore decline to address it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    It appears that Casper is arguing that counsel should have pushed for a further reduced sentence because Casper's conduct aligned more with the elements necessary to convict of only sexual abuse of a child, \"but because he was [related to the victims], his punishment jumped to 10 years to life.\" First, his punishment did not \"jump[ ]\" to ten years to life; it was reduced from the presumptive fifteen years to life. Second, Casper pleaded guilty to two of the four counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child with the stipulated aggravator of being in a position of special trust to the victims. In exchange, the State dismissed two other counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child. And, as explained above,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b615, the court found other aggravating circumstances to support its decision not to reduce his sentence further to six years to life. By arguing that pleading guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child should be considered akin to pleading guilty to sexual abuse of a child-because the aggravating factor was only that he was in a position of special trust-and therefore the sentence should have been reduced even further would have only served to highlight the favorable plea deal and undermine Casper's apparent remorse for the harm he admits to have inflicted on the victims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
