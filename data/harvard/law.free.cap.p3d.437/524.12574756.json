He argues that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to object to a jury instruction, failed to question a witness thoroughly, and failed to object to the jury reviewing certain evidence during deliberation. We conclude that Cantarero has not demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In preparation for a Fourth of July camping trip, Cantarero and his wife (Wife) invited Wife's two sisters and their families to the house to clean a camping trailer. One of Wife's sisters, the mother of the victims (Mother), brought her two children (Older Victim and Younger Victim) to Cantarero's house, and the second sister (Sister) brought her husband. After cleaning the trailer, Wife, both sisters, and Sister's husband stayed outside talking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Meanwhile, inside the house, Cantarero watched television in the living room. Younger Victim entered the house to get a glass of water. When she entered the living room, Cantarero stood up, grabbed her hand with one hand, and touched her genitals under her clothes and underwear with the other hand. Younger Victim said, \"[S]top\" and ran back outside. After they returned home later that evening, Younger Victim told Older Victim what had happened. Both victims then approached Mother and told her about the incident with Cantarero in the living room. Older Victim also revealed that Cantarero had touched her vagina several times over approximately three or four years, beginning when she was five years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Following these revelations, Mother told the victims that they should not go camping because Cantarero would be going, but the victims were excited about the trip so they resolved to go. Mother and the victims drove in a vehicle separate from Cantarero and Mother warned them not to get near Cantarero. At the campsite, the three of them also stayed in their own tent. The next morning, Sister confronted Cantarero about his \"touching private parts [of] little girls.\" He then said, \"Wow, I'm so sorry. I will work on that[,]\" and he told Mother that he was \"very sorry.\" Cantarero apologized to Sister and asked her \"to forgive [him] if [he] had made any mistakes with the children.\" Following this exchange, Cantarero and Wife packed up and left. Mother later informed the police who then began an investigation. As part of that investigation, each victim participated in recorded interviews at the Children's Justice Center (the CJC Interviews). A nurse also examined each of the victims and found no physical indicators of sexual abuse. The State charged Cantarero with two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, and the case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    U Visa\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 During trial, in response to a question from defense counsel, Mother testified that\n   she learned about \"U visas\" as a result of the charges against Cantarero.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother explained that she signed some paperwork and provided it to an attorney, but she did not know whether the paperwork had been filed. In subsequent questioning, both the prosecutor and defense counsel returned briefly to the U visa topic. Shortly after being excused to deliberate, the jury sent out a question, asking, \"[W]hat is a U visa?\" Following discussion among the prosecutor, defense counsel, and Cantarero, the trial court concluded that this information could not be provided during deliberation and was irrelevant. The court sent a response to the jury, stating, \"[T]he Court cannot give you any further evidence at this time. You must make your determination based on the evidence you already have.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    The CJC Interviews\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 The jury viewed the interviews of each victim that had been recorded at the Children's Justice Center following the report of the abuse. In closing statements, defense counsel urged the jury to watch the recorded interviews again as they deliberated because the statements made during those interviews illustrated the holes in the State's case. Counsel asserted that, although the victims testified that Cantarero touched their genitals multiple times, they could describe details of only one event each. Additionally, counsel emphasized Younger Victim's statement in the interview, particularly her explanation that Cantarero started touching her after he had stopped touching Older Victim. Counsel theorized that Younger Victim may have \"heard that in a conversation or someone told her to say that, but that's a very adult evaluation.\" During deliberations, the jury had access to the recorded CJC Interviews of both victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Jury Instruction 17\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 The State proposed several jury instructions, including one at issue in this appeal-Instruction 17. The challenged instruction provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In evaluating the testimony of a child you should consider all of the factors surrounding the child's testimony, including the age of the child and any evidence regarding the child's level of cognitive development.

You should not discount or distrust the testimony of a child solely because he or she is a child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A child witness shall be considered a competent witness.

The court also provided the jury a written copy of this instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b69 The jury convicted Cantarero on both counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child. He appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b610 Cantarero raises three issues on appeal, none of which were preserved below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"When a party fails to raise and argue an issue in the trial court, it has failed to preserve the issue, and an appellate court will not typically reach that issue absent a valid\n   exception to preservation.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Jury Instruction 17\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b612 Cantarero first asserts that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object to jury Instruction 17. He takes particular exception to that portion of the instruction stating that \"[a] child witness shall be considered a competent witness.\" Cantarero does not contend that Instruction 17 incorrectly states the law. Instead, he argues that, by failing to provide a definition of \"competent,\" Instruction 17 \"singled out the [child victims] for the court's endorsement as competent witnesses and lent weight to their testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b613 We review the jury instructions here through the lens of ineffective assistance of counsel and we generally \"review jury instructions in their entirety and will affirm when the jury instructions taken as a whole fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a defendant must establish that counsel's performance was objectively deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Here, we analyze only the prejudice prong and conclude that Cantarero has failed to establish a reasonable probability that-had an objection been made-the results of his trial would have been different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614 Considered as a whole, the jury instructions directed the jury to evaluate the testimony of a child witness in the same manner as any other witness. Specifically, the court instructed the jury on its proper role-determining the weight and credibility of each witness's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Day\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10382103\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/815/1345/#p1351\">\n    815 P.2d 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1351 (Utah Ct. App. 1991) (\"It is the role of the jury to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.\"). The court directed the jury to consider \"all of the factors surrounding the child's testimony, including the age of the child and any evidence regarding the child's level of cognitive development,\" when evaluating the child's testimony. The court further instructed the jury that a \"child's testimony shall be evaluated in the same manner and given the same weight as [any other] witness.\" In other words, the court expressed no view on whether the child victims were telling the truth and instructed the jury to evaluate their testimony the same as it would any other witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615 Another jury instruction, Instruction 11, listed several factors for the jury to consider when weighing the credibility of a witness, including the witness's demeanor, bias, memory, and consistency. In his closing statement, defense counsel called particular attention to the jury's role, stating, \"You heard the testimony as I did. You have to judge credibility and give the weight to different testimonies that you heard.\" The State, in closing, also drew the jury's attention\n   to its proper role, recommending that it review Instruction 11, which explained the factors to consider when determining witness credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b616 In light of the above, we are unpersuaded that a defense objection to Instruction 17 reasonably could have made a difference. The exclusion of the instruction that a \"child witness shall be considered a competent witness\" or addition of a \"competence\" definition-possible results of a defense objection-would not have altered, reasonably, the jury's weighing the victims' testimony. In other words, Cantarero has not established a reasonable probability of a different outcome had an objection been made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Ott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988245\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/344/\">\n    2010 UT 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988245\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/344/\">\n    247 P.3d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II. U Visa\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b617 Next, Cantarero asserts that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to ask follow-up questions regarding a witness's interest in obtaining a U visa. He argues that trial counsel should have presented further explanation of the U visa benefit, without which \"the jury was left confused.\" Reviewing such a claim of ineffective assistance, we employ \"a strong presumption that counsel was competent and effective, giving [defense] counsel wide latitude in making tactical decisions, and we will not question such decisions unless there is no reasonable basis supporting them.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Goode\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980414\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/288/306/\">\n    2012 UT App 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980414\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/288/306/\">\n    288 P.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b618 Defense counsel elicited the U visa testimony from Mother on cross-examination to show a possible motive for her and the victims to fabricate the accusations against Cantarero. The testimony emerged in the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   COUNSEL: Did you ever talk to the police since [making a witness statement] about any kind of benefit to you, as far as this case is involved?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   MOTHER: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   COUNSEL: There has been no discussion of any benefit of any status or anything on this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   MOTHER: With the police, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   COUNSEL: With anybody else?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   MOTHER: With the therapist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   COUNSEL: And what was that discussion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   MOTHER: The therapist told me that because of my therapy that I could get a ... U visa.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   COUNSEL: And did you know what that was before she told you about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   MOTHER: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Responding to defense counsel's questions, Mother testified that she did not know about the U visa before the therapist informed her. On redirect examination, the prosecutor asked whether Mother had since applied for a U Visa. Mother responded that she asked her attorney about a U visa but had not received one. When it became clear that Mother had not been awarded a U visa, defense counsel terminated this line of questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b619 Soon after it began deliberating, the jury sent the court a question, asking, \"What is a U visa?\" Following discussion of the question and possible responses with counsel and Cantarero, the trial court responded to the jury with a note, stating, \"[T]he court cannot give you any further evidence at this time. You must make your determination based on the evidence you have heard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b620 We are not persuaded that counsel performed deficiently by failing to ask follow-up questions about the details or availability of a U visa for Mother. While an excursion into the landscape of immigration law may have prevented the U visa jury question, Cantarero was not prevented from exploring his theory that Mother encouraged the victims to fabricate their allegations of abuse to gain a benefit. Defense counsel left the jury with the idea that Mother was interested in a benefit associated with the accusations made in this case. Counsel successfully introduced this fabrication defense to the jury and eliciting greater detail from Mother may not have been possible or prudent under the circumstances. Counsel legitimately could have believed that further explanation of this potential immigration benefit would have undermined his effort to impeach Mother. This is a reasonable tactical decision of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980414\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/288/306/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The State argues, and we agree, that delving deeper into the U visa\n   status application \"risked undermining the defense-favorable inference the jury may draw\" from the exchange with Mother. Indeed, further exploration also may have necessitated a presentation of the U visa's purpose, eligibility requirements, issuance, and its other contours by someone qualified to address these questions. Additionally, Cantarero offered other theories supporting the fabrication defense, so a better explanation of the U visa would have added little to his defense strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b621 We conclude that Cantarero has not shown that counsel performed deficiently by not asking additional questions of Mother about the U visa or seeking to explain it further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   III. The CJC Interviews\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b622 Cantarero next asserts that defense counsel was ineffective when he failed to object to the jury having access to the victims' recorded CJC Interviews during its deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b623 We have previously noted that \"a child's interview taken by police for the purpose of prosecuting crime, which is then introduced at trial and subjected to live cross-examination, constitutes ... testimony[, or is testimonial in nature,] ... and thus should not be given to the jury during its deliberations.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In addition to their testimony, the State played the recorded CJC Interviews of each victim for the jury and submitted the recordings as exhibits. Had an objection been made and sustained regarding the jury's access to the CJC Interviews during deliberations, all of the \"oral evidence\"-the victims' testimony, the CJC Interviews played in court, as well as Cantarero's own testimony-would likely have \"faded [equally] from the memory of the jurors\" as they began their deliberations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10411647\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/689/5/#p15\">\n    689 P.2d at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). Instead, the jurors retained the CJC Interviews and could refresh their memories on this testimony during their discussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b626 Rather than object, defense counsel insisted that the jury review the CJC Interviews during its deliberations because, in counsel's view, the recorded interviews illustrated \"hole[s] in this case.\" Defense counsel explained that this tactic supported an important defense theory-the lack of detail regarding any other incidents could be explained by the victims fabricating the abuse allegations. Counsel also impressed upon the jury what counsel described as a \"very adult evaluation\" of Younger Victim's statement drawn from the CJC Interview, suggesting that Younger Victim may have been told that Cantarero began abusing Younger Victim when he stopped abusing Older Victim. Consequently, Cantarero chose to take strategic\n   advantage of the jury's access to the CJC Interviews, and he cannot now be heard to complain about that strategic choice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988245\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/344/\">\n    2010 UT 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988245\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/344/\">\n    247 P.3d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
