Marriott's (Marriott)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   property. Marriott appeals, arguing that the district court erred in excluding evidence of damages resulting from the easements' interference with potential mining. Rocky Mountain cross-appeals, asserting that the district court erred in granting Marriott partial summary judgment on a provision in Rocky Mountain's amended condemnation complaint. We affirm the district court's grant of partial summary judgment to Marriott. But we reverse the district court's ruling that excluded evidence of damages resulting from lost potential mining and remand to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Seeking to construct an electric transmission line (the New Line), Rocky Mountain filed a complaint for condemnation to obtain easements across approximately 453 acres of land (the Property) belonging to Marriott. Soon after, the parties stipulated to Rocky Mountain's occupancy of the easements, and Rocky Mountain began construction on the New Line. Marriott then requested that a jury determine the appropriate amount of \"just compensation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 At the time of the condemnation, Marriott possessed two small mining permits, which authorized him to mine for sand and gravel aggregate on a ten-acre portion of the Property. Although the mining operation was relatively small, Marriott had applied for a large mining permit from the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (DOGM). In the application (the Proposed Permit), Marriott provided plans to mine 145 acres of the Property in two phases. Phase one consisted of 35 acres, and phase two consisted of 110 acres. The Proposed Permit estimated that it would take \"between 8 and 15 years\" to complete phase one and did not include a time frame for phase two. DOGM had indicated to Marriott that the Proposed Permit would be approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 To support his proposed \"just compensation,\" Marriott provided evidence of the market value of the land supporting the New Line. That evidence included lost value because of the New Line's interference with potential mining on the Property. Marriott asserted that the New Line \"greatly diminishes the ability to mine gravel products not only directly beneath the [New Line] ... but also the areas surrounding [it].\" Although the land supporting the New Line was not included in the Proposed Permit, Marriott asserted that he planned to eventually exploit \"all mineable areas of the [P]roperty.\" Accordingly, Marriott argued that the loss of potential mining should be included in his award of just compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Rocky Mountain disagreed with Marriott's proposed damages. It asserted that damages should be based solely on uses to which the Property could have been put at the time of the condemnation. Rocky Mountain pointed to various preexisting encumbrances on the Property, which created legal barriers to Marriott's proposed mining development. Given those legal barriers, Rocky Mountain believed that Marriott's alleged mining plans were speculative, and therefore the lost value of that potential mining should not be considered in determining Marriott's award of just compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 For example, the Property was bisected by an irrigation canal (the Canal), which the\n   federal government owned in fee. Although Marriott conceded he did not have the unilateral right to relocate the Canal, he asserted that he always planned to move the Canal and believed a relocation was possible. Thus, Marriott included losses of potential mining that would have required the Canal's relocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Rocky Mountain attempted to avoid these potential damages by amending its condemnation complaint. It added a provision (the Canal Provision), which provided that, if Marriott received written approval from the federal government to relocate the Canal, Marriott had the right to request that Rocky Mountain relocate portions of the New Line to allow mining operations on the Property. If that happened, Rocky Mountain would be obligated either to relocate the New Line at its own expense or pay Marriott \"the fair market value of the Deposits that would otherwise be made accessible for mining by the relocation of the [New Line].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 In response to the amendment, Marriott filed a motion for partial summary judgment, asking the court to strike the Canal Provision. That motion first cited the Utah Code, stating that \"damages shall be considered to have accrued at the date of the service of summons,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-6-512(1) (LexisNexis 2012), and that the condemnor \"shall, within 30 days after final judgment, pay the sum of the money assessed,\"\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-6-514. Marriott then asserted that the Canal Provision was impermissible because it \"propose[d] that some of the damages will only be calculated and paid in the future.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 After reviewing the arguments, the district court granted Marriott's motion for partial summary judgment. It found that there were no disputes of material fact, and that the Canal Provision was \"not permissible under Utah Law for the reasons stated in\" Marriott's motion. The court therefore struck the Canal Provision from the condemnation complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Apart from the Canal, two more preexisting encumbrances created legal barriers to potential mining on the Property. These encumbrances included a fifty-foot-wide easement owned by Rocky Mountain that contained an electric transmission line, and a thirty-foot-wide easement owned by Questar Gas that contained a natural gas pipeline (collectively, the Utility Lines). Marriott did not have the unilateral right to relocate the Utility Lines. The relocation process involved formal procedures, including the proposal of alternate routes and the payment of assessment fees. Further, whether to grant relocation requests was within the discretion of Rocky Mountain and Questar, and their decisions were not subject to review or appeal. But Marriott nonetheless claimed he intended to relocate the Utility Lines to facilitate his mining plans. And he claimed damages for the lost value of potential mining that depended on their relocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Rocky Mountain opposed Marriott's proposed damages by filing two motions to exclude evidence (the Motions to Exclude). In the first motion, Rocky Mountain asked the court to exclude evidence of losses that depended on Marriott's ability to relocate the Utility Lines. That motion asserted that Marriott's \"position that the Utility Lines ... could be relocated is not a 'reasonable certainty.' It is fantasy.\" Rocky Mountain noted that Marriott has \"no unilateral right to relocate the Utility Lines and never obtained consent from [Rocky Mountain] or Questar to relocate those lines.\" Further, Marriott had \"never asked [Rocky Mountain] or Questar to move the Utility Lines or the Easements\" and \"it is impossible to know how that request would have been received.\" Before approving such a request, Rocky Mountain and Questar \"would need to consider many factors, including ... the proposed new locations and replacement routes of the easements, whether other third parties would have to approve the relocations and whether such approvals had been obtained, ... the cost of relocating the lines and the future maintenance costs,\" etc. The first motion also noted that Rocky Mountain and Questar had complete discretion to grant or deny relocation requests. In sum, Rocky Mountain argued that the \"hypothetical relocation of the [Utility Lines] ... cannot be a factor in determining the amount of reasonable compensation to which [Marriott is] entitled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 In the second motion, Rocky Mountain asked the court to exclude evidence of losses that depended on Marriott's ability to obtain authorization to mine areas where mining was not permitted at the time of the condemnation. To support that request, Rocky Mountain noted \"it was impossible to know\" whether DOGM would approve the Proposed Permit. Further, even if the Proposed Permit were approved, Marriott sought compensation for lost mining in areas the Proposed Permit would not cover. Rocky Mountain stated, \"[Marriott's] claim that [he] would have received DOGM's approval to revise a non-existent mine permit is too speculative.\" Thus, it asked the district court to exclude evidence of damages from potential lost mining in areas that would be authorized only if the Proposed Permit was approved. In the alternative, it asked the court to exclude evidence of damages from lost mining in areas that were not covered by the Proposed Permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 When Rocky Mountain filed the Motions to Exclude, the parties had not concluded fact discovery, and expert discovery had not begun. Fact discovery was scheduled to end the following month, initial expert disclosures were due approximately four months later, expert rebuttal reports were due approximately five months later, and the deadline for expert depositions was approximately six months later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 Marriott opposed the Motions to Exclude. In his memorandum in opposition, he noted that \"just compensation\" is not measured by the actual use of the property at the time of the condemnation, but rather by the property's highest and best use. Further, he argued that the district court could not yet properly determine whether it was feasible to remove the legal barriers that prevented mining on the Property. Such a determination \"would require the [c]ourt to consider evidence and expert testimony relating to several factors,\" which Marriott intended to obtain and \"submit ... at the appropriate time.\" Essentially, Marriott asserted that granting the Motions to Exclude at that time would deny him \"a full and fair opportunity to obtain or offer evidence\" that supports or relates to his position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 The district court granted the Motions to Exclude. It first stated, \"[C]ourts have an obligation to act as a gatekeeper to screen irrelevant evidence from the jury\" and that \"motions in limine may be used early in the litigation process to narrow the issues and reasonably limit discovery.\" (Quotation simplified.) Accordingly, the court determined it was \"well within its authority to address the substantive issues of the [Motions to Exclude].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 The court then addressed the substantive arguments. It first determined that mining in areas covered by the Proposed Permit was legally feasible because the Proposed Permit had been submitted and there was reason to believe it would actually be approved. But the court also determined that Marriott's plans to mine in areas that would require him to relocate the Utility Lines or obtain a mining permit for areas not covered by the Proposed Permit were conjectural or speculative potential uses that were not legally feasible. The court therefore ordered that \"any evidence of alleged losses or valuation theories premised upon\" those two development plans \"are excluded from and shall not be introduced in this matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 Following the district court's ruling, the parties entered a settlement agreement, reserving the right to appeal the district court's previous rulings. After that, the district court entered a final judgment of condemnation. Marriott now appeals and Rocky Mountain cross-appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b618 Marriott argues that the district court erred in granting the Motions to Exclude on two grounds. First, he asserts that the court \"adopted and applied an incorrect legal feasibility analysis\" by ruling that \"condemnees must request and receive permission from the entity with authority to approve or deny a proposed use for [that] use to be considered legally feasible.\" Second, he argues that the court erred in granting the Motions to Exclude before he had a \"full and fair opportunity to complete fact and expert discovery.\" \"We review the legal questions underlying the admissibility of evidence for\n   correctness and the district court's decision to admit or exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackhawk Townhouses Owners Ass'n Inc. v.

The record established that, under certain circumstances, Rocky Mountain and Questar agreed to relocate their utility lines. Both companies allowed servient landowners to submit relocation requests and decided to grant or deny those requests according to established procedures. To show the legal feasibility of his proposed potential mining, Marriott was required to show that, given those procedures and all other relevant factors, the prospect of relocating the Utility Lines to develop the mining operation was reasonably probable at the time of the condemnation.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499802\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/28/697/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b631 In its ruling, the district court noted that Marriott never initiated the relocation process. To the extent the court determined this was dispositive, that ruling was erroneous. In fact, any steps Marriott had taken to relocate the Utility Lines were necessarily insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25 (\"[A] landowner may testify concerning the individual elements of feasibility, but that landowner must offer the testimony of a properly qualified expert to prove the actual feasibility of a potential use.\"). Marriott was required to first present testimony from a qualified expert that the potential mining was the relevant land's \"highest and best use.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (quotation simplified). And an expert could testify that the potential mining was the \"highest and best use\" only by testifying to the legal feasibility of that use.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   That is, that relocating the Utility Lines was reasonably probable.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   When Rocky Mountain filed the Motions to Exclude, the time for expert disclosure and discovery had not yet started. Thus, Marriott was denied a fair opportunity to obtain and present evidence that was essential to his claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b632 Marriott asserts on appeal, as he did below, that he intended to retain expert witnesses who would testify to the likelihood, under the circumstances, that Rocky Mountain and Questar would have granted his relocation requests. To that end, he requested production of documents that referenced instances in which Rocky Mountain approved or rejected a third party's request to relocate power lines, but Rocky Mountain refused to produce those documents based on the pendency of the Motions to Exclude. This evidence was essential to establishing that mining was the land's \"highest and best use.\" We therefore conclude Marriott did not have a fair opportunity to develop his claim that relocating the Utility Lines was reasonably probable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b633 Rocky Mountain argues that expert testimony would not have been helpful. It notes, \"[B]ecause [Questar and Rocky Mountain] were never asked to assess a potential relocation, they did not know whether a relocation ... would even have been possible, let alone approved.\" Further, it notes that \"merely because a utility has granted or denied a relocation in one instance ... does not mean that the same utility will agree to relocate another line\" under different circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b634 Rocky Mountain's arguments are mistaken because they assume an incorrect legal standard. The uncertainty regarding the relocation of the Utility Lines created a legal feasibility issue, but it should not have determined the outcome. When a legal barrier prevents a proposed \"highest and best use,\" the ability to remove that barrier will always be uncertain to some degree. But a landowner need not show that a legal barrier will certainly be removed, he must show only that its removal is reasonably probable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Hildale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20UT%2056\">\n    2001 UT 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499802\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/28/697/\">\n    28 P.3d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Marriott was entitled to present such evidence to the district court. Because he was denied that opportunity, we conclude the district court erred in ruling, before the close of fact and expert discovery, that Marriott could not establish the legal feasibility of mining that depended on relocating the Utility Lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   B. Mining in Unpermitted Areas\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b636 Marriott argues the district court erred in ruling, before the close of fact and expert discovery, that he could not establish the legal feasibility of mining in areas that were not permitted under the Proposed Permit. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b637 In its ruling, the district court first found that Marriott had established the legal feasibility of mining areas covered by the Proposed Permit because the Proposed Permit had been submitted and there was reason to believe it would actually be approved. But as to areas outside the Proposed Permit, the court stated that \"it appears uncertain as to when or if any application, revision[,] or amendment\" to allow mining outside the Proposed Permit would be made. The court continued, \"[I]t is uncertain how DOGM would respond to such a request or whether it would approve additional areas on [the Property] for mining.\" Based on these observations, the court concluded, \"[P]lans to mine currently unpermitted areas [are] conjectural or speculative potential uses that are not legally feasible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b638 The court's analysis was misguided. As with relocating the Utility Lines, the uncertainty of obtaining authorization to mine outside the Proposed Permit created a legal feasibility issue, but that uncertainty should not have determined the outcome. To show that mining in unpermitted areas was legally feasible, Marriott did not need to have the legal right to mine those areas, nor was he required to start the process of obtaining that right. Instead, he was required to show that the likelihood of obtaining approval to mine those areas was reasonably probable so as to have an appreciable influence upon market value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

It provided that, if Marriott received written approval from the federal government to relocate the Canal, Marriott could request that Rocky Mountain relocate the New Line to allow mining operations on the supporting land. If that happened, Rocky Mountain would have been obligated to either relocate the New Line at its own expense or pay Marriott \"the fair market value of the Deposits that would otherwise be made accessible for mining by the relocation of the [New Line].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b645 Rocky Mountain disagrees with this interpretation. It argues that, under the Canal Provision, \"relocation would be at the option of [Marriott], not [Rocky Mountain].\" But the Canal Provision clearly provided otherwise. It stated, \"[Rocky Mountain] shall have the option of paying [Marriott] the fair market value of the Deposits that would otherwise be made accessible for mining by the relocation of the [New Line]. This option shall be\n   <em>\n    in lieu of\n   </em>\n   relocating the [New Line].\" (Emphasis added.)
