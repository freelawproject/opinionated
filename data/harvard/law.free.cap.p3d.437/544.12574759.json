A search of Bilek's cell phone revealed numerous nude photographs and video recordings of E.C. in which she appeared to be unconscious. Subsequently, Bilek was convicted of two counts of voyeurism, one count of distribution of a controlled substance, and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 With respect to his voyeurism convictions, Bilek argues that the State presented insufficient evidence to prove that he used a \"concealed or disguised\" electronic device to secretly or surreptitiously record or view E.C. Specifically, Bilek argues that the \"concealed or disguised\" element of class A misdemeanor voyeurism cannot be satisfied by proving only that he provided E.C. with drugs to render her unconscious. We hold that evidence that E.C. was unconscious is sufficient to prove that Bilek secretly or surreptitiously made the recordings, but it does not satisfy the separate element that requires the use of a concealed or disguised electronic device. Accordingly, we vacate his voyeurism convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Bilek also argues for reversal of his other convictions because the State wrongfully admitted evidence that he was on probation at the time of the offenses and because the district court denied his right to self-representation. We reject these challenges and affirm Bilek's convictions for distribution of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 In December 2015, Bilek was sentenced to sixty months of probation after pleading guilty to felony kidnapping.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a condition of probation, Bilek agreed that no women would stay overnight with him without his probation officer's approval and that he would abstain from illegal use or possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Less than two months later, two probation officers conducted a routine check and discovered Bilek in a motel room with E.C. When they entered Bilek's room, the officers saw that E.C. was wearing a tank top, sweatpants, and no shoes. According to the officers, it \"appeared like she had just woke[n]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   up\" and she \"seemed a little bit out of it.\" They also observed heroin, crystal methamphetamine, crack cocaine, syringes, a spoon, a metal pipe, and plastic paper next to the bed. After speaking with Bilek and E.C., the officers searched the contents of Bilek's cell phone and discovered 179 photographs and 9 videos of E.C. in Bilek's motel room. In most of the photographs and videos, E.C. was nude, either alone or in compromising positions with Bilek, and appeared to be unconscious or asleep. After reviewing the photographs and speaking with E.C., the officers allowed her to leave, but they placed Bilek under arrest for violating his probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Based on E.C.'s statements and the drugs, drug paraphernalia, photographs, and videos discovered in the motel room, the State charged Bilek with one count of forcible sexual abuse, a second degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2014) ; one count of distribution of or arranging to distribute a controlled substance, a second degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58-37-8(1)(a)(ii) (2016); two counts of voyeurism, class A misdemeanors,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-9-702.7(2) (2014);\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia, a class B misdemeanor,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58-37a-5(1) (2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The district court appointed counsel to represent Bilek. On five occasions before trial, Bilek requested to substitute counsel. Bilek complained that his attorney refused to provide him with the discovery he requested, to file the motions he asked be filed, to subpoena witnesses he identified, and to \"excuse herself as ineffective counsel.\" After addressing the matter with Bilek and his attorney, the district court denied Bilek's requests, finding that there was no conflict that necessitated a change in counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Before trial, Bilek filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of his prior convictions and probation status. The district court granted the motion with respect to Bilek's prior convictions, but it declined to exclude evidence that Bilek was on probation. The court explained that excluding evidence that the officers were conducting a probation check \"would subject the jury to wondering and speculating in improper areas\" and that it would be \"a better result, a less prejudicial result by actually just saying who [the officers] are and why they [were in Bilek's motel room].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 At trial, E.C. testified that she met Bilek in December 2015. Since then, they had many sexual encounters in which Bilek agreed to pay her money or drugs in exchange for oral sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Two days before Bilek was arrested in this case, he had paid to bail E.C. out of jail. When Bilek met her at the police station, E.C. told him she was feeling sick from withdrawal, so Bilek offered her methamphetamine and \"a place to shower and sleep.\" E.C. went to Bilek's motel room, \"injected [the] meth\" that he provided, and then drove with him to another location where he purchased heroin and crack cocaine. E.C. also went with Bilek to purchase supplies to assemble a crack pipe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 After purchasing the supplies, the two returned to Bilek's motel room where E.C. injected methamphetamine and heroin and smoked crack cocaine. E.C. testified that the methamphetamine Bilek provided that night made her feel \"cold and sick and tired\" when \"[m]eth usually makes [her] feel the opposite.\" E.C. also testified that she witnessed Bilek inject methamphetamine, but that the drugs he used appeared to come from a separate stash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 During the time she remained in Bilek's motel room, E.C. was \"mostly asleep.\" On the first night, E.C. performed oral sex on Bilek as payment for the drugs. The only other sexual activity she recalled occurred when she awoke to Bilek rubbing lotion near\n   her genitals and when Bilek requested she inject his penis with methamphetamine. E.C. testified that she removed her clothes only twice in Bilek's motel room, on the first night when she performed oral sex on Bilek and the single time she took a shower. In both instances, she recalled re-dressing immediately afterward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 E.C. also testified that she had not consented to being photographed or video recorded. E.C. acknowledged that she had allowed Bilek to photograph her nude in exchange for money during a prior sexual encounter, but she maintained that she had not consented to additional nude photographs and never agreed to allow Bilek to photograph or film her while she was unconscious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 In addition to E.C.'s testimony, the State presented the photographs and videos found on Bilek's cell phone and introduced expert testimony about the physical effects of the drugs E.C. ingested. The probation officers also testified about their observations. The officers explained that they went to Bilek's motel room to conduct a routine probation check, but they did not disclose that Bilek was on probation for a kidnapping conviction or that Bilek was on felony probation. During one officer's testimony, the jury submitted two questions asking for more information about why Bilek was on probation. In response, the district court instructed the jurors that it could not provide an answer to their question and that they were not to consider \"any thoughts [they] might have about that or about the subject of that question in [their] deliberations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 When the State rested, Bilek moved for a directed verdict as to the forcible sexual abuse, distribution of a controlled substance, and voyeurism charges. Before the district court could rule, Bilek objected to the statements his attorney made in her argument in support of the motion. The district court explained that it had already instructed Bilek that it was not going to recognize objections unless they came from his attorney but would construe Bilek's objection as a request for \"an opportunity for [him] to speak with counsel.\" Bilek's attorney explained to the court that Bilek was \"agitated about what's happening\" and would like to \"argue about the facts,\" despite counsel's assessment that those facts \"would be harmful to his case.\" Bilek again objected and stated that he was \"firing\" his attorney. The district court asked whether Bilek was requesting to represent himself, and Bilek confirmed that he was. The court ruled that it was \"not going to allow that to happen at this point.\" Bilek's defense counsel continued to represent him through the duration of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 After denying Bilek's request for self-representation, the district court denied the motion for a directed verdict. As to the voyeurism charges, the court ruled that providing \"a controlled substance that would render a person unaware as to what's going on\" was sufficient evidence of \"concealment or disguise to secretly or surreptitiously videotape, film, photograph or record.\" The district court also found that E.C.'s testimony along with the drugs and paraphernalia discovered in Bilek's motel room provided sufficient evidence of forcible sexual abuse and distribution of a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 The jury convicted Bilek of two counts of voyeurism, one count of distribution of a controlled substance, and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia. The jury acquitted him of forcible sexual abuse. Bilek appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18 Bilek raises three issues on appeal. First, he contends that the State presented insufficient evidence to support his convictions for class A misdemeanor voyeurism. Specifically, Bilek contends that the State's evidence that E.C. was unconscious when he used his phone to take photographs and videos of her was insufficient to prove that he \"concealed or disguised\" his phone while doing so. To assess claims of insufficient evidence, \"we review the evidence and all inferences which may reasonably be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We recognize that \"[t]he trial judge is in a better position than we are to assess the avowed basis for evidence of prior misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Sufficiency of the Evidence Supporting Class A Misdemeanor Voyeurism\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21 Bilek contends that we should reverse his conviction for voyeurism because the \"State never proved that [he] used a 'concealed or disguised' camera, a requirement under the [voyeurism] statute.\" The State disagrees but argues in the alternative that, if we determine that the evidence was insufficient to support Bilek's class A misdemeanor voyeurism convictions, we should order the district court to enter convictions for class B misdemeanor voyeurism. We first address whether the State presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the elements of class A misdemeanor voyeurism. We conclude that it did not and then turn to the appropriate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A. Evidence Supporting the \"Concealed or Disguised\" Element\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22 When Bilek committed the acts charged, a person committed class A misdemeanor voyeurism by\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (1) intentionally us[ing] a camcorder, motion picture camera, photographic camera of any type, or other equipment\n   <em>\n    that is concealed or disguised\n   </em>\n   to secretly or surreptitiously videotape, film, photograph, record, or view by electronic means an individual:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (a) for the purpose of viewing any portion of the individual's body regarding which the individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy, whether or not that portion of the body is covered with clothing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (b) without the knowledge or consent of the individual; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (c) under circumstances in which the individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-9-702.7\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-9-702.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), (2) (LexisNexis 2014) (emphasis added). The State contends, as it argued at trial, that Bilek's actions met the \"concealed or disguised\" element of the voyeurism statute because he \"concealed his phone when he used it to take nude photographs and videos of his victim after the drugs he gave her left her unconscious or otherwise unaware.\" The State's argument relies on the photographs and videos the officers discovered on Bilek's phone, including a video that seems to depict Bilek hiding his phone when E.C. begins to stir from her unconscious state. The State also relies on E.C.'s testimony that she had not consented to being photographed or recorded nude, that she had been rendered unconscious by the narcotics Bilek provided, and that she was unaware that Bilek had photographed and recorded her nude while she was unconscious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 23 Assuming that E.C. was unconscious and did not consent to being photographed and recorded nude, Bilek argues that her unconscious state cannot support a finding that he concealed or disguised his phone camera. Rather, Bilek contends that all of the photographs and videos of E.C. were\n   taken while he \"was using the phone openly\" and that \"concealment should focus on 'ordinary observation,' not the subjective observation of the person being photographed.\" Because the State relied solely on E.C. being unconscious to prove the device was concealed or disguised, Bilek contends there was insufficient evidence to support that element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24 Ultimately, whether photographing an unconscious person qualifies as using \"concealed or disguised\" equipment is a question of statutory interpretation. \"When interpreting a statute, we rely first on the statute's plain language as the best evidence of the legislature's intent.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

While \"concealed or disguised\" is a postpositive modifier that applies to the noun sequence \"camcorder, motion picture camera, photographic camera of any type, or other equipment,\" \"secretly or surreptitiously\" is a prepositive modifier that applies to the verb sequence \"videotape, film, photograph, record, or view.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n   </em>\n   147 (2012) (explaining the series-qualifier cannon of statutory construction). Although both sequences and their modifiers require that the perpetrator act generally to prevent the victim from recognizing that he or she is being recorded or viewed with electronic equipment, the requirement that the perpetrator conceal or disguise the equipment is separate and in addition to the requirement that the perpetrator secretly or surreptitiously record or view the victim. Here, evidence that E.C. was unconscious at the time is sufficient to prove that the photographs and videos were \"secretly or surreptitiously\" taken. But it does not prove that Bilek's phone camera was \"concealed or disguised\" under the ordinary and accepted meaning of those words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 26 Adopting the State's position-that Bilek concealed or disguised his phone camera by waiting to take illicit photographs and video recordings of E.C. until she was unconscious-would render superfluous the \"secretly or surreptitiously\" element of the statute. Because we must interpret the statute \"to give meaning to all parts,\" both the noun and verb sequences and their modifiers must be given individual meaning.\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904141\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/254/\">\n    2014 UT 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904141\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/254/\">\n    337 P.3d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 27 Such an interpretation does not produce unintended absurd results.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bagley v.

Specifically, when read as a whole, subsection (1) requires, in relevant part, that the perpetrator intentionally use some form of equipment that is \"concealed or disguised to secretly or surreptitiously ...\n   <em>\n    view by electronic means\n   </em>\n   an individual ... under circumstances in which the individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-9-702.7\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-9-702.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(c) (emphasis added). In contrast, subsection (4) applies when the perpetrator \"\n   <em>\n    views or attempts to view\n   </em>\n   an individual ... under circumstances in which the individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-9-702.7\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-9-702.7(4)(c) (emphasis added). In other words, subsection (1) requires proof that E.C.-under the circumstances of this case-had a reasonable expectation of privacy in not having portions of her body viewed with some form of electronic equipment, whereas subsection (4) requires proof that E.C. had a reasonable expectation of privacy in not having portions of her body viewed at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 32 Here, the distinction is significant. The jury could have credited E.C.'s testimony that she never consented to Bilek using his phone to photograph or videotape her, while at the same time believing that she consented to Bilek viewing her body without the use of equipment based on her testimony that she voluntarily disrobed before performing oral sex on Bilek. Moreover, because subsection (4) was not charged, Bilek's defense strategy focused on disproving only the elements of subsection (1), specifically whether he used \"concealed or disguised\" equipment to commit the offense. And, because the jury was not instructed on a lesser included\n   offense under subsection (4), Bilek was not on notice that he needed to address whether E.C. consented to him viewing her body without the assistance of equipment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The challenged rule 404(b) evidence was limited to the officers' testimony that they were conducting a routine probation check when they found E.C. in Bilek's motel room. During his opening statement and closing argument, the prosecutor also briefly mentioned that Bilek was on probation. The district court did not admit evidence that Bilek was on probation for the crime of felony kidnapping or evidence of the facts giving rise to his prior conviction. And when the jury asked about Bilek's probation, the district court properly instructed the jurors that they were not to consider his probation status in their deliberations. We presume the jury followed such instructions and did not consider Bilek's probation status in reaching its verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State's evidence included testimony from E.C. that she had no money to purchase drugs for herself when Bilek bailed her out of jail, that he supplied narcotics for her use, and that she spent days in his motel room using drugs with him. The State also introduced testimony of the probation officers and photographs of the drug paraphernalia and drugs they recovered from Bilek's motel room. And, to support the defense theory that E.C. consented to being photographed and video recorded, Bilek argued that his relationship with E.C. involved providing drugs in exchange for sexual acts and explicit photographs. In closing argument, Bilek's defense counsel expressly argued that E.C. \"had consented to injecting [Bilek] in the penis with this drug,\" that Bilek and E.C. \"had a prostitute-client relationship,\" and that E.C. and Bilek were \"in [the hotel room] doing drugs.\" In fact, defense counsel made no argument at closing for acquittal on the drug charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 38 In sum, the evidence admitted at trial supporting Bilek's drug distribution and possession of drug paraphernalia convictions was overwhelming. Bilek's own defense counsel acknowledged and argued that he had used narcotics with E.C. over the course of their stay in his motel room. Thus, without deciding whether the rule 404(b) evidence was properly admitted, \"we agree with the State that any error in admitting the evidence was harmless under the facts of this case.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calvert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347345\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/407/1098/\">\n    2017 UT App 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347345\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/407/1098/\">\n    407 P.3d 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   B. Self-Representation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 39 Finally, Bilek contends that the district court violated his right to self-representation when it denied his midtrial request to \"fire\" his attorney and represent himself.
