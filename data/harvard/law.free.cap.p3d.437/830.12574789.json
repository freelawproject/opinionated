Further, Ms. Sheesley's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Scadden\n   </em>\n   suffers the same flaw as did her federal constitutional argument: it fails to account for sexual relationships between individuals in circumstances where consent is in doubt. In fact,\n   <em>\n    Scadden\n   </em>\n   involved individuals situated in such a relationship-an adult coach and his underage student athlete-and we concluded the \"appellant's due-process argument [did] not apply.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11312036\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/732/1036/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11312036\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/732/1036/\">\n    at 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ms. Sheesley offers no argument why we should now hold the Wyoming Constitution independently protects the right she asserts when we had that opportunity in\n   <em>\n    Scadden\n   </em>\n   and did not do so. In sum, Ms. Sheesley has not provided \"well founded legal reasons\" justifying resort to independent state grounds, and we will not consider the reach of substantive due process under the Wyoming Constitution any further here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b617] Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-304\">\n     Wyo.
