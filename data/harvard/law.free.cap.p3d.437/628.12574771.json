Marquina now appeals that conviction, contending that he is entitled to a new trial because at least one juror may have slept through a portion of his trial. Marquina also contends that his conviction should be vacated because there was insufficient evidence to place him at the scene of the crime. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Crime\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 A few minutes after returning home from an evening out, Victim and his wife (Wife) heard a ring of the doorbell and a knock on the door. Victim opened the door and saw a man on his porch with a blue and white-streaked mask covering his face.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   man was about 5'5? tall and of average build. He said something that Victim could not understand and then \"immediately started pulling\" the trigger of his gun. Victim was shot five times in the neck and face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Wife, who was upstairs during the attack, heard three gun shots and rushed to the top of the stairs where she had a view of the front door. She saw \"an arm with a dark-colored covering\" and a gloved hand holding a gun. Still from her vantage point, Wife saw Victim fall to the floor and gurgle \"lots of blood\" as he tried to yell for her. Wife called the police and, after they arrived, Victim was taken to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Neighbors also heard the gunshots. One neighbor looked through his window and saw two persons wearing black hoodies running away. Another neighbor ran out of her house in an attempt to see the shooter. She did not see anyone but, upon approaching Victim's house, stumbled on a black mask in Victim's driveway. Police later recovered the mask and sent it to the crime lab for DNA testing. That testing led the police to a local drug dealer (Dealer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    The Three Accomplices\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Shortly before the shooting, Dealer decided to rob someone because he needed money to pay his rent. He had heard from several of his customers that Victim kept a lot of cash in his van and would be a good target. With help from his girlfriend (Girlfriend), Dealer made a plan to rob Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Dealer then told his occasional chauffer (Driver) that he \"had something [he] needed him to do.\" Driver was a drug addict who received free drugs from Dealer. He went along with Dealer and Girlfriend on the night of the robbery because Dealer, who \"can't see well at night,\" needed someone to drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 After a police investigation, Dealer, Girlfriend, and Driver admitted their involvement in the aggravated robbery of Victim. And all three placed Marquina at the scene of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Marquina, who was a member of the same gang as Dealer, had joined Dealer and Girlfriend at Dealer's apartment on the day of the robbery. While at the apartment, Dealer asked Marquina \"if he wanted to go do some dirt with [him] real quick,\" and Marquina said he did.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Dealer, Girlfriend, Driver, and Marquina then got into Dealer's car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dealer drove and placed a gun between the driver's seat and the emergency brake. Because they did not know where Victim lived, Girlfriend tried searching the internet to find his address. Her search initially led them to the wrong neighborhood, but they eventually found Victim's house with Victim's van parked outside. They drove around the neighborhood \"for what seemed like forever\" until Girlfriend asked Dealer, \"Are you going to do this or not?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 Dealer and Marquina eventually got out of the car, while Driver took the driver's seat and circled the car around the block. Both Dealer and Marquina wore black hoodies, and Dealer brought two masks-one black and one blue with white streaks. Marquina put on the blue and white-streaked mask, but Dealer was unable to get his black mask on and threw it back toward his car. On the way to Victim's front door, Dealer got nervous and sent Marquina to the door alone. Marquina rang the doorbell and knocked. When Victim answered, Marquina shot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Marquina and Dealer then ran up Victim's street until they spotted Dealer's car. They yelled for Driver to stop and got in the backseat. Driver then drove straight back to Dealer's apartment. Once there, Marquina went his own way. Girlfriend phoned Marquina repeatedly that night to \"see if he was okay,\" but Marquina never answered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 A few weeks later, after the police had questioned Dealer, Girlfriend, and Driver, each of whom implicated Marquina in the shooting, Marquina was arrested. Marquina's driver license listed him as 5'6? and 120 pounds. Shortly after Marquina's arrest, the police conducted a photo array identification with Victim, who survived the shooting. Marquina's photograph was in the array, but Victim identified someone else as the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    The Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 The State charged Marquina with one count of aggravated robbery, which included a group enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dealer, Girlfriend, and Driver each testified at Marquina's trial. Dealer had pled guilty to the aggravated robbery and agreed to testify even though it was \"going to make [his life in prison] worse.\" He did not expect to receive \"any benefit whatsoever\" for testifying. Girlfriend pled guilty to obstruction of justice, but in exchange for her testimony against Marquina, she was placed on probation in lieu of incarceration. Driver also struck a deal that, in exchange for his testimony, he would be placed on probation for robbery and would enter a rehabilitation program. Although all three of their accounts varied in some particulars, each witness placed Marquina at the scene of the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 The trial lasted three days. On the second and third days, the prosecutors mentioned a sleepy juror. The first time, defense counsel was in the middle of cross-examining one of the detectives on the case when one prosecutor noticed a juror \"nodding off.\" The prosecutor asked for a break so the jurors could stretch, and the court agreed to take a fifteen-minute recess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 The second time, after reading the jury instructions, the court discussed with counsel its intention to make the last-selected juror the alternate unless the parties agreed on someone else. In response, a second prosecutor noted that \"we do have someone who has been sleeping through part or-not all but part of the testimony\" and reasoned that, because closing arguments were likely to be lengthy, it would \"probably [be] safer to use the alternate ... as an actual juror.\" The prosecutor further explained that the juror \"has been dozing off here now, but there have been moments when he has been seemingly out.\" Defense counsel stated he \"ha[d] not noticed any of the jurors sleeping,\" but that he \"ha[d not] really been focusing on them.\" Defense counsel went on to refer to a judge who \"is often mistaken by many counsel to be sound asleep ... when the truth of the matter is he is just resting his eyes,\" and that counsel will realize that \"not only has he been listening but he has been processing everything in a very high way.\" The court then observed that \"everyone tried to stay awake\" and, with no objection from counsel, left the jury as it was. The court also invited counsel to alert the court if they \"change[d] [their] mind[s] after closing\" and stated, \"We will be looking at [the jury] this time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Neither side raised further concerns after closing argument. The alternate juror was excused and the jury retired to deliberate. The jury unanimously found Marquina guilty of aggravated robbery, and Marquina appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Marquina raises two issues on appeal. First, he contends that his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury was violated because at least one juror reportedly slept during his trial. Normally, \"[c]onstitutional issues are questions of law that we review for correctness,\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Norcutt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8407727\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/139/1066/\">\n    2006 UT App 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8407727\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/139/1066/\">\n    139 P.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but unpreserved constitutional issues, as Marquina concedes this is, are reviewed \"under the ineffective assistance of counsel and plain error doctrines,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Bond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6831696\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/361/104/\">\n    2015 UT 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6831696\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/361/104/\">\n    361 P.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 Second, Marquina contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for aggravated robbery. \"When a defendant challenges a jury verdict\n   for insufficiency of the evidence, we review the evidence and all inferences which may be reasonably drawn from it in the light most favorable to the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Sixth Amendment Jury Right\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants \"the right to ... an impartial jury.\" U.S. Const. amend. VI. Marquina contends that he was denied this right when a juror reportedly fell asleep during the trial. In support, he argues that the trial court had a duty to conduct voir dire\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the allegedly sleepy juror to ensure the juror had not missed important testimony. He also argues that his defense counsel was constitutionally ineffective when he failed to insist that the court conduct voir dire or, if necessary, replace the sleepy juror with the alternate juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 As noted above, Marquina concedes that this constitutional issue has not been preserved for appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2076\">\n    2017 UT 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567068\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/443/\">\n    416 P.3d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A failure to preserve an issue in the trial court generally precludes a party from arguing that issue in an appellate court, absent a valid exception.\"). Marquina nevertheless urges us to review it under the plain error and ineffective assistance of counsel exceptions to the preservation rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Ison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8419463\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/135/864/\">\n    2006 UT 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8419463\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/135/864/\">\n    135 P.3d 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ineffective assistance exception);\n   <em>\n    State v.

But before we reach those arguments, we must address whether Marquina invited the error he now complains of by allegedly resisting the replacement of the sleepy juror with the alternate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8991614\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/128/1171/\">\n    2006 UT 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8991614\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/128/1171/\">\n    128 P.3d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the invited error doctrine forecloses even plain error review). Concluding that the invited error doctrine does not apply in this case, we then turn to the plain error argument regarding the trial court's alleged failure to conduct voir dire of the sleepy juror and then the ineffective assistance argument regarding defense counsel's alleged failure to insist on replacing the juror with the alternate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Invited Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b621 The State asserts that Marquina's defense counsel invited any error regarding the sleepy juror by resisting the prosecutor's suggestion that the sleepy juror be replaced with the alternate. By rejecting the prosecutor's suggestion, and even disputing \"the prosecutor's observation that the juror had slept through 'part of the testimony,' \" the State maintains that defense counsel \"led the court to believe there would be no reason to question the juror.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b622 The \"invited error doctrine arises from the principle that a party cannot take advantage of an error committed at trial when that party led the trial court into committing the error.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Winfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8991614\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/128/1171/\">\n    2006 UT 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8991614\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/128/1171/\">\n    128 P.3d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).

In\n   <em>\n    McNeil\n   </em>\n   , the State argued that trial counsel for the defendant had invited error not through \"affirmative representation\" but through \"affirmative acquiescence\" by failing to make a proper objection to the admission of hearsay\n   evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21 (quotation simplified). The supreme court was unpersuaded by this argument \"because an error of this sort ... is not invited but merely unpreserved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. It accordingly \"reject[ed] [the State's] broad definition of invited error\" and reviewed the defendant's claim for plain error.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 24 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

After the prosecutor alerted the court that \"someone ... ha[d] been sleeping through part ... of the testimony,\" defense counsel responded by saying that he \"ha[d] not noticed any of the jurors sleeping,\" but that he \"ha[d not] really been focusing on them.\" Counsel went on to explain the difficulty in knowing whether someone really was sleeping and pointed to the possibility that someone might just be \"resting [his or her] eyes\" but still \"processing everything in a very high way.\" The court then decided to keep the jury as it was but to keep an eye on the jurors. It also informed counsel that if they changed their minds, they could revisit the issue. From the record it is clear that defense counsel did not affirmatively tell the court to either forgo voir dire or to not replace the juror with the alternate. And although the court told counsel they could change their minds, defense counsel's failure to thereafter request an alternate juror does not make the error here \"invited but merely unpreserved.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McNeil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6828567\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/365/699/\">\n    2016 UT 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6828567\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/365/699/\">\n    365 P.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b625 To be sure, the State characterizes defense counsel's response here as an affirmative representation and not merely acquiescence. For example, it asserts that counsel \"openly resisted the prosecutor's request\" to substitute the alternate juror for the sleepy juror and that he \"clearly indicated that he did not want the allegedly sleepy juror relegated to alternate status.\" We disagree with these characterizations. Although it is true that defense counsel did not ask for the juror to be questioned, and instead suggested an alternative to the prosecutor's theory that the juror was asleep, he did not affirmatively state that the court should not conduct voir dire of the sleepy juror or replace him. Thus, his statements do not \"reveal[ ] that [he] independently made a clear affirmative representation of the erroneous principle.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. In short, on these facts, we do not think Marquina's defense counsel invited the error. We therefore proceed to analyze the sleeping juror issue for plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   B. Plain Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b626 Marquina contends that the trial court committed plain error, arguing that \"the trial court failed to properly voir dire the sleeping juror after receiving two reliable reports that a juror was sleeping during a portion of the trial.\" He also asserts that this error was obvious because Utah case law establishes \"the need for a trial judge to assess the jurors' ability to deliberate and decide a case\" and \"[c]ase law across the nation\" establishes that \"a trial judge [must] do a proper voir dire of a juror after receiving a reliable report that a juror has been sleeping.\" Finally, he asserts that the error was prejudicial because \"a fully awake juror would ... have recognized the problems\" in the State's case and may have helped acquit him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627 We invoke the plain error exception to the preservation requirement \"sparingly.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
