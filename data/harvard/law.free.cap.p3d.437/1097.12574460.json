On defendant's petition, we allowed review, and, for the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals decision, reverse the trial court's judgment in part, and remand the case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. HISTORICAL AND PROCEDURAL FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Acting as the personal representative of his father's estate, plaintiff brought this medical negligence action against defendants Providence and Apogee. Plaintiff asserted that defendants were negligent in their care of plaintiff's father, Sloan, because they failed to diagnose and treat Sloan's rib fractures and internal bleeding. On November 3, Sloan, who was 85 years old, came to Providence's hospital after falling at home and was initially treated by Providence's emergency department personnel. He was later admitted to the hospital, where he was treated by Apogee's doctors. On November 7, Apogee's doctors discharged Sloan to a skilled nursing facility, Three Fountains. On November 17, Sloan's condition worsened significantly. His blood oxygen saturation levels dropped and his breathing became rapid and shallow. A nurse practitioner at Three Fountains believed that something was happening with Sloan's lungs and suspected he might have pneumonia. Sloan's condition continued to worsen over the next two days, and, on November 19, Three Fountains returned Sloan to the hospital. At the hospital, Sloan was found to have multiple displaced rib fractures and bleeding in his right chest cavity, which had caused his right lung to collapse. Later that same day, Sloan died of respiratory failure due to the bleeding in his chest cavity and the collapse of his lung.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, plaintiff brought this medical negligence action against defendants. At trial, plaintiff's theory was that, when Sloan first came to the hospital, he had\n   fractured ribs that were causing bleeding into his chest cavity and that Providence and Apogee's doctors failed to diagnose and treat those problems, which continued and eventually led to Sloan's death. Plaintiff did not make any claims against Three Fountains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Providence and Apogee did not dispute the medical cause of Sloan's death, but they did dispute that Sloan had displaced fractured ribs and internal bleeding during his first stay at the hospital. They suggested that \"something happened\" while Sloan was at Three Fountains that caused Sloan's death. Providence and Apogee did not identity a particular cause and did not assert that Three Fountains was negligent. But they presented evidence suggesting that Sloan's ribs could have fractured-or, if any of them were already fractured, the fractures could have been displaced-by Sloan's own movements while at Three Fountains or by actions\n   or omissions by Three Fountains. In support of that theory, Providence and Apogee presented testimony from medical experts. One expert testified that rib fractures can be displaced \"just in the course of breathing, rolling around, getting in and out of bed.\" Another suggested that Sloan's rib fractures could have been displaced during physical therapy at Three Fountains. Providence and Apogee also presented evidence that, although Three Fountains knew that Sloan was a high fall risk, Sloan was not always assisted when walking. In addition, the nurse practitioner from Three Fountains testified that no one at Three Fountains was aware that Sloan had fractured ribs, but that she would want to know if a patient had fractured ribs because that patient would be at risk of bleeding into his chest cavity or puncturing a lung.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because Providence and Apogee's theory raised the possibility that Sloan's death was caused by something that happened at Three Fountains, plaintiff requested a jury instruction regarding a tortfeasor's liability for the subsequent conduct of a third party (the Liability for Subsequent Conduct Instruction). Similar to Uniform Civil Jury Instruction 20.07, plaintiff's requested instruction stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"If you find the defendant was negligent and that such negligence caused injury to the plaintiff, the defendant\n   would also be liable for any additional injury caused by the subsequent conduct of another person or entity, even if such conduct was negligent or wrongful, as long as the subsequent conduct and risk of additional injury were reasonably foreseeable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff argued that, because defendants were implying that Three Fountains caused Sloan's death, the jury needed to know that, if Providence and Apogee were negligent, they could be liable for Sloan's death, even if Three Fountains' subsequent conduct contributed to the death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants objected to the instruction. Defense counsel read the instruction as applicable only if defendants were asserting that Three Fountains was negligent, and he asserted that defendants were \"not contending that anybody dropped the ball, necessarily.\" Defense counsel commented, \"I think that what we have is what historically has been thought of as [an] intervening superseding cause. And if that's the kind of instruction that needs to be given then so be it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court refused to give plaintiff's Liability for Subsequent Conduct Instruction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff expressly excepted to the trial court's refusal to give the instruction, asserting that he was entitled to it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"because of the suggestions by [defense counsel] and argument that something that happened over at the Three Fountains home is responsible for the death of Mr. Sloan as opposed to the acts of negligence that are set forth in Plaintiff's *** complaint.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As relevant to the issues on review, the trial court instructed the jury on negligence, reasonable foreseeability, causation, multiple causation, and two or more possible causes, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The law assumes that all persons have obeyed the law and have been free from negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"To recover, the plaintiff must prove two things by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) that the defendants were negligent in at least one of the ways claimed in the plaintiff's complaint; and (2) that the defendants' negligence was a cause of damage to the plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"* * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"A person is liable only for the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his or her actions. There are two things that must be foreseeable. First, the plaintiff must be within the general class of persons that one reasonably would anticipate might be threatened by the defendant's conduct. Second, the harm suffered must be within the general class of harms that one reasonably would anticipate might result from the defendant's conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"A cause is defined as an act or omission that is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm. A substantial factor is an important or material factor and not one that is insignificant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Many factors or things may operate either independently or together to cause harm. In such a case, each may be a cause of the harm even though the others by themselves would have been sufficient to cause the same harm. If you find that the defendant's act or omission was a substantial factor in causing the harm to the plaintiff, you may find that the defendant's conduct caused the harm even though it was not the only cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Where there are two or more possible causes for an injury for one or more of which a defendant is not responsible, there can be no recovery unless it is shown that as between the causes in question, the cause for which a defendant is responsible is the more probable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"If the evidence leaves it as probable that the injury was a result of one cause as much as another, then the plaintiff cannot recover from that defendant.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The jury found that Providence was not negligent. It found that Apogee was negligent, but not the cause of Sloan's death. After the verdict, plaintiff moved for a new trial, asserting, among other things, that the trial court had erred by refusing to give the Liability for Subsequent Conduct Instruction. The trial court denied the motion, and plaintiff appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff assigned error to the trial court's refusal to give the instruction and its denial of his motion for a new trial. The Court of Appeals concluded that the instruction was a correct statement of the law, was supported by the evidence, and, in light of the parties' competing theories of the case, was necessary to avoid jury confusion.\n   <em>\n    Sloan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412093\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/301/\">\n    282 Or.

Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412093\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/301/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412093\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/301/\">\n    at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412093\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/301/\">\n    386 P.3d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On Apogee's petition, this court allowed review to address whether the trial court erred in refusing to give the Liability for Subsequent Conduct Instruction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II. ARGUMENTS ON REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On review, Apogee makes three arguments. First, Apogee argues that the Court of Appeals \"erroneously applied the foreseeability principles\" set forth in\n   <em>\n    Fazzolari v. Portland School Dist. No. 1J\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175421\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/303/1/\">\n    303 Or. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175421\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/303/1/\">\n    734 P.2d 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), \"in making its decision in this case.\" According to Apogee, \"long-held Oregon precedent dictates that the\n   <em>\n    Fazzolari\n   </em>\n   foreseeability principles are not applicable in a case such as this one, that is based on a special relationship,\" specifically, the physician-patient relationship. Second, Apogee argues that the Court of Appeals \"erroneously held that plaintiff's proposed instruction sets forth a correct statement of law.\" In Apogee's view, the instruction was incorrect, because it would \"hold the original tortfeasor liable for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   injuries the plaintiff might suffer while undergoing medical treatment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Emphasis in original.) Third, Apogee argues that, even if the trial court erred in refusing to give the instruction, the error did not substantially affect plaintiff's rights because \"the jury was instructed on how to decide the case if they found there was more than one cause of [Sloan's] death,\" and, therefore, \"the trial court's refusal to give plaintiff's requested instruction would not\n   likely have affected the verdict.\" We address those three arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Relevance of Reasonable Foreseeability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Apogee asserts that the Court of Appeals \"erroneously based [its] analysis upon the law applicable to ordinary common law negligence claims, which require application of the\n   <em>\n    Fazzolari\n   </em>\n   foreseeability analysis to determine liability.\" Apogee does not identify a particular holding as error. Instead, it asserts that the Court of Appeals\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"cited foreseeability as central to its analysis of whether the subject instruction was a correct statement of law, whether it was supported by evidence, and whether the failure to give the instruction substantially affected plaintiff's rights. Thus, this improper application of the Fazzolari foreseeability analysis significantly affected the court's analysis of the determinative issues in this case, and resulted in an erroneous decision.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As we understand it, Apogee's argument is that foreseeability plays no role in medical negligence cases. That is incorrect. As explained below, in medical negligence cases, reasonable foreseeability serves as a limit on the scope of a defendant's liability. We do not understand Apogee to argue that there is no such limit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, contrary to Apogee's argument on review, neither\n   <em>\n    Fazzolari\n   </em>\n   nor the cases that predate it suggest that reasonable foreseeability principles \"are not applicable in determining liability for medical malpractice based on a physician-patient relationship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   1. Fazzolari\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Traditionally, to prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff had to prove that (1) the defendant had a duty to the plaintiff, (2) the defendant breached the duty, (3) the breach was a factual cause and (4) a legal cause (or proximate cause) of (5) harm to the plaintiff measurable in damages.\n   <em>\n    Aiken v. Shell Oil Co. et al. and Huey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4915202\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/219/523/#p535\">\n    219 Or. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535-36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4915202\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/219/523/#p535\">\n    348 P.2d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959) (\"One of the old and simple definitions of negligence is: 'There must be a duty on the defendant; a failure to perform that duty; and the failure to perform that duty must be the proximate cause of injury and damage to the plaintiff.' \"). But, in\n   <em>\n    Fazzolari\n   </em>\n   , this court reformulated the elements for an ordinary negligence claim, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"[U]nless the parties invoke a status, a relationship, or a particular standard of conduct that creates, defines, or limits the defendant's duty, the issue of liability for harm actually resulting from defendant's conduct properly depends on whether that conduct unreasonably created a foreseeable risk to a protected interest of the kind of harm that befell the plaintiff.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Fazzolari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175421\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/303/1/\">\n    303 Or. at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175421\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/303/1/\">\n    734 P.2d 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, when asserting an ordinary negligence claim, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant's conduct created a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of legally cognizable harm to the plaintiff and that the conduct in fact caused that kind of harm to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In ordinary negligence claims, foreseeability plays a role in determining whether a defendant's conduct is negligent (in other words, in setting a defendant's standard of care) and whether a defendant should be liable for particular consequences of their negligent conduct (in other words, establishing the scope of a defendant's liability). As this court explained in\n   <em>\n    Piazza v. Kellim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185838\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/58/#p70\">\n    360 Or. 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 70,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185838\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/58/#p70\">\n    377 P.3d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016),\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"Foreseeability plays a role in at least two overlapping common-law negligence determinations: (1) whether the defendant's conduct unreasonably created a foreseeable risk of harm to a protected interest of the plaintiff such that the defendant may be held liable for that conduct-formerly described in terms of 'duty' and 'breach' as measures of negligent conduct; and (2) whether, because the\n   risk of harm was reasonably foreseeable, the defendant may be held liable to the plaintiff for the particular\n   harm that befell the plaintiff-a concept that traditionally was referred to as 'proximate' cause and which, in our current analytical framework, operates as a legal limit on the scope of a defendant's liability for negligent conduct.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fazzolari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175421\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/303/1/\">\n    303 Or. at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175421\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/303/1/\">\n    734 P.2d 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Stewart v.

Foreseeability can limit a defendant's liability, even in special relationship cases, including medical negligence actions.

As mentioned, Apogee asserts that the instruction would \"hold the original tortfeasor liable for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   injuries the plaintiff might suffer while undergoing medical treatment.\" (Emphasis in original.) According to Apogee, \"the requested instruction states that defendant would be liable for '\n   <em>\n    any additional injury\n   </em>\n   caused by the subsequent conduct of' the third party.\" (Emphasis in original.) That is incorrect. Again, plaintiff's requested instruction, which is similar to UCJI 20.07, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"If you find the defendant was negligent and that such negligence caused injury to the plaintiff, the defendant would also be liable for any additional injury caused by the subsequent conduct of another person or entity, even if such conduct was negligent or wrongful, as long as the subsequent conduct and risk of additional injury were reasonably foreseeable.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The instruction does not hold an original tortfeasor liable for all injuries that a plaintiff might suffer after being injured by the tortfeasor, or even all injuries that a plaintiff might suffer while undergoing medical treatment for the injuries caused by the tortfeasor. The text of the instruction expressly limits the original tortfeasor's liability by providing that the tortfeasor is liable for additional injuries caused by the subsequent conduct of another \"\n   <em>\n    as long as\n   </em>\n   the subsequent conduct and risk of additional injury were reasonably foreseeable.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Apogee also argues that an original tortfeasor's liability for injuries caused by the subsequent conduct of a medical provider has a special limitation.

Specifically, in holding that the trial court had not erred in refusing to give the defendant's requested instructions regarding intervening forces and superseding causes, this court stated that the defendant's instructions were \"incomplete\" because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \"they would not have informed the jury of the important qualification *** that 'where the negligent conduct of the actor (defendant) creates or increases the foreseeable risk of harm through the intervention of another force, and is a substantial factor in causing this harm, such intervention is not a superseding cause.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2128649\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/268/233/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2128649\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/268/233/\">\n    at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2128649\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/268/233/\">\n    520 P.2d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Woosley\n   </em>\n   supports the view that an original tortfeasor is liable for the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his initial injuries to a plaintiff, and those consequences can include, but are not limited to, additional injuries caused by a physician's conduct in diagnosing or treating the initial injuries.

In\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff brought an action against the defendant, seeking damages for injuries suffered in a car accident. As part of the discovery process in that case, the defendant arranged to have the plaintiff examined by a doctor that the defendant had selected. During that examination, the doctor injured the plaintiff's knee, which had not been injured in the car accident. The plaintiff then amended his complaint against the defendant to include an allegation regarding the knee injury. The trial court struck the allegation, apparently on the ground that\n   \"as a matter of law, the knee injury was not sufficiently related to the original accident for defendant to be responsible for it.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4394028\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/84/7/\">\n    84 Or.

Or, in\n   <em>\n    Fazzolari\n   </em>\n   terms, the further injury would not be reasonably foreseeable and, therefore, would be outside the scope of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Here, we do not think that the facts alleged are, as a matter of law, outside the scope of liability. Plaintiff's theory of the case was that Apogee failed to diagnose and treat Sloan's fractured ribs and internal bleeding. As this court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   , in which it held that a hospital's liability for its x-ray technicians' failure to get clear x-rays could extend to injuries caused by a doctor's later actions based on the x-rays, if a medical care provider negligently fails to provide information to a subsequent medical care provider, the first provider can be liable for injuries caused by the second provider's actions, if both the second provider's actions and the resulting injuries were reasonably foreseeable consequences of the first provider's negligence.\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   does not alter that rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In sum, Apogee's second argument-that plaintiff's requested instruction is not a correct statement of law-is unavailing. Contrary to Apogee's assertion, the instruction does not provide that an original tortfeasor is liable for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   additional injury caused by the subsequent conduct of a third party. Instead, it limits an original tortfeasor's liability to reasonably foreseeable subsequent conduct and injuries, which is consistent with this court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Woosley\n   </em>\n   and the Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Effect of the Refusal to Give the Requested Instruction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Apogee's third and final argument is that, even if the trial court erred in refusing to give plaintiff's Liability for Subsequent Conduct Instruction, the error did not substantially affect plaintiff's rights and, therefore, does not require reversal. ORS 19.415(2) (\"No judgment shall be reversed or modified except for error substantially affecting the rights of a party.\"). Specifically, Apogee argues that the trial court's failure to give the instruction did not\n   substantially affect plaintiff's rights because, although the jury found that Apogee was negligent, the jury also found that Apogee's negligence did not cause Sloan's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   When determining whether a trial court's refusal to give a party's requested instruction substantially affected the party's rights, this court considers the instructions as a whole and in light of parties' theories and evidence.\n   <em>\n    Purdy v.

If there is \"some likelihood that the jury reached a legally erroneous result\" because of the trial court's refusal to give the party's requested instruction, then the refusal substantially affected the party's rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881848\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/355/204/#p227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881848\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/355/204/#p227\">\n    at 231-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881848\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/355/204/#p227\">\n    324 P.3d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As described above, Apogee's theory at trial was that Sloan's death was caused by something that happened after Sloan left its care and went to Three Fountains. Apogee did not specify a particular cause, but it presented evidence suggesting that Sloan's displaced rib fractures and internal bleeding could have been caused by ordinary movements, physical therapy, or a fall. Apogee's evidence raised the possibility that Sloan himself could have caused the displacement and bleeding by breathing, rolling, getting in and out of bed, or falling. It also raised the possibility that Three Fountains could have caused the displacement and bleeding through its actions (in physical therapy) or its inactions (in failing to supervise Sloan's movements, if Sloan fell at Three Fountains). In addition, Apogee presented evidence that Sloan's condition deteriorated for two days at Three Fountains, before Three Fountains returned Sloan to the hospital, thereby raising the possibility that Three Fountains caused Sloan's death by failing to respond promptly. In short, Apogee's defense was that someone else's subsequent conduct caused Sloan's death. Given Apogee's theory and evidence, it was important for the jury to be instructed on the law governing a defendant's liability for the injuries caused by another's subsequent\n   conduct, which is exactly what plaintiff's requested instruction did. Without the requested instruction, the jury may not have understood that Apogee could be responsible for the consequences of another's subsequent conduct, which was a key issue in the case.\n   In arguing that the trial court's failure to give plaintiff's requested instruction did not substantially affect plaintiff's rights, Apogee points out that the jury found that, although Apogee was negligent, its negligence did not cause Sloan's death. The problem with that argument is that, in order to determine whether Apogee caused Sloan's death, the jury needed to know that Apogee could be responsible for the subsequent conduct of another. Without the requested instruction, that would not have been clear to the jury. Furthermore, Apogee requested, and the trial court gave, an instruction that provided that, when there are two or more possible causes, the jury must determine the causes for which a defendant is responsible for and then determine whether those causes are more probable than other possible causes. Specifically, as quoted above, the trial court instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \"Where there are two or more possible causes for an injury for one or more of which a defendant is not responsible, there can be no recovery unless it is shown that as between the causes in question, the cause for which a defendant is responsible is the more probable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \"If the evidence leaves it as probable that the injury was a result of one cause as much as another, then the plaintiff cannot recover from that defendant.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   That instruction would have encouraged the jury to identify possible causes, determine who was responsible for each of them, and then determine which cause was the more probable. Because the jury was not specifically instructed that Apogee could be responsible for the subsequent conduct of another, it could have erred in determining the causes for which Apogee could be responsible, and that error could have affected its determination of whether Apogee was liable for causing Sloan's death. Consequently, we conclude that-in light of Apogee's theory and evidence and the instruction it requested regarding two or more possible causes-there is some likelihood that the trial court's refusal to give plaintiff's requested instruction caused the jury to base its verdict on an incomplete understanding of the relevant law and to reach a legally erroneous result. Therefore, we must reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   To summarize, we hold that, contrary to Apogee's arguments on review, (1) the Court of Appeals did not err in applying foreseeability principles because reasonable foreseeability limits liability in medical negligence cases, (2) plaintiff's requested jury instruction regarding an original tortfeasor's liability for the subsequent conduct of another was a correct statement of the law because an original tortfeasor is liable for the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his conduct, including reasonably foreseeable conduct and injuries by subsequent medical providers, and (3) the trial court's failure to give plaintiff's requested instruction requires reversal because, given how the case was litigated and the instructions the jury received, the jury could have based its verdict on an incorrect understanding of the relevant law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. The judgment of the circuit court for defendant Apogee is reversed and remanded; the circuit court judgment is otherwise affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Uniform Civil Jury Instruction 20.07, \"Liability for Subsequent Conduct of Third Party,\" provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    \"If you find that the defendant's conduct was negligent and caused some injury to the plaintiff, then the defendant is liable for any reasonably foreseeable additional injury to the plaintiff.
