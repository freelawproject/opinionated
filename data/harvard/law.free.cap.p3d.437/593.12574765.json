We vacate the district court's rulings and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Bonnie Silva and David Silva divorced in 2010. The marital estate included interests in fifteen parcels of real property-four properties held jointly, one property held by David, and ten properties held by Bonnie.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The decree allocated the properties and ordered the parties to execute quitclaim deeds within thirty days, conveying their interests in the properties to one another as specified in the decree. If either party failed to execute a quitclaim deed, the divorce decree authorized the other party to seek a court order to transfer title. One of the properties awarded to David was a residential property located on Dennis Drive in West Valley City, Utah (the Dennis Drive Property).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In June 2010, pursuant to the divorce decree, Bonnie executed a quitclaim deed as \"Grantor Bonnie Moore, now known as Bonnie Silva,\" purportedly conveying the Dennis Drive Property to David. But when David attempted to record the deed, he discovered that \"Bonnie Moore[,] as Trustee for the Consolidated Trust,\" actually held title to the Dennis Drive Property. He further discovered that one week before he had filed for divorce in September 2008, Bonnie had conveyed the Dennis Drive Property and other properties then in her name to herself and her daughters, K.V. Lum and R. Carter, as trustees of a trust known as the Consolidated Trust. After learning these facts, David sent a revised quitclaim deed to Bonnie, but she did not sign and return it as requested. Several months later, Bonnie, as a trustee of the Consolidated Trust, again conveyed the Dennis Drive Property and other properties to Lum, as trustee of the Consolidated Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In October 2010, David filed a Motion for Contempt with the district court. Because he claimed he could not locate Bonnie, David filed a Motion for Alternative Service, which the court granted. The district court held an evidentiary hearing and entered a default judgment finding Bonnie in contempt for failing to convey the Dennis Drive Property to David. However, the court left open a window during which Bonnie could cure the contempt. If Bonnie did not convey the Dennis Drive Property to David within thirty days, the court would enter a $219,000 judgment against her. Bonnie did not convey the property to David during this time. A few months later, Lum, as a trustee of the Consolidated Trust, conveyed title to the Dennis Drive Property to Carter, as a trustee of the Consolidated Trust. The district court then entered a contempt judgment against Bonnie, reducing slightly the $219,000 by amounts David owed to Bonnie under the divorce decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The following month, David instituted this action against Bonnie and her daughters alleging fraudulent conveyance and seeking to quiet title to the Dennis Drive Property. David filed a motion for alternative service recounting his prior unsuccessful efforts to serve Bonnie. David asserted that the process server had attempted personal service at Bonnie's last known address four separate times. The district court ordered alternative service by publication, which David accomplished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Bonnie did not answer the complaint. The district court clerk consequently entered a default certificate against Bonnie, and the court ordered an evidentiary hearing on damages. Concerned that Bonnie may have received inadequate notice of the hearing, the district court rescheduled the hearing and required additional service on Bonnie. David attempted service by mailing copies of the notice of hearing to what David claimed was Bonnie's last known address by both regular and certified mail. David also attempted personal service whereby the process server left the notice at Bonnie's last known residence on three separate occasions. David then completed service by publication again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Bonnie did not appear at the hearing on damages. In its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the district court concluded that \"Service of Process of the Complaint and notice of the evidentiary hearing on damages were in accordance with the Rules of the Court, the Statutes of Utah, and the Constitutional requirements of due process.\" The district court also determined that Bonnie\n   had fraudulently conveyed the Dennis Drive Property and her other properties to the Consolidated Trust. Accordingly, the district court ruled that the contempt judgment entered in the divorce action attached to the properties, that Bonnie and her daughters were enjoined from transferring or encumbering the properties, and that David \"may levy execution on the properties ... and sell the amount of the property necessary to satisfy the judgment.\" Finally, the district court awarded attorney fees and costs to David. The district court thus entered default judgment against Bonnie in the amount of the contempt judgment, now attached to Bonnie's properties. The court also awarded costs and attorney fees totaling nearly $50,000. The district court clerk subsequently issued a writ of execution on three of Bonnie's properties, including the Dennis Drive Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Later that month, Bonnie's counsel entered an appearance in the district court and filed a motion pursuant to rule 60(b)(1) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure seeking to set aside the default judgment on the basis of excusable neglect and to quash the writ of execution. The district court held a hearing, which Bonnie and her counsel attended. At that hearing, Bonnie maintained that the default judgment should be set aside on the ground of excusable neglect because she did not receive actual notice of the action and service was insufficient under the circumstances. Bonnie acknowledged that service complied with the law, but she argued that David knew where Bonnie was located and could easily have contacted her to give her actual notice of his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Bonnie filed an affidavit with her rule 60(b) motion and a second affidavit with her reply motion. In her first affidavit, Bonnie alleged that she had not received notice of the current action against her. She further alleged that she received a call from David notifying her that \"something was wrong with the quitclaim deed\" but that \"David never indicated to [her] in that telephone call that there was any court proceeding.\" In her second affidavit, Bonnie alleged that David knew of various means of contacting her, including her two email addresses or through their respective children and the renters of their properties. David did not refute these allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The district court denied Bonnie's motion to set aside based upon excusable neglect on the ground that \"service [of the notice] and the resulting default were appropriate.\" The court reached this conclusion, in part, because the court determined Bonnie provided no evidence-despite her two affidavits-supporting her assertions that David knew where Bonnie was located and that she did not receive actual notice of the proceedings. And although the court recited the law relative to excusable neglect, the court did not address excusable neglect in its analysis. Similarly, the court denied the motion to quash for Bonnie's failure to provide evidence of irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Four days later, the Dennis Drive Property and the other two properties subject to the writ of execution were sold at a sheriff's sale. Bonnie responded with a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), a motion to void the execution sale, and a motion to join the sale purchasers as parties to the action. After a hearing, the district court denied the TRO on the ground that Bonnie had failed to meet the required elements for relief. The court denied the motion to join the purchasers on the ground that \"[Bonnie] cites rules that apply before a judgment is made and are not applicable for a case as this one where judgment was entered.\" The court noted that \"even if there was no judgment in this case, there is no basis, claim, or cause of action asserted against the purchasers.\" The court denied the motion to void the execution sale on the ground that the court had already ruled at the TRO hearing that the notice of sale was properly served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Bonnie appealed the district court's denial of her motions to set aside the default judgment and the sheriff's sale, and the district court's award of attorney fees to David.

Instead, the court's analysis focused only on the propriety of its order authorizing alternative service. In its decision denying Bonnie's motion to set aside, the court observed that the court had approved the alternative service and that Bonnie's counsel had \"admitted at the hearing that service upon [her] was legally proper.\" On this basis, the district court concluded that \"service and the resulting default were appropriate.\" But the question before the court was not whether service or entry of default judgment was technically appropriate. Indeed, despite proper service and entry of an otherwise appropriate default judgment, parties under our rules are afforded an opportunity to set a judgment or final order aside. The correct inquiry, then, is whether Bonnie's lack of actual notice constitutes a reasonable justification to set aside the default \"under principles of fundamental fairness in light of the\n   particular facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996539\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/859/\">\n    2009 UT 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996539\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/859/\">\n    214 P.3d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the particular circumstances of service of process may shed light on whether Bonnie's failure to respond was reasonable and excusable, the district court failed to address this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 Bonnie argues that David had \"many means at his disposal to contact [her] to give notice that he was suing her, including calling and emailing her.\" Her affidavit alleges that he knew \"her two active email addresses, her telephone number, ... her children, and many other means he had after 13 years of marriage\" to contact her. If Bonnie's unrefuted allegations are to be believed, then David, contrary to his representations to the court when he filed his motion for alternative service, had the ability to contact Bonnie through means that would have been more likely to reach her. If this is the case, then there was likely \"reasonable justification\" for Bonnie's failure to answer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arbogast Family Trust\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8206913\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/191/39/\">\n    2008 UT App 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8206913\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/191/39/\">\n    191 P.3d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 The district court did not address whether these circumstances made Bonnie's failure to respond excusable. Rather, the court merely ended its inquiry upon determining that (1) the alternative service was adequate and (2) Bonnie admitted the technical legality of that service of process. Because this determination did not address Bonnie's excusable neglect argument, we vacate the district court's ruling and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II. Sheriff's Sale\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 Bonnie also challenges the district court's refusal to set aside the sheriff's sale of three of her properties to satisfy the judgment. A court \"may set aside a sheriff's sale where (1) a debtor's property is sold at a grossly inadequate price and (2) there were irregularities during the sale that contributed to the inadequacy of price or circumstances of unfairness during the redemption period caused by the conduct of the party benefitted by the sale.\"\n   <em>\n    Pyper v. Bond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987331\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/258/575/\">\n    2011 UT 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987331\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/258/575/\">\n    258 P.3d 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 Bonnie points to two irregularities in the sale that she believes justify setting it aside. First, she asserts that she and her attorney did not receive proper notice of the sale as outlined by rules 69B(b), 64(a)(10), and 5 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. Second, she points out that the sheriff's sale disposed of all three properties together rather than as separate parcels. She asserts that this is contrary to rule 69B(d), which directs, \"The property shall be sold in such parcels as are likely to bring the highest price. Severable lots of real property shall be sold separately.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 69B(d). Bonnie maintains that these irregularities contributed to a grossly inadequate sale price, pointing out that the Dennis Drive Property alone was valued at $219,000 at \"the bottom of the real estate depression in Utah,\" yet the Dennis Drive Property plus two other single family dwellings were sold together at auction for only $186,000 in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b622 In its ruling on Bonnie's motion to set aside the default judgment, the district court did not fully address her arguments. The ruling states simply that the court had \"already addressed at the previous hearings the issue of notice of the sale (not required to be served on counsel and notice of sale not done under Rule 5 ).\" From what we can glean from the record, this ruling seems to be based on the court's reading of rule 69B(b)(3), which states that \"[i]f the property is real property, the officer shall post written notice\" of the sale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987331\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/258/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 69B(b)(3). The district court appears to have taken this statement in the rule to mean that only posting of notice, rather than service on the defendant pursuant to rule 5, is required under 69B. But in examining the structure of rule 69B(b), this is not the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b623 The rule first states, \"The officer shall set the date, time and place for sale\n   <em>\n    and serve notice thereof on the defendant\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987331\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/258/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 69B(b) (emphasis added). The rule then goes on to state, \"The officer shall publish notice of the date, time and place of sale as follows ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987331\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/258/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rule 69B(b)(3), on which the district court appears to have relied for its determination that \"if it's real property ... [t]he manner [of service] is different,\" is only a subpart of subsection (b) and describes the manner in which notice is to be published with respect to real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It does not negate the requirement in the first sentence of subsection (b) regarding service upon the defendant. Rule 64(a)(10) defines \"serve\" for purposes of rule 69B as \"any method of service authorized by Rule 5,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987331\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/258/575/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 64(a)(10), and rule 5 requires service upon a party's attorney where the party is represented by counsel,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987331\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/258/575/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 5(b). Thus, the district court's determination that service upon Bonnie's attorney was not required was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b624 Nevertheless, the defect in service does not necessarily mean that the sheriff's sale should be set aside.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pyper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987331\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/258/575/\">\n    2011 UT 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987331\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/258/575/\">\n    258 P.3d 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a sheriff's sale may be set aside where the price is \"grossly inadequate\" and there are \"irregularities during the sale that contributed to the inadequacy of price or circumstances of unfairness\"). Further analysis is needed to make this determination. Because the district court erred in its determination regarding notice and did not fully address Bonnie's other arguments, we remand for the district court to address those arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   III. Attorney Fees on Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b625 Finally, both parties request an award of attorney fees incurred on appeal. Bonnie contends that \"[e]quity requires that [she] be granted her attorney's fees for having to make this appeal.\" David counters that even if Bonnie is \"able to prevail on appeal, [she] would not be entitled to [her] fees,\" because she was \"not awarded fees below.\" David also requests attorney fees on appeal because he was awarded fees in the default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b626 \"When a party is entitled to attorney fees below and prevails on appeal, that party is also entitled to fees reasonably incurred on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Jordan Constr., Inc. v. Federal Nat'l Mortgage Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12408260\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/408/296/\">\n    2017 UT 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 71,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12408260\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/408/296/\">\n    408 P.3d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). \"In Utah, attorney fees are awardable only if authorized by statute or by contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Further, neither party has made the required showing or otherwise persuaded us that equity requires an award of attorney fees. Accordingly, we decline to exercise our equitable power and deny each party's request for attorney fees incurred on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b628 We conclude that the district court did not address Bonnie's arguments for setting aside the default judgment and the sheriff's sale. Accordingly, we vacate the district court's rulings on these motions and remand for the district court to fully address Bonnie's arguments. We deny each party's request for attorney fees incurred on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Because Bonnie and David share a last name, we refer to them by their first names throughout this opinion. We intend no disrespect by this apparent informality.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Bonnie also asserts that the attorney fees award associated with the default judgment was not supported by findings regarding the reasonableness of the award. Because we vacate the district court's decision based on Bonnie's first argument, we do not address her attorney fees argument in detail.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Because we conclude that the district court failed to properly analyze Bonnie's excusable neglect argument-the basis she alleged for relief-we do not consider the other requirements.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
