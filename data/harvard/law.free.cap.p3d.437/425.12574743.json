The court's restitution order was entered without objection. King, however, asserts that his counsel abandoned him after sentencing, and that he was either completely unrepresented or ineffectively represented during the restitution phase. We agree, and therefore vacate the restitution order and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Late one evening, while heavily intoxicated, King attempted to forcibly enter a stranger's home. The homeowner confronted King and was able to push him out of the doorway, preventing him from entering the home. During the struggle, King fell down, his shoe came off, and the shoe broke one of the home's windows. The police later arrived and arrested King, and as they did so, he kicked and spat at them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 At the time, King was on parole related to previous offenses, and promptly contacted his parole officers to inform them of the arrest. King had exhibited relatively good behavior while on parole-at least up to that point-and King's parole officers did not immediately seek to have him recommitted to prison. King posted bail, and soon took steps to repair the damaged window, and offered to pay for any additional damage he may have caused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Four months after his arrest, the State charged King with one count of aggravated burglary, two counts of propelling a bodily substance at a correctional or peace officer, and one count of assault against a peace officer. King retained private counsel, who eventually negotiated a plea agreement with the State in which King agreed to plead guilty to one count of burglary, a third-degree felony, and one count of propelling a bodily substance at a correctional or peace officer, a class A misdemeanor. In the plea statement, King admitted that he \"tried to enter into a place [without] permission and caused damage.\" During his sentencing hearing, members of King's family spoke, expressing their support for King, explaining his lifelong struggle with alcohol, and detailing the many admirable character traits he possesses when not intoxicated. King spoke as well, and expressed remorse, telling the district court that, because he felt obligated to do so, he had already gone back to the home and fixed the window. Later in the hearing, King's attorney also mentioned that King had fixed the window, and the State never contradicted this account. The homeown\n   er was not present at sentencing and had not given a statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced King to prison on the felony count and to a year in jail on the misdemeanor count, but ordered his terms of incarceration to run concurrently with each other, as well as with the sentence he was serving for his previous offense. At the prosecution's request, the district court also ordered King to pay \"full and complete restitution,\" although the court left open the issue of the restitution amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Three weeks after the sentencing hearing, and before the State's deadline to seek a specific restitution amount, King's counsel filed a Notice of Withdrawal, stating that \"[c]ounsel's scope of representation ... has been fulfilled.\" That notice was unaccompanied by a motion or a proposed order; the district court did not sign any order authorizing counsel's withdrawal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Four days later, the State filed a Motion for Order of Restitution with the district court, requesting \"complete and court ordered restitution in the amount of $400.00.\" This motion was served on King's counsel, but not on King himself. The motion was very brief, and neither the motion nor the accompanying order contained any documentation-or even any indication-as to what the $400 was intended to cover. No opposition or objection to the State's specific restitution request was ever filed. A few weeks later, the district court signed the State's apparently unopposed restitution order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 King learned of the restitution order a few weeks later, when he received a letter from the district attorney's office informing him that he \"owe[d] money.\" King then sent multiple letters to the prosecutor and the court complaining about the restitution award, and the court set the matter for hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 At the hearing, King appeared without an attorney, and objected to the restitution award on the ground that \"[t]he only thing that got broke was a window and it got fixed.\" The court asked King if he was still represented by counsel, and King answered that he was not. The prosecutor also believed King to be unrepresented, stating \"the defendant's attorney, he withdrew.\" The court explained that it had signed the restitution order without holding a hearing because the order was unopposed. The court noted that King's attorney had filed a notice of withdrawal, but observed that \"there wasn't an order filed that I could grant or deny the notice of withdrawal.\" After realizing that King may need replacement counsel, the court declined to take any further action at that hearing other than appointing a public defender to represent King in any future proceedings, including any appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 King now appeals the restitution order, and asks us to consider two alternative arguments. First, King contends that he was denied the right to counsel because he was in fact unrepresented during restitution proceedings. Whether a defendant has the right to counsel during a particular phase of criminal proceedings is a constitutional issue that presents a question of law that we review for correctness.\n   <em>\n    State v. Cabrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8355983\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/163/707/\">\n    2007 UT App 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8355983\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/163/707/\">\n    163 P.3d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Second, and in the alternative, King contends that, even if he was still represented during the restitution proceedings, his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the State's motion for restitution. \"A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel raised for the first time on appeal presents a question of law, which we consider de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State posits that counsel may have been worried that an objection would result in a restitution order of more than $400, and that, given the relatively small amount requested, counsel made a tactical decision not to object. But nothing in the record supports this supposition, and the record contains numerous indications to the contrary. First and most notably, counsel filed a notice of withdrawal a few days\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the State's restitution request and then failed to appear at the follow-up hearing, indicating\n   that counsel's failure to object was not tactical but, rather, the result of counsel's belief that he was no longer representing King. Second, both counsel and King himself made statements, on the record, indicating that the only damage to the home that they were aware of was the broken window, and that King had already voluntarily repaired all of that damage prior to sentencing. Indeed, there is no evidence anywhere in the record-not even in the State's restitution request-that King caused any other damage to the home. Finally, in King's statements to the court at the review hearing, he avers that his attorney never contacted him to discuss the restitution request. On this record, we conclude that King has overcome the \"strong presumption\" that counsel's conduct was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8328972\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/152/321/\">\n    2007 UT 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 To establish prejudice, \"[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , 466 U.S. at 694,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We are persuaded that, in this case, there is a reasonable probability that the district court would not have entered the State's restitution order if counsel had objected. As noted, both King and his counsel represented at sentencing that King had repaired the broken window, and there is no indication in the record that these representations were untrue. Moreover, there was no indication in the State's restitution paperwork-or anywhere else in the record-that its request was intended to cover anything other than the one broken window.

Because the attorney failed to properly withdraw, he remained King's counsel of record through the restitution proceedings.
