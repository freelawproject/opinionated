Because the charter schools previously operating on the property ceased operations in May 2015, the property was not exempt for the 2015 tax year, and we thus affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Under Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 42-11104(C)(1), property owned by a \u00a7 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that operates as a charter school is exempt from taxation if the property is used for education and not used or held for profit. Luz Social Services, Inc., a qualifying nonprofit corporation, owned three parcels of real property (the \"Property\") in Pima County, where it operated nonprofit charter schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Luz filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2014, at which time the Property became part of the bankruptcy estate, subject to the automatic bankruptcy stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 541(a)(1). Compass, one of Luz's creditors and the beneficiary of a deed of trust on the Property, sought leave to pursue a sale of the Property. In February 2015, the bankruptcy court granted limited stay relief and authorized Compass to sell the property, but further ordered that the schools could continue to operate until May 29 and that no sale could be completed before that date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of this process, ROI was appointed as receiver with respect to the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The schools ceased all operations on May 29, 2015. Although the Pima County Assessor had classified the Property as tax exempt under the charter school exemption and had applied the exemption through the 2014 tax year (during which time the schools had remained in continuous operation), the Assessor did not apply the exemption for the 2015 tax year. Accordingly, 2015 property taxes were fixed, levied, and assessed against the Property (which remained part of the bankruptcy estate); the taxes went unpaid, and the first installment became delinquent as of November 2, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-18052(A)-(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The Property was eventually sold to a third-party on April 28, 2016. The next day, in conjunction with closing the sale (and timely as to the second installment of 2015 taxes), Luz (through ROI) paid the full amount of 2015 taxes owed on the Property (including interest on the delinquent first installment), totaling over $180,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-18052(B) (second installment not delinquent until May 1 after close of tax year).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Less than one year later, in April 2017, Taxpayers filed a tax claim in superior court, asserting that the Property remained entitled to the charter school exemption for the 2015 tax year, seeking a declaratory judgment to that effect, and requesting a refund of the 2015 taxes paid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11005(A). Taxpayers concurrently filed a petition for a refund with the Pima County Board of Supervisors, invoking a special administrative procedure provided by the charter school exemption statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11104(G) (directing that, upon petition by a qualifying nonprofit charter school that failed to timely file an eligibility affidavit but otherwise qualified for the exemption, the county board of supervisors order the county treasurer to refund property taxes paid within the previous year and strike from the tax rolls any unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties). After the Board denied the petition, Taxpayers amended their tax court complaint to add a special action claim seeking a writ of mandamus directing the Board and the County Treasurer to refund the 2015 tax payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The County Defendants (Pima County Treasurer, Pima County Assessor, and Pima County) then moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that (1) the tax court lacked jurisdiction over the illegal-tax claim because the 2015 taxes had not been paid before delinquency as required by A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11004, (2) the tax court should decline to exercise special action jurisdiction over the mandamus claim because Taxpayers had access to an adequate remedy at law (an illegal-tax claim), and (3) in the alternative, the complaint failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted because, as a matter of law, the Property was not exempt for the 2015 tax year as it was used for operation of a charter school only through May 29, 2015. Relying on the first two grounds, the tax court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Taxpayers timely appealed the resulting judgment, and we have jurisdiction under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Taxpayers argue that the tax court erred by dismissing the illegal-tax claim based on Taxpayers' failure to timely pay the 2015 taxes and by declining to exercise jurisdiction over the mandamus claim based on the availability of an alternative remedy at law. We decline to address these arguments, however, because, even assuming those grounds were improper, dismissal was nevertheless warranted. As explained below, based on the allegations of the complaint, the Property lost its exempt status for the 2015 tax year because the charter schools ceased operations as of May 29, 2015. The Property therefore was not entitled to the exemption for the 2015 tax year, and Taxpayers' illegal-tax and mandamus claims fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Charter School Exemption.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 Article 9, Section 2(2), of the Arizona Constitution authorizes the Legislature to exempt from taxation \"[p]roperty of educational ... institutions not used or held for profit,\" and the Legislature has crafted such an exemption for charter schools. Under A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11104(C)(1), property and buildings belonging to a \u00a7 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that operates as a charter school \"are exempt from taxation beginning on the date the nonprofit organization acquires ownership of the property and buildings if the property and buildings are used for education and are not used or held for profit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 To establish entitlement to the exemption, the qualified charter school must file an initial eligibility affidavit with the county assessor in the first two months of the tax year, and an additional eligibility affidavit each year thereafter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 42-11104(D), -11152(A)(1)-(2), -11153(A). If a qualified charter school provides the assessor with proof of its \u00a7 501(c)(3) tax exempt status, however, the annual affidavit requirement is waived \"until all or part of the property is conveyed to a new owner or is no longer used for education,\" at which point the organization must notify the assessor in writing. A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11104(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 For most taxpayers, failure to timely file an exemption eligibility affidavit (or acquiring the property after the time to file has passed) waives entitlement to the exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11153(A) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Church of the Isaiah 58 Project of Ariz., Inc. v.

The charter school exemption statute, however, provides a special administrative remedy for charter schools faced with these circumstances. A qualifying charter school owning property used for education and \"otherwise qualif[ying] for exemption\" that fails to timely file an eligibility affidavit may directly petition the county board of supervisors to secure the benefit of the charter school exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11104(G) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11109(E) (providing a comparable special administrative remedy with regard to an exemption for religious organizations). If the charter school meets the requirements for the exemption, the statute requires the board of supervisors to direct a refund of any property taxes paid within the preceding year and to forgive any unpaid property taxes, along with associated interest and penalties. A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11104(G)(1)-(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Entitlement to Exemption.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 The County Defendants urge that based on the allegations of the complaint, the Property lost its exempt status for the 2015 tax year when the charter schools ceased operations on May 29, 2015.

Here, as alleged in Taxpayers' complaint, the Property was used for education only through May 29, 2015; the schools ceased operations entirely as of May 30, 2015. Because the Property was no longer used for education after that date-before the assessment period for the 2015 tax year was complete-the Property lost a necessary condition for entitlement to the charter school exemption, lost its exempt status, and thus as a matter of law was subject to taxation for the 2015 tax year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Taxpayers urge, however, that because the Property was exempt for the first five months of the year, it was entitled to the exemption for the entire tax year. We have previously addressed and rejected this same argument in the context of another tax exemption. In\n   <em>\n    Hub Properties Trust v.

According to Taxpayers, a private purchaser of a government-owned property would thus have no legitimate expectation to receive the benefit of the exemption, whereas a charter school that completed the administrative eligibility process would have both the expectation and legal entitlement to receive the exemption for that entire year regardless of a change in use or ownership. Taxpayers assert that extinguishing the exemption after the close of the administrative eligibility process (even if the property is no longer used for education) is in effect an improper retroactive termination of the exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 Taxpayers' argument conflates the period for filing an eligibility affidavit (January to March 1 of the tax year)-a procedural requirement for establishing entitlement to the charter school exemption-with the substantive requirements of the exemption itself.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11104(C)(1),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 42-11104(D)-(E), -11152(A), -11153(A). And \u00a7 42-11104(C)(1) places no time limit on the requirement that the charter school exemption be applied only \"if the property and buildings are used for education.\" Moreover, even nonprofit charter schools that are relieved of the obligation to file subsequent annual eligibility affidavits are nevertheless required to notify the assessor in writing when \"all or part of the property is conveyed to a new owner or is no longer used for education,\" A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11104(E), which further suggests that the exemption may be extinguished by conveyance or change of use. If the exemption is extinguished mid-year-whether by sale to another entity or by the charter school retaining ownership but ceasing use for education-the property is no longer entitled to the exemption for that tax year. In short, the logic underlying the\n   <em>\n    Hub Properties\n   </em>\n   decision applies here, and Taxpayers' argument relies on the same faulty premise that we rejected in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 Taxpayers further argue that \u00a7 42-11104 does not specify that the property must be used as a charter school throughout the entire tax year in order to qualify for the exemption, positing that such a requirement would be inconsistent with common school breaks such as summer vacation. Although the statutory requirement that the property be \"used for education\" presumably does not require educational use every day of the year, it expressly conditions the exemption on continued educational use. And here, the charter schools ceased operations entirely in the middle of the tax year, before the property taxes were fixed, levied, and assessed and before those taxes came due.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 42-17151(A), -18052(A). The Legislature could have authorized the exemption for property that\n   <em>\n    loses\n   </em>\n   its eligibility mid-year, just as it expressly did for property that\n   <em>\n    gains\n   </em>\n   eligibility after being acquired by a nonprofit charter school mid-year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-11104(C)(1), (G) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   S. Fact Sheet (Apr. 7, 2008), H.B. 2330, 48th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2008); H.R. Bill Summary (Feb. 20, 2008), H.B. 2330, 48th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2008). But nothing in \u00a7 42-11104 suggests that the benefit of the exemption survives even after the property no longer meets the substantive eligibility requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 Finally, Taxpayers argue in the alternative that the amount of property taxes should be prorated to reflect that the Property was exempt for five months of the tax year. Although the Legislature could have authorized proration for charter school property that loses its exempt status mid-year-as it has done expressly in the context of destroyed property,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-15157 -the Legislature did not do so. Section 42-11104 itself does not authorize proration, and Taxpayers offer no other authority to support their argument. Accordingly, we conclude that the Property was not entitled to an exemption for the 2015 tax year because it lost its tax-exempt status when the charter schools ceased operation and the Property was no longer used for education. Taxpayers' mandamus claim and illegal-tax claims for refund and declaratory relief thus fail as a matter of law, and dismissal was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Attorney's Fees on Appeal.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b622 Taxpayers seek an award of attorney's fees on appeal under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2030(A), which directs an award of fees to a private party that prevails on the merits in a mandamus action, and under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-348(B)(1), which allows an award of fees to a private party that prevails on the merits of a tax claim. Because Taxpayers have not prevailed, we deny their request for fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b623 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Taxpayers' complaint alleged more broadly that the bankruptcy court's order \"terminat[ed] the automatic stay of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20362\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) with respect to the Property,\" but the order itself reflects more limited stay relief tailored only to \"Compass' enforcement of its rights under its deed of trust on the Property.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The bankruptcy court had previously issued an order confirming that the bankruptcy stay had terminated with respect to the Property and that the bankruptcy estate abandoned any interest in the claim for refund of 2015 property taxes on the Property. Similarly, the receivership was reopened for ROI to assert the refund claim on Luz's behalf.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
