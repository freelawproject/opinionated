Brugh sued Fun-Tastic Rides Co., Midway Rides LLC, and John Doe Manufacturer (collectively Fun-Tastic), alleging negligence. She relied on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to establish a breach of duty. Fun-Tastic moved for summary judgment on the theory that res ipsa loquitur did not apply, and after reconsideration, the trial court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Fun-Tastic operated a roller coaster at the Washington State Fair. Before the start of the Fair, the Department of Labor and Industries (L&amp;I) inspected the roller coaster for safety. L&amp;I issued a permit for the roller coaster. Fun-Tastic inspected the ride on September 16, 2013, found no abnormalities,\n   and noted that the \"Ride is Running well.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 On September 16, Brugh rode Fun-Tastic's roller coaster. Brugh described the last turn of the roller coaster as a sudden and violent jolt. As a result of the jolt, she struck both sides of her head on the roller coaster's safety harness. Subsequently, she lost hearing in her right ear. Fearing that she had a blown eardrum, she went to the Fair's medical tent for assistance. The Fair's medical staff recommended that she either go to urgent care or see her doctor the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The next day, Brugh saw her primary care physician, Dr. Rachael Gonzalez. Brugh was bleeding from her ears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because Brugh had a history of ear infections, Dr. Gonzalez attributed the bleeding to an ear infection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 On October 7, Brugh again saw Dr. Gonzalez. Brugh reported \"severe and debilitating\" head and neck pain. CP at 89. Dr. Gonzalez diagnosed Brugh with, among other injuries, \"[s]evere traumatic brain injury\" and a \"[s]ubdural hematoma post head injury.\" CP at 90. Dr. Gonzalez believed the injuries were, more probably than not, \"directly related to the head trauma Ms. Brugh suffered from the rollercoaster ride.\" CP at 90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Dr. Gonzalez referred Brugh to a neurologist for an emergency consultation. Brugh had brain surgery for the subdural hematoma on October 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Brugh then filed a complaint alleging Fun-Tastic's negligence. After some discovery, Fun-Tastic moved for summary judgment. The court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Fun-Tastic filed a motion for reconsideration. The court heard oral argument, granted Fun-Tastic's motion, and dismissed Brugh's claims. Brugh appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I.

Brugh argues that general experience teaches that such an impact leading to her brain injury does not ordinarily occur on roller coasters, absent negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 Fun-Tastic argues that Brugh must show something more than just the extent of her injuries to show that the roller coaster operated abnormally.

It does not dispute causation or allege that Brugh contributed to her own injury. Thus, Fun-Tastic recognizes that Brugh, while strapped into the roller coaster, hit her head during the course of the ride. It recognizes that Brugh's subsequent subdural hematoma directly resulted from hitting her head\n   during the roller-coaster ride. It also recognizes that Brugh did not contribute in any way to her injury. Yet, Fun-Tastic argues that the roller coaster operated as expected. The general experience and observation of mankind teaches that these cannot all simultaneously be true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bibeau v. Fred W.

For example, general experience teaches that people may receive minor bumps to their head from the safety harness of a roller coaster during a ride. General experience teaches that people may receive minor whiplash while riding a roller coaster. However, general experience teaches that a subdural hematoma brain bleed does not ordinarily happen while strapped into a roller coaster in the absence of negligence. Accordingly, the nature of Brugh's injury is not of a type that one would expect while riding a roller coaster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 31 We do not determine which types of injuries are severe enough to invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur in all cases.
