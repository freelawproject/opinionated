Hooker argues that the district court violated his constitutional rights in construing his \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissing it as time-barred. He contends that he should have been allowed to proceed under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255 offers an \u201cinadequate and ineffective\u201d remedy in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-19\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Hooker raised, among other things, several challenges to his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) for aiding and abetting the using and carrying of a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime. He included a claim that he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the offense in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). In 1993, prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bailey, </em>Hooker unsuccessfully sought post-conviction relief under \u00a7 2255. After <em>Bailey </em>was rendered, Hooker sought leave from us to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, insisting that his \u00a7 924(c)(1) conviction should be reversed in light of that decision. We denied him leave to appeal because his claim did not involve newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-20\">Hooker subsequently filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, the district in which he is confined. The record shows that the petition was transferred administratively, without a judicial order, from the Northern District of Alabama to the Northern District of Mississippi, the district court in which Hooker was convicted. As previously stated, the district court for the Northern District of Mississippi construed Hooker\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it as time-barred under that section\u2019s one-year limitations period. Although \u00a7 2255 is the proper vehicle for challenging the validity of a conviction and sentence, <em>see United States v. Tubwell, </em>37 F.3d 175, 177 (5th Cir.1994), the district court lacked jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>tion to construe Hooker\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion because he had not received prior authorization from us to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244, 2255; <em>United States v. Rich, </em>141 F.3d 550, 551 (5th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 119 S.Ct. 1156, 143 L.Ed.2d 221 (1999). The district court likewise lacked jurisdiction to entertain Hooker\u2019s pleading as a \u00a7 2241 petition: Such a petition must be filed in the district where the prisoner is incarcerated. <em>See United States v. Weathersby, </em>958 F.2d 65, 66 (5th Cir.1992). As Hooker is incarcerated in Talladega, Alabama, only the district court for the Northern District of Alabama would have jurisdiction to entertain his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 81(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">As noted, Hooker alleged in his petition that he is seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255 offered an \u201cinadequate and ineffective\u201d remedy in his case. He pointed out that he could not have presented his claim of \u201cactual innocence\u201d under <em>Bailey </em>in his first \u00a7 2255 motion because <em>Bailey </em>had not been decided at that time. He also contended that he is prohibited from raising his <em>Bailey </em>claim in a second \u00a7 2255 motion because he is unable to satisfy the requirements of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) that govern the filing of successive \u00a7 2255 motions. Hooker advances that same argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Hooker\u2019s argument is based on the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255, under which a prisoner may seek \u00a7 2241 relief in lieu of \u00a7 2255 relief if he can establish that \u201cthe remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990) (internal quotations and citation omitted); \u00a7 2255. We have not had occasion to address whether a prisoner may use the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 to raise a <em>Bailey </em>claim in a \u00a7 2241 petition to circumvent the successive requirements established by the AEDPA. <em>See United States v. Sorrells, </em>145 F.3d 744, 748 n. 2 (5th Cir.1998). Some circuits have allowed prisoners to do so under these circumstances. <em>See, e.g., In re Davenport, </em>147 F.3d 605, 611-12 (7th Cir.1998); <em>Triestman v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 361, 377-80 (2d Cir.1997); <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 248-52 (3d Cir.1997). Recently, the Eleventh Circuit, the circuit in which Hooker\u2019s application was originally filed, adopted the Seventh Circuit\u2019s approach in <em>Davenport </em>as it pertains to <em>Bailey </em>claims, even though it did so in a case in which no <em>Bailey </em>issue was raised. <em>See Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Hooker cites the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Triestman </em>and the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsainvil </em>in support of his argument that he was entitled to seek habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. Hooker did not, however, obtain a judicial determination regarding his ability to proceed under \u00a7 2241; rather, his petition was administratively transferred by the clerk\u2019s office to the Northern District of Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">A clerk of court may not reject a pleading for lack of conformity with requirements of form; only a judge may do that. <em>See McClellon v. Lone Star Gas Co., </em>66 F.3d 98, 101 (5th Cir.1995). If a clerk of court may not reject a pleading for defects of form, it follows <em>a fortio\u00f1 </em>that a clerk of court may not reject a pleading on substantive grounds, which is essentially what occurred in the instant case. Hooker is entitled to a judicial determination whether he may proceed under \u00a7 2241, and that determination can only be made in the district where he is incarcerated. <em>See Weathersby, </em>958 F.2d at 66. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is vacated, and Hooker\u2019s case is remanded to the district court with instructions to transfer the case back to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
