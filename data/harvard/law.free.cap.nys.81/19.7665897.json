In other words, when he makes good the trust fund which he has been directed by the decree to do, on the ground that it was an investment which he ought not to have made, he personally takes the place of himself as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The decree, therefore, should be modified to the extent of permitting the appellant to transfer the title to the real estate which he now holds as trustee to himself personally; also to assign to himself personally the cause of action in the proceedings instituted to set aside the transfers from Pettit to his wife, as well as the judgment for deficiency in the action to foreclose the mortgage; and, as thus modified, the decree appealed from should be affirmed, with costs to the respondents, to be paid by the appellant personally. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
