The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>has found that ever since 1890 the defendant has, by means of its system of sewers and drains, collected in artificial channels, and wrongfully and unlawfully discharged into such creek above the lands of the plaintiff, a large quantity of sewage and filth, thereby polluting the waters and also the bed and the bank of said creek, rendering them offensive to the senses, and occasioning deposits in the bed and along the banks thereof, and upon plaintiff\u2019s land, rendering such waters less useful for farming, dairying, and manufacturing purposes, and for the maintenance of cattle and other animals, and for the harvesting of merchantable ice, to the nuisance of the plaintiff and his land; that the defendant thereafter enlarged its system of sewers so that the amount of pollution discharged from them into such creek at the time of the trial amounted to 1,200,000 gallons per day of domestic sewage, beside the washings of streets through 80 catch-basins; that such wrongful acts of the defendant have continued for more than six years prior to the commencement of the action; that the defendant is a growing city; that it has from time to time during said six years enlarged its system of sewers, and increased the quantity of its sewage discharged into said creek, and is continually increasing said nuisance to the lands of the plaintiff; that the defendant threatens to continue said nuisance, and does not abate the same, and will, unless restrained by the court, continue said nuisance permanently, and the plaintiff will be compelled from time to time to bring actions against the city to recover his damages from time to time suffered by the trespass so committed and continued. The court also found the amount of damages the plaintiff had suffered for the six years prior to the commencement of the action, and from that time down to the time of the trial, and awarded him a judgment therefor, but denied him an injunction, on account of the distance of his lands from the city of Gloversville. Because of this denial, the' plaintiff has appealed. .</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b499-5\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Butler v. Village of White Plains, 59 App. Div. 30, 69 N. Y. Supp. 193; Strobel v. Kerr Salt Co., 164 N. Y. 321, 58 N. E. 142, 51 L. R. A. 687, 79 Am. St. Rep. 643; Hooker v. City of Rochester, 126 N. Y. 635, 26 N. E. 1043; Chapman v. City of Rochester, 110 N. Y. 273, 18 N. E. 88, 1 L. R. A. 296, 6 Am. St. Rep. 366. More than this, there appears no substantial distinction between this case and that of Sammons v. City of Gloversville, 34 Misc. Rep. 459, 70 N. Y. Supp. 284, recently affirmed in this court without opinion (67 App. Div. 628, 74 N. Y. Supp. 1145), and we feel bound to follow that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The judgment, in so far as it denies an injunction, should be reversed, with costs to the appellant, and an injunction granted to the same effect, and containing the same provisions, as in the case last mentioned. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
