Said company alleges that there was a total failure of the consideration for which said note was given by it to said plaintiff.

The Court of Appeals has held that in an action at law a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>plaintiff cannot be compelled to bring in any other parties than those he has chosen. Chapman v. Forbes, 123 N. Y. 532, 26 N. E. 3; Bauer v. Dewey, 166 N. Y. 402, 60 N. E. 30. The learned counsel for the appellant does not deny that this is an action at law, but contends that the cases cited should not be deemed controlling, except where the merits of the controversy require that no further parties' should be brought into the action. Such a limitation would be an effectual destruction of the rule itself. If said rule adopted by the Court of Appeals is to be modified and limited in its application, such modification. and limitation should be stated by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
