J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcJ\">The plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant for an assault committed upon her by Shepard, one of defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s. Defendant had sold plaintiff some furniture under the installment plan, and there was an unpaid installment. Shepard came to the house. There was a direct conflict of evidence as to what occurred, but the jury, by their verdict, have apparently found the plaintiff\u2019s account to be true. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">\u201cOn July 12, 1900, he came to my house, knocked at the door, and asked for Mrs. McGrath, and I told him I was the party. He said, \u2018Well, I represent Mr. Michaels. What are you going to do about that furniture again?\u2019 I said I expected the collector to come on Tuesday, and he had not come. He said, \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u2019 I said, T have not got very much money this morning, but I have got a dollar, and I thought the collector\u2014\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he says, T want S5.\u2019 I said, T have not got it.' \u2018Well,\u2019 he says, T will have to take the goods.\u2019 I said, \u2018Can\u2019t you wait till Saturday night, and I will go down and see Mr. Michaels.\u2019 He said, \u2018No; that will not do. I want the goods or $5.\u2019 I said, \u2018If I had got $5, I would not be buying goods on time.\u2019 He said, \u2018That has got nothing to do with me. I want $5 or the goods.\u2019 Then I stepped over to the bedroom door and shoved the table in front of me. When I stood there he grabbed me, and I told him to keep his hands off me, and he began with a sneer on him. He grabbed me by the shoulder and forced me up against the door. He threw me on the floor, and, as I fell, then I grabbed at his hat, and he fell on the floor with me. Then he put his hand on my side. He put his hand in his pocket and said, T will knock the head off her!\u2019 and he called me a vulgar name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">The plaintiff called the defendant as a witness, and he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-17\">\u201cHe [Shepard] has been in my employ. * * * His duties were that . of a collector\u2014to go around collecting from people the money they owed to me. He did not have any charge of the removal of furniture. * * * He had authority to collect this bill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-18\">Shepard testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-19\">\u201cQ. When you went down to collect on this date, were you authorized to do anything else? A. No, sir. Q. Your other duties at that time were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>\u2022what? A. Investigator, tracer, and collector. Q. Were you authorized at any time to take the goods? A. Not forcibly; no, sir; not by anybody; no, sir. Q. Only by replevin? A. If they wished to give them up, or by replevin.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u2022 The court charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">. \u201cThe theory of the law is that the defendant would be responsible for the tortious acts of the agent, when committed by him while acting within the apparent scope of his authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">To this charge the defendant excepted, and asked the court to charge that the plaintiff must satisfy the jury \u201cthat the person whom she says committed the assault was authorized; that the act was done within the scope or course of his employment\u2014within the scope of his authority\u201d; also that \u201cthe defendant did not authorize the acts [of Shepard], * * * and that the acts were not in the course of his employment or within the scope of his authority\u2014what he was doing was in excess of his duty, and the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d The court refused both requests, and the defendant excepted; thus bringing up sharply the question whether the use of the word \u201capparent\u201d was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">There is no doubt of the rule that a master may be held responsible for the acts of his servant within the general scope of his employment while engaged in the master\u2019s business, even though the servant\u2019s act be negligent, wanton, or willful. Grimes v. Young, 51 App. Div. 239, 64 N. Y. Supp. 859; Rounds v. Del., Lack. &amp; West. R. Co., 64 N. Y. 129, 21 Am. Rep. 597; Mott v. Consumers\u2019 Ice Co., 73 N. Y. 543. But this does not cover the point involved in the use of the word \u201capparent.\u201d I have found no decision which grafts any such doctrine upon the general rule above stated. In a case of this nature, it is actual authority, not apparent authority, which governs. The jury may have inferred that the acts of Shepard were evidence that apparently he had authority to remove the goods without the consent of the plaintiff, and that the assault was committed in the exercise of such authority. But the evidence of the limitation of his employment to the collection of the installment, or to a removal of the goods only with the consent of the plaintiff, is clear, explicit, and uncontradicted. The defendant is not responsible for a willful act of Shepard not within the scope of his employment, and the charge was error which requires a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide event All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
