Against the demurrer, the pleading will be deemed to allege whatever can be fairly and reasonably implied. Kain v. Larkin, 141 N. Y. 144, 36 N. E. 9; Greeff v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc., 160 N. Y. 19, 54 N. E. 7I2 46 L. R. A. 288, 73 Am. St. Rep. 659. In Coatsworth v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., 156 N. Y. 451, 457, 51 N. E. 301, 303, the court, per Martin, J., say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-9\">\u201cUnder the more recent authorities, pleadings are not to be strictly construed against the pleader, but averments which sufficiently point out the mature of the pleader\u2019s claim are sufficient if under them he would be entitled to give the necessary evidence to establish his cause of action. Rochester Railway Co. v. Robinson, 133 N. Y. 242, 246 [30 N. E. 1008].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1105-10\">The word \u201cjust\u201d is derived from the Latin \u201cjustus,\u201d which is from the Latin \u201cjus,\u201d which means a right, and, more technically, a legal right, a law. Thus \u201cjus dicere\u201d was to pronounce the judgment, to give the legal decision, as by the praetor. Our word \u201cjust\u201d is defined in the Century Dictionary as \u201cright in law or ethics\u201d; in Stormonth\u2019s Dictionary, as \u201cconformable to laws\u201d; ' in Imperial Dictionary, as \u201cconformed to rules and principles of justice.\u201d \u201cJust\u201d is defined in the Standard Dictionary as \u201cconforming to the requirements of right or of positive law\u201d; in Anderson\u2019s Law Dictionary as \u201cprobable; reasonable, as just cause to make an arrest, to suspect one of a crime.\u201d Rapalje &amp; Lawrence\u2019s Law Dictionary states that the terms \u201cjust cause\u201d and \u201creasonable cause\u201d are synonymous. Kinney\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cjust\u201d as \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cadequate,\u201d \u201creasonable,\u201d \u201cprobable,\u201d and \u201cjusta causa,\u201d in civil law, as \u201ca just cause,\u201d \u201ca lawful ground.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cjust\" as \u201cright, in accordance with law and justice.\u201d In Jones v. Fruin, 26 Neb. 76, 42 N. W. 283, the court held that the allegation that the attachment was \u201cwrongfully and maliciously sued out, and no just ground existed for issuing the same,\u201d as equivalent to allegations of want of probable cause. In Martin v. Gage, 9 N. Y. 398, the court held that the phrase \u201cjust debts\u201d means \u201csuch debts as shall turn out.to be just according to the determination of the courts of law and equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">The pleader charges that the defendant prosecuted him without just cause or provocation. Does he not fairly mean that the defendant had no legal justification for his act? A just cause for an act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>is such a cause as the law recognizes as legal warrant for the act, absolving the offender from any legal consequences, and that in malicious prosecution is \u201cprobable cause.\u201d The pleader is not pleading that which he must, prove, namely, want of probable cause; and so the question is not to be determined by deciding whether proof of no just cause is the same -as proof of no probable cause. He is pleading that the defendant acted without such cause, as the law recognizes as just, in the sense that it was not excusable .in law. To have \u201cno just cause\u201d in such a case is to have no such ca-use as the law recognizes, namely, a probable cause. And the pleading may be regarded as \u201cthe statement of a fact ascertained by the 'rules of law.\u201d * See remarks of Landon, J., in Thayer v. Gile, 42 Hun, 268. I think that the averment sufficiently points out the nature of the claim, ahd that evidence of no probable cause is admissible under it. The two decisions mainly relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant, namely, Young v. Gregory, 3 Call (Va.) 446, 2 Am. Dec. 556, and Van de Wiele v. Callanan, 7 Daly, 386, need not be followed. The first is nice to a degree in the lines of antique pleading, when the courts indulged in subtleties, for the divided decision turned upon the fact that \u201cjustifiable cause\u201d could mean something else than \u201cprobable cause.\u201d The second decision is obiter upon this point. It holds that as \"just\u201d or \u201cproper\u201d cause does not necessarily express the same thing as \u201cprobable\u201d cause, it could not be substituted for it. I think that the rule expounded is too stringent in the light of the more recent decisions on the construction of pleadings upon demurrer ut supra. The learned Special Term (Dickey, J., presiding) was right in overruling the demurrer, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">Interlocutory judgment affirmed, with costs.
