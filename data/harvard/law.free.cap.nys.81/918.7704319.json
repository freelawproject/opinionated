On such sale he directed that the proceeds should be divided into four parts, and he advised that the sale be made on the expiration of a certain lease for 26 years, or at such other time as his executors should deem advisable. He directed his executors to pay certain mortgages on his property, and provided that from one of the four parts before mentioned a certain sum should be deducted, and the balance paid to one of his sons.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b951-6\">\u25a0 The following is the opinion of Russell, J., delivered at Special Term:</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b951-7\">\u201cThe major purpose of the testator was to divide his property among his four children equally, except as to a deduction of $3,000 from the share of one for the very purpose of equalization of benefit. To accomplish that main object, the .executors were given power to sell the real estate, power to sell personalty by provision of the will being unnecessary, and such power was unlimited by any superior controlling clause suspending the capacity to .alienate during the term of any life. The directions to provisionally dispose of the income and to pay mortgages are simply guides to the executors for their necessary action during the interim between death and sale. The absence of precise directions as to what shall be done with three of the four parts of the proceeds does not destroy or alter any right. By the general purpose of the division, as expressed, and by implication of law, those three parts go to the three children whose parts are not diminished by the special provision applicable to one alone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b951-8\">\u201cPresent proposed decision and judgment, with memoranda of counsel as to costs.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b951-9\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.
