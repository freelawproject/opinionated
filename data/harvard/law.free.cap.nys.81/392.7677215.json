The defendant was served with a summons and complaint in the action on September 9, 1901. The defendant\u2019s time to answer was- extended at various times down to October 23, 1902. On October 22, 1902, the defendant served his answer, and on January \u00f3, 1903, he served an amended answer. On January 19, 1903, the plaintiff served a notice of trial, which also contained a notice of motion to place the cause upon the preferred calendar, which notice read as follows, to wit: \u201cAnd at the same time a motion will be made on the pleadings at Part 2 of said court to give this action a preference on the calendar, under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 791, subd. 2.\u201d The point made by the appellant is that the notice for preference was not in compliance with the Code, in that it did not state the particular day in the term at which it would be moved. Whether the notice is sufficient in that respect it is not necessary at this time to consider. Subdivision 1 of section 791 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for the service of a notice of trial on a particular day in the term at which the case will be moved; and, unless compliance be had with the Code provisions in this respect, \u201cit shall not be moved out of its order at that term, except by the special order of the court.\u201d Subdivision 2 of the same section makes the quoted provision applicable to cases for which jprovision is made therein. If we assume that the notice was insufficient, it does not avail the appellant, for the court, by special order, advanced the cause as preferred, and placed it upon the calendar for a particular day. This the court was authorized to do, whether the-notice was sufficient or not, and, as the court had power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>to grant the order, the cause was regularly placed upon the preferred calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $xo costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
