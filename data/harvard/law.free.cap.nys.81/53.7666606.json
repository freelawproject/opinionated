It must be regarded as established by the papers presented to the court upon this appeal that Frank Jones was not a freeholder at the time of his appointment as commissioner, on October 18th, but that -intermediate that date and the hearing of the application to vacate his appointment, on November 21st, he became a freeholder. The statutory requirement is that persons appointed be freeholders at the time of their appointment. Later becoming a freeholder does not v\u00e1lidate the appointment of the commissioner. People v. Purdy, 154 N. Y. 439, 48 N. E. 821, 61 Am. St. Rep. 624. The appointment of a person not a freeholder will be vacated upon motion when that fact is made to appear. Matter of Beehler, 3 N. Y. State Rep. 486. Approved in Re Baker, 173 N. Y. 249, 65 N. E. 1100. Furthermore, we think that in view of the affidavits before the Special Term as to the possible interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>appointee, and without any reflection upon him, the application should have been granted. It is essential that a commissioner be able, without liability of embarrassment to himself, to act with entire freedom in the performance of his duties as such commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We think the court erred in denying the application to vacate the appointment of Frank Jones, and to appoint another person in his stead as commissioner. Order, so far as it denied application to vacate appointment of Frank Jones, reversed, with costs, and motion to vacate such appointment granted, with costs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">Order, so far as it denies application to vacate the appointment of Frank Jones as a commissioner, reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to vacate said appointment granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
