When the engagements of counsel were such that it was apparent that he would not be able to try a case which had appeared upon the day calendar and had been passed on account of his actual engagement in court, the plaintiff was bound to procure other counsel, so that the case could be tried as provided for in the rules adopted for the regulation of trials at Trial Term; and had the court below, in the exercise of its dis* cretion, refused to open this default, we should not be disposed to interfere. The Special Term presided over by the learned judge before whom the case was called for trial has, however, in the exercise of its discretion, relieved the plaintiff from the effect of this violation of the rules, and we are not disposed to reverse its action. We think, however, that the terms imposed as a condition for opening the default were insufficient. The case appeared upon the day calendar of the Trial Term for trial on Thursday, January 8, 1903, and was adjourned from day to day on account of engagements of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel until January 19th, when the complaint was dismissed. During all that time the defendants were compelled to have their witnesses in court and their counsel ready to try the case, and during that time the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, on account of whose engagements the case was passed, tried three cases, the case in which he was actually engaged when the'case first. appeared on the day calendar having ended a day or two thereafter. The counsel then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>went into the trial of other cases, notwithstanding that this case had been held on account of his engagement. At least the defendants should be indemnified so far as possible for the expense that they were put to in the preparation of the trial of the case when it had been regularly called for trial upon the day calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">We think, therefore, that the order should be modified by imposing as a condition of the opening of the default that the plaintiff pay a trial fee and $io term fee and the disbursements incurred by the defendants for witnesses\u2019 fees during the term at which the complaint was dismissed, and $io costs of opening this motion, and the order as thus modified is affirmed, without costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">HATCH, PATTERSON, and O\u2019BRIEN, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b398-6\">VAN BRUNT, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axx\">(dissenting). The rules adopted by this court for the regulation of the business of the trial terms were promulgated, it is to be presumed, for the purpose of being obeyed, and of removing the reproach, which had become a trite expression, \u201cthat there is no use in taking a default, because it will always be opened.\u201d In the case at bar the defendant was ready and anxious to try his case. He was in court day after day with his witnesses, and the plaintiff substantially refused to go on because it did not suit his convenience. The rules of the Appellate Division were violated in the way in which the case was postponed from day to day, and the instructions even of the trial court were treated with contempt. But of this latter feature, perhaps, we ought not to complain, because it would appear from the subsequent action of the trial justice that such instructions were issued without the slightest expectation of any attention being paid to the same. Notwithstanding these inexcusable circumstances, this court has allowed the default taken to be opened upon the payment of a few dollars in costs. Such leniency and violation of the rules of the court lead to vexatious and unreasonable delays, and tend to make the cost of litigation greater than any possible reward which may be reaped from success. The traditional reproach in respect to the law\u2019s delays will never be removed so long as such practice as prevailed in the case at bar is tolerated. I think that the motion to open the default should be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
