Nos. 33 and 34.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-13\">\u201c(2) That the plaintiff and the defendant on the 14th day of June, 1898, entered into an agreement in writing, bearing date that day, wherein and whereby the defendant undertook and agreed to sell to the plaintiff said premises, in consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s paying the defendant therefor the sum of $28,775, as follows: $1,000 at the execution and delivery of the agreement, the receipt of which was therein and thereby acknowledged; $2,500 in cash, or a duly certified check for that amount, at the time fixed for the delivery of the deed; $7,000 by accepting said deed subject to three certain mortgages, liens on the premises, payable in currency, viz., one for $1,000, one for $2,000, and one for $4,000, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, payable semiannually, said mortgages being then past due; and $18,275 by the said plaintiff executing and delivering to the defendant her bond, secured by a purchase-money mortgage on said premises, payable on or before two years, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, payable semiannually. Said agreement further provided that the defendant would, upon receiving such payment in the manner and at the time above mentioned, at his own proper cost and expense, execute, acknowledge, and deliver to the plaintiff or her assigns a full covenant warranty deed for the conveying and assuring to her or them of the fee simple of said premises free and clear of all incumbrances except the said mortgages and the tenancies of the present tenants, all of which were monthly tenancies, and that such deed should be delivered at the office of Lewis S.
