Upon this affidavit and all the records and proceedings in said matter an order was made requiring the attorneys upon whose motion the order of October 25th was made to show cause, at a time and place therein stated, why an order should not be made as prayed for by said receiver. The motion under this order to show cause came on for hearing on January 6, 1903, before the same judge who made the order of October 25th. The attorneys to whom payment was directed by the order of October 25th appeared, and verbally opposed the granting of the prayer of the receiver, urging as a preliminary objection that the moving papers were fatally defective, in that they failed to state whether a previous application for the order had been made, as required by rule 25 of the General Rules of Practice. No affidavits were read or filed by the appellants. On January 6, 1903, an order was made, in response to the prayer of the receiver, vacating the order of October 25th, and directing payment of $750 to th\u00bf attorneys to whom payment of $1,762.32 had been directed by the order of October 25th upon performance by them of certain conditions therein specified, \u201cwith leave\u201d to the said attorneys \u201cto make further application for an additional allowance of $1,000.\u201d On January 17, 1903, upon the return of an order to show cause, granted on the application of the attorneys claiming to be aggrieved by the order of January 6th, a motion to resettle said order was denied by the same judge who had made both of the previous orders. From this order denying resettlement this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">It is urged by the appellants that the recitals of the order of January 6th do not truthfully and fairly state the proceedings \u25a0 had upon the argument of the motion for said order; that certain proper recitals were omitted therefrom; that certain affidavits are therein referred to as having been read on said argument which were not served with the motion papers, nor in fact read at that time; and that the order as entered does not conform to* the court\u2019s decision, and was improperly entered without notice of settlement. While it is true that preliminary or other formal objections taken upon the argument and ruled on by the court should ordinarily be recited in an order for purposes of review on1 appeal, we do not believe that the appellants were in any way prejudiced by the omission from the recitals of the order of January 6th of the objection relative to the receiver\u2019s failure to comply with rule 25. It has been repeatedly held that this defect is merely an irregularity. Bean v. Tonnelle, 24 Hun, 353; Skinner v. Steele, 88 Hun, 307, 34 N. Y. Supp. 748; Wooster v. Bateman, 53 N. Y. St. Rep. 562, 24 N. Y. Supp. 112; People ex rel. Brodie v. Cox, 14 N. Y. St. Rep. 632; Pratt v. Bray, 10 Misc. Rep. 445, 31 N. Y. Supp. 465. The order of January 6th, of which resettlement was refused, leaves the appellants free to make further application for the additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>amount to which they deem themselves entitled. It imposes no conditions that cannot easily be fulfilled, and affects no substantial right of the appellants. In substance it is quite as favorable to them as the order they themselves propose as a substitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">No substantial right of the appellants being affected, this court cannot disturb the order appealed from. \u201cWhether a court shall modify or change an order already made by it is a question addressed to its discretion, and over its exercise an appellate court has no control.\u201d Place v. Hayward, 100 N. Y. 626, 3 N. E. 199. To the same effect are Waltham Manufacturing Co. v. Brady, 67 App. Div. 102, 73 N. Y. Supp. 540; Wadsley v. Houck, 27 App. Div. 630, 50 N. Y. Supp. 167; Sexton v. Bennett (Sup.) 17 N. Y. Supp. 437. These decisions are not in conflict with Gleason v. Smith, 34 Hun, 547, and New York Rubber Co. v. Rothery, 112 N. Y. 592, 20 N. E. 546. In these cases the orders appealed from were orders denying motions to resettle cases on appeal. From such orders appeals are expressly allowed by section 1347, subd. 1, of the Code of Civil Procedure. The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur. HIRSCHBERG, J., in result</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
