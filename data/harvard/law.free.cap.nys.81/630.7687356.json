The justice found for plaintiff, on a -cause of action based on an alleged breach of contract, for $200 \u25a0damages and $22 costs. The defense was a general denial. There is sufficient evidence to sustain the finding of the justice in favor of the plaintiff on the disputed questions of fact, and there is only one \u2022exception in the case, and that one is of small importance. It appears, however, from the record, that plaintiff amended his complaint \"by reducing his demand for damages from $200 to $190. The justice seems to have overlooked this fact when he fixed the damages at .$200. This error, however, is one that could be rectified by this court Fy a modification of the judgment, without a reversal, which we. would be disposed to do, were it not for the fact that the record \u25a0shows that the justice had lost jurisdiction of the case. As we have seen, the case was submitted on November 14, 1902. The decision was signed on November 28, 1902, but the record states as follows, viz.: \u201cThe decision of the justice was filed in the clerk\u2019s office of this [the Municipal] Court on Dec. 2nd, 1902. Sd. Francis Mangin, Clerk.\u201d It therefore appears that the decision was not filed with the \u2022clerk of the Municipal Court until more than 14 days after the case had been submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-17\">Section 230 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. i486, c. 580) required the justice to render judgment within 14 days from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>time when the case was submitted, except under certain circumstances, which are not applicable here. The rule is well settled that, where the justice does not render his decision within the time required by law, he loses jurisdiction of the case, and the judgment rendered under such circumstances must be reversed. See Lambert v. Salomon, 28 Misc. Rep. 562, 59 N. Y. Supp. 676. Previous to the act of 1902, above quoted, the limit of time was 8 days. It is now 14 days. In the case at bar, as we have seen, the decision was indorsed on the papers on November 28, 1902, 14 days after the case had been submitted; but this decision was not delivered to the cleric of the Municipal Court until 4 days after the expiration of the 14 days, i. e., on December 2, 1902. It must be held that the simple indorsement of the decision on the papers within the time limited by the statute is not a sufficient compliance with the statute. Unless the decision is delivered to the clerk within the statutory time, the justice loses his jurisdiction of. the case. See Dalton v. Loughlin, 4 Abb. N. C. 187; Orvis v. Curtis (Com. Pl.) 28 N. Y. Supp. 728. The reason for this construction of the statute is very simple, as otherwise the justice, after signing his decision, could hold it back indefinitely without losing jurisdiction of the case. The judgment must be reversed, with costs to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Judgment reversed, with costs to appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
