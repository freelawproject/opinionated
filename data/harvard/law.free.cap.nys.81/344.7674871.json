Having thereby, as evidenced by the judgment, established, to the satisfaction of the learned justice, the partnership, and that goods were obtained for the use of the firm by fraud of one of its members, it was proper to hold that the other partners, by receiving and participating in the use of the goods, adopted the fraudulent acts of the one who obtained them, and were in the same situation in reference to the rights of the vendors of the goods as if they had directed the senior partner to procure the goods, or had concurred in the transaction. Coman v. Allen, 21 How. Prac. 114. The fact that some of the goods were obtained six months after the credit was induced by the representations found herein to be fraudulent does not aid the defendants. Bradley v. Seaboard Nat. Bank, 167 N. Y. 427, 430, 60 N. E. 771. Nor will it avail the defendant that, saving his own appearance, there was no contradiction of his statement that he had not reached his majority at the time of the transaction, for the learned justice was not bound to believe the assertion of him, an interested party. Garbarsky v. Simkin, 36 Misc. Rep. 195, 73 N. Y. Supp. 199. Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
