Plaintiff claimed the making of a verbal modification of .this writing to the effect that plaintiff should receive said commission without regard to the price for which defendant\u2019s intestate might sell the property. Defendant denied the alleged verbal modification of the writing. Plaintiff induced one Dudley to agree to purchase the property for $40,250, and a contract there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>for in due form,, containing certain interlineations as to the nature of the deed to be given, and bearing the canceled signatures of the parties, was introduced in evidence. Plaintiff claimed that this contract was signed, delivered, and accepted by both parties without the interlineations, and that the interlineations were later made with defendant\u2019s consent. Defendant claimed, however, that the interlineations were made after the contract had been signed by her intestate, and without his consent, and before being signed by Dudley, and that defendant\u2019s intestate never agreed to the contract in its altered condition. A few days subsequent to the cancellation of this contract, defendant\u2019s intestate stated to plaintiff that he had increased the price to $42,000, and plaintiff then telephoned Dudley, with the knowledge and consent of defendant\u2019s intestate, offering the property for that sum. This offer, both plaintiff and Dudley testified, Dudley accepted, which fact plaintiff testified that he communicated on the afternoon of -the same day to defendant\u2019s intestate, who then stated he had been thinking the matter over, and had decided not to sell for $42,000. Defendant\u2019s intestate later called Dudley by telephone, and offered to sell the property at an increased price, which he did not state in his testimony, but which Dudley testified was $43,000. Dudley answered that he would later telegraph his decision, which he did, declining to pay $43,000 for the property. Dudley testified that he was not only willing, but was able, to pay $42,000 for the property. No further negotiations were had with Dudley for the sale of the property, and, defendant\u2019s intestate refusing plaintiff\u2019s demand for the payment of brokerage commission, this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The defendant asked the court to charge, among other requests, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">\u201cSixth. Under the contract in this case between plaintiff and defendant, the commission was not to be paid unless the sale was consummated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">\u201cFourteenth. The risk of failure is wholly the broker\u2019s, and reward comes only with his success.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Each of these requests was charged, and plaintiff excepted. The plaintiff contends that the effect of the instructions contained in these requests to charge was to lead the jury to believe that plaintiff could not recover even if the jury should find that the contract of brokerage was modified as plaintiff claimed, and that the contract of sale was executed, delivered, and accepted prior to the interlineations being made, for the reason that the sale was not consummated; also that the plaintiff could not recover, even should the jury find that the offer to sell the real estate for $42,000 was later duly made and accepted, for the reason that the sale was not consummated, although the failure to consummate the sale arose solely, by reason of the refusal of defendant\u2019s intestate to stand by his offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">We think there is force in plaintiff\u2019s contention notwithstanding the language of the main body of the charge, and that it cannot be said that the jury did not take the view which plaintiff claims, particularly as to the offer and acceptance at $42,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">We think the judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
