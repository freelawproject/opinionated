Counsel for defendant excepted to the charge, as indicating that the jury were not to consider defendant\u2019s testimony until they had concluded that prosecutor\u2019s story was untrue, whereupon the court remarked that, if he made such a charge, he did not wish to be so understood, but that he had told the jury to determine the truth of either story by all the evidence. <em>Held, </em>that the error in the main charge was inadvertent, and was corrected.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b588-14\">8.

Defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that he was first assaulted by prosecutor, and that he shot in self-defense. Defendant was a police officer at the time, but was not on duty. Defendant requested a charge that the use or attempted use of violence is not unlawful when committed by a public officer in the performance of legal duty, or when committed in arresting one who has committed a felony, or when committed by a person about to be injured, or by any other person in his aid or defense, in preventing an offense against his person or a trespass. <em>Held </em>that, for the most part, the request had no appliea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>tian to the case, and was properly refused; the court having already charged on self-defense.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b589-5\">11.

The defendant pleaded \u201cNot guilty,\u201d and was brought to trial October 28, 1901.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-10\">In opening the case to the jury, the assistant district attorney, who conducted the prosecution, stated that the case was not moved at that time because of the then pending \u201cmomentous political struggle,\u201d but because of the \u201cstrenuous efforts\u201d to delay it \u201cuntil after the 1st of January, probably.\u201d Counsel for the defendant interrupted, and denied any attempt on the part of the defendant to inject polities into the case or any effort to delay it, and asserted a desire to have the case tried on the facts only, whereupon the court declared that the case would be tried on the evidence only. The assistant district attorney then stated that when the assault occurred the defendant was in citizen\u2019s clothes, and that the police who were attracted to the scene did not recognize him as a patrolman at first, nor until he had been taken over to a saloon across the street, on the southeasterly corner of Fifteenth street and Seventh avenue and laid upon the floor, but that as soon as it became known that he was an \u201cofficer\u201d he was put on a chair and bolstered up, and the \u201cPolice Department of the city of New York have been bolstering him up ever since.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel again interrupted with an objection to this statement, whereupon the court directed counsel for the people to \u201ckeep within the bounds of the opening,\u201d and said that the statements could not be proved, and should not have been made. Counsel for the people replied that he intended to prove the statement. No exception was taken, and no request to instruct the jury concerning these matters was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-11\">The people gave evidence tending to show that shortly after midnight on the morning of February 16, 1901, the complaining witness, Lorenzo D. Cummings, popularly known as \u201cDad Cummings,\u201d a man over 80 years of age, left Slevin\u2019s saloon or hotel, on the southwest corner of Fourteenth street and Seventh avenue, and proceeded north, on the westerly side of the avenue, on the way to his home, at 162 West Fifteenth street; that when about midway between Fourteenth and Fifteenth streets the defendant, who evidently came up from behind, seized him by the collar and whirled him around; that he told the defendant to let go, but the defendant said nothing; that he pushed defendant\u2019s hand off and started on, whereupon defendant again seized him violently and whirled him around; that he remonstrated, but that defendant still remained mute; that he again pushed off defendant\u2019s hand; that defendant then struck him on the side of the head, knocking his cigar holder out of his mouth, and his hat off; that he stepped back, and defendant attempted to strike him again, whereupon he hit defendant across the face with a light malaeca cane with which he was walking, and which was exhibited to the jury;' that each then stepped back from the other, and the defendant drew a pistol and fired three or four shots at Cummings, one of which struck him a little below the heart and passed directly through the body to the back, where it lodged, and another struck him on the elbow and passed up his arm, and lodged somewhere at the back of the upper arm or shoulder; that the defendant then started to run, but slipped and fell, and an officer came up and took the pistol away from him; that Cum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>mings then started across the street, and fell unconscious on the opposite sidewalk, his cane having broken as he fell; that he was taken into the saloon into which the defendant was taken, and, after regaining consciousness, he recognized the defendant as the man who shot him; that \"defendant was then or soon after recognized as a policeman off duty and in citizen\u2019s, clothes; that Cummings was taken to a hospital, and the defendant, who was extremely intoxicated, was taken to the station house, and into a waiting room in the rear, where the injuries which he had received were dressed, and he was then taken to the desk and made a charge of assault against Cummings. The physician who examined him in the waiting room testified that the only injury or bruise on his face was a flesh wound or cut on the left eyebrow. There was evidence from which, if believed, it might be inferred that the officer who took the pistol from defendant struck him with his club. There was also evidence tending to show that the police handled the defendant unceremoniously, and laid him on the floor of the saloon, with his head on the bar footrail, before he was known to be an officer, and that afterwards he was placed upon a chair.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-5\">The defendant testified in his own behalf, and called other witnesses, who, if believed, corroborate his version of the affair. The evidence on behalf of the defendant tended to show that he was a policeman attached to the Eighteenth Precinct, generally known as \u25a0 the \u201cSteamboat Squad\u201d; that he lived at 97 Seventh avenue, which was at or near the corner of Fifteenth street; that he had to report for duty at 1 o\u2019clock; that he would have to leave his house at 22 or 23 minutes before 1 in order to get to his station house, at the Battery, by 1 o\u2019clock; that he was in citizen\u2019s clothes and sober; that he got off a Cross-Town car at the corner of Fourteenth street and Seventh avenue, and walked rapidly along the west side of the avenue toward his house; that, as he approached the corner of Fifteenth street, he overtook five or six men walking abreast, and taking up nearly the whole sidewalk; that, as he passed them, he was near the curb, and hit against the old man, Cummings; that he turned around and tried to excuse himself; that the old man struck him with his stick on the left forehead, knocking him down; that as he fell he struck the back of his head on the paving stones, becoming unconscious for a few moments; that, as he came to, he found the whole crowd kicking and beating him; that he caught one man by the coat, and tried to get up, but was knocked down again; that he drew his revolver and fired in the air to attract attention, but not to hit anybody; that, the next thing he knew, a policeman had him by the hand, and that he told the policeman he had been assaulted by a \u201cgang\u201d; that he was taken to the saloon, and stood up in front of Cummings, who said that defendant was the man that shot him. Defendant further testified that he was injured in a number of respects besides the cut on his left forehead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-6\">The defendant\u2019s pistol was produced in court. It was a five-chambered revolver. The officer who took it from the defendant testified that the defendant held it in his hand, and that one loaded cartridge and three or four empty shells were in it when he took it. The people also introduced evidence tending to show that some time after the occurrence the defendant admitted that he had been drinking, and knew nothing about what took place, and was willing to settle with Cummings, and suggested the payment of $800. This evidence was received without objection or exception, but evidence was offered by the defendant tending to refute it. In rebuttal, Cummings testified that he was alone, and that he saw no one else on the block, at the time of the occurrence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-7\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked that the court direct an acquittal; also that the court take away from the jury the first count in the indictment, for assault in the first degree. Both motions were denied, and exceptions taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-8\">In summing up, counsel for the people commented on the change of attitude of the police on discovering that defendant was an officer, and in taking him to the station house, but not charging him with a crime; taking him into a room, and, after three-quarters of an hour, when he became well enough, walking him out in front of the desk as a complainant against old Mr. Cummings, whom he had shot. He then continued; \u201cGentlemen, I tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>you that that Is a scene for comic opera, not for the great city of New York. It out-Deverys Devery.\u201d Counsel for defendant objected, asserting that it was an improper remark, in the midst of a political campaign, and asked the court to take notice of it. The court stated that perhaps Devery had nothing to do with it, and agreed with counsel for the defendant that it was highly improper for the district attorney to inject \u201cDevery into the case,\u201d and directed him to \u201crefrain from any such comments.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-5\">The exceptions and alleged errors relating to the charge will be stated and discussed in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b591-6\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

This claim is based upon the remark in the opening and summing up, the substance of which is stated in the statement of facts. The remarks concerning efforts to delay the trial and with reference to the pending election indicate that they were said in response to something said by counsel for the defendant in moving the case or during the examination of the jurors, but this does not appear. However, no exception was taken, and this incident. affords no basis for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">There was evidence tending to show a material change in the attitude of the police officers who had knowledge of the facts on the night of the shooting, after the)' discovered that the defendant was a fellow officer. This not only justified, but fairly called for, comment from the prosecuting officer, to enable the jury to determine the value of their testimony. Perhaps it did not, however, justify the statement that the police department had been bolstering1 the defendant up; but this was made in connection with the statement of facts as to what the defendant\u2019s fellow officers did at the time of his arrest, and we think that the jury must have understood that it related to' the conduct of the members of the force who were witnesses for the defendant, and not to the entire department. The district attorney, as a prosecuting officer, is entitled to some degree of license in commenting upon the testimony of witnesses, and the attitude and nature of the defense as disclosed by the evidence. As has been observed, there was evidence which would justify a finding that there was a marked change in the attitude of the members of the force who were present on discovering that the defendant was an officer; and shortly thereafter the defendant, who had been arrested for committing the shooting, became the aggrieved party, and complainant against Cummings, whom he had shot. We discover no error prejudicial to any right of the defendant in the assistant district attorney saying to the jury, in substance, that in his opinion this was a scene appropriate for the stage, but that such things should not be permitted in real life in the city of New York. There was no charge that Devery was connected with or interested in the defense, and nothing was said to indicate that he was. He was a public char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>acter, and the press had given considerable attention to his methods while connected with the police force. The reference to him was a mere figure of speech used in commenting on the conduct of the defendant and his brother officers, and presents no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The defendant also contends that the first count of the indictment, charging assault in the first degree, should have been taken from the jury. There was evidence from which the jury might infer that the shooting was with intent to kill, and this would constitute the crime of assault in the first degree. Pen. Code, \u00a7 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The defendant also contends that an acquittal should have been directed, and that the evidence does not warrant his conviction. We are of opinion that the guilt of the defendant was clearly established, and that any other verdict would have been a miscarriage of justice. His story, although corroborated, is utterly improbable, and is contradicted by the uncontroverted physical facts. Even if he had been assaulted as he claimed, there was no justification or excuse for his emptying four chambers of the revolver upon his assailants, most of whom\u2014if they were there at all\u2014disappeared on the first shot being fired, on the theory that it was intended to frighten them away. It would have been extremely difficult, even in daylight and by special effort, for Cummings to get in a position over the prostrate form of the defendant which would enable the latter to fire a bullet through the body of the former as shown by the evidence; and it is utterly incredible that this could have occurred with the defendant in that position, while the octogenarian was striking or attempting to strike him with his cane. It is extremely improbable that the defendant, a young, strong, hardened, athletic man, could have been knocked down by a blow of this light cane wielded by an old man. The evidence shows beyond any reasonable doubt that the defendant was intoxicated and ugly, and fired these shots while in a standing attitude, and without any cause or provocation. If his guilt were not so satisfactorily established, there are exceptions in the case which would justify a new trial; but we think the defendant was not prejudiced by the errors, which are more technical than substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">It is.claimed that the court, in charging the jury, cast the burden of proof upon the defendant of showing that the shooting was legally justified or excusable. There are portions of the charge in which the court was discussing the defendant\u2019s evidence and theory, which, if taken alone, afford ground for this criticism; but the court subsequently fairly and accurately charged the jury as to what constituted a reasonable doubt, and instructed them that if, upon all the evidence, they had a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt, he was entitled to the benefit of that doubt, and should be acquitted, and further, at the request of the counsel for the defendant, that \u201call through the case the burden of proof is upon the proseqution,\u201d and that \u201cthrough the case the defendant has the presumption of innocence, and carries it with him. all through the trial,\u201d and \u201cthat the presumption of innocence must be overcome beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d We are therefore of the opinion that the jury understood the law, and that no error to the substantial prejudice of the appellant was committed in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The court, after adverting to the testimony of Cummings, and submitting his credibility to the jury, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">\u201cIf you come to the conclusion that Mr. Cummings is not worthy of belief, that his story is a fabrication, and that he has not told the truth, then take up the defendant\u2019s version of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The court then alluded to the evidence given by the defendant and his witnesses. At the close of the charge, counsel for the defendant said he desired to except to so much of the charge \u201cas might seem to indicate that the jury were not to consider the testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses or of the defendant until after they had reached the conclusion that the complainant\u2019s story was untrue,\u201d whereupon the court remarked, \u201cI have not made any such charge, and I do not think the jury understand me as making any such charge.\u201d Counsel for the defendant then said, \u201cWe so understand your honor\u2019s language to run, I think,\u201d to which the court replied, \u201cNo; I told them to determine the truth of either story by all the evidence.\u201d We think the error in the main charge was inadvertent, and was corrected by what the court subsequently said; and, if the defendant desired any more specific charge on the subject, his counsel should have requested it.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The court said to the jury, in contrasting the testimony of the people with that of the defendant and his witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">\u201cThe two stories are diametrically opposed, and I do not think that I would be uncharitable when I say that somebody has willfully falsified in the case. AB the witnesses have not told the truth, for they differ too much for that, and it seems to me that it would be more than charitable to say that some have not willfully prevaricated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">This was a mere expression of opinion by the court, and was not a controlling direction. The jury were still at liberty to reconcile the testimony consistently with the truth of the witnesses, if that were possible. While it is ordinarily improper for the court to give expression to personal views as to the credibility of witnesses, we think no harm was done in this case, for no theory was suggested and none is apparent upon' which the conflicting testimony could be reconciled consistently with the honesty and truthfulness of all the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Counsel for the defendant requested the court to charge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">\u201cIf the defendant, while on the ground, after having been struck by the complainant, 'fired his revolver to attract attention, with no intention of hitting the complainant, and that the hitting of the complainant was a mere accident, the defendant is entitled to an acquittal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">The court had in the main charge read to the jury both sections 26 and 205 of the Penal Code, and fully and properly instructed them concerning the right of self-defense, and, upon this request being made, said that \u201cexcusable assault\u201d had not been defined to the jury, because the court did not understand that the defendant made that claim, and supposed that the defendant\u2019s contention was that the assault was justifiable. Then, evidently paraphrasing section 203 of the Penal Code, the court said to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-13\">\"An assault is excusable when committed by accident and misfortune, in doing any lawful act by lawful means, with ordinary caution, and without any unlawfuldntent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Counsel for the defendant did not except to the omission of the court to charge as requested, but excepted xto this charge as made, and requested the court to charge\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">\u201cThat the use or attempted use of force or violence upon or towards the person of another is not unlawful when it is necessarily committed by a public officer in the performance of a legal duty, or when necessarily committed by any person in arresting one who has committed a felony, or when committed by the person about to be injured, or by any other person in his aid or defense, in preventing or attempting to prevent an offense against his person, &gt; or a trespass or other unlawful interference with his person or property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The court inquired whether counsel for the defendant was reading from the Code, and, on receiving an answer in the affirmative, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">\u201c1 do not intend to charge all the law in the Code. Excepting as I have already charged, I decline to charge. That which you read is good law, of course; but, excepting as I have already charged, I decline to charge that, proposition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">There is no evidence that the defendant was acting as a public officer in the performance of a legal duty when he shot the complainant, or that he was attempting to arrest any one who had committed a felony, or that he was aiding another person about to be injured in his person or property, or that he himself was resisting an offense against his property rights. Consequently, for the most part, the request had no application to the facts of the \"case; and the court evidently declined making it upon this ground, at the same time informing the jury that it was the law. We think the jury would understand from the instructions previously given that the defendant was not guilty if he shot the complainant in preventing or attempting to prevent an assault upon himself, and that the shooting was necessary to prevent such offense against his person. If counsel for the defendant deemed that that was not made clear to the jury, he should have made a specific request to that effect, under subdivision 3 of section 223 of the Penal Code, which he must have understood, from the remarks of the court, would have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Counsel for the defendant then requested the court to charge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">\u201cIf the only purpose of the defendant in firing his revolver was to attract attention, or to call- or summon the police, and, in so doing, one or more of the shots bit the complainant\u2014that, without any intent on the part of the defendant, the shots struck the complainant\u2014he is not guilty of any offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">\u25a0 Whereupon the court repeated the charge previously made, as to what constituted an excusable assault, and declined to charge the request, to which the defendant took an exception. This request eliminated entirely the prerequisite that the act was done to prevent an offense against the person of the defendant, and that the force or violence used was not more than sufficient to prevent such offense, and consequently the refusal to charge it constituted no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">We are also of opinion that the motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence was properly denied. It was not satisfactorily shown that it could not have been produced upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the trial, with due diligence; and we do not think it would have-changed the verdict, had it been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">It follows that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">VAN BRUNT, P.
