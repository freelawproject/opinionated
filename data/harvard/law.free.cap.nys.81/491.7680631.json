He sought to prove by paroi the removal and sale by the sheriff of the levied goods, which testimony was excluded as secondary evidence. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, on motion of defendants, the complaint was dismissed for failure to prove a cause of action. I think this was error. \u201cConversion\u201d has been defined to be an authorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of their condition, or the exclusion of the owner\u2019s rights. Black, L. Diet.; Laverty v. Snethen, 68 N. Y. 524, 23 Am. Rep. 184. It is not incumbent on plaintiff, in an action of this nature, to make out more than a prima facie case in order to put the defendant to his proof. When, as here, he has shown ownership, and the levy by the sheriff for sale, he has done all that the law requires, for the act of the sheriff was such an exercise of dominion over the goods in question as would sustain an action for either conversion or replevin, although there was no actual removal of the goods. Alvord v. Haynes, 13 Hun, 28; Knapp v. Smith, 27 N. Y. 277; Smith v. Smalley, 19 App. Div. 521, 46 N. Y. Supp. 277. It follows, therefore, that the complaint herein was improperly dismissed, and for the error thus committed the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant-to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">Judgment reversed and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">McCARTHY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
