Good v. Daland, 119 N. Y. 153, 23 N. E. 474. See Harmon v. Van Ness, 56 App. Div. 160, 67 N. Y. Supp. 561; Talman v. Barnes, 12 Wend. 227. The notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals is ineffectual for any purpose until the required undertaking has been given and a copy thereof served as required by section 1326 of the Code.

Y. 652.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b895-21\">The plaintiff, having returned the copy of the undertaking served, will not now he heard to say that the appeal became effectual by that service so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>deprive this court of jurisdiction of this application, but is ineffectual to perfect the appeal to the Court of Appeals. I believe this court has authority to require the plaintiff to accept service of the undertaking where such service, and the service of the notice of appeal was timely, but the copy of the undertaking served was returned on the ground that \u201cno appeal to the Court of Appeals is pending in the action mentioned in said undertaking. * * * \u201d Motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b896-5\">\u2022Argued before McLENNAN, P.
