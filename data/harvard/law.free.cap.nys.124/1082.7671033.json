The complaint alleges, in very general language, a cause of action growing out of an accident which occurred while the deceased was engaged in oiling machinery in defendant\u2019s rail shop at Port Jervis, and the learned court at Special Term has grant\u00e9d defendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars in respect to a portion of the matters alleged in the complaint, and denied the following, of a like nature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-12\">\u201c(1) In what respects and in what manner does plaintiff claim that the machinery provided and maintained by defendant was unusual and improper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-13\">\u201c(3) What proper and usual instructions and protection- does, plaintiff claim defendant failed to give decedent in connection with his work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1103-14\">\u201c(4) What proper and usual rules for the protection of decedent does plaintiff claim defendant failed to make, have, and promulgate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1103-15\">The complaint alleges negligence in all of these matters, but in such a general way as to make it practically impossible to determine what issues are to be met; and it is no answer to defendant\u2019s demand for a bill of particulars that defendant is in a position to know the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-16\">\u00b0 The question to be determined is what the plaintiff claims are the facts. That is the issue to be tried, and the defendant has a right to be informed Of the issues by the pleadings; a bill of particulars being a part of such pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-17\">The order appealed from should be reversed, and defendant\u2019s motion should be granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
