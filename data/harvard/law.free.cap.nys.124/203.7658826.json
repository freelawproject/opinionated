The answer sets up 65 counterclaims, and the defendant desires to examine two employ\u00e9s of the plaintiff to obtain testimony to establish said counterclaims and to ascertain the names of witnesses. The order is sought to be justified on the ground that the magnitude of the plaintiff\u2019s business is such that only its employ\u00e9s have knowledge of the particular matters in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-18\">The right to examine a witness before trial and the right to examine a party depend upon entirely different grounds, Subdivision 5 of section 872 of the Code of Civil Procedure applies to the examination of a witness. This court in this department has held that that subdivision must be read in connection with section 882, which specified what proof must be made to use the deposition upon the trial, and that the special circumstances relied upon must be such as to justify a well-grounded apprehension at least that the examination of the witness cannot be had upon the trial as well as before trial. Automobile Club of America v. Canavan, 128 App. Div. 426, 112 N. Y. Supp. 785. We have gone to the verge of what the statute permits in reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>examination of witnesses before trial in two cases. Chittenden v. San Domingo Co., 132 App. Div. 169, 116 N. Y. Supp. 829; Hill v. Bloomingdale, 136 App. Div. 652, 121 N. Y. Supp. 370. In each of those cases there were circumstances justifying an apprehension at least that the testimony sought might not be available to the party applying for it on the trial, and the examination appeared to be necessary to prevent a failure of justice. No such special circumstances are shown to exist in this case, and we cannot extend the rule further without encroaching upon the province of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
