Such evidence may be said to be newly \u201ccreated,\u201d but cannot appropriately be termed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>newly \"discovered,\u201d and obviously does not meet the requirements prescribed for the granting of new trials on the ground of newly discovered evidence. If the practice of granting new trials upon such evidence were adopted, litigations wouicl become interminable. The defeated party would only need to interview his adversary to get a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The orders of the Appellate Term and of the City Court should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements in this court and in the Appellate Term, and the motion should be denied, with $10 costs.
