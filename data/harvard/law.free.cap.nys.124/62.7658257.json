The court denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, made at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, and at the close of the whole case assumed to dismiss the complaint, without costs. The dismissal, in effect, amounted to the direction of a verdict for the defendant. Judgment was entered accordingly, and defendant appeals from so much thereof as adjudged \u201cthat the defendant recover no costs of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">The right to costs is statutory, and depends in the present case on the provisions of section 3228, subd. 4, and section 3229, of the Code of Civil Procedure. Whether the judgment is upon the merits or not, it is a final one, because it terminates the action, and the defendant consequently had an absolute right to costs. Murthey v. Burke, 121 App. Div. 400, 106 N. Y. Supp. 98. The fact that the judgment does not bar a subsequent action for the same cause of action in no wise affects the defendant\u2019s right to costs in this action, which has terminated in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">The judgment, therefore, should be modified, with costs to the appellant, so as to adjudge that defendant recover the costs of the action, to be taxed by the clerk. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
