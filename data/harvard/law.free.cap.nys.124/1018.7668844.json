The car was brought to plaintiff for such repairs by a chauffeur in the employment of the city of New York. Plaintiff refused to make repairs without an order from the city, and thereupon received on official paper the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-10\">\u201cMr. Charles Hamann, No. 27-1 Hall Street, Brooklyn, N. Y.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-11\">\u201cDear Sir: You are hereby requested to overhaul the Ranie car, used by \u2022this bureau, and place same in good condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-12\">\u201cYours truly, [Signed] P. E. Leahy,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-13\">\u201cSuperintendent of Highways, Borough of Queens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1039-14\">Leahy, as superintendent of highways, had hired the car of Boyce, -and so undertook the repairs. Why is payment demanded of Boyce? The plaintiff. testifies that, after the completion of the work, Boyce said \u201che would see I got my money.\u201d This was not a promise to pay primarily, but vouching for the debt of another. But plaintiff further relies upon defendant\u2019s promise \"made at the time the car was purchased. The evidence is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-15\">\u201cI told Mr. Boyce, when I sold this car, I told him: \u2018This car needs an overhauling.\u2019 I said: \u2018If you don\u2019t sell the car, * * * that I would like the job of overhauling the car.\u2019 Mr. Boyce said: \u2018Never mind; you will get the job of overhauling the car, whether I sell it or keep it, and I will see .you get your money.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1039-16\">Nothing more relevant occurred between the parties save as above given. Boyce at the time hoped to sell the car to the city, and so stated to plaintiff. I do not consider whether the plaintiff could rely on this promise, inasmuch as he did not. He testified that, when the car came for repairs, \u201cI asked for an order, and they gave me an order.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t work on the car until I received the letter.\u201d Credit was given to the letter and whomsoever Leahy represented. If he wrote without authority, he is himself liable. It does not appear that Boyce participated in Leahy\u2019s action. The plaintiff testified that he -asked Boyce for money, and that he promised to send a check, and did so; but it appears that plaintiff had in his possession another car owned by Boyce, and refused to deliver it without payment, and the payment related to that car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-17\">I advise that the judgment of the Municipal Court be reversed, and .a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-18\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
