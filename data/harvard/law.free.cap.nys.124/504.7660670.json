No evidence was given upon the trial. The defendant first moved to dismiss the complaint, upon the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. This motion was ' granted, and counsel for plaintiff excepted. The defendant then moved, \u201con the bill of particulars and on the pleadings, for judgment on the counterclaim for $500, the extent of the jurisdiction of this court\u201d; the court saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">\u201cBlotion granted. Judgment on the pleadings and on the counterclaim is granted to the extent of $500 in favor of the (defendant against the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">To this ruling the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">It is contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that the ruling of the court is justified by the provisions of section 349 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1903, c. 580), and section 547 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The latter section provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-15\">\u201cIf either party is entitled to judgment upon the pleadings, the court may upon motion at any time after issue joined give judgment accordingly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">This section is a portion of chapter 6 of title 3, and was inserted in such chapter by chapter 166 of the Laws of 1908. Subdivision 4 of section 3347 provides that the whole of chapter 6 applies only to an action commenced on or after September 1, 1877, in the Supreme Court, the City Court of New York, or a County Court. At the time this subdivision became operative, and at the time of the last amendment of the section of which it forms part, in any manner affecting its provisions, section 547 did not exist. On April 14, 190.3, the Municipal Court act became an operative law, section 30 providing that the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure shall apply to the Municipal Court, as far as the same can be made applicable; and six years thereafter section 547 was enacted, added to chapter 6, becoming operative on September 1, 1908. I think that the provisions of section 547 are properly applicable,to the Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s cause of action rests upon a contract evidenced by a resolution duly adopted by the defendant, alleged in full in the complaint and admitted by the defendant. It is further alleged, and not denied, that under such contract the plaintiff entered upon the discharge of his duties on April 17, 1905, and continued in defendant\u2019s employ until November 13, 1909, a period of 338 weeks, during which time he was paid by the defendant $33,363.01. No claim was made by either party that the contract is ambiguous, or required any oral testimony to explain its provisions; and the only question before the trial court was one of law arising upon the pleadings. The procedure of the trial court was right, but the conclusion reached and construction given the contract were wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The resolution, upon the provisions of which the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action rests, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\u201cOn motion duly adopted, Oswald Maune was' appointed general manager of Unity Press, and a contract authorized to be entered into between Oswald Maune and Unity Press which should contain the following conditions: That the said Oswald Maune shall agree to enter the services of Unity Press as general manager, and promise faithfully, honestly, and diligently to give and devote his time and labor exclusively to Unity Press for the space of 10 years from April 19, 3905. In consideration whereof the said Unity Press shall agree to allow and pay said Oswald Maune at the rate of one hundred ($100) dollars per week, and payable as follows, to wit: Not more than fifty ($50) dollars per week in cash. The balance remaining due and unpaid, being the difference between the whole amount paid in cash on account of wages and the total amount of wages at one hundred ($100) dollars per week for the number of weeks that he shall have faithfully and truthfully performed the duties of manager, shall be paid by issuing to him in his name shares of the common stock of the company as the sum so due and unpaid will purchase at one hundred ($100) dollars per share. The number of shares so issued shall at no time exceed 100. That if Oswald Maune or Unity Press refuse, neglect, or fail to faithfully and truthfully perform any \u25a0 condition or conditions of this agreement that it shall cease to be binding upon either party thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">It is the contention of the defendant that, as soon as the 100 shares of stock had been earned by plaintiff, his compensation for'services rendered thereafter was thereby reduced to $50 per week. This contention I believe to be without merit. The ruling was erroneous, and not warranted by the resolution. The contract plainly evidences the intent of the parties. It provides in effect that plaintiff should be paid the sum of $100 per week for his services during the entire time; that until such time as plaintiff became entitled to receive stock of the value of $10,000 such compensation should be paid $50 in cash and $50 <em>in </em>stock per week, and from and after the time when such stock allowance equaled the par value of the stock to which plaintiff\u2019s right of acquisition was limited by the contract he was entitled to receive and he paid weekly compensation of $100 in cash. That this was the construction given by the parties themselves is apparent from the fact that the defendant paid plaintiff during the time he served as its general manager at the rate of $100 per week, with the exception of the $437.99 he seeks to recover in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">It follows that the judgment of the Municipal Court must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
