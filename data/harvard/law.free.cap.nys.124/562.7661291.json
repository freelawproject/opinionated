That question is presented by its appeal from the order denying the motion for a retaxation of costs. The question of the presentation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim has been fully discussed upon the appeal from the judgment and the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, decided herewith (124 N. Y. Supp. 558); that if I am right in the conclusion there reached, I think it follows that this order should be affirmed. As there pointed out, the duty of passing upon the liability of the defendant city for the support of the poor person, out of which this controversy arises, was devolved upon the overseer of the poor; and the amount of the claim as well as its justness was for his determination. He denied the liability of the city, and I think if that section applies at all, what was done in asserting that liability against the city and the denial thereof by its overseer of the poor, a sufficient presentation of the claim to entitle the plaintiff to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">The order should therefore be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
