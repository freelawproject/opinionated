The complaint was oral, and was for services rendered by the plaintiff in the laundry of Hotel Saga-more, at Boulton Landing, N. X. The answer was a general denial. The plaintiff recovered before the justice, and the defendant appealed to the County Court, which affirmed the judgment of the justice. It appeared upon the trial that there was a written agreement between the parties, dated June 19, 1909, by which the plaintiff agreed to work for the defendant as mangle girl and to perform the duties attendant upon such a situation for \u201cthe sum of $14 per month for each and every month that I work for the interest of my employers, to be paid at the end of my service. The time of service to be computed from the commencement of actual service after arrival at the said hotel, and continuing until such time as my services may no longer be required, or until the close of -the season.\u201d The agreement also contained the following clause: \u201cIt is agreed that this is an entire contract, and in the event of my not giving satisfaction in every particular, * * * and for any disregard on my part of any of the stipulation of this contract, I may be discharged, or if I leave while my services are required I agree to forfeit the amount of $7 as liquidated damages hereby agreed upon.\u201d The plaintiff commenced work on the 19th day of June, and continued to the 8th of August, 1909. She was discharged by the defendant for refusing to work in the laundry the afternoon of Sunday, August 8th. The plaintiff recovered the balance unpaid for services up to the time she was discharged. The defendant claims that the court erred in not allowing him the $7 which the plaintiff agreed to forfeit in the provision of the agreement already quoted.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b36-15\">Argued before SMITH, P.

A construction which would compel the plaintiff to pay or allow the defendant $7 for discharging her would cause this provision of the contract to operate contrary to the intention of the parties, and should not be resorted to unless the language used demands it. I cannot discover any sufficient or satisfactory reason for such a conclusion. The language of the contract is</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u201cIn the event of my not giving satisfaction, * * * and for any disregard on my part of any of the stipulations of this contract, I may be discharged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">That is the punishment provided for that breach. It also provides that if\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">\u201cI leave while my services are required, I agree to forfeit the amount of $7 as liquidated damages hereby agreed upon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">. The forfeiture is the specific provision made by the contract for this breach, and the rule of \u201cexpressio unius\u201d would prevent a forfeiture for any other default.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">I think it is clear that the appellant\u2019s contention cannot be sustained, and that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except SMITH, P. J., and COCHRANE, J., who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
