There is no'proof of injury of any kind to the horse.The evidence is limited to the single fact that when the truck was overturned the horse was thrown to the ground. He was assisted to his feet, apparently all right, and walked to his stable, where he was fed and watered. It is not proven that he was bruised, or that there was any indication in his appearance or acts indicating his injury. The plaintiff says he looked all right, that he fed and watered h'im, and he ate everything given him. The next morning he did not eat his oats. No veterinary was called before or after his death. The plaintiff mixed liquor with his food, and he died in the afternoon. None of' the symptoms or actions of the horse during his sickness or death are shown, and there is nothing to indicate the cause of his death, or connect it in any manner with the accident, except that he was then thrown to the ground by the tipping over of the truck. This evidence is insufficient to establish the conclusion of the jury that the death of the plaintiff\u2019s horse was caused by the accident, and as the damages recovered represent the value of the horse, to which a recovery was limited by the trial court, the verdict is without evidence to sustain it, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and a new trial ordered; \u25a0costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
