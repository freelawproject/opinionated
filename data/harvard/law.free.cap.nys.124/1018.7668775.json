The will was probated November 17, 1909. The defendant, as she admits, continued to occupy the upper floor of the house, and, as plaintiff alleges, the whole house, to January 17, 1910. This action is to recover for such use and occupation. The defense is that the defendant occupied only part of the house and paid the temporary administrator for that. The order appointing a temporary administrator and authorizing him to take possession of the real property does not appear in evidence, nor is there proof thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-16\">The judgment dismissing the complaint should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur, except WOODWARD, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
