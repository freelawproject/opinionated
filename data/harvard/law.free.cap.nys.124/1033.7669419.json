At the conclusion of the trial each party submitted a decision. The court, without further notice, or requirement for settlement on notice, signed the decision submitted by the plaintiff, and the judgment directed in accord was entered. The judgment provided that the plaintiff as a private consumer of water was entitled to a supply of water to his house and to his stable through two separate service pipe\u00a7, one to each, at\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-5\">\u201ca flat rate not to exceed $22.50 per house and $5 per stable, per annum, such supply to be unlimited by meters or any other device other than the size of the taps or openings in the defendant\u2019s water mains, connecting such service pipes or pipe to house and to stable, and which taps or openings in said mains shall not exceed three-quarters (%) of an inch, inside diameter, and with the right and privilege to the plaintiff to use such supply of water upon his premises, for the usual domestic uses of water, in and about the plaintiff\u2019s premises and buildings thereon, and the defendant, its oflicers and agents, are hereby permanently enjoined until October 22, 1924, from charging or exacting a greater charge than hereinbefore stated, and from varying or altering the terms and conditions of such supply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">The amendment of the decision is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-7\">\u201cThis decision and the judgment to be entered hereon are without prejudice to the rights of the defendant to maintain the meter installed in the plaintiff\u2019s premises in pursuance of the order of Mr. Justice Tompkins, entered September 10, 1908, for the purposes stated in said order, but not for the purpose of charging for the water consumed at the metered rates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">And the judgment is resettled by adding thereunto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-9\">\u201cIt is ordered that this judgment shall be without prejudice to the rights of the defendant to maintain the meter installed in the plaintiff\u2019s premises in pursuance of the order of Mr. Justice Tompkins, entered September 10, 1908, for the purposes stated in said order, and not for the purpose of charging for the water consumed at the metered rates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">I think that the order must be reversed. The judgment expressly afforded the right to the plaintiff to take the water from the defendant in a supply \u201cunlimited by meters,\u2019\u2019 while the amendment affords the express right to the defendant to maintain a meter in the premises of the plaintiff. \u201cThe purposes stated in said order\u201d seem to be the regulation and limitation of the supply. Hence we have this situation. The judgment affords the right to a supply unlimited by meter; the amendment denies the right, save as limited by meter. The application of the defendant does not rest upon contention of any error or mistake, or that the decision is not iri accord with the record; but, in the language of Andrews, J., in Stannard v. Hubbell, 123 N. Y., at page 527, 25 N. E., at page 1086, it is \u201cto limit the legal effect of the judgment to meet some supposed equity subsequently called to its [the court\u2019s] attention.\u201d Such an order is, in the language of Freeman on Judgments, \u00a7 70, \u201cclearly judicial and revisory, being deAmted to correcting its supposed errors or its want of action, and not to making its records speak the truth.\u201d The same learned author points out in the same section, citing authorities, that in this state the omission from a decree of any matter which, if applied for on the hearing, would have been granted as a matter of course, \u201c \u2018as necessary or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>proper to carry into effect the decision of the court/ will be supplied on motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">But how can we assume, in the face of the direct provision of the judgment that the supply should be unlimited by meter, that the court upon the hearing would have awarded to the defendant the right to limit the supply by meter? For these reasons, I think that the order as made was not within the power of the Special Term. See, too, Heath v. N. Y. B. L. B. Co., 146 N. Y. 260, 40 N. E. 770; Bohlen v. M. E. R. Co. et al., 121 N. Y. 546, 24 N. E. 932. The defendant showed upon the application that no notice of settlement of the form of judgment or decision was served upon it. But I think that, in the absence of any express direction of the court, or of special arrangement of the parties, such notice was not requisite. See People v. Albany &amp; Susquehanna Railroad Co., 57 Barb. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">The order is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
