Disagreeable as is the task of determining the merit of this contention, it is a duty which, in justice to the rights of the defendants and their counsel, cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">In the course of the examination of a witness, defendants\u2019 counsel said to the witness, \u201cYou keep on enlarging and enlarging,\u201d to which remark the counsel for the plaintiff objected. The following colloquy-then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-8\">\u201cThe Court: Sustained. Counsel is censured for making foolish remarks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: I take an exception to your honor\u2019s remarks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-10\">\u201cThe Court: If I have to sit here and listen to foolishness by counsel and not be allowed to reprehend it, I won\u2019t stand for this by counsel; and, if it happens again, I will fine you or commit you, and that will be subject only to habeas corpus, and not to a mere exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-11\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: May I respectfully except to your honor\u2019s remark?-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-12\">\u201cThe Court: You may except to anything you like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-13\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: I mean to these remarks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-14\">\u201cThe Court: You may except to anything that you like, if you think it does you any good. I won\u2019t stand here or sit here and listen, as I say, to the remarks of counsel which they know to be improper, and rely upon the judge .being a dummy, and not opening his mouth to the counsel\u2019s foolish remarks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-15\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: I take an exception to the remark by the court and the insinuation that counsel assumes that the judge is a dummy, which I never did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-16\">\u201cThe Court: You must if you think you can go on that way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-17\">It seems to us clear that any one experienced in the work of the trial term must appreciate how unnecessary this colloquy was, and that, without adequate cause, it placed counsel for the defendants in the position of having been censured by the court, and threatened with fine or imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-18\">Subsequently the court undertook a prolonged cross-examination of one of the defendants\u2019 witnesses. The examination was such as to plainly show that in the opinion of the court the defendants\u2019 witness was unworthy of belief. At the close of his examination the court directed the witness to \u201cstand down,\u201d and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-19\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: Now, if your honor please, I desire to state that in-the examination, in the cross-examination conducted by your honor, I attempted to interrupt you, and you did not heed the interruption. I wanted' to make an objection to your honor putting all these questions on cross-examination of the witness, for the reason that it is improper as tending to make an impression upon the jury that your honor didn\u2019t believe this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-20\">\u201cThe Court: That is ridiculous, Mr. Rieger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-21\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: I am making an objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-22\">\u201cThe Court: I have a right to examine any \"witness that comes to the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-23\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: And I take an exception to your honor stating that my objection is ridiculous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-24\">\u201cThe Court: I stated it. It is ridiculous and will not be heeded by thccourt or the jury, and there will be no objection noted. You may move to strike out the court\u2019s examination, but you should have objected before and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>to each of the questions. The stenographer will note that the court refuses to allow an exception to the questions which are already asked and answered\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: Out of respect\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-6\">\u201cThe Court: Stop. That the counsel may move to strike out the examination, and that motion is denied on the ground that no objection was made to the questions as they were put.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: On the motion to strike out\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-8\">\u201cThe. Court: That is enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-9\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: Will your honor hear me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-10\">\u201cThe Court: That is enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-11\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: I take an exception to your honor\u2019s refusal to hear me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-12\">\u201cThe Court: No; I will not hear any more from you at all. You stand up again and make a remark to me that I think is insulting to the court, I will commit you to jail as sure as you are sitting in that chair. I will commit you and not impose a fine, but a commitment for the full term. I will not sit here and be insulted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">We think it unjust that counsel in endeavoring to protect the rights of his clients should be subjected to the treatment accorded to defendants\u2019 counsel in this case. Counsel was within his rights in noting an exception to the examination by the court. We do not mean to intimate that the court may not properly examine a witness. Where, however, the court conducts a prolonged examination of a witness, and the examination is such as to convey to the jury the impression that in the opinion of the court the witness is unworthy of belief, counsel may note an objection, so that upon review upon appeal it may not appear that he acquiesced in such examination. There was no disrespect to the court in the fact that an objection was made. Nor did the fact that counsel made an objection merit the reply that it was \u201cridiculous.\u201d After twice telling the counsel that his objection was \u201cridiculous,\u201d the court proceeded to instruct him that he should have movedl to strike the examination out and assume to deny such a motion, although it had not been made. Counsel then attempted to speak \u201con the motion to strike out,\u201d and may have intended making such a motion as the court told him he might make, but the court twice refused to permit him to be heard. When counsel excepted! to the court\u2019s refusal to hear him, he was again threatened with a commitment to prison for the full term. There were other improper remarks on the part of the trial judge, but it seems to us that enough has been quoted to show that in justice to the defendants this judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">It is no part of our duty to prescribe the rules which should govern the conduct of a trial judge. It is our duty to reverse any judgment properly before us which is not the result of a fair trial, and it is self-evident that misconduct on the part of a trial judge may make a fair trial impossible. A trial in which counsel for one of the parties is held up to ridicule by the court for making proper objections and is unjustifiably threatened with punishment by fine and imprisonment and is denied! a hearing upon relevant matters is not a fair trial. An advocate subjected to such persistent discourtesy from the court is .embarrassed in the presentation of the cause of his client, and the cause of the client is palpably prejudiced in the eyes of the jury. Every advocate who has been subjected to such an experience knows well its embarrassment and the serious manner in which it hinders a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>discharge of his duties. Counsel are bound to treat the court with courtesy and respect. It is seldom that they fail in this duty. If they do, the court is clothed with ample power to punish such misconduct. When counsel perform this duty, they are entitled as a matter of right to courtesy from the court. If the discourtesy is so gross as to hold the advocate up to the ridicule of the jury and by unjustifiable threats of fine and imprisonment to embarrass the advocate in the discharge of his duty and to prejudice the jury against his client, the rights of the parties are impaired, and such conduct is on that account subject to review by an appellate tribunal. The judge upon a trial is not a mere figurehead. He has an active duty to perform. He may properly caution, correct, admonish, or criticise counsel during the trial, provided he acts in such a manner as not to subject counsel to contempt or ridicule or to prejudice the cause of his client in the minds of the jurors. Nor is it error for the court to punish counsel for contempt in the presence of the' jury when the conduct of counsel justifies such action (Miller v. State, 32 Tex. Cr. R. 266, 22 S. W. 880), but an unjustifiable prosecution for contempt may constitute prejudicial error (Robertson v. State, 38 Tex. 187). The law wisely allows to the presiding judge a wide latitude\u2019in exerting his influence to the end that the trial shall be conducted in a suitable manner and that justice be done. The law to which the judge as well as all others are subject gives the judge no right to be insulting, or to hold counsel up to ridicule or to treat him in such a way as to prejudice the cause of his client. \u201cWe presume not,\u201d said the Supreme Court of Georgia, \u201cto' prescribe the manner of intercourse between the court and the bar. We leave that to the good sense and high breeding which so generally characterizes both, except when we find that it affects the rights of parties. Then it is within our corrective jurisdiction.\u201d Long v. State, 12 Ga. 295, 330. The advice of Lord Bacon is not without application here. \u201cThere is due from the judge,\u201d he said, \u201cto the advocate some commendation and gracing, when causes are well handled and faire pleaded, especially towards the side which obtaineth not; for that upholds, in the client the reputation of his counsel, and beats down, in him, the conceit of his cause.\u201d Sergeant Ballantine, who was himself a sufferer from judicial discourtesy, in speaking of the importance of the demeanor of a judge when upon the bench says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbY\">o\u201cHe has no excuse for discourtesy. He naturally commands the respect and consideration of all present. Fractiousness and impatience seriously impair his usefulness. They produce nervousness in counsel of inexperience, who' ought to be encouraged, if not out of kindness to themselves, for the sake of those to whom it is the duty of the judge to see, to the best of his power, that.justice is done.\u201d Sergeant Ballantine\u2019s Experiences, p. 158.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In our opinion the conduct of the trial judge was prejudicial to the rights of the parties whose cause was on trial before him, and for this reason we think the judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Judgment and order reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">BIJUR, J., concurs.
