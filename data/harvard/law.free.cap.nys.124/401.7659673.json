A verdict was directed by the trial court. The defense was payment. The appeal is based upon two grounds of supposed legal error. The complaint is attacked as not stating facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and a motion was made on the trial to dismiss it before any testimony was taken. The complaint sets forth the note, alleges its making by one of the defendants, its indorsement by the other, its discount by the plaintiff, its presentation at maturity, its nonpayment and protest, and then further alleges that no part of it has been paid. What more should have been pleaded it is difficult to conceive. The objection to its supposed insufficiency is based upon section 534 of the Code of Civil Procedure and arises, as the appellants claim, from a failure to state that \u201cthere is due * * * thereon, from the adverse party, a specified sum.\u201d A decision of the Appellate Term in New York county is cited as afi authority for -the appellants\u2019 contention. Elkan v. Edwards, 112 N. Y. Supp. 1107. That case purports to have been decided on the authority of Wright v. Deering, 2 Misc. Rep. 296, 21 N. Y. Supp. 929. In the last-cited case there was no allegation whatever of nonpayment of the note, and it was held there that, in the absence of such an allegation, there was no averment of an indebtedness. In this case, however, there is an allegation of nonpayment on presentation, and then an allegation of nonpayment generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The complaint at bar is good beyond cavil. There were, however, some rulings on the trial as to the admissibility of evidence, which may require a reversal of the judgment. The defense was payment. In support of this defense, it was sought to prove that the defendant Eacher was indebted to the plaintiff on a number of promissory notes, including the one here in suit, and that in payment and discharge of all of said obligations the defendant Eacher conveyed to one Boswell, grantee designated by the plaintiff, eight houses and received from the plaintiff a package of these notes, including, as the defendant thought, the note now in question, but which had in fact been retained by the plaintiff contrary to the mutual agreement upon which the real estate was conveyed. The transaction was carried through by the defendant Eacher and one Mintz, appearing to represent the plaintiff, under an agreement made in .the plaintiff\u2019s banking office. The court refused to allow this evidence to be considered until it was first established that Mintz had power to act for the plaintiff in the transaction in question. It was shown that Mintz had some sort of connection with the plaintiff, participating in its conduct of business, in its banking office, and that the defendant\u2019s grantee in the deeds taken under the agreement with Mintz was the assistant secretary of the plaintiff. The defendant thought that Mintz was a vice president of the plaintiff, but no proof was given that he held actually such office. There was proof that, when the deed was delivered, Mintz surrendered to Eacher some 20 or more notes held by the plaintiff against Each-er as maker or indorser. These circumstances made out at least a prima facie case of authority on the part of Mintz, which the plaintiff might rebut, if it could, by showing the exact relations between it and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Mintz. While the defendants had the burden of sustaining their defense of payment, this burden did not require an absolute demonstration on their part. The facts shown by them were susceptible of a strong inference that Mintz was the plaintiff\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
