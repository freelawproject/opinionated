Without passing upon the merits, we think a question is presented which fairly justifies the appeal, and it appears to be taken in good faith. The sole question is, then, whether a stay should be granted, and whether the relator should be admitted to bail. Without a stay, the appeal will be ineffectual. While the decisions in all jurisdictions do not appear to be uniform, they have usually turned upon the construction of the Constitution and laws of the state in which the question arose. It appears from the statement of facts in Roberts v. Reilly, 116 U. S. 80, 6 Sup. Ct. 291, 29 L. Ed. 544, that the relator in that case was admitted to bail by the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Georgia, and it was held by the court that the provisions of the Revised Statutes of the United States relating to. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>appeals in cases of habeas corpus were applicable. In People ex rel. Cockran v. Hyatt, 172 N. Y. 176, 64 N. E. 825, 60 L. R. A. 774, 92 Am. St. Rep. 706, it was held that the question of fact whether the prisoner was a fugitive from justice could be inquired into on habeas corpus proceedings, and that such proceedings were controlled by the Constitution and laws of the state of New York. Section 2015 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure are, therefore, applicable. Section-2058 provides when an appeal may'be taken. Section 2060 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u201cWhere a prisoner, who stands charged, upon a criminal accusation, with a bailable offense, has perfected, or intends to take, an appeal from a final order dismissing the proceedings, remanding him, or otherwise refusing to discharge him, made as prescribed in this article, the court or judge, upon his application, either before or after the final order, must, upon such notice to the district attorney as the court or judge thinks proper, make an order ' fixing the sum in which the applicant shall be admitted to bail, pending the appeal; and thereupon, when his appeal is perfected, he must be admitted to bail accordingly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">No question is made but that the offense charged is bailable. .If the section authorizing an appeal is applicable, the one requiring that the relator be admitted to bail must equally be applicable, and upon that point we consider the decision in People ex rel. Cockran v. Hyatt, supra, controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The motion for a stay is granted, and bail is fixed in the sum of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">SCOTT, J., while concurring in the granting of the stay, does not concur in admitting the relator to bail.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
