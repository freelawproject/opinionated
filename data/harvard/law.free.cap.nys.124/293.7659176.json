In this action attacking the validity of the last two codicils, the two sons excluded from the will, Munro, and such special legatees are not made parties. The questions are whether there is a defect of parties defendant and a failure to state a cause of action. The first and second codicils do not materially affect the question. The third codicil makes a specific devise to a daughter and a general legacy to another daughter; and the fourth codicil gives the son a general legacy, and declares that certain advances to children have been repaid. The specific devise removes property from the residuary estate, and, as regards payment of debts, places it on an equality with the specific legacies to the grandchildren and niece, and the general legacies in the codicils are coequal with Munro\u2019s legacy. Hence, Munro and the special legatees have interests to protect that give them standing to attack the validity of the codicils. Moreover, a litigation is initiated, the expenses of which may so diminish the assets first applicable to the payment of debts as finally to require the sale of the subjects of the special legacies (Stall v. Wilbur, 77 N. Y. 158), and the special legatees should be summoned and enabled to protect their interests. If it be answered that the peril is remote or absent, it is sufficient reply that the court is not and cannot be informed as to the debts and the adequacy of the assets. Nor does the statute intend that the .court shall scan the present condition of the estate or forecast its vicissitudes. Section 2653a of the Code provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">\u201cAll the flevisees, legatees and heirs of the testator and other interested persons, including the executor or administrator, must be parties to the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The intention is to herald to one final contention all to whom the will and law imputes interests and all other persons who in fact have interests, to the end that one comprehensive judgment may determine all rights and forever quiet dispute and title. Lewis v. Cook, 150 N. Y. 163, 166, 44 N. E. 778; Brinkerhoff v. Tiernan, 61 Misc. Rep. 586, 588, 114 N. Y. Supp. 698. So all the legatees should be made parties, as well as the omitted heirs at law. The demurrer, further, is that the complaint does not state a cause of action, in that it does not allege that all interested persons are parties to the action. As the statute directs this .for the purpose of estopping all persons interested, the plaintiff should plead and prove that she has brought such persons before the court for judgment. Otherwise some defendant must take that burden, and in case of default in appearance the court would not be advised. Wood v. Fagan, 126 App. Div. 581, 110 N. Y. Supp. 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
