That the objectors, the German Society of the City of New York, as attorney in fact for Joseph Orthaus et al., by Edward M. Burghard, Esq., and Louis V. Ebert, Esq., its counsel, and the administratrix, Sophia Beer, by Samuel Widder, Esq., her counsel, and the Title Guarantee &amp; Surety Company, surety on the bond of the accounting administratrix, by Adrian T. Kiernan, Esq., its counsel, have attended before me, and I have heard and considered the proofs submitted by them respectively, and upon such proofs I do find as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-12\">Findings of Fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-13\">(1) That during the course of the hearing before me, the objector, the German Society of the City of New York, withdrew objections numbered 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, leaving for determination by me objections numbered 2, 6, and 9, which are to the effect that the administratrix should be surcharged in this proceeding with at least the sum of $4,672.34.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-14\">(2) That the decedent, at the time of her death, had on deposit in the Greenwich Savings Bank of the City of New York the sum of $2,372.34, and in the German Savings Bank of the City of New York the sum of $4,095.88. That on or about the 18th day of October 1906, Sophia Beer, the administratrix, and her attorney, William E. Deane, went to said Savings Banks and withdrew in cash from said banks the amounts on deposit therein to the credit of Sophia Orthaus, to wit, the sum of $2,372.34 and $4,095.88. That the said Sophia Beer, upon receiving such payments, delivered said moneys to the said W\u00fcliam E. Deane. That thereafter, and on the same day, said Sophia Beer, with said William E. Deane, went to the Lincoln Trust Company, at 413 Broadway, city of New York, and then and there said Deane opened an account in the sum of $4,095.88, in the name of Sophia Beer, administratrix of the estate of Sophia Orthaus, deceased; she believing that all the moneys drawn by her from said savings banks had been deposited. That the said Sophia Beer did not ask for nor obtain from the said Lincoln Trust Company any bank book or pass book, nor did she know whether or not any bank book or pass book had been issued or delivered to her attorney, William E. Deane. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>That the sum of $2,372.34, the balance of the moneys drawn by the said Sophia Beer from the savings- banks as aforesaid, was not deposited in the Lincoln Trust Company, either by her or by her attorney, William E. Deane; the same being appropriated by her said attorney, William E. Deane, to his own use. That on said 18th day of October, 1906, said attorney, Deane, delivered to said Sophia Beer his personal receipt for the sum of $6,468.22. That the said Sophia Beer made no inquiries whatsoever with reference to the moneys on deposit in the Lincoln Trust Company, at any time between said 18th day of October, 1906, and the 11th day of March, 1909. That said Sophia Beer learned for the first time in March, 1909, that her former attorney, Deane, had not deposited said balance of $2,372.34 as aforesaid. That said Sophia Beer left the entire management and care of the estate to her said attorney, Deane, feeling perfectly satisfied that she was safe in the possession of his receipt for the sum of $6,468.22. That the-said Sophia Beer failed and neglected to have her pass book properly and regularly balanced at any time whatsoever between the 18th day of October, 1906, and the 11th day of March, 1909.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">(3) That on the 13th day of December, 1906, said Sophia Beer signed a check in the sum of $100 and delivered same to her attorney, William E. Deane, who thereafter raised the amount of said check to $2,100, which said check, as raised, was thereafter paid by said Lincoln Trust Company and charged against the account of said administratrix. That the said Sophia Beer was not a party to the raising of such check, this having been done entirely without her knowledge or consent. She never authorized the Lincoln Trust Company to pay over other than the original amount for which said check was drawn, namely, the sum of $100, and had no knowledge of such payment until some time in the month of March, 1909.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">(4) That on the 25th day of April, 1908, said Sophia Beer signed a check in the sum of $50, and delivered same to her attorney, William E. Deane, who thereafter raised the amount of said check to $350, which said check, as raised, was thereafter paid by said Lincoln Trust Company and charged against the account of said administratrix. That the said Sophia Beer was not a party to the raising of such check, this having been done entirely without her knowledge or consent. She never authorized the Lincoln Trust Company to pay more than the original amount for which said check was drawn, namely, the sum of $50, and had no knowledge of such payment until some time in the month of March, 1909/</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\">(5) That during the hearing before me the accounting administratrix withdrew the following items from schedule C of the original account, to wit: October 26, 1908, to William E.
