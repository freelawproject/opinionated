We are of opinion that the evidence was sufficient to permit the case to gfo to the jury upon this point, and that we are not called upon to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s driver testified that he was prevented from seeing the approaching team until it was quite near him, owing to an obstruction; that when he did see the team approaching at a rapid rate he stopped as quickly as he could; that his horse was hard-bitted, and did not stop promptly. He was driving upon a walk, following another vehicle; and, while it may seem probable that he might have stopped his horse soon enough to have avoided the collision, it is to be remembered that the jury heard all of the testimony, that they are familiar with the location, and that the plaintiff\u2019s driver had a right to drive his rig on the assumption that every other driver, in approaching a busy street intersection, would observe due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-12\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
