That the Applicant is married to a Philippine citizen and has six children, all of whom are permanently residing in the Philippines.</p>\n<p id=\"Aei\">6. That the.Applicant supports a spouse and family who are permanently residing in the Philippines and also maintains an address outside the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"ATh4\">7.

That the record is devoid of any information that Applicant made an attempt to register for the December 1977 election.</p>\n<p id=\"AN_X\">10.That the only evidence in the Applicant\u2019s favor is his oath of re-enunciation and his desire to stay in the Northern Mariana Islands. Such declaration is viewed as self-serving, made at a time when the declarant has a great deal at stake with respect to his status.</p>\n<p id=\"AN33\">In determining whether one is under a yearly employment contract, such as in the case of Applicant, is domiciled in the Northern Mariana Islands, his manner of living in the Northern Mariana Islands, taken in connection with his station in life, is relevant. There is no evidence no- record that Applicant owns anything of considerable value or permanence in the Northern Mariana Islands or that his relations to the community are such that identify him with the Northern Mariana Islands. Absence from one\u2019s domiciliary because of work or employment at another place does not bring about a change of domicile without more.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap-E\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The determination of domicile depends/upon no one fact or isolated facts, but upon all of the facts, taken together, showing a preponderance of evidence in favor of some particular place as one\u2019s domicile, or permanent place of abode.</p>\n<p id=\"Az2Z\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AEON\">Rv reason of the findings aforesaid, the Board concludes:</p>\n<p id=\"AaXd\">That the Applicant has not sustained the burden of proof on his claim of compliance with Section 8c of the Schedule of Transitional Matters of the Constitution of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"Axe\">DATED this Z-O day of 1), .1979.</p>\n<judges id=\"Arly\">BY: JOSE S.
