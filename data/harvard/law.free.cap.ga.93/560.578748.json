The order granting the motion was not placed upou any specific ground, and the plaintiff in his bill of exceptions simply excepts generally to the grant of a new trial. Even if the plaintiff\u2019s theory of the law of the case be correct, we cannot say that the evidence demanded the verdict and that there was a manifest abuse of discretion in granting a new trial. The case falls within the well settled rule of this court as to the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>grant of a new trial, and the judgment of the court below must stand <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
