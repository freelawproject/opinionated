We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Defendant Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company (Cleveland Cliffs), in partnership with defendant Empire Iron Mining Partnership, planned to expand operations at the Empire Mine in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. Cleveland Cliffs applied for a permit through the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), which held a public hearing to receive public comment. Eventually, the MDEQ issued the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Plaintiffs, on behalf of their members, filed a petition for a contested case hearing with the MDEQ. The hearing referee held that plaintiffs lacked standing and dismissed the matter. Plaintiffs then appealed to the Marquette Circuit Court, which affirmed the referee\u2019s dismissal, and the Court of Appeals denied plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Meanwhile, plaintiffs filed suit in Ingham Circuit Court (venue was later changed to Marquette County), including a count asserting a claim under MEPA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>liminary injunction of further mine expansion. The trial court denied the injunction, finding that plaintiffs lacked standing. Plaintiffs appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court analyzed the statute and found that it simply permitted \u201cany person\u201d to bring suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">This Court granted leave, limited to the issue of \u201cwhether the Legislature can by statute confer standing on a party who does not satisfy the judicial test for standing. See <em>Lee v Macomb Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>464 Mich 726 [629 NW2d 900] (2001).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Whether a party has standing is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Lee, supra </em>at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">III. STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">First, contrary to the three concurring/dissenting opinions, one of which \u201cdisavows\u201d its past support for <em>Lee, supra, </em>one of which reaffirms its past opposition to <em>Lee, </em>and one of which maintains its support for <em>Lee </em>while distinguishing it into nothingness, we reaffirm our support for the principles of standing set forth in <em>Lee, </em>and explain the importance of <em>Lee </em>for our constitutional system of separated powers and for the preservation of a judiciary operating within proper boundaries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The Michigan Constitution provides that the Legislature is to exercise the \u201clegislative power\u201d of the state, Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 1, the Governor is to exercise the \u201cexecutive power,\u201d Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 1, and the judiciary is to exercise the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1. The importance of these allocations of power is reaffirmed in Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">The powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">By separating the powers of government, the framers of the Michigan Constitution sought to disperse governmental power and thereby to limit its exercise. \u201c[T]here [is] no liberty... if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.\u201d Madison, The Federalist No 47.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">As a term that both defines the role of the judicial branch and limits the role of the legislative and execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>tive branches, it is clear that the scope of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d is a matter of considerable constitutional significance. Given the final authority of the judicial branch to accord meaning to the language of the constitution, the term \u201cjudicial power\u201d cannot ultimately be defined by the Legislature any more than \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or the \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> can ultimately be defined by the Legislature.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The \u201cjudicial power,\u201d although not specifically defined in the Michigan Constitution, is distinct from both the legislative and executive powers. As former Justice Thomas Cooley has written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">It is the province of judicial power [] to decide private disputes between or concerning persons; but of legislative power to regulate public concerns, and to make law for the benefit and welfare of the state. [Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations (Little, Brown &amp; Co, 1886) at 92.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The \u201cjudicial power\u201d has traditionally been defined by a combination of considerations: the existence of a real dispute, or case or controversy; the avoidance of deciding hypothetical questions; the plaintiff who has suffered real harm; the existence of genuinely adverse parties; the sufficient ripeness or maturity of a case; the eschewing of cases that are moot at any stage of their litigation; the ability to issue proper forms of effective relief to a party; the avoidance of political questions or other non-justiciable controversies; the avoidance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>unnecessary constitutional issues; and the emphasis upon proscriptive as opposed to prescriptive decision making.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Perhaps the most critical element of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d has been its requirement of a genuine case or controversy between the parties, one in which there is a real, not a hypothetical, dispute, <em>Muskrat v United States, </em>219 US 346; 31 S Ct 250; 55 L Ed 246 (1911), and one in which the plaintiff has suffered a \u201cparticularized\u201d or personal injury. <em>Massachusetts v Mellon, </em>262 US 447, 488; 43 S Ct 597; 67 L Ed 2d 1078 (1923). Such a \u201cparticularized\u201d injury has generally required that a plaintiff must have suffered an injury distinct from that of the public generally. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Absent a \u201cparticularized\u201d injury, there would be little that would stand in the way of the judicial branch becoming intertwined in every matter of public debate. If a taxpayer, for example, opposed the closing of a tax \u201cloophole\u201d by the Legislature, the legislation might be challenged in court. If a taxpayer opposed an expenditure for a public building, that, too, might be challenged in court. If a citizen disagreed with the manner in which agriculture officials were administering farm programs, or transportation officials\u2019 highway programs, or social services officials\u2019 welfare programs, those might all be challenged in court. If a citizen opposed new prison disciplinary policies, that might be challenged in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In each instance, the result would be to have the judicial branch of government \u2014 the least politically accountable of the branches \u2014 deciding public policy, not in response to a real dispute in which a plaintiff had suffered a distinct and personal harm, but in response to a lawsuit from a citizen who had simply not prevailed in the representative processes of government. To allow the judiciary to carry out its responsibilities in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>manner is to misperceive the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d and to establish the judicial branch as a forum for giving parties who were unsuccessful in the legislative and executive processes simply another chance to prevail. To allow this authority in the judiciary would also be to establish the judicial branch as first among equals, being permitted to monitor and supervise the other branches, and effectively possessing a generalized commission to evaluate and second-guess the wisdom of their policies. As the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Mellon-.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">The administration of any statute... is essentially a matter of public and not of individual concern.. .. The party who invokes the [judicial] power must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with the people generally. ... To [allow standing under a different understanding] would be not to decide a judicial controversy, but to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department, an authority which we plainly do not possess. <em>[Id. </em>at 487-489.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">When a broadening and redefinition of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d comes not from the judiciary itself, usurping a power that does not belong to it, but from the Legislature purporting to confer new powers upon the judiciary, the exercise of such power is no less improper. The acceptance by one branch of the expansion of the powers of another branch is not dispositive in whether a constitutional power has been properly exercised. When the Legislature redefines the \u201cjudicial power\u201d by expanding the realm of disputes cognizable by the judiciary, such expanded power on the part of the courts invariably comes at the expense of the executive, whose policies then become subject to the perpetual review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>and revision of the courts. As the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 US 555, 576-577; 112 S Ct 2130; 119 L Ed 2d 351 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">Vindicating the <em>public </em>interest (including the public interest in Government observance of the Constitution and laws) is the function of the Congress and the Chief Executive. ... To permit Congress to convert the undifferentiated public interest in executive officers\u2019 compliance with the law into an \u201cindividual right\u201d vindicable in the courts is to permit Congress to transfer from the President to the courts the Chief Executive\u2019s most important constitutional duty, to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\u201d Art II, \u00a7 3. It would enable the courts, with the permission of Congress, \u201cto assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department,\u201d and to become \u201cvirtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of Executive action. We have always rejected that vision of our role .... [Citations omitted; emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\u201cWe must as judges recall that, as Mr. Justice Holmes wisely observed, the other branches of Government \u2018are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flast v Cohen, </em>392 US 83, 131; 88 S Ct 1942; 20 L Ed 2d 947 (1968) (Harlan, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas R Co v May, </em>194 US 267, 270; 24 S Ct 638; 48 L Ed 971 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Despite the remarkable statement in Justice WEAVER\u2019S concurrence/dissent, <em>post </em>at 654, that the majority \u201cexpands the power of the judiciary,\u201d the exact opposite is true. By its adherence to <em>Lee, </em>the majority opinion rejects a constitutional regime in which the judicial branch can be invested with extra-constitutional powers at the expense of the other branches, in particular the executive. One need only be a casual student of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>government to recognize the extraordinary rarity of an institution of government, such as this Court, choosing, on the basis of constitutional objection, <em>not </em>to exercise a power conferred upon it by another branch of government. It is impenetrable reasoning to equate such an <em>abnegation </em>of power with an <em>enhancement </em>of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The requirement of a genuine case or controversy as a precondition for the exercise of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d is not a mere fine point of constitutional law. Rather, as Professor Alexander Bickel once wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">[There are] sound reasons, grounded not only in theory but in the judicial experience of centuries, here and elsewhere, for believing that the hard, confining, and yet enlarging context of a real controversy leads to sounder and more enduring judgments. [Bickel, The Least Dangerous Branch (2d ed) (Yale University Press, 1986) at 115.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Professor Bickel proceeded to observe that a contrary result in <em>Mellon </em>\u2014 one failing to recognize the importance of a plaintiff having suffered an \u201cimmediate, personal injury\u201d in order to have standing to bring a lawsuit \u2014 would have \u201cmaterially altered the function of judicial review and seriously undermined any acceptable justifications for it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <em>122.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Justice Robert Jackson has similarly written that the case or contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>versy requirement of the federal constitution is \u201cperhaps the most significant limitation upon judicial power.\u201d The Role of the Supreme Court in the American System of Government (Harvard University Press, 1955) at 101. And Justice Antonin Scalia has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-3\">The Judiciary would be, \u201cfrom the nature of its functions, .. . the [department] least dangerous to the political rights of the constitution,\u201d not because its acts were subject to legislative correction, but because the binding effect of its acts was limited to particular cases and controversies. <em>[Plaut v Spendthrift Farms, </em>514 US 211, 223; 115 S Ct 1447; 131 L Ed 2d 328 (1995), quoting Hamilton, The Federalist, No 78.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The concurrence/dissents, stating that they would overrule <em>Lee, </em>would erode one of the most significant barriers protecting the people from government by the judiciary. As Justice Harlan warned in his dissent in <em>Flast, supra </em>at 130, \u201cThere is every reason to fear that unrestricted public actions might well alter the allocation of authority among the three branches of the Federal Government.\u201d In <em>United States v Richardson, </em>418 US 166, 188; 94 S Ct 2940; 41 L Ed 2d 678 (1974), Justice Powell observed, \u201c[r]elaxation of standing requirements is directly related to the expansion of judicial power . . . significantly altering] the allocation of power at the national level, with a shift away from a democratic form of government.\u201d And in <em>Lewis v Casey, </em>518 US 343, 349-350; 116 S Ct 2174; 135 L Ed 2d 606 (1996), the Supreme Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">It is the role of courts to provide relief to claimants ... who have suffered, or will imminently suffer, actual harm; it is not the role of courts, but that of the political branches, to shape the institutions of government in such fashion as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>to comply with the laws and the Constitution.... [T]he distinction between the two roles would be obliterated if, to invoke intervention of the courts, no actual or imminent harm were needed, but merely the status of being subject to a governmental institution that was not organized or managed properly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">When courts exceed the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d the interests of some other branch of government necessarily must be implicated and, as already observed, these normally will be the interests of the executive branch. As then-Professor, later-Justice Scalia put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">[T]he law of standing roughly restricts courts to their traditional undemocratic role of protecting individuals and minorities against impositions of majorities, and excludes them from the even more undemocratic role of prescribing how the other two branches should function in order to serve the interests <em>of the majority itself. </em>[Scalia, <em>The doctrine of standing as an essential element of the separation of powers, </em>17 Suffolk U L Rev 881, 894 (1983).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Professor Kenneth Karst has described some of the practical implications of relaxing the case or controversy requirement in greater detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-9\">These developments in jurisdictional doctrine are representative of the emergence of what Abram Chayes has called \u201cpublic law\u201d litigation. In the traditional common-law model of a lawsuit there is one plaintiff and one defendant; the plaintiff personally initiates the lawsuit, and on both sides the parties control the conduct of the case; the parties\u2019 dispute concerns legal obligations founded on facts in the past; the remedies requested are closely fitted to the specific rights of the plaintiff; and the case culminates in a single trial and a single judgment. If, however, a class of plaintiffs sues a governmental institution such as a school board or the managers of a state hospital or prison, the lawsuit is likely to diverge from the common-law model. Public interest lawyers may invent the lawsuit and then go out to find some plaintiffs.... The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>whole process has a \u201clegislative\u201d or even \u201cadministrative\u201d look. The interests of the particular parties in whose name the suit was filed seem secondary. [Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court, <em>supra </em>at 458-459.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-3\">In this process, the authority of the executive branch is replaced by the authority of the judiciary, public policy decisions increasingly come to be made exclusively by lawyers in robes, the negotiation and compromise and give-and-take of the representative processes is replaced by the absolutist \u201crights\u201d analyses of individual judges, and local control of public decision making comes increasingly to be replaced by unaccountable judicial decision making. One committed to a governmental system in which most important public policy decisions are eventually made by the courts, and in which the representative processes increasingly become little more than a prelude to judicial decision making, would, almost certainly, begin by dismantling longstanding and traditional preconditions to the exercise of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d reflected in the concept of standing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Thus, we continue to adhere to <em>Lee, </em>and conclude that <em>Lee </em>was correct in its holding that questions of standing implicate the constitutional separation of powers, and that forsaking this proposition \u201cwould imperil the constitutional architecture . . ..\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735. As the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>Allen v Wright, </em>468 US 737, 751-752; 104 S Ct 3315; 82 L Ed 2d 556 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The requirement of standing... has a core component derived directly from the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">[T]he law of Art. Ill standing is built on a single basic idea \u2014 the idea of separation of powers... . [Q]uestions . .. relevant to the standing inquiry must be answered by reference to the Art. Ill notion that federal courts may exercise power only \u201cin the last resort, and as a necessity,\u201d and only when adjudication is \u201cconsistent with a system of separated powers and [the dispute is one] traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process.\u201d [Quoting <em>Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk R Co v Wellman, </em>143 US 339, 345; 12 S Ct 400; 36 L Ed 176 (1892), and <em>Flast, supra </em>at 97.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">See also <em>Lujan, supra </em>at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">If the Legislature were permitted at its discretion to confer jurisdiction upon this Court unmoored from any genuine case or controversy, this Court would be transformed in character and empowered to decide matters that have historically been within the purview of the Governor and the executive branch. If there is dispute over the manner in which the Governor is enforcing or administering a law, such dispute, in the normal course, must be resolved through the executive process. If there are citizens who believe the Governor is wrongfully or inadequately enforcing or administering the state\u2019s consumer protection or occupational safety or worker\u2019s compensation or revenue laws, it is their right to petition or lobby the Governor in order to alter these policies. It is also the right of such citizens to petition or lobby the Legislature in order to cause them to alter these laws. Finally, of course, it is the right of citizens to participate in the channels of public debate, and in the political processes, in order to influence public policies, or to place in public office persons who are more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>accommodating to their points of view. Unless there is an individual who has personally been injured by the Governor\u2019s enforcement or administration of these laws, it is not normally the role of the judicial branch to monitor the work of the executive and determine whether it is carrying out its responsibilities in an acceptable fashion. That the Legislature \u2014 perhaps even with the acquiescence of the executive \u2014 has purported to impose this role upon the judicial branch does not alter this constitutional reality. See, e.g., <em>Hayburn\u2019s Case, </em>2 US (2 Dall) 409; 1 L Ed 436 (1792), in which the United States Supreme Court refused to accept as part of its \u201cjudicial power\u201d the responsibility imposed upon it by the Congress of examining the pension claims of Revolutionary War veterans. The Court concluded that the Congress could not \u201cconstitutionally assign to the Judiciary any duties, but such as are properly judicial, and to be performed in a judicial manner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 410; see also <em>Osborn v Bank of United States, </em>22 US (9 Wheat) 738; 6 L Ed 204 (1824).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Justice WEAVER\u2019S efforts to distinguish between the United States and the Michigan constitutions in defining the \u201cjudicial power\u201d are unconvincing. She misapprehends both of these constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In the first section of the judicial articles of the federal and the Michigan constitutions, their respective judicial branches are vested simply with the \u201cjudicial power.\u201d The federal constitution states, \u201cThe judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\u201d US Const, art III, \u00a7 1. The Michigan Constitution states, \u201cThe judicial power of the state is vested exclusively in one court of justice .. ..\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1. The purpose of these sections is to define \u2014 equivalently to what has been done earlier in the first sections of the legislative and executive articles \u2014 the scope of authority of the judicial branch. That authority consists exclusively of the \u201cjudicial power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Nothing further is said in either of these constitutions specifically defining the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d with three exceptions in the Michigan Constitution, each of which undercuts the argument of the concurrence/ dissents that there is no fixed meaning to the \u201cjudicial power\u201d and that it is susceptible to constant redefinition at the discretion of the other branches.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Const <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>1963, art 3, \u00a7 8 allows either house of the Legislature to request the Court to issue an \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d on the \u201cconstitutionality of legislation\u201d; Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 32 confers upon \u201cany taxpayer of the state\u201d standing to bring suit to enforce the provisions of the so-called Headlee Amendment; and Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5 empowers \u201cany citizen of the state\u201d to bring injunctive or mandamus proceedings to enforce the civil service laws of the state. To the extent that the people of Michigan, through their Constitution, have chosen to confer upon the judiciary three specific authorities potentially beyond the traditional \u201cjudicial power,\u201d it seems unlikely that the people intended that any other such nontraditional authority could simply be incorporated as part of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d by a simple majority of the Legislature.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The concurrence/dissents find relevant that the federal constitution diverges from the Michigan Constitution where, in art III, \u00a7 2, it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">The judicial Power shall extend to all <em>Cases, </em>in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; \u2014 to all <em>Cases </em>affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; \u2014 to all <em>Cases </em>of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; \u2014 to <em>Controversies </em>to which the United States shall be a Party; \u2014 to <em>Controversies </em>between two or more States; \u2014 between a State and Citi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>zens of another State; \u2014 between Citizens of different States; \u2014 between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign states, Citizens or Subjects. [Emphasis <em>added.][</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Contrary to what is implicit in the concurrence/dissents, this is not a definitional provision that seeks to give meaning to the \u201cjudicial power.\u201d Rather, art III, \u00a7 2 is a provision defining the <em>limited </em>judicial power of the federal judiciary, in contrast to the <em>plenary </em>judicial power of the state judiciary. The respective legislative articles of the two constitutions are analogous to the judicial articles: the legislative article of the Michigan Constitution does not purport to define the authority of its Legislature (for example, nothing is said therein concerning its authority over marriage, divorce, child custody, child support, alimony, or foster care), while the legislative article of the federal constitution <em>does </em>affirmatively confer authority upon the Congress, article I, \u00a7 8. The state judicial power, as with the state legislative power, is plenary, requiring no affirmative grant of authority in the state Constitution. The federal judicial power, on the other hand, as with the federal legislative power, is limited. Such power is exclusively a function, or a creation, of the federal constitution, and, therefore, must be affirmatively set forth. In similar fashion, the federal judicial power must also be affirmatively set forth, for it is also a function, or creation, of the federal constitution. Thus, US Const, art III, \u00a7 2 does not <em>define </em>the \u201cjudicial power\u201d; rather it defines what <em>part </em>of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d within the United States belongs to the federal judiciary, with the remaining part belonging exclusively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>to the state judiciary. That art III, \u00a7 2 variously employs the terms \u201ccases\u201d or \u201ccontroversies\u201d is not to confer a particular meaning upon the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d but merely is to employ words that are necessary to the syntax of allocating the \u201cjudicial power\u201d between the federal and state governments.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The concurrence/ dissents would confuse the allocation of a power with its definition, and would thereby define the federal \u201cjudicial power\u201d in the narrowest possible manner by limiting it through reference <em>alone </em>to the existence of a \u201ccase.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Even from the perspective of the concurrence/ dissents, is there <em>no </em>more permanent aspect of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d than that it pertain to a \u201ccase\u201c?</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In fact, the \u201cjudicial power\u201d in the Michigan Constitution, with the several exceptions enumerated above, is the same \u201cjudicial power\u201d as in the federal constitution,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and it is the same \u201cjudicial power\u201d that has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>informed the practice of both federal and state judiciaries for centuries.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These historical principles were recognized by <em>Lee, </em>and we continue to adhere to them today.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">At the same time that the concurring/dissenting justices extol their own commitment to preservation of the natural environment, they might well devote equal attention to the preservation of our constitutional environment. By their diminishment of a traditional check and balance upon the exercise of the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d the concurring/dissenting justices would, if their position were ever to gain a majority, inflict considerable injury upon our system of separation of powers and the rule of law that it has produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">IV APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">At a minimum, standing consists of three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d \u2014 an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \u201cactual or imminent, not \u2018conjectural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical.\u2019 \u201d Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>conduct complained of \u2014 the injury has to be \u201cfairly... traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not... the result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u201d Third, it must be \u201clikely,\u201d as opposed to merely \u201cspeculative,\u201d that the injury will be \u201credressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>[Lee, supra </em>at 739, quoting <em>Lujan, supra </em>at 560-561.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-3\">Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief on behalf of their members. Nonprofit organizations, such as plaintiffs, have standing to bring suit in the interest of their members where such members would have standing as individual plaintiffs. See, generally, <em>Trout Unlimited, Muskegon White River Chapter v White Cloud, </em>195 Mich App 343, 348; 489 NW2d 188 (1992); <em>Karrip v Cannon Twp, </em>115 Mich App 726, 733; 321 NW2d 690 (1982). Thus, plaintiffs must allege that their members suffered either an actual injury or an \u201cimminent\u201d injury. <em>Lee, supra </em>at 739-740, citing <em>Lujan, supra. </em>The United States Supreme Court in <em>Friends of the Earth, Inc v Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc, </em>528 US 167, 183; 120 S Ct 693; 145 L Ed 2d 610 (2000), found \u201cenvironmental plaintiffs adequately allege injury in fact when they aver that they use the affected area and are persons \u2018for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area will be lessened\u2019 by the challenged activity\u201d (citation omitted). The Court continued, contrasting the allegations with those found insufficient in <em>Lujan </em>and <em>Los Angeles v Lyons, </em>461 US 95; 103 S Ct 1660; 75 L Ed 2d 675 (1983) (regarding anticipated use of chokeholds by the LAPD):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\">[W]e see nothing \u201cimprobable\u201d about the proposition that a company\u2019s continuous and pervasive illegal discharges of pollutants into a river would cause nearby residents to curtail their recreational use of that waterway and would subject them to other economic and aesthetic harms. The proposition is entirely reasonable, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Court found it was true in this case, and <em>that is enough for injury in fact. [Friends of the Earth, Inc, supra </em>at 184-185 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Plaintiffs here provided affidavits from three individuals, members of their organizations who reside near the mine, who alleged they bird-watched, canoed, bicycled, hiked, skied, fished, and farmed in the area, they plan to continue to do so as long as the area remains unspoiled, and they are \u201cconcerned\u201d that the mine expansion will irreparably harm their recreational and aesthetic enjoyment of the area. One affiant also alleged that his well, on property adjacent to the mine, was almost dry and he had to construct a new, deeper well due to the local aquifer dropping too low. He alleged this was because of defendants\u2019 mining activities. These affidavits are nearly identical to those found adequate in <em>Laidlaw, </em>and we find they sufficiently meet the test for standing we set forth in <em>Lee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">However, we note that plaintiffs may not simply rely on these affidavits throughout the entire proceedings to prove that standing exists. Subject-matter jurisdiction is a matter that may be raised at any time. MCR 2.116(D)(3). The United States Supreme Court explained the requirements in <em>Lujan, supra </em>at 561:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements [i.e., injury in fact, causation, redressibility]. Since they are not mere pleading requirements but rather an indispensable part of the plaintiffs case, each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, <em>i.e., </em>with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation. At the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant\u2019s conduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss we \u201cpresume that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>the claim.\u201d In response to a summary judgment motion, however, the plaintiff can no longer rest on such \u201cmere allegations,\u201d but must \u201cset forth\u201d by affidavit or other evidence \u201cspecific facts,\u201d which for purposes of the summary judgment motion will be taken to be true. And at the final stage, those facts (if controverted) must be \u201csupported adequately by the evidence adduced at trial.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-3\">Thus, a plaintiff must include in the pleadings \u201cgeneral factual allegations\u201d that injury will result from the defendant\u2019s conduct. If the defendant brings a motion for summary disposition, the plaintiff must further support the allegations of injury with documentation, just as he has to support the other allegations that make up his claim. Finally, when the matter comes to trial, the plaintiff must sufficiently support his claim, including allegations of injury, to meet his burden of proof.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">In this case, the response to defendants\u2019 motion is met by the affidavit of plaintiffs expert, Christopher Grobbel. Included in that document is an explanation of the expected effect on groundwater flow and recharge rate; effects on stream flow and water quality; and the expected effects on birds, fish, and plants resulting from the planned extensive habitat destruction. Grobbel\u2019s affidavit serves to provide the necessary factual support for the individuals\u2019 averred injuries. Plaintiffs will, of course, be required at trial to meet their burden of proof regarding the alleged injuries and the alleged effects of the expansion plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Because we hold that plaintiffs have standing without regard to MCL 324.1701(1), we find it unnecessary to reach the constitutionality of \u00a7 1701(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">V RESPONSE TO CONCURRENCE/DISSENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Justice WEAVER expresses dissatisfaction with the fact that plaintiffs have been found by the majority to possess standing to pursue their MEPA claims, but not on the constitutional grounds that she would prefer. It seems that it is not enough that plaintiffs prevail, but that their victory must be predicated, not upon the resolution of a mere case or controversy, but upon the constitution itself. The majority concludes that it is unnecessary in this case to resolve a constitutional issue where the case can be fully resolved on nonconstitutional grounds. Just as respect for the requirements of standing is an essential element of the responsible exercise of the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d so too is respect for the need to address constitutional issues only where necessary. Given her very different views of standing, it is understandable why Justice WEAVER, unlike this majority, would find the constitutional question here to be an easy one. However, notwithstanding the merits of our respective views on standing, constitutional issues\u2014 whether easy or difficult \u2014 are to be avoided where a case can be resolved adequately on non-constitutional grounds.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Several other aspects of Justice WEAVER\u2019S opinion deserve comment, as does the opinion of Justice KELLY:</p>\n<p id=\"AI1\">(1) Justice WEAVER asserts that, despite <em>Lee, </em>Michigan\u2019s standing requirement is not constitutional, but rather is nothing more than \u201cjudge-made\u201d law. <em>Post </em>at 653 n 4.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is hard to know what to make of this dismissive observation. Justice WEAVER does not explain why <em>Lee </em>constitutes \u201cjudge-made\u201d law any more than any other interpretation of the constitution, except that she disagrees with <em>Lee. </em>Whatever \u201cjudge-made\u201d law is, <em>Lee </em>does not constitute \u201cjudge-made\u201d law any more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>than <em>Marbury v Madison, </em>5 US (1 Cranch) 137; 2 L Ed 60 (1803); <em>McCulloch v Maryland, </em>17 US 316; 5 L Ed 579 (1819), or <em>Brown v Bd of Ed, </em>347 US 483; 74 S Ct 686; 98 L Ed 2d 873 (1954). Some judicial opinions interpreting the Constitution, of course, may be more persuasive than others, but all are presumed to articulate the meaning of the Constitution rather than the personal views of a judge. In <em>Lee, </em>this Court, expounding upon the constitutional status of standing in Michigan, relied upon federal and state judicial precedents, as well as historical understandings, and in the instant opinion, we elaborate upon this analysis by looking to the meaning of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d under the constitution. While Justice WEAVER is certainly free to disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis, and while there is room for reasonable debate, the majority\u2019s constitutional holding is no more properly characterized as \u201cjudge-made\u201d law than any other interpretation of the constitution. What constitutes the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d just as what constitutes \u201cequal protection of the laws,\u201d \u201cdue process,\u201d and \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d cannot be determined by some mechanical process, but must be given <em>meaning </em>by judges attempting in good faith to understand the intentions of those who ratified these provisions. If constitutional interpretations with which she disagrees are mere \u201cjudge-made\u201d law, how would Justice WEAVER characterize interpretations with which she agrees, perhaps even those interpretations produced by her own pen?</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">(2) Justice WEAVER asserts that the majority discussion of standing is, by virtue of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 52, \u201cirrelevant to the important questions of Michigan law presented in this case.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 651 n 1. Art 4, \u00a7 52 states, in part, \u201cThe legislature shall provide for the protection of the air, water and other natural resources of the state from pollution, impairment and destruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>tion.\u201d Justice WEAVER contends that, pursuant to this provision, \u201cthe people of Michigan have required that the Legislature provide for the protection of Michigan\u2019s natural resources. The Legislature properly acted in fulfillment of its constitutional responsibility through enactment of the MEPA citizen-suit provision . . . ,\u201d and thus any constitutional standing concerns are irrelevant where MEPA is concerned. <em>Post </em>at 651-652.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">What Justice WEAVER overlooks, however, is that there are many requirements that are imposed upon the Legislature by the constitution. For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">\u2014 The Legislature \u201cshall implement\u201d legislation protecting civil rights. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">\u2014 The Legislature \u201cshall enact\u201d laws to preserve the integrity of elections. Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">\u2014 The Legislature \u201cshall implement\u201d the rules of initiatives and referendums in Michigan. Const 1963, art 2, \u00a79.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-8\">\u2014 The Legislature \u201cshall further implement\u201d rules against conflicts-of-interests by legislators. Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">\u2014 The Legislature \u201cshall implement\u201d the provisions of the Headlee Amendment pertaining to tax limitations. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 34.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">While undoubtedly making clear what some of the priorities and obligations of government are, these constitutional provisions do not state that the Legislature may pursue these goals, as Justice WEAVER implies, <em>by whatever means. </em>Rather, it is implicit in these provisions that the Legislature is to pursue these goals <em>by appropriate means. </em>The Legislature cannot pursue the objects of these \u201cshall do\u201d provisions by methods that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>are otherwise unconstitutional. Does Justice WEAVER think that the Legislature is empowered under art 4, \u00a7 52 to do <em>anything at all </em>so long as it is done ostensibly with the goal of protecting the environment? Can it disregard due process in the criminal prosecution of environmental polluters? Can it disregard the requirements of just compensation in taking property in order to construct a wilderness area? Can it ignore the prohibition against ex post facto laws by criminalizing conduct that was legal at the time it took place?</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Moreover, can the Legislature, under art 1, \u00a7 2 (requiring it to implement civil rights laws), expand the \u201cjudicial power\u201d by enacting laws allowing \u201cany person\u201d to sue for a civil rights violation committed against \u201cany other person,\u201d even if the actual victim chooses not to sue? Can the Legislature, under art 9, \u00a7 34 (requiring it to implement tax-limitation provisions), expand the \u201cjudicial power\u201d by authorizing \u201cany person\u201d in Monroe or Hillsdale to sue to prevent a tax increase in Marquette or Escanaba? Can the Legislature, under art 2, \u00a7 4 (requiring it to enact election laws), expand the \u201cjudicial power\u201d by authorizing \u201cany person\u201d in Kalamazoo or Battle Creek to sue over ballot disagreements in the Alpena city council race?</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">While clearly identifying an important priority of government, art 4, \u00a7 52 does not authorize the Legislature to ignore all other provisions of the constitution in enacting laws to protect the environment. At least to date, the \u201cjudicial power\u201d in Michigan has been exercised only on behalf of plaintiffs who have suffered actual and particularized injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">(3) Justice WEAVER repeatedly asserts that this Court, in exercising the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d must act in conformity with MEPA. <em>Post </em>at 653, 654, 666. In this assertion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>she fundamentally misapprehends the duties of the judicial branch. As the Michigan Constitution makes clear, the duty of the judiciary is to exercise the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d art 6, \u00a7 1, and, in so doing, to respect the separation of powers, art 3, \u00a7 2. While as a <em>general proposition, </em>the proper exercise of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d will obligate the judiciary to give faithful effect to the words of the Legislature \u2014 for it is the latter that exercises the \u201clegislative power,\u201d not the judiciary\u2014 such effect cannot properly be given when to do so would contravene the constitution itself. Just as the judicial branch owes deference to the legislative branch when the \u201clegislative power\u201d is being exercised, so too does the legislative branch owe deference to the judicial branch when the exercise of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d is implicated. Even with the acquiescence of the legislative and executive branches, the judicial branch cannot arrogate to itself governmental authority that is beyond the scope of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d under the constitution. See <em>Marbury v Madison, supra. </em>The \u201ctextual\u201d approach of the concurring/dissenting justice is a caricatured textualism, in which the Legislature is empowered to act <em>beyond </em>its authority in conferring powers upon other branches that are also <em>beyond </em>their authority.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">In the final analysis, the constitutional responsibility of the judiciary is to act in accordance with the constitution and its system of separated powers, by exercising the judicial power and only the judicial power.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>(4) Justice WEAVER asserts that the majority\u2019s decision \u201coverrules 30 years of Michigan case law that held that the Legislature meant what it said when it allowed \u2018any person\u2019 to bring an action in circuit court to protect natural resources from actual or likely harm.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 652. In support of this proposition, she cites <em>Eyde v Michigan, </em>393 Mich 453, 454; 225 NW2d 1 (1975), and <em>Ray v Mason Co Drain Comm\u2019r, </em>393 Mich 294, 305; 224 NW2d 883 (1975). However, neither of these decisions, issued in the aftermath of MEPA\u2019S passage, offer the slightest support for the concurrence/dissent\u2019s conclusion. Unlike the present case, neither <em>Eyde </em>nor <em>Ray </em>concerned the issue of standing and neither involved plaintiffs concerning whom there was any question of standing. Rather, in <em>Eyde </em>and <em>Ray, </em>this Court did nothing more than describe, in passing, the substance of the various provisions of the new act. Such statements do not even rise to the level of dictum since in neither <em>Eyde </em>nor <em>Ray </em>did this Court even purport to comment upon the propriety of the standing provision, much less comment upon it approvingly. The statements in <em>Eyde </em>and <em>Ray </em>make no pretense of being statements of law; they are merely passing, but accurate, descriptions of what was contained in the new act. Because of what these statements constituted \u2014 mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>descriptions of provisions of an act not then in dispute \u2014 it is understandable why neither <em>Eyde </em>nor <em>Ray </em>set forth any analysis of the meaning of these provisions, any analysis of their constitutional implications, any analysis of relevant judicial precedents, and even any acknowledgment of relevant judicial precedents. See <em>Smith v Globe Life Ins Co, </em>460 Mich 446, 461 n 7; 597 NW2d 28 (1999).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Yet, it is on the basis of <em>Eyde </em>and <em>Ray </em>that Justice WEAVER identifies \u201c30 years of Michigan case law\u201d in support of the proposition that matters of standing do not implicate the Constitution.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">(5) Justice WEAVER accuses the majority of \u201cexpanding] the power of the judiciary at the expense of the Legislature....\u201d <em>Post </em>at 654. This accusation turns reality upon its head. It is akin to saying that President Washington was expanding his own powers by turning down congressional invitations to become King. Rather than <em>expanding </em>its powers, this Court, by questioning the authority of the Legislature to confer broader powers upon it, and thereby to expand the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d is <em>resisting </em>an expansion of power \u2014 not an everyday occurrence in the annals of modern government.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">By ensuring that the \u201cjudicial power\u201d not be improperly expanded by the Legislature, and the \u201cexecutive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>power\u201d not be improperly contracted, this Court is defending the constitutional structure. In similar fashion, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Marbury v Madison, supra, </em>concluded that a congressional grant of authority to the Court to issue writs of mandamus could not be exercised because the constitution did not allow the original jurisdiction of that Court to be expanded by mere statute. As Chief Justice Marshall stated, \u201cIt is a proposition too plain to be contested, that the constitution controls any legislative act repugnant to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177. The Michigan Constitution grants this Court the \u201cjudicial power\u201d \u2014 nothing more and nothing less \u2014 and neither the Legislature nor this Court itself possess the authority to redefine these limits.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>(6) In attempting to understand Justice KELLY\u2019S opinion, it is important to recognize that she takes great care to proclaim, <em>post </em>at 676 n 1, that, despite all contrary appearances, she is not <em>\u201cen toto\u201d </em>overruling <em>Lee. </em>The effect of this analysis on the part of the concurring justice is to allow her to enjoy the freedom to discard traditional principles of standing when it is useful to do so, as in this case, and then to reassert such principles, per <em>Lee, </em>when that is equally useful.

This is essentially a euphemism for the proposition that this provision should not be read to mean very much of anything at all. It is hardly an \u201coverly rigid\u201d reading to suggest that, \u201c[n]o person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch\u201d in art 3, \u00a7 2 means that a judge is limited to exercising the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d and not the powers of another branch. This is made <em>explicit </em>in art 6, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Moreover, Justice KELLY\u2019S understanding of the separation of powers is confused, as reflected in her citation of the dissenting opinions in <em>Judicial Attorneys Ass\u2019n v Michigan, </em>459 Mich 291, 307; 586 NW2d 894 (1998); 228 Mich App 386, 427; 579 NW2d 378 (1998), for the proposition that the \u201cseparation of powers doctrine allows limited overlap and interaction between the branches.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 682. Of course, in pursuit of their <em>distinct </em>constitutional powers, it will often be the case that the <em>exercise </em>of separated powers overlaps. For example, it may be that the Legislature in exercising its legislative power to enact laws and appropriate monies will sometimes come into conflict with the Governor in exercising her executive power to recommend or veto laws and appropriations. Although the separated <em>powers </em>of the legislative and executive branches do not overlap, their <em>exercise </em>often does. The separate and distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>constitutional powers of two branches may be focused on the same subject areas and the operations of state government may occasionally involve a blending of governmental operations as, for example, in the interaction between the legislative and executive branches regarding the drafting of a law or the preparation of a budget. But this is distinct from a blending of powers or functions. However much cooperation there is between the branches, the Legislature exercises only the legislative power and the executive exercises only the executive power. While the exercise of such separated powers may often overlap \u2014 this being understood generally as the realm of checks and balances \u2014 there is no \u201csharing\u201d of the legislative or executive powers. There is only a sharing of the sum of all state governmental power.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">(9) Justice KELLY makes much of the concepts of citizen suits and private attorneys general, yet fails to note that the history of such suits indicates that they have been brought only by individuals who have suffered an injury. This understanding continues today.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Justice KELLY correctly notes that \u201ccitizen suits\u201d have a long pedigree in English history through relator and informers\u2019 actions. She fails to explain, however, that those who brought such actions were not strangers to the action, but possessed standing themselves either through a direct injury or through the assignation of the government\u2019s injury in fact. The historical use of such actions was explained by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v United States ex rel Stevens, </em>529 US 765, 774-777; 120 S Ct 1858; 146 L Ed 2d 836 (2000), using the label \u201cqui tam\u201d actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-6\"><em>Qui tam </em>actions appear to have originated around the end of the 13th century, when private individuals <em>who had suffered injury </em>began bringing actions in the royal courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>on both their own and the Crown\u2019s behalf. </em>See, e.g., <em>Prior of Lewes v. De Holt </em>(1300), reprinted in 48 Selden Society 198 (1931). Suit in this dual capacity was a device for getting their private claims into the respected royal courts, which generally entertained only matters involving the Crown\u2019s interests. See Milsom, Trespass from Henry III to Edward III, Part III: More Special Writs and Conclusions, 74 L. Q. Rev 561, 585 (1958). Starting in the 14th century, as the royal courts began to extend jurisdiction to suits involving wholly private wrongs, the common-law <em>qui tarn </em>action gradually fell into disuse, although it seems to have remained technically available for several centuries. See 2 W Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 369 (8th ed. 1824).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">At about the same time, however, Parliament began enacting statutes that explicitly provided for <em>qui tam </em>suits [which] allowed injured parties to sue in vindication of their own interests (as well as the Crown\u2019s), see, e.g., Statute Providing a Remedy for Him Who Is Wrongfully Pursued in the Court of Admiralty, 2 Hen. IV, ch. 11 (1400). [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Accordingly, the Court held that one who brings a relator suit has standing because he is the assignee of a claim and may assert the injury-in-fact suffered by the assignor, which is normally the government. <em>Id. </em>at 773. In such cases, the Court concluded, the government\u2019s injury-in-fact suffices to confer standing on the individual relators bringing the suit. <em>Id. </em>at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Similarly, a review of modern citizen suit cases almost always includes a review of standing in addition to a review of the statute that confers the right to such suits. See, e.g., <em>Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd v Chesapeake Bay Foundation, </em>484 US 49, 65-66; 108 S Ct 376; 98 L Ed 2d 306 (1987). Further, like citizen suits, suits by private attorneys general do not involve those completely divorced from an injury; rather, they involve those who have suffered an injury \u2014 generally \u201cnoneconomic\u201d injuries \u2014 and who have been provided an incen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>tive by the legislature to bring a lawsuit to advance the public interest. See <em>Middlesex Co Sewerage Authority v Nat\u2019l Sea Clammers Ass\u2019n, </em>453 US 1, 17; 101 S Ct 2615; 69 L Ed 2d 435 (1981). As the United States Supreme Court noted, the point of the doctrine is that \u201cdirectly <em>injured </em>victims can be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general, without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely.\u201d <em>Holmes v Securities Investor Protection Corp, </em>503 US 258, 269-270; 112 S Ct 1311; 117 L Ed 2d 532 (1992) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">Therefore, contrary to Justice KELLY\u2019S assertions, the use of citizen suits or actions by private attorneys general does not undermine the application of traditional standing requirements. If anything, the use of such suits <em>supports </em>the application of those requirements, as citizen suits and actions by private attorneys general have always been grounded in a private injury, whether suffered directly or as a result of an assignment by another.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">(10) Justice WEAVER, referencing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Preserve the Dunes v Dep\u2019t of Environmental Quality, </em>471 Mich 508; 684 NW2d 847 (2004), derides the majority for having \u201cunleashed an assault on MEPA this term.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 674 n 31.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> However, the legal issue addressed in <em>Preserve the Dunes </em>has utterly <em>nothing </em>in common with the legal issue addressed in this decision, and to rhetorically equate these decisions merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>because they both implicate an environmental statute suggests less a legal analysis on the part of the concurring/dissenting justice than a political statement. It is this Court\u2019s responsibility simply to uphold the law and the constitution, not to promote or impede any particular legislative cause or interest, however popular or unpopular. Rather, the obligation of this Court is simply to say what the law is. And that is exactly what the justices in the majority have sought to do in this case, as they have each sought to do \u2014 however imperfectly \u2014 in every case coming before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The majority cannot read the concurring/dissenting justice\u2019s conflation of wholly unrelated legal issues in a single derisive volley as anything other than implying that this Court has some obligation to decide environmental issues with an eye toward their results.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> However, that the issue of standing has arisen here in the context of MEPA is, from the perspective of the majority, utterly irrelevant. The majority would be addressing this critical constitutional issue in identical terms if it had arisen in any other subject area of the law, and it would be no more of an \u201cassault upon MEPA\u201d than the present decision is an \u201cassault upon MEPA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Further, in the other case referenced, <em>Preserve the Dunes, </em>in which this same majority has also allegedly \u201cassaulted MEPA,\u201d this Court addressed the following specific legal question \u2014 whether MEPA authorizes a collateral action to challenge the Department of Environmental Quality\u2019s decision to issue a permit under the Sand Dune Mining Act, MCL 324.63701, enacted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Legislature, where that collateral action seeks to challenge flaws in the permitting process <em>unrelated </em>to whether the conduct involved has polluted, or will likely pollute, natural resources. We can only invite the reader of the instant opinion to also read <em>Preserve the Dunes </em>to determine whether that opinion represents an \u201cassault on MEPA,\u201d or instead an honest and impartial effort to resolve the limited question of statutory interpretation presented in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Justice WEAVER\u2019S \u201cassault on MEPA\u201d rhetoric becomes even more groundless when one recognizes that she is dissatisfied with the majority for having concluded that it is <em>unnecessary to interpret </em>MEPA at all in resolving the present standing controversy. Instead, we conclude that plaintiffs possess standing on traditional grounds. Thus, in the end, the majority\u2019s \u201cassault upon MEPA\u201d amounts merely to the majority <em>refraining </em>from interpreting MEPA.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">In addressing an issue that the majority does not resolve today, Justices WEAVER and KELLY would allow the Legislature to grant plaintiffs standing in environmental lawsuits, regardless of whether any injury has been suffered. Under this view of the \u201cjudicial power,\u201d \u201cany person,\u201d for example, could seek to enjoin \u201cany person\u201d from mowing his lawn with a gas-powered mower because such activity allegedly creates air pollution and uses fossil fuels when other alternatives are available. \u201cAny person\u201d could sue \u201cany person\u201d for using too much fertilizer on his property, or allowing too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>much runoff from a feedlot on his property. \u201cAny person\u201d could sue \u201cany person\u201d from using excessive amounts of pesticides in his home or garden or farm. \u201cAny person\u201d could sue \u201cany person\u201d for improperly disposing of used petroleum-based oils. \u201cAny person\u201d could sue \u201cany person\u201d for improper backyard grilling practices, excessive use of aerosol sprays and propellants, or wasteful lawn watering.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">We can only assume that the concurring/dissenting justices\u2019 casualness about eliminating traditional rules of standing suggests that they are not fully aware of the world that they would create. It is a world in which any conduct allegedly affecting the environment might result in litigation if <em>anyone, anywhere, </em>for <em>any </em>reason, felt aggrieved. The potential for abuse under such a circumstance explains at least one of the practical reasons why the enforcement of regulatory laws has generally been limited to officers of the executive branch, and why, from time immemorial, standing has required an individualized injury on the part of a plaintiff. The concurring/dissenting justices would replace the judgment and discretion of the executive branch with an enhanced regime of lawsuits, a regime in which judges increasingly substitute their own views for those of the Governor, the Attorney General, and their appointees.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>This Court reaffirms <em>Lee </em>and concludes that, under the circumstances of this case, plaintiffs, on behalf of their members, possess standing to pursue the instant cause of action.

Two justices, Stevens and Ginsburg, in dissent indicated their willingness to accept this modified conception of the \u201cjudicial power.\u201d \u201cWe must remember that the machinery of government would not work if it were not allowed a little play in its joints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266 (Stevens, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Bain Peanut Co v Pinson, </em>282 US 499, 501; 51 S Ct 228; 75 L Ed 482 (1931). Nor, when the \u201cjudicial power\u201d becomes a mere function of legislative determination, is there any guarantee that this authority will only be broadened.

[MCL 324.1701(l)(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The majority disregards the intent of the Legislature, erodes the people\u2019s constitutional mandate, and overrules 30 years of Michigan case law that held that the Legislature meant what it said when it allowed \u201cany person\u201d to bring an action in circuit court to protect natural resources from actual or likely harm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">In this case, this Court specifically asked the question whether the Legislature may confer standing under MCL 324.1701(1) of MEPA on persons who do not satisfy the judicial test for standing articulated by <em>Lee v Macomb Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>464 Mich 726; 629 NW2d 900 (2001). The majority purports to not decide this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>question, but it clearly implies that the Legislature\u2019s attempt to confer standing more broadly than <em>Lee </em>in MEPA <em>or any other statute </em>is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Fortunately for the plaintiffs in this case the majority concludes that the plaintiffs have standing under the judge-made test articulated in Lee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In so holding, the majority purports to exercise judicial restraint, asserting that it is preserving the \u201cseparation of powers\u201d by not exercising the \u201cpower\u201d conferred upon it by the Legislature under MEPA and applying Lee\u2019s restrictive standing test to these MEPA plaintiffs. This assertion is untrue because MEPA empowered the <em>people </em>to help protect the state\u2019s natural resources, not the courts, and because the majority has in fact laid out its position on the constitutional question. Though camouflaged by the correct result, it is clear that the majority would hold that the Legislature may not grant standing more broadly than <em>Lee. </em>The majority can wait for a future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>case that has not drawn public attention<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to openly and directly declare the MEPA citizen-suit standing provision unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The majority\u2019s application of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>judicial standing test to these plaintiffs imposes unprecedented, judge-made restrictions on MEPA plaintiffs\u2019 access to the courts. The majority\u2019s decision overrules without discussion 30 years of precedent, imposes on all future MEPA plaintiffs the burden of establishing standing under the restrictive test of <em>Lee, </em>and undermines the people\u2019s mandate expressed by Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 52 that the Legislature provide for the protection of Michigan\u2019s natural resources. While pretending to limit its \u201cjudicial power,\u201d the majority\u2019s application of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>judicial standing test in this case actually expands the power of the judiciary at the expense of the Legislature by undermining the Legislature\u2019s constitutional authority to enact laws that protect natural resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The majority\u2019s failure to adhere to MEPA\u2019s \u201cany person\u201d standard will have far-reaching consequences and will affect plaintiffs\u2019 access to courts in more than just the environmental arena. For example, while resolving the case on other grounds, the Court of Appeals in <em>Cuson v Tallmadge Charter Twp, </em>unpublished opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>ion per curiam, issued May 15, 2003 (Docket No. 234157), applied <em>Lee </em>to note that the plaintiffs did not have standing under <em>Lee </em>to enjoin future violations of the Open Meetings Act, MCL 15.261 <em>et seq. </em>The panel did not address \u00a7 11(1) of that Open Meetings Act, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-4\">If a public body is not complying with this act, the attorney general, prosecuting attorney in which the public body serves, or <em>a person </em>may commence a civil action to compel compliance or to <em>enjoin further noncompliance with this act. </em>[Emphasis added.][6]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Thus, it cannot be denied that this case concerns more than the people\u2019s constitutional mandate that the Legislature protect the environment and the Legislature\u2019s attempt through MEPA\u2019s citizen-suit provision to do so. It also concerns every statutory grant of standing that is broader than <em>Lee\u2019s </em>standing test.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Consequently, while I concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs have standing to bring this action, I dissent from the majority\u2019s imposition of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>judicial standing test in this case. Further, I disagree with the majority\u2019s inappropriate suggestion, in its reliance on inapplicable federal law, that the plaintiffs\u2019 victory may be short-lived. <em>Ante </em>at 630-631 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>and 631 n 20.

I would further conclude that the Legislature did expressly confer standing on \u201cany person\u201d under MCL 324.1701(1).

Yet the federal courts are bound not only by judicially imposed prudential considerations, but also by federal constitutional limitations on standing imposed by article III of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Warth, supra at </em>498. Federal constitutional standing limitations involve \u201cwhether the plaintiff has made out a \u2018case or controversy\u2019 between himself and the defendant within the meaning of article III of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">The United States Supreme Court has made clear that article Ill-based constraints apply to every person who seeks to invoke federal court jurisdiction. <em>Bennett v Spear, </em>520 US 154, 162; 117 S Ct 1154; 137 L Ed 2d 281 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>(1997). However, the United States Supreme Court has also made clear that article Ill-based constraints are distinguishable from federal prudential constraints, because prudential constraints can be \u201cmodified or abrogated by Congress .. . .\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Before <em>Lujan, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court described the difference between federal constitutional and federal prudential constraints on standing in <em>Sierra Club, supra </em>at 732:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\">Where the party does not rely on any specific statute authorizing invocation of the judicial process, the question of standing depends upon whether the party has alleged such a \u201cpersonal stake in the outcome of the controversy,\u201d <em>Baker v.

Where, however, Congress has authorized public officials to perform certain functions according to law, and has provided by statute for judicial review of those actions under certain circumstances, the inquiry as to standing must begin with a determination of whether the statute in question authorizes review at the behest of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">There has never been a federal case applying article Ill\u2019s case or controversy based standing constraints to state courts. As noted by Justice Kennedy writing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the Court in <em>ASARCO, Inc v Kadish, </em>490 US 605, 617; 109 S Ct 2037; 104 L Ed 2d 696 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-4\">We have recognized often that the constraints of Article III do not apply to state courts, and accordingly the state courts are not bound by the limitations of a case or controversy or other federal rules of justiciability ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Nevertheless, because the majority incorrectly and at length insists that article Ill\u2019s case or controversy constraints do apply to Michigan, it is necessary to review those constraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">For the purposes of this case, the relevant articulation of the federal article Ill-based standing test is found in <em>Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 US 555; 112 S Ct 2130; 119 L Ed 2d 351 (1992).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Lujan, supra </em>at 560, the lead opinion of the United States Supreme Court concluded that the \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum\u201d for standing within the meaning of article Ill\u2019s \u201ccase or controversy\u201d limitation is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d \u2014an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \u201cactual or imminent, not \u2018conjectural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical.\u2019 \u201d Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of \u2014 the injury has to be \u201cfairly .. . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not... the result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.\u201d Third, it must be \u201clikely,\u201d as opposed to merely \u201cspeculative,\u201d that the injury will be \u201credressed by a favorable decision.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">In <em>Lujan, </em>six United States Supreme Court justices agreed that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a concrete injury resulting from a lack of opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>consult regarding the impact of certain federally funded overseas activities on its members\u2019 ability to observe endangered species on unspecified future trips abroad.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The <em>Lujan </em>lead opinion, with the qualified support of the concurrence, noted that \u201c[w]e have consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about government \u2014 claiming only harm to his and every citizen\u2019s interest in the proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large \u2014 does not state an article III case or controversy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573-574.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Until the decision in <em>Lee, </em>it was well-understood by this Court that article Ill\u2019s \u201ccase or controversy\u201d limitation was inapplicable to Michigan courts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Until <em>Lee, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>no decision of this Court characterized standing in Michigan courts as being a constitutional question. Nonetheless, the <em>Lee </em>majority adopted <em>Lujan\u2019s </em>article Ill-based test, concluding vaguely that <em>Lujan\u2019s </em>test was \u201cfundamental to standing.\u201d <em>Lee, supra </em>at 740. The <em>Lee </em>majority warned that to neglect standing \u201cwould imperil the constitutional architecture whereby governmental powers are divided between the three branches of government.\u201d <em>Lee, supra </em>at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Obscuring the fact that Michigan\u2019s Constitution contains no corollary to article III, \u00a72, the <em>Lee </em>majority suggested that Michigan\u2019s standing doctrine developed on a parallel track by way of <em>\u201cadditional </em>constitutional underpinning.\u201d <em>Lee, supra </em>at 737 (emphasis added). The \u201cadditional constitutional underpinning\u201d referenced by the <em>Lee </em>majority was Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1, which vests the state judicial power in the courts,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2, which divides the powers of government into three branches.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, the cases addressing these provisions cited by the <em>Lee </em>majority were not standing cases; rather each involved a distinct question regarding the scope of judicial power.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>other words, the <em>Lee </em>majority incorrectly equated Michigan case law addressing unrelated issues of \u201cjudicial power\u201d with federal case law addressing article Ill\u2019s \u201ccase or controversy\u201d constraints on standing.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The <em>Lee </em>majority\u2019s analysis, and its adoption of <em>Lujan\u2019s </em>article Ill-based standing test, laid the groundwork to question the Legislature\u2019s authority to confer standing on plaintiffs who would not survive <em>Lee\u2019s </em>test. I continue to believe that the adoption of the <em>Lujan </em>test for standing by the <em>Lee </em>majority was unnecessary. <em>Lee, supra </em>at 744 (Weaver, J. concurring). Further, the majority\u2019s application of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>standing test to a case involving a constitutionally based, expressly legislated grant of standing demonstrates that the adoption of <em>Lujan </em>is not only unnecessary, it is wrong for Michigan. Michigan\u2019s case law addressing distinguishable issues involving the scope of judicial power before <em>Lee </em>already protected the balance of powers among Michigan\u2019s three branches of government.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">It is simply not true that a judge-made standing test based on a federal constitutional provision that has no corollary in Michigan would, as promised by the <em>Lee </em>majority, better preserve Michigan\u2019s \u201cconstitutional architecture.\u201d <em>Lee, supra at </em>735. Certainly, the majority\u2019s distracting diversion into contemplations of federal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>does nothing to clarify or justify its abandonment of thirty years of precedent under MEPA. Nevertheless, it is clear that <em>Lee </em>has, and the majority in this case has, constitutionalized Michigan\u2019s judicial standing test. In so doing, the majority usurps the Legislature\u2019s authority to modify or abrogate the judiciary\u2019s prudential standing constraints. It is, thus, the majority\u2019s application of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>article Ill-based test to this and future MEPA cases that will disrupt Michigan\u2019s \u201cconstitutional architecture\u201d and the legislatively conferred access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">IV PRESERVING MICHIGAN\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Among the reasons why <em>Lee\u2019s </em>article Ill-based standing test or any judge-created standing test should not be applied to MEPA plaintiffs, the most important is that to do so defeats the clear, unambiguous, and readily understandable purpose of art 4, \u00a7 52 of the Michigan Constitution.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Through art 4, \u00a7 52, the people of Michigan directed the Legislature \u201cto provide for the protection of the air, water and other natural resources of the state from pollution, impairment and destruction.\u201d Art 4, \u00a7 52 provides that this mandate serves the people\u2019s express \u201cparamount concern in the interest of the health, safety and general welfare of the people\u201d specifically with respect to \u201cthe \u201cconservation and development of the natural resources of the state.\u201d Employing the precise words of art 4, \u00a7 52, the Legislature enacted MEPA in fulfillment of art 4, \u00a7 52\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Since MEPA\u2019s enactment, this Court has held that the Michigan Legislature could confer standing under MEPA to \u201cany person\u201d who alleges that a defendant\u2019s conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>has or is likely to \u201cpollute, impair or destroy the air, water or other natural resources or the public trust therein.\u201d <em>Ray, supra. </em>MEPA plaintiffs have not been required, until now, to overcome any judge-created standing tests to gain access to the courts.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It is clear that the Legislature\u2019s explicit grant of standing to \u201cany person\u201d under MEPA was intended to operate free from judge-made standing tests. Expanding the application of <em>Lee, </em>therefore, undermines art 4, \u00a7 52 and the Legislature\u2019s policy decisions, by restricting who may bring a MEPA action to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Expanding the application of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>standing test, as the majority does in this case, also infringes the Legislature\u2019s power to make laws pursuant to art 4, \u00a7 52.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2019s decision to allow \u201cany person\u201d to maintain a cause of action under MEPA is consistent with art 4, \u00a7 52\u2019s environmental mandate and is an exercise of legislative discretion that carries a presumption of constitutionality. <em>Johnson v Kramer Bros Freight Lines, Inc, supra </em>at 257. As duly recognized by Justice COOLEY: \u201cno court can compel the Legislature to make or to refrain from making laws, or to meet or adjourn at its command, or to take any action whatsoever, though the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>duty to take it be made ever so clear by the constitution or the laws.\u201d <em>Sutherland, supra </em>at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Through MEPA, the Legislature has given \u201cthe private citizen a sizable share of the initiative for environmental law enforcement.\u201d <em>Eyde, supra </em>at 454. Yet it is strongly implied by the majority that MEPA\u2019s citizen-suit provision unconstitutionally transfers to the judiciary the executive power to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed. This argument is unsupportable and incorrect. MEPA\u2019s citizen-suit provision does not expand the power of the judiciary; it grants the power to the people of this state to pursue MEPA violations. The court\u2019s role in these cases differs in no way from any other controversy that comes before it: the court hears the case, interprets the applicable law, and renders a decision.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s decision to permit \u201cany person\u201d to sue under MEPA does not interfere with the enforcement of the law by the executive branch, it simply provides every citizen an opportunity to ensure that the laws that are designed to prevent environmental harm are enforced. In this sense, MEPA\u2019s citizen-suit provision is consistent with the fact that, \u201c [a]ll political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal benefit, security and protection.\u201d Art 1, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Further, the majority\u2019s application of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>standing test ignores the fact that the three branches of government cannot \u201coperate in all respects independently of the others, and that what are called the checks and balances of government constitute each a restraint upon the rest.\u201d <em>Sutherland, supra </em>at 325. Justice Cooley elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">The Legislature prescribes rules of actions for the courts, and in many particulars may increase or diminish their jurisdiction; it also, in many cases, may prescribe rules for executive action, and impose duties upon, or take powers from the governor; while in turn the governor may veto legislative acts, and the courts may declare them void where they conflict with the constitution, notwithstanding, after having been passed by the Legislature, they have received the governor\u2019s approval. But in each of these cases the action of the department which controls, modifies, or in any manner influences that of another, is had strictly within its own sphere, and for that reason gives no occasion for conflict, controversy or jealousy. The Legislature in prescribing rules for the courts, is acting within its proper province in making laws, while the courts, in declining to enforce an unconstitutional law, are in like manner acting within their proper province, because they are only applying that which is law to the controversies in which they are called upon to give judgment. It is mainly by means of these checks and balances that the officers of the several departments are kept within their jurisdiction, and if they are disregarded in any case, and power is usurped or abused, the remedy is by impeachment, and not by another department of the government attempting to correct the wrong by asserting a superior authority over that which by the constitution is equal. <em>[Id.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The legislative power includes the power to create new legal rights. And, where the Legislature chooses, it may exercise its discretion to create and define new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>causes of action.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Unlike its federal counterpart, the jurisdiction of the Michigan judiciary is not limited by the case or controversy limitations expressed in article III, \u00a7 2 of the United States Constitution nor by the federal court\u2019s ever-evolving interpretation of those limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Without a doubt, the constitutionality of MEPA\u2019s citizen-suit provision remains \u201cteed up\u201d for a future open and direct ruling that <em>Lee\u2019s </em>judicial standing test supercedes the Legislature\u2019s authority to confer standing. The majority\u2019s application of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>standing test to any person\u2019s legislatively conferred and constitutionally based standing under MEPA improperly enlarges the court\u2019s power at the expense of the Legislature\u2019s power, ironically violating the very \u201cconstitutional architecture\u201d the majority purported to protect in <em>Lee.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>V PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING UNDER MCL 324.1701(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The circuit court concluded that plaintiffs lack standing to sue under MEPA in light of <em>Lee. </em>To reach this conclusion, that court reviewed affidavits of members of plaintiff organizations and made the following comments from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-5\">They were concerned about this, they were concerned about that, they were concerned that there might not be as many birds around Goose Lake as there used to be. And I\u2019m not going to take the time to go through the affidavits one by one, but I think that anybody who reads them will see how often the words or the phrases \u201cI am concerned\u201d without any stated basis in those affidavits for the reason for being concerned. I am concerned that there will be an impact, I am concerned that there has been a diminishment of the fishery in Goose Lake, and I\u2019m concerned that the mining activities will further diminish the fishery. That\u2019s not enough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Plaintiffs appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed. The Court of Appeals reviewed the plain language of MEPA and, citing <em>Ray, </em>correctly held that plaintiffs have standing. The Court of Appeals stated that it \u201cdeclined defendants\u2019 invitation to read an additional requirement of compliance with non-statutory standing prerequisites,\u201d i.e., judge-made standing tests. Unpublished memorandum opinion, issued June 11, 2002 (Docket No. 232706). In a footnote, the Court of Appeals aptly commented that it found no indication in <em>Lee </em>that this Court intended to overrule <em>Ray </em>and noted that the statute at issue in <em>Lee </em>could be distinguished because it did not \u201ccontain a provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>expressly authorizing any person to maintain an action for violations or omissions of the act.\u201d Slip op at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">I agree with the Court of Appeals that plaintiffs have standing under MEPA. Consistent with the people\u2019s mandate in art 4, \u00a7 52, the Legislature has determined that actual or threatened pollution, impairment, or destruction of natural resources is an injury that any person may seek to enjoin in circuit court. MCL 324.1701(1). In this case, plaintiffs have alleged that the defendant\u2019s proposed mining will harm natural resources. This is sufficient under MEPA to allow the plaintiffs their day in court. Once in the door, plaintiffs must next establish their prima facie case as required by MCL 324.1703(1).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">VI. DECODING THE MAJORITY OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The Legislature\u2019s grant of standing to \u201cany person\u201d in MCL 324.1701(1) is unquestionably broader than <em>Lee\u2019s </em>judge-made standing test. The majority retains its firm belief that <em>Lee\u2019s </em>standing test is grounded in the constitutional separation of powers. By repeatedly asserting that the Legislature may not confer standing more broadly than <em>Lee, </em>the majority has impliedly decided the very constitutional question they accuse this dissent of improperly reaching. It appears that, from the majority\u2019s mistaken perspective, the MEPA\u2019s citizen-suit provision is unconstitutional because the Legislature\u2019s attempt to confer standing on \u201cany person\u201d under MEPA violates the separations of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Moreover, it is the majority who, in <em>Lee, </em>created the constitutional dilemma that must be resolved in this case. As previously discussed, <em>Lee </em>unnecessarily imported the federal constitution\u2019s article III case or controversy constraints on standing into Michigan law. It should also be noted that in <em>Lee, </em>the parties had not raised or briefed the applicability of <em>Lujan </em>or article III of the federal constitution. On its own initiative, the <em>Lee </em>majority raised <em>Lujan\u2019s </em>standing test and transformed standing in Michigan into a constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">I fundamentally disagree with the majority\u2019s perception of judicial discipline and duty. It is not necessarily evidence of judicial discipline to dodge the ultimate issue in a case, be the issue of constitutional dimension or not. Nor is it disciplined to import into Michigan law federal constitutional constraints that the people \u2014 the ratifiers of the Michigan Constitution \u2014 have not adopted. Moreover, where the Court specifically requests that an issue be briefed (as this Court did in this case) and the issue is squarely presented, dodging the question destabilizes the law. It is particularly inappropriate where the parties must bear the cost of further unnecessary litigation or where the decision creates confusion for the bench and the bar. In this case, it is a proper exercise of judicial duty and power to answer the constitutional question presented by this Court regarding whether <em>Lee\u2019s </em>judge-made standing test supercedes the Legislature\u2019s authority to confer standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Further, while purporting to act with judicial restraint by leaving the constitutionality of MCL 324.1701(1) in doubt, the majority attempts to chart a course for the resolution of issues not even before the Court by suggesting that plaintiffs may not simply rely on the affidavits to prove that standing exists. <em>Ante </em>at 630-631. The majority confuses the issue of standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>with a court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Ante </em>at 630-631. The majority erroneously suggests that the circuit court can reverse this Court\u2019s unanimous decision that plaintiffs have standing. <em>Id. </em>However, this Court\u2019s decision that plaintiffs have standing controls that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\">The majority then hints that plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits may be insufficient either to survive a motion for summary disposition or to meet the plaintiffs burden of proof. For this, the majority cites an irrelevant and nonbinding United States Supreme Court dissenting opinion in a federal case involving federal law. The plain language of MEPA and this Court\u2019s own MEPA decisions are a far more appropriate guide for the circuit court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">MEPA instructs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">When the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that the conduct of the defendant has polluted, impaired, or destroyed or is likely to pollute, impair, or destroy the air, water, or other natural resources or the public trust in these resources, the defendant may rebut the prima facie showing by the submission of evidence to the contrary. The defendant may also show, by way of an affirmative defense, that there is no feasible and prudent alternative to defendant\u2019s conduct and that his or her conduct is consistent with the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare in light of the state\u2019s paramount concern for the protection of its natural resources from pollution, impairment, or destruction. Except as to the affirmative defense, the principles of burden of proof and weight of the evidence generally applicable in civil actions in the circuit courts apply to actions brought under this part. [MCL 324.1703(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">As this Court previously held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">the necessary showing to establish a plaintiffs prima facie case is \u201cnot restricted to actual environmental degradation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>but also encompasses probable damage to the environment as well.\u201d General rules of evidence govern this inquiry, and a plaintiff has established a prima facie case when his case is sufficient to withstand a motion by the defendant that the judge direct a verdict in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>[Nemeth v Abonmarche Dev, Inc, </em>457 Mich 16, 25; 576 NW2d 641 (1998) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">This Court has emphasized that MEPA\u2019s, \u201cvery efficacy . . . will turn on how well circuit court judges meet their responsibility for giving vitality and meaning to the act through detailed findings of fact.\u201d <em>Ray, supra </em>at 307-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The majority decision in this case illustrates how judicial activism can be disguised as judicial restraint.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Purporting to be concerned about the separation of powers, the majority, in actuality, uses its judicial power to undermine the Legislature\u2019s proper exercise of its authority to create a cause of action and define who can pursue that action in court. The clear implication of the majority\u2019s constitutional rhetoric combined with its application of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>standing test to these plaintiffs is that the majority will not yield to any grant of standing by the Legislature that is broader than the majority\u2019s own judge-made test. The majority\u2019s decision destabilizes the law and overrules 30 years of precedent. See <em>supra </em>at 652 n 3. The majority decision forces future MEPA plaintiffs to establish that an actual or threatened environmental harm has actually injured or will immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>nently injure them concretely, that such injury is traceable to the defendant, or that such injury is redressable as required by the majority opinion in <em>Lee, supra </em>at 739-740, or risk being kicked out of court for lack of standing. Thus, any characterization of the majority\u2019s application of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>judicial standing test as a narrower ground to resolve this case is judicial gymnastics or gamesmanship, not an example of true judicial restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-3\">The people through Michigan\u2019s Constitution required the Legislature to pass laws to protect the environment. Art 4, \u00a7 52. MEPA and its citizen-suit provision properly implements the constitution\u2019s directive. <em>State Hwy Comm, supra </em>at 184. <em>Lee\u2019s </em>more restrictive judge-made standing test should not be imposed on plaintiffs by the majority in this case. Rather, the \u201cany person\u201d standard clearly expressed by the Legislature through MEPA should be applied.

They, along with other actions brought by a person who lacks an individualized injury, were known to the framers of the federal constitution. They existed in the legal practice in the United States and England when the federal constitution was written. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Individuals were allowed, also, to bring suits for writs of quo warranto and mandamus. Sunstein, <em>What\u2019s standing after </em>Lujan? <em>Of citizens suits, \u201cInjuries,\u201d and Article III, </em>91 Mich L R 163, 170 (1992). Individuals were allowed, also, to bring mandamus actions in the states. See Sunstein at 171. See also <em>Union Pacific Railroad v Hall, </em>91 US 343 (1875).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">In England, suits by individuals, private attorneys general, could be brought under the informers\u2019 action and the relator action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-5\">In the informers\u2019 action, cash bounties were awarded to strangers who successfully prosecuted illegal conduct. In relator actions, suits would be brought formally in the name of the Attorney General, but at the instance of a private person, often a stranger. [Sunstein at 172.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Merely because the framers of our state Constitution created a tripartite government like the federal government, it does not follow that they intended to eliminate actions by private attorneys general.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">THE SEPARATION OF POWERS ARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">The state separation of powers doctrine reads simply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-9\">The powers of government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] [Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>It has been understood that this provision is not to be applied in an overly rigid fashion. Some overlap is acknowledged to exist in the functioning of the various branches. The state Constitution permits it. For instance, a civil rights commission within the executive branch is vested with some lawmaking power. Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29. Article 4, \u00a7 33 provides the Governor with veto power over legislation, and art 11, \u00a7 7 provides the Legislature with impeachment authority. Indeed, any grant of legislative powers to executive agencies would be unconstitutional per se if some overlap between the branches of government were not permissible. See <em>JW Hampton, Jr, &amp; Co v United States, </em>276 US 394; 48 S Ct 348; 72 L Ed 624 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The courts, also, have recognized that the separation of powers doctrine allows limited overlap and interaction between the branches. <em>Soap &amp; Detergent Ass\u2019n v Natural Resources Comm, </em>415 Mich 728, 752; 330 NW2d 346 (1982). See also <em>Judicial Attorneys Ass\u2019n v Michigan, </em>459 Mich 291, 315-316; 586 NW2d 894 (1998) (Taylor, J., dissenting), citing the Court of Appeals dissent of Judge MARKMAN. Accordingly, when one branch exercises its power, it may overlap the exercise of power belonging to another branch. For example, the executive branch may utilize hearing officers to attempt to resolve disputes. The judiciary may review the decisions of those hearing officers, although doing so may appear to infringe on the executive branch\u2019s exercise of its power to administer the law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The majority in <em>Lee </em>applied the federal separation of powers and standing doctrines to the state and created a mandatory particularized injury requirement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>standing. This requirement is not found in the text of either the federal or state constitutions. To exist, it had to be gleaned from the historical context of the constitutions. However, a plumbing of that context reveals no support for a belief that a person must show a particularized injury before gaining standing in order to bring a citizens\u2019 suit. See pp 680-681 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-3\">Even though the federal separation of powers doctrine has been found to require a particularized injury for standing in federal courts, it does not follow that the same rule applies in Michigan. Our state\u2019s courts are not identical to our federal courts. They are part of a government having broader powers and broader jurisdiction than the federal government and having judges who are selected by the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Although the state and federal governments are similarly structured, the scope of the powers of their respective branches is different. That is because the natures of the two governments are inherently different. The federal government is one of enumerated powers. The states retain any powers not expressly ceded to the federal government. US Const, Am X.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">State sovereignty to address any social problem that threatens the public welfare is plenary. <em>Washington-Detroit Theatre Co v Moore, </em>249 Mich 673, 680; 229 NW 618 (1930). Michigan\u2019s Constitution, like that of many other states,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> includes detailed substantive social and economic provisions. See, e.g., articles 8-10 on education, finance and taxation, and property. Accordingly, the power of the state\u2019s judiciary is plenary as well, and Michigan\u2019s courts have general, broad subject-matter jurisdiction. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 1. See MCL 600.775.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>By contrast, the jurisdiction of federal courts<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is limited. For instance, a federal case must arise under a federal question or the parties must have diversity of citizenship. Federal judicial power is limited to \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies,\u201d a fundamental restriction. <em>Allen v Wright, </em>468 US 737, 750; 104 S Ct 3315; 82 L Ed 2d 556 (1984). Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> I do not argue that this restriction defines, the judicial power. Instead, it limits federal courts\u2019 utilization of the judicial power to certain disputes. By contrast, the judicial power inherent in Michigan\u2019s courts may be applied under a wider range of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The federal standing and separation of powers doctrines adopted by <em>Lee </em>from <em>Lujan </em>are predicated in part also on the fact that federal judges are not directly accountable to the people. <em>United States v Richardson, </em>418 US 166, 180; 94 S Ct 2940; 41 L Ed 2d 678 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring). Federal judges are appointed by the President<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and may be removed only by impeachment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By contrast, our state judges are elected by the people.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that access to state courts is not limited by the federal constitution. <em>ASARCO, Inc v Kadish, </em>490 US 605, 616-617; 109 S Ct 2037; 104 L Ed 2d 696 (1989). Everything considered, it is not surprising that the qualifications for standing in state courts are broader than in federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Other states have determined that their judicial power is not constrained by the federal model. For example, Indiana has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-4\">While Article III of the United States Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to actual cases and controversies, the Indiana Constitution does not contain any similar restraint. Thus, although moot cases are usually dismissed, Indiana courts have long recognized ... an exception to the general rule when the case involves questions of \u201cgreat public interest.\u201d <em>[In re Lawrance, </em>579 NE2d 32, 37 (Ind, 1991).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Similarly, Minnesota has recognized that federal standing concerns historically have been related to whether a dispute brought for adjudication is in an adversary context and is capable of judicial resolution. However, when standing has been conferred by a state statute, \u201cthere is no constitutional basis for imposing a more stringent standing requirement [than that] which is set by the governing statute.\u201d <em>Minnesota Pub Interest Research Group v Minnesota Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Industry, </em>311 Minn 65, 73; 249 NW2d 437 (1976), citing Ass'n <em>of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc v Camp, </em>397 US 150, 151; 90 S Ct 827; 25 L Ed 2d 184 (1970). See also <em>Dep\u2019t of Revenue v Kuhnlein, </em>646 So 2d 717 (Fla, 1994), <em>Chester Co Housing Auth v Pennsylvania State Civil Service Comm, </em>556 Pa 621; 730 A2d 935 (1999), <em>In Life of the Land v Land Use Comm, </em>63 Hawaii 166; 623 P2d 431 (1981), and <em>Sears v Hull, </em>192 Ariz 65; 961 P2d 1013 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Of course, this is not to say that, before <em>Lee, </em>Michigan was without standing requirements. Simply, they were more encompassing than the federal requirements. To have standing in Michigan courts, a person had to show the existence of a dispute over a legal right. <em>Daniels v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number><em>People, </em>6 Mich 381, 388 (1859). See Sunstein at 170. The necessary showing did not need to rise to the level of a \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Our state has relied on other requirements which also serve to ensure that standing is not too broadly applied. For example, the ripeness requirement ensures that a claim has actually arisen and that it has not been negated. <em>Obenauer v Solomon, </em>151 Mich 570; 115 NW 696 (1908). The requirement that the case not be moot ensures that it does not present a purely abstract question and that only actual disputes are litigated. <em>East Grand Rapids School Dist v Kent Co Tax Allocation Bd, </em>415 Mich 381, 390; 330 NW2d 7 (1982). See p 687 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">I believe that our state\u2019s standing provisions before <em>Lee </em>sufficiently ensured that judicial power was properly constrained while allowing vigorously pursued suits to proceed. The decision in <em>Lee </em>wrongly blocked access to our state\u2019s courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Hence, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, <em>Lee\u2019s </em>standing requirements are not essential to prevent the judicial branch from overpowering the legislative branch and the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE AND MEPA</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Turning to the interplay between the Michigan environmental protection act and the separation of powers clause, I cannot conclude that the act offends the clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Separation of powers principles ensure that courts do not move beyond the area of judicial expertise and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>political questions are not answered by a branch of government unaccountable to the people. <em>House Speaker v Governor, </em>443 Mich 560, 574; 506 NW2d 190 (1993). I am unable to discern how MEPA\u2019s private attorneys general standing provision will offend these principles. The Legislature made the public\u2019s interest in the environment a legal right.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is authorized to determine who may enforce such rights and in what manner. <em>Davis v Passman, </em>442 US 228, 241; 99 S Ct 2264; 60 L Ed 2d 846 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">MEPA is an expression of public concern for protecting the state\u2019s natural resources that was passed into law through the normal political process. It reflects the determination that the resources of the executive branch should be supplemented with those of the people. The majority today threatens to diminish the victory signified by its passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">MEPA does not enable the judiciary to exercise legislative power at the instigation of a disinterested plaintiff. The structure of MEPA ensures that the plaintiffs are not mere interlopers. The act requires a plaintiff to make a prima facie showing of environmental damage. MCL 324.1703. Hence, there will always be alleged actual or imminent harm that will ensure that cases like this one will be ripe and that they will not be moot. See p 686 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">This case presents one such actual, live controversy. The defendants\u2019 mine expansion is imminent. Plaintiffs\u2019 membership includes people who live and recreate in the area of the mine and claim to be adversely affected by its expansion.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Environmental and other collective concerns often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>have strong personal manifestations, called \u201cpassive use\u201d or \u201cstandby value\u201d interests. See, e.g., <em>General Electric Co v United States Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>327 US App DC 33, 38; 128 F3d 767 (1997). These interests ensure that environmental suits are vigorously pursued by people with a strong personal belief in their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">I cannot perceive that the judiciary would be enabled to make policy by this Court\u2019s affirmance of the constitutionality of MEPA\u2019s standing provision without the need for particularized injury. <em>Sutherland v Governor, </em>29 Mich 320, 324 (1874).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Neither does MEPA offend executive authority. The Constitution states that \u201cThe executive power is vested in the governor.\u201d Const 1964, art <em>V, </em>\u00a7 1. However, it is not vested solely in the Governor. Obviously, the Governor may delegate some of her power. As stated, the Legislature may vest some of its power in an agency. Similarly, the Legislature may return it to the people. The people know how to vest power exclusively in a single branch of government. For example, our Constitution says, \u201cThe judicial power is vested <em>exclusively </em>in one court of justice.\u201d Const 1963, art VI, \u00a7 1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The Legislature\u2019s decision to allow the people to directly enforce MEPA would offend the executive branch if it interfered with the executive branch\u2019s ability to accomplish its functions. <em>Nixon v Administrator of Gen Services, </em>433 US 425, 443; 97 S Ct 2777; 53 L Ed 2d 867 (1977), citing <em>United States v Nixon, </em>418 US 683, 711-712; 94 S Ct 3090; 41 L Ed 2d 1039 (1974). MEPA does not do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">MEPA includes a mechanism to ensure that executive branch decisions are respected. It allows the judiciary to refer environmental protection act cases to state agencies for resolution. MCL 324.1704(2). MEPA is explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>\u201csupplementary to existing administrative and regulatory procedures as provided by law.\u201d MCL 324.1706. Nothing in it encourages or authorizes the judiciary to itself exercise executive power or hinders the discretion of the executive branch. MEPA poses no danger of \u201caggrandizement or encroachment\u201d of power that would trigger separation of powers concerns. <em>Mistretta v United States, </em>488 US 361, 382; 109 S Ct 647; 102 L Ed 2d 714 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">THE NEW JUDGE-MADE STANDING LIMITATION</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Obviously, this Court is entitled to constrain its own power and limit standing as it has done in this case. But in doing so, it creates a self-inflicted wound. See <em>Warth v Seldin, </em>422 US 490, 500; 95 S Ct 2197; 45 L Ed 2d 343 (1975). No constitution requires it. <em>People v Goldston, </em>470 Mich 523, 532-535; 682 NW2d 479 (2004). It is an entirely judge-made limitation, a standing requirement fabricated by judges where none existed before. And, because it subverts the popular will, it injures more than the judicial branch. It injures the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The Court is ill-advised to curb its authority under the guise of respect for another branch of government. Its decision today is an unwarranted contraction of the right of the people to use the judicial and the legislative power to protect their interest in preserving the environment. It is not, as the majority asserts, a prudent check on an attempted expansion of legislative power. <em>Ante </em>at 616-618.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Mepa does not violate constitutional separation of powers principles despite the fact that it lacks a particularized injury requirement. These principles require that the judiciary respect the Legislature\u2019s decision and fulfill its role to adjudicate disputes as a co-equal branch of the state\u2019s government.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The majority advances a parade of horribles<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that it fears would emerge if MEPA\u2019s standing provision were not supplemented by the <em>Lujan </em>standing requirements.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When examined closely, the horribles tend to shrink. Under MEPA, a plaintiff must establish prima facie environmental harm sufficient to support a claim. See MCL 324.1703(1) and <em>Nemeth v Abonmarche Dev, Inc, </em>457 Mich 16; 576 NW2d 641 (1998); MCR 2.116(C)(8), (10). Moreover, existing court rules deter frivolous suits. See MCR 2.114 and MRPC 3.1 and 3.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">It is improper to hold the plaintiffs in this case to the <em>Lujan </em>judicial test for standing. Given that the express will of the people is to the contrary, plaintiffs now and in the future should not have to shoulder the <em>Lujan </em>standing burden in MEPA cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">I agree with the opinion of Justice WEAVER and with the result reached by the majority. Plaintiffs have standing. The authority of the Legislature to give the people a legal right to protect their interest in the environment through private attorneys general should not be abridged.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">I would find that the Michigan Legislature did not violate the state Constitution by granting standing under MEPA to a party who does not satisfy the judicially crafted <em>Lee </em>test. The applicable test here, the MEPA test, was carefully devised by the Legislature. Because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>gave standing to \u201cany person,\u201d I believe that any person should be able to avail himself of that law. The Court of Appeals decision and analysis should be affirmed and the case remanded to the circuit court for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b837-3\">CAVANAGH, J., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-9\"> <em>Lee </em>adopted the United States Supreme Court requirements of <em>Lujan v Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 US 555; 112 S Ct 2130; 119 L Ed 2d 351 (1992). <em>Lujan </em>requires a plaintiff seeking standing to establish an actual or imminent injury to his or her legal rights that is concrete and particularized. There must be a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s action and the plaintiffs injury, and the injury must be one for which the court can grant redress. <em>Lee </em>at 739-740, quoting <em>Lujan </em>at 560-561. I have come to believe that <em>Lee </em>wrongly adopted <em>en toto </em>the federal standing requirements. As Justice Weaver notes, the <em>Lujan </em>standing test was not presented by the parties. Also, the statute at issue in <em>Lee </em>differed from the statute under consideration here in one important respect: it lacked a provision expressly authorizing an individual to maintain an action for a violation of the act without having suffered a particularized injury. Here the standing issue has been fully presented and discussed. Moreover, I do not believe that rejecting the <em>Lujan </em>requirements now would work any unfairness that would mandate their continuing retention in Michigan. <em>Murray v Beyer Mem.
