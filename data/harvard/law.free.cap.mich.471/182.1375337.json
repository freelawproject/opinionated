We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Defendant was charged with possession with intent to deliver less than fifty grams of both cocaine and heroin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the beginning of trial, defendant informed the trial court that he wanted his trial counsel, Damian Nunzio, removed and new trial counsel appointed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The trial court did not grant defendant\u2019s request, but noted that he \u201cwould entertain\u201d the request if defendant presented \u201csome valid reason\u201d to appoint substitute counsel other than \u201cpersonality difficulties.\u201d Defendant offered no such explanation. After refusing to grant defendant\u2019s request, the trial court offered defendant the following four options:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">[O]ur alternatives here are basically these. You may, if you have made arrangements on your own, bring in your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>own lawyer at your own expense and hire anybody you want, and I will allow that lawyer to substitute right now and we\u2019ll go from here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">Option number two, we can go forward with Mr. Nunzio, the second lawyer that\u2019s been provided for you at government expense, and try this case on the merits. I would strongly suggest that, if Mr. Nunzio thinks you have a valid defense, that you consult with him and work with him on it because he\u2019s a man that knows how to present such a defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">Or number three, you may decide to serve as your own counsel and represent yourself. I caution you strongly against the third course because obviously a trial involves issues of complicated legal procedure and, unless you are legally trained, and I don\u2019t know whether you are or not hut I suspect you are not, there are many pitfalls there for the unwary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">And that leads us, I suppose, to option four, which is sort of a variation on option number three, in which you provide your own defense but Mr. Nunzio would be available to consult with you and provide you assistance as to technical legal points when you need counsel.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">. After defendant continued to indicate that he did not \u201cfeel comfortable\u201d with his appointed attorney\u2019s representation, the trial court reminded defendant of his other available options \u2014 defendant could retain counsel or he could represent himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\"><em>The Court: </em>And, while I would not advise it, I will certainly guard your rights and see to it that you have the opportunity to present your own defense, if that\u2019s your wish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\"><em>Defendant: </em>Well, that\u2019s putting words in my mouth. I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, then maybe you should put words in your mouth and tell me what you want.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>Defendant: </em>I told you. I don\u2019t want Mr. Nunzio as my attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\"><em>The </em>Court: ... So, your options are really kind of limited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\"><em>Defendant: </em>The State has the obligation to give me representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">At a later point in the proceedings, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\"><em>The Court: </em>... And if you can\u2019t cooperate with the man, then you can try the case yourself, and that\u2019s fine. You have a constitutional right to do it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea, but I\u2019m here to guarantee your constitutional rights. And if you want to try your case yourself, by goodness, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\"><em>Defendant: </em>Well, that\u2019s what you keep insisting that I do, <em>and I\u2019m, telling you that I need competent </em>counsel.... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Although the trial court then gave defendant several more opportunities to select among the four proffered options, defendant continued to reject all of them. The trial court then empanelled the jury and asked defendant if he had any questions for the panel. Defendant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, this is something totally new for me. I\u2019m being forced into this situation ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">I requested the Court appoint new counsel for me, and they said, for some reason being that we\u2019re here and they don\u2019t see the difference \u2014 any differences between me and Mr. Nunzio. So they forced me to go on with this trial alone by myself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">After a four-day trial, defendant was convicted of both charges and sentenced to consecutive prison terms of 2V2 to 40 years for each conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">The Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions in a published opinion. The panel concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>defendant implicitly \u201cmade Ms unequivocal choice\u201d to proceed in propria persona \u201cby Ms own conduct\u201d when he continued to reject appointed counsel\u2019s representation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">We review for clear error the trial court\u2019s factual findings surrounding a defendant\u2019s waiver. However, to the extent that a ruling involves an interpretation of the law or the application of a constitutional standard to uncontested facts, our review is de novo.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">A. THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SELF-REPRESENTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">The Sixth Amendment provides that the accused in a criminal prosecution \u201cshall enjoy the right... to have the Assistance of counsel for his defence.\u201d US Const, Am VI.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This requirement was made applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The right to counsel is considered fundamental because it is essential to a fair trial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>attaches at the trial stage, which is clearly a critical stage of the proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While a defendant may choose to forgo the assistance of counsel at trial, any waiver of the right to counsel must be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, it is a long-held principle that courts are to make every reasonable presumption <em>against </em>the waiver of a fundamental constitutional right,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> including the waiver of the right to the assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In <em>Faretta v </em>California,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant \u201chas a constitutional right to proceed without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently <em>elects </em>to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While the <em>Faretta </em>majority noted that the framers of the Constitution never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>imagined that the right of self-representation \u201cmight be considered inferior to the right of assistance of counsel,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court has also noted that the \u201cright to self-representation is not absolute.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, because a defendant automatically enjoys the right to the assistance of counsel,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the right of self-representation and the right to counsel are mutually exclusive, a defendant must <em>elect </em>to conduct his own defense \u201c \u2018voluntarily and intelligently,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and must be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation \u201cin order to\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> proceed pro se.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, while the right of self-representation is a fundamental constitutional right, other interests, such as the failure to effectively waive the right to counsel or a governmental interest in \u201censuring the integrity and efficiency of the trial\u201d may in some instances outweigh the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to act as his own counsel.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In sum, although the right to counsel and the right of self-representation are both fundamental con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>stitutional rights, representation by counsel, as guarantor of a fair trial, \u201cis the standard, not the exception,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> in the absence of a proper waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">B. MICHIGAN\u2019S APPLICATION OF THE FEDERAL STANDAKD</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In <em>People v Anderson,</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court applied the <em>Faretta </em>standard for self-representation and established requirements regarding the judicial inquest necessary to effectuate a valid waiver and permit a defendant to represent himself. Upon a defendant\u2019s initial request to proceed pro se, a court must determine that (1) the defendant\u2019s request is unequivocal, (2) the defendant is asserting his right knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily through a colloquy advising the defendant of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, and (3) the defendant\u2019s self-representation will not disrupt, unduly inconvenience, and burden the court and the administration of the court\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In addition, a trial court must satisfy the requirements of MCR 6.005(D), which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">The court may not permit the defendant to make an initial waiver of the right to be represented by a lawyer without first</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">(1) advising the defendant of the charge, the maximum possible prison sentence for the offense, any mandatory minimum sentence required by law, and the risk involved in self-representation, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>(2) offering the defendant the opportunity to consult with a retained lawyer or, if the defendant is indigent, the opportunity to consult with an appointed lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In <em>Adkins, </em>this Court clarified the scope of judicial inquiry required by <em>Anderson </em>and MCR 6.005(D) when confronted with an initial request for self-representation. <em>Adkins </em>rejected a \u201clitany approach\u201d in favor of a \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">We hold, therefore, that trial courts must substantially comply with the aforementioned substantive requirements set forth in both <em>Anderson </em>and MCR 6.005(D). Substantial compliance requires that the court discuss the substance of both <em>Anderson </em>and MCR 6.005(D) in a short colloquy with the defendant, and make an express finding that the defendant fully understands, recognizes, and agrees to abide by the waiver of counsel procedures. The nonformalistic nature of a substantial compliance rule affords the protection of a strict compliance rule with far less of the problems associated with requiring courts to engage in a word-for-word litany approach. Further, we believe this standard protects the \u201cvital constitutional rights involved while avoiding the unjustified manipulation which can otherwise throw a real but unnecessary burden on the criminal justice system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">Completion of these judicial procedures allows the court to consider a request to proceed in propria persona. <em>If a judge is uncertain regarding whether any of the waiver procedures are met, he should deny the defendant\u2019s request to proceed in propria persona, noting the reasons for the denial on the record. The defendant should then continue to be represented by retained or appointed counsel, </em>unless the judge determines substitute counsel is appropriate.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Under <em>Adkins, </em>if the trial court fails to substantially comply with the requirements in <em>Anderson </em>and the court rule, then the defendant has not effectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>waived his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel. In addition, the rule articulated in <em>Adkins </em>provides a practical, salutary tool to be used to avoid rewarding gamesmanship as well as to avoid the creation of appellate parachutes: if any irregularities exist in the waiver proceeding, the defendant should continue to be represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">C. RESOLUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In this case, a review of the record indicates two key facts: first, that defendant expressly rejected self-representation and, second, that defendant never voluntarily waived his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel at trial.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Indeed, defendant clearly sought appointment of <em>another </em>trial counsel, and defendant and the trial court engaged in a lengthy dialogue over defendant\u2019s desire to have substitute counsel appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">While defendant was given clear choices, defendant consistently denied that <em>his </em>choice was self-representation. Throughout his colloquy with the trial court, defendant steadfastly rejected the option of proceeding to trial without the assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Therefore, it cannot be said, as the Court of Appeals and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>dissenting opinions maintain, that defendant <em>unequivocally </em>chose self-representation and voluntarily waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">We believe that defendant\u2019s repudiation of self-representation was unmistakable in this case. However, to the degree that defendant\u2019s refusal to explicitly choose between continued representation by appointed counsel and self-representation created any ambiguity regarding defendant\u2019s desire to unequivocally waive his right to trial counsel, any ambiguity should have been resolved in favor of representation because, consistently with <em>Adkins </em>and United States Supreme Court precedent, courts <em>must </em>indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of the right to counsel.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Because defendant unequivocally rejected self-representation and did not voluntarily waive his right to the assistance of counsel at trial, the trial court erred in requiring defendant to proceed in propria persona. The clear cut rule articulated by this Court in <em>Adkins </em>requires that counsel should have been retained where defendant explicitly rejected self-representation.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for a new trial.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b340-5\">Cavanagh, Kelly, Weaver, and Taylor, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-12\"> MCL 333.7401(2) (a) (iv).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-13\"> Mr. Nunzio was defendant\u2019s second appointed attorney.

In this case, defendant does not argue that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to appoint substitute counsel; rather, defendant argues before this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Court that the trial court reversibly erred because defendant did not unequivocally waive his right to counsel and did not elect to represent himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\"> As the dissent notes, there are some federal circuit court cases holding that an unreasonable insistence on the appointment of a new attorney operates as a waiver of the right to counsel. This view is in contravention of the principle articulated in <em>Johnson. </em>Until the United States Supreme Court sees fit to distinguish or overrule <em>Johnson, </em>this Court is required to follow it. Moreover, it does not logically follow that a defendant affirmatively waives a fundamental constitutional right simply because he insists on a favorable ruling on something to which he is not entitled. Under the theory advocated by the dissent, if a defendant were to insist on empanelling only left-handed jurors, his insistence would constitute an affirmative waiver of his right to a jury trial <em>even if </em>he explicitly indicates that he <em>desires </em>a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\"> Because defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to the assistance of counsel at trial was not voluntary, we need not address whether defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent. It is worth noting, however, that an effective waiver of <em>trial </em>counsel requires a more exacting waiver than that required to waive counsel at pretrial stages of the proceedings. See <em>Iowa v Tovar, supra, </em>124 S Ct 1387-1388; 158 L Ed 2d 220-221 (requiring that a defendant \u201cmust be warned <em>specifically </em>of the hazards ahead\u201d and that those warnings surrounding waiver of counsel at trial be <em>\u201crigorousfly] </em>conveyed\u201d) (emphasis added; citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\"> In this instance, the trial court should have simply denied defendant\u2019s request to appoint another counsel and continued with the proceedings.

I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion because I agree with the trial court and the Court of Appeals and believe that defendant, by his conduct alone, \u201cunequivocally\u201d waived his constitutional and statutory right to trial counsel. US Const, Am VI; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 13; MCL 763.1. Because I believe that defendant\u2019s waiver also satisfied the requirements set forth by this Court in <em>People v Anderson, </em>398 Mich 361, 367-368; 247 NW2d 857 (1976), and MCR 6.005(D), I would affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Further, I respectfully urge the United States Supreme Court to consider granting certiorari in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>to clarify the operation of the presumption against the waiver of trial counsel in <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458; 58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461 (1938). In this case, defendant unreasonably refused to cooperate with his second court-appointed counsel, but also declined to assert that he wished to proceed pro se. Some federal courts have interpreted such conduct as constituting an effective waiver of the right to trial counsel, but the lack of clarity regarding the scope of the <em>Johnson </em>presumption continues to create constitutional uncertainty. Where a defendant unreasonably declines appointed counsel\u2019s services, the <em>Johnson </em>presumption should not remain inviolate. The right to trial counsel, the right to self-representation, and the prohibition against forcing trial counsel on an unwilling defendant intersect. Thus, courts must protect a defendant\u2019s rights while also safeguarding the integrity of the judicial process from delay tactics and gamesmanship, both of which are on display in this case. If defendant here had been <em>required </em>to retain his counsel, as the majority would require, he would now almost certainly be arguing that his right to trial counsel had been violated and that such counsel had been forced upon him against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Defendant was charged with possession of cocaine and heroin. At the beginning of trial, defendant informed the trial court that he wanted his trial counsel, Damian Nunzio, removed and new trial counsel appointed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among other allegations, defendant claimed that there had been miscommunications between him and Nunzio, that Nunzio had been convinced of defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>dant\u2019s guilt, that Nunzio had failed to give defendant certain helpful documents, and that Nunzio had failed to call certain witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The court found that defendant had failed to present \u201csome valid reason why a different lawyer should be appointed, other than the fact that [defendant was] seeming to have personal difficulties with the leading members of the bar.\u201d The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to appoint new counsel, and informed defendant that his options were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">You may, if you have made arrangements on your own, bring in your own lawyer at your own expense and hire anybody you want, and I will allow that lawyer to substitute right now and we\u2019ll go from here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">Option number two, we can go forward with Mr. Nunzio, the second lawyer that\u2019s been provided for you at government expense, and try this case on the merits. I would strongly suggest that, if Mr. Nunzio thinks you have a valid defense, that you consult with him and work with him on it because he\u2019s a man that knows how to present such a defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">Or number three, you may decide to serve as your own counsel and represent yourself. I caution you strongly against the third course because obviously a trial involves issues of complicated legal procedure and, unless you are legally trained, and I don\u2019t know whether you are or not but I suspect you are not, there are many pitfalls there for the unwary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">And that leads us, I suppose, to option four, which is sort of a variation on option number three, in which you provide your own defense but Mr. Nunzio would be available to consult with you and provide you assistance as to technical legal points when you need counsel. That pretty much exhausts the field, as far as I can determine at this moment, for what we might do about proceeding here today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Defendant insisted that he did not want Nunzio to represent him because, \u201cMr. Nunzio has stated that he doesn\u2019t believe that I\u2019m innocent.\u201d Nunzio denied this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The trial court explained to defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">[E]ven if we were to assume arguendo that [Nunzio] did say that, and I don\u2019t believe it for a minute, it would not be germane. A lawyer represents a client by presenting his defense under the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">It is not necessary that Mr. Nunzio believe you are innocent in order to represent you and present the very best defense available to you under the law. So, essentially we\u2019re sparring at shadows here, and this discussion is not getting us anywhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Defendant continued to insist that he did not want Nunzio to represent him. The trial court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">I think I\u2019ve given you the options as I understand them, and I\u2019m prepared to go with whichever one you feel is the appropriate one to follow at this particular time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Defendant replied, <em>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve expressed mine. I don\u2019t want Mr. Nunzio to represent me. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">The court then explained that only three options remained for defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">Your options are that you may bring in counsel of your own choosing, which you\u2019ve had many months to do and I don\u2019t see anybody sitting here, so I don\u2019t assume that [is] going to happen; or you may represent yourself in which case I will allow Mr. Nunzio to be available to provide you with legal counsel on technical and procedural points when you wish to consult with him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">The trial court then warned defendant about the dangers of self-representation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>If you wish to do that, I will certainly proceed in that fashion. I would not personally advise that you do that, but that\u2019s your right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">I should advise you that there is an ancient adage in the law, for good reason, that a man who acts as his own counsel has a fool for a client. The corollary to the rule is that he also has a fool for a lawyer, but, as a practical matter, it all winds up in the same place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">My guess is that you will not fare well in that approach, but you have the right to take that approach if you wish to do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Defendant replied, \u201cWell, that\u2019s putting words in my mouth.\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cWell then maybe you should put words in your mouth and tell me what you want.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cWell, I told you. I don\u2019t want Mr. Nunzio as my attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The trial transcript contains four more pages of dialogue between defendant and the trial court in which, although defendant continues to request that a new attorney be appointed for him, the trial court continued to deny such request. The court eventually states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">What I really want to know is how you want to proceed so we can get started here. And I\u2019m willing to take a recess and let you speak to Mr. Nunzio, or if you want don\u2019t want to speak to Mr. Nunzio, I\u2019m willing to take a recess and let you contemplate the matter. But the fact is that we need to know what it is that you wish to do and within the range of the options, which I think I\u2019ve pretty clearly delineated for you. I\u2019m prepared to accommodate you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">Now, do you wish to consult with Mr. Nunzio or mull this over for a few minutes, or are you ready to make an alternative choice at this time?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Defendant answered, \u201cYour Honor, I thought I made myself clear here.\u201d The trial court replied, \u201cWell apparently not because I haven\u2019t heard you make any choice ... I just need to know which of those you wish to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The transcript contains another six pages of dialogue between the trial court and defendant in which defendant complained about Nunzio\u2019s performance. After the trial court found all of defendant\u2019s allegations to be completely unfounded, the following exchange between-the trial court and defendant occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">Defendant: I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t want any contact with Mr. Nunzio, and I expressed that to you. I don\u2019t want Mr. Nunzio to have anything to do with anything in my case.... <em>There\u2019s no way that I will let him try to defend me.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">All right. Well, I just want it noted that I have stated the conflict between me and attorney Nunzio, and the statements that Mr. Nunzio has made in regards to me and my case, and there\u2019s <em>no way that I would feel comfortable with him having anything to do with the defense on my behalf. </em>And I\u2019m requesting that you remove him from my case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\"><em>Court: </em>All right. Well, then, I will inform the jury that you have chosen to represent yourself and that Mr. Nunzio is available as your legal advisor. Now, are you ready to proceed or do you wish to take a few moments to get yourself organized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\"><em>Defendant: </em>(No verbal response)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">Court:Mr. Russell that\u2019s a question to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\"><em>Defendant: </em>I\u2019ve requested to you, Your Honor, <em>I said that I don\u2019t want Mr. Nunzio involved in nothing of my defense, </em>and I am requesting of this court to appoint counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-14\"><em>Court: </em>Well, we have appointed counsel, Mr. Russell, and he sits next to you at this particular moment. Now, you can either work with Mr. Nunzio or demonstrate some reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>able basis why he should be removed, which you have not done, or else we\u2019re going to start this case and you can represent yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">Inasmuch as you apparently have not made arrangements for alternate counsel, I suggest that you strongly consider going forward with the very capable lawyer that you have been provided. Failing that, I will protect your right to represent yourself. But this is the day and time of proceeding and we\u2019ve run out of time. We\u2019ve run out of options. So I suggest that you confine yourself to what we\u2019ve discussed. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Although the trial court then gave defendant several additional opportunities to select an option,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant continued to refuse to do so, at which time the trial court empanelled the jury and asked defendant if he had any questions for the panel. Defendant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, this is something totally new for me. I\u2019m being forced into this situation ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">I requested the Court appoint new counsel for me, and they said, for some reason being that we\u2019re here and they don\u2019t see the difference \u2014 any differences between me and Mr. Nunzio. So they forced me to go on with this trial alone by myself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">After a four-day trial, defendant was convicted on both charges and sentenced to consecutive prison terms of two-and-a-half to forty years on each count. Although the Court of Appeals remanded this case for correction of the presentence investigation report and resentencing, it affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions, concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>defendant, by his conduct alone, had demonstrated his choice to represent himself at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The United States Supreme Court has held that the right to self-representation is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, <em>Faretta v California, </em>422 US 806, 819-820; 95 S Ct 2525; 45 L Ed 2d 562 (1975), and that a defendant may waive his right to counsel, provided he do so \u201ccompetently and intelligently.\u201d <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 468. [W]hether there has been an intelligent waiver of the right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and <em>conduct </em>of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">In Michigan, the right to self-representation is secured by both the state constitution and statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, this Court has stated that a trial court may only permit a defendant to represent himself if the following requirements have been satisfied: (1) the defendant\u2019s request to represent himself has been unequivocal; (2) the defendant has asserted his right of self-representation \u201cknowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily\u201d; (3) the trial court has been satisfied that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>defendant, in representing himself, \u201cwill not disrupt, unduly inconvenience and burden the court and the administration of the court\u2019s business.\u201d <em>People v Anderson, </em>398 Mich 361, 367-368; 247 NW2d 857 (1976). Moreover, the trial court must also satisfy MCR 6.005(D).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>People v Adkins (After Remand), </em>452 Mich 702, 722; 551 NW2d 108 (1996). Taken together, the requirements of Michigan law are in accord with the waiver requirements of the federal constitution. See <em>Iowa v Tovar, </em>541 US 77; 124 S Ct 1379, 1383; 158 L Ed 2d 209, 216 (2004) (\u201cthe [federal] constitutional requirement is satisfied when the trial court informs the accused of the nature of the charges against him, of his right to be counseled regarding his plea, and of the range of allowable punishments attendant upon the entry of the guilty plea\u201d); <em>Faretta, supra </em>at 835 (holding that, before a defendant may waive his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, a defendant \u201cshould be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Compliance with these requirements mandates that the trial court \u201cengage, on the record, in a methodical assessment of the wisdom of self-representation by the defendant.\u201d <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 721. The defendant must exhibit \u201c \u2018an intentional relinquishment or abandonment\u2019 \u201d of the right to trial counsel, and the trial court should \u201c \u2018indulge every reasonable presumption against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>waiver\u2019 \u201d of such right. <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 464. Further, \u201c \u2018[p]resuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible. The record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandably rejected the offer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 721 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Defendant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion when it declined defendant\u2019s request to appoint him a third attorney, thereby forcing defendant to represent himself. That is, defendant contends that because he did not expressly waive his right to trial counsel, such waiver was, at the very least, equivocal and, therefore, invalid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">I disagree. A waiver of a defendant\u2019s right to trial counsel must be \u201cunequivocal,\u201d <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 367, meaning only that such waiver must be \u201c[c]lear; plain; capable of being understood in only one way, or as clearly demonstrated.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed). I do not accept the standard proposed by defendant and implied by the majority \u2014 that only a verbal waiver can sufficiently constitute an \u201cunequivocal\u201d waiver of the right to trial counsel. Neither defendant nor the majority has cited a single state or federal court decision that has adopted such a standard, and I do not believe this standard to be implicit in the requirement of an \u201cunequivocal\u201d waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Here, defendant was offered four options by the trial court in response to his request for a third appointed counsel. Having clearly rejected three of these options, I believe, as a matter of logic, that it can be fairly concluded that defendant \u201cunequivocally\u201d assented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the fourth option. That defendant made clear his displeasure at being limited to these four options does not alter my conclusion. The fact that defendant desired the fifth option of being appointed a third counsel does not transform the trial court\u2019s decision to reject such an appointment into an abuse of discretion. See <em>Mowat v Walsh, </em>254 Mich 302, 304; 236 NW 791 (1931); <em>People v Akins, </em>259 Mich App 545, 556-557; 675 NW2d 863 (2003). As the majority has correctly noted, \u201cno defendant is entitled to the appointed counselor of his choice.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 192 n 25. Because there was no abuse of discretion, there was no fifth option. Defendant was properly limited by the trial court to four options, and he clearly rejected three of these.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Concerning the first option, defendant, despite repeated invitations and opportunities to hire his own counsel, failed to do so and expressed no interest in doing so. Concerning the third and fourth options, defendant, as noted earlier, unambiguously, repeatedly, and vehemently refused to have Nunzio represent him. See pp 197, 199. The majority would disregard defendant\u2019s clear wishes on this point and force defendant to retain Nunzio. <em>Ante </em>at 194. In <em>Faretta, supra </em>at 820-821, the United States Supreme Court asserted that the Sixth Amendment \u201cright to counsel,\u201d does not permit the trial court to appoint counsel that defendant has refused to accept:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">The language and spirit of the Sixth Amendment contemplate that counsel, like the other defense tools guaranteed by the Amendment, shall be an aid to a willing defendant \u2014 not an organ of the State interposed between an unwilling defendant and his right to defend himself personally. To thrust counsel upon the accused, against his considered wish, thus violates the logic of the Amendment. In such a case, counsel is not an assistant, but a master; and the right to make a defense is stripped of the personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>character upon which the Amendment insists. It is true that when a defendant chooses to have a lawyer manage and present his case, law and tradition may allocate to the counsel the power to make binding decisions of trial strategy in many areas.... This allocation can only be justified, however, hy the defendant\u2019s consent, at the outset, to accept counsel as his representative. An unwanted counsel \u201crepresents\u201d the defendant only through a tenuous and unacceptable legal fiction. Unless the accused has acquiesced in such representation, the defense presented is not the defense guaranteed him by the Constitution, for, in a very real sense, it is not <em>his </em>defense. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><em>Faretta </em>continued by stating, \u201cno State or Colony had ever forced counsel upon an accused; no spokesman had ever suggested that such a practice would be tolerable, much less advisable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 832. The Court then observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">There can be no blinking at the fact that the right of an accused to conduct his own defense seems to cut against the grain of this Court\u2019s decisions holding that the Constitution requires that no accused can be convicted and imprisoned unless he has been accorded the right to the assistance of counsel. See <em>Powell v Alabama, </em>287 US 45 [53 S Ct 55; 77 L Ed 158 (1932)]; <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458 [58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461 (1938)]; <em>Gideon v Wainwright, </em>372 US 335 [83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963); <em>Argersinger v Hamlin, </em>407 US 25 [92 S Ct 2006; 32 L Ed 2d 530 (1972)]. For it is surely true that the basic thesis of those decisions is that the help of a lawyer is essential to assure the defendant a fair trial. And a strong argument can surely be made that the whole thrust of those decisions must inevitably lead to the conclusion that a State may constitutionally impose a lawyer upon even an unwilling defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">But it is one thing to hold that every defendant, rich or poor, has the right to the assistance of counsel, and quite another to say that a State may compel a defendant to accept a lawyer he does not want. The value of state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>appointed counsel was not unappreciated by the Founders, yet the notion of compulsory counsel was utterly foreign to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">To force a lawyer on a defendant can only lead him to believe that the law contrives against him. <em>[Id. </em>at 832-834.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Moreover, in his concurrence in <em>Martinez v Court of Appeals of California, </em>528 US 152, 165; 120 S Ct 684; 145 L Ed 2d 597 (2000), Justice Scalia noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">I have no doubt that the Framers of our Constitution, who were suspicious enough of governmental power\u2014 including judicial power \u2014 that they insisted upon a citizen\u2019s right to be judged by an independent jury of private citizens, would not have found acceptable the compulsory assignment of counsel by the <em>Government </em>to plead a criminal defendant\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">That asserting the right of self-representation may often, or even usually, work to the defendant\u2019s disadvantage is no more remarkable \u2014 and no more a basis for withdrawing the right \u2014 than is the fact that proceeding without counsel in a custodial interrogation, or confessing to the crime, usually works to the defendant\u2019s disadvantage. Our system of laws generally presumes that the criminal defendant, after being fully informed, knows his own best interests and does not need them dictated by the State. Any other approach is unworthy of a free people. As Justice Frankfurter eloquently put it for the Court in <em>Adams v United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 US 269, 280 [63 S Ct 236; 87 L Ed 268] (1942), to require the acceptance of counsel \u201cis to imprison a man in his privileges and call it the Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Thus, after defendant told the trial court that he no longer wanted Nunzio to represent him, the trial court did not have the authority to force defendant to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>represented by Nunzio.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, I question the basis on which the majority asserts that \u201cthe trial court should have simply denied defendant\u2019s request to appoint another counsel and continued with the proceedings.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 194 n 27.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under <em>Faretta, </em>this type of action by the trial court would seemingly have violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial counsel and presumably provided a basis for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Thus, in light of <em>Faretta, </em>the only remaining option, and this was made abundantly clear to defendant, was the second option. That defendant did not expressly assent to this option is not dispositive of his choice \u2014 for such ail option is all that remained available to him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The majority\u2019s decision to require a defendant under circumstances such as these to <em>expressly </em>assent to self-representation is either to ensure that a \u201cno decision\u201d impasse develops in the event that a defendant refuses to give an express assent, or to unwarrantedly pressure the trial court into disregarding its own judgment \u2014 appointing new trial counsel where it is not viewed as necessary \u2014 and enduring the necessary trial delays as new counsel orients himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">That is, the majority\u2019s decision requires the trial court to exercise its discretion in accord with defendant\u2019s own preferences and to compel the trial court to grant him a third appointed counsel. But the question of such an exercise of discretion is a distinct question from whether the trial court has complied with its obligations in permitting a defendant to proceed to trial by self-representation. Because I believe that there has been no abuse of discretion by the trial court in rejecting defendant\u2019s application for a third appointed counsel, defendant has no right to such counsel. He has a right only to the four options identified by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The upshot of the majority\u2019s decision, in my judgment, is that it undermines the administration of justice by encouraging gamesmanship in the courtroom by criminal defendants, making more readily available an appellate parachute for appellants, and frustrating the orderly progress of trial proceedings. As this Court has previously observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">The Court recognizes and sympathizes with the \u201cCatch 22\u201d judges face in the waiver of counsel setting. On the one hand, defendants have a right to counsel. On the other hand, defendants have a right to self-representation. We realize the potential for savvy defendants to use these competing rights as a means of securing an appellate parachute. <em>[Adkins, supra </em>at 724.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Although a defendant\u2019s rights to trial counsel and to self-representation are intertwined, defendant here would ensure that these rights increasingly take on a \u201czero sum\u201d relationship in which either the former or the latter right is necessarily violated, and in which one or the other becomes a potential basis for appellate reversal. This becomes more likely when formalisms (such as the majority\u2019s unfounded requirement that a waiver only be effected by verbal statement) come to prevail over an inquiry into the totality of circumstances, including both the verbal statements and the conduct of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, I would find that defendant, by his conduct alone, unequivocally waived his right to trial counsel. Given defendant\u2019s knowledge that the trial court was unprepared to appoint new counsel and defendant\u2019s clear rejection of three of the four options offered to him by the trial court, I believe that these circumstances, which do not include a verbal statement of assent to self-representation, sufficiently give rise to an \u201cunequivocal\u201d waiver of his right to trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Because of the disadvantages that inure from self-representation, a defendant must also \u201cknowingly [and] intelligently\u201d waive his right to trial counsel. <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 368. To satisfy this requirement, the trial court must ensure that a defendant has been \u201cmade sufficiently aware of his right to have counsel\u201d and \u201cof the possible consequences of a decision to forgo the aid of counsel\u201d so that his choice \u201c \u2018is made with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d <em>Patterson v Illinois, </em>487 US 285, 292-293; 108 S Ct 2389; 101 L Ed 2d 261 (1988)(citations omitted); see also <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 368, 370-371. \u201cThe trial judge is in the best position to determine whether the defendant has made the waiver knowingly . .. .\u201d <em>Adkins, supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>723 (citation omitted). In this case, the trial court engaged in a lengthy and methodical colloquy, over thirty-five pages long, explicitly warning defendant of the dangers of self-representation. Among other warnings, the trial court counseled that, \u201cunless you are legally trained,. . . there are many pitfalls there for the unwary,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m suggesting that you don\u2019t know legal procedure.\u201d The trial court also advised defendant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">I should advise you that there is an ancient adage in the law, for good reason, that a man who acts as his own counsel has a fool for a client. The corollary to the rule is that he also has a fool for a lawyer, but, as a practical matter, it all winds up in the same place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">My guess is that you will not fare well in that approach, but you have a right to take that approach if you wish to do it. And, while I would not advise it, I will certainly guard your rights and see to it that you have the opportunity to present your own defense, if that\u2019s your wish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Further, the trial court repeatedly warned defendant that if Nunzio were removed, new trial counsel would not be appointed. Finally, the trial court gave defendant numerous opportunities, including two separate recesses, to consult with Nunzio concerning defendant\u2019s four options. Accordingly, I am convinced, as was the trial court, that under the circumstances of this case, there is no question that defendant was provided with sufficient information to make a decision with \u201ceyes wide open.\u201d Thus, I would hold that the trial court did not err in finding that defendant \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d waived his right to trial counsel when he repeatedly informed the trial court that he no longer wanted Nunzio to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">A defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to trial counsel must also be voluntary. <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 371. \u201cThe trial judge is in the best position to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the defendant has made the waiver. . . voluntary.\u201d <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 723 (citation omitted). Substitution of counsel is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>People v Williams, </em>386 Mich 565, 578; 194 NW2d 337 (1972). \u201cWhile a defendant may not be forced to proceed to trial with incompetent or unprepared counsel, ... a refusal without good cause to proceed with able counsel is a \u2018voluntary\u2019 waiver.\u201d <em>Maynard v Meachum, </em>545 F2d 273, 278 (CA 1, 1976). See also <em>United States v Harris, 2 </em>F3d 1452, 1455 (CA 7, 1993) (finding a voluntary and informed waiver where the defendant refused to cooperate with his lawyers and was told that no substitute counsel would be appointed for him); <em>United States v Kneeland, </em>148 F3d 6, 12 (CA 1, 1998) (a waiver of the right to trial counsel must be considered involuntary if the defendant had a valid reason for requesting the appointment of new trial counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">In <em>United States v Moore, </em>706 F2d 538 (CA 5, 1983), the trial court required the defendant to proceed pro se after he rejected several court-appointed attorneys. Like the instant defendant, the defendant in <em>Moore </em>made statements on the record that he was not waiving his right to trial counsel, but that he simply wanted different trial counsel. The defendant was convicted and appealed his conviction on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">[Defendant] refers to a statement by the trial court which indicates that the court knew [defendant] was not waiving his right to counsel. This misperceives the record. Viewed in the context of the entire dialogue, the trial court was noting its awareness that [defendant] was not waiving his demand for dismissal of his current attorney and appointment of another. That demand is precisely the issue herein presented: may a defendant repeatedly demand that his appointed counsel be relieved and that new counsel be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>appointed and, if the request is denied, contend that his sixth amendment right to counsel. . . has been violated? We answer that inquiry in the negative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">We conclude that a persistent, unreasonable demand for dismissal of counsel and appointment of new counsel, as herein discussed, is the functional equivalent of a knowing and voluntary waiver of counsel. In such an instance the trial court may proceed to trial with the defendant representing himself. <em>[Id. </em>at 540.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Similarly, in <em>United States v Fazzini, </em>871 F2d 635 (CA 7, 1989), the defendant sought to remove his fourth court-appointed attorney. In allowing the defendant to dismiss his latest attorney, the trial court \u201cexpressly found that defendant, through his actions, had knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642. During trial, the defendant claimed that he was being \u201cforced\u201d to proceed pro se, and continually expressed a desire for new counsel to be appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The defendant was ultimately convicted. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">In this case, the defendant claims that he did not knowingly and intentionally waive his right to appointed counsel since he continued to ask for counsel even after Kling was excused from the case. Yet it is not necessary that a defendant verbally waive his right to counsel; so long as the district court has given the defendant sufficient opportunity to retain the assistance of appointed counsel, defendant\u2019s actions which have the effect of depriving himself of appointed counsel will establish a knowing and intentional choice. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The instant defendant was essentially given only two viable options \u2014 continue with court-appointed counsel or continue without court-appointed counsel. Defendant made it abundantly clear that he would not be cooperating with his current counsel, and therefore, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>believe, that he effectively chose to proceed pro se. Like the defendant in <em>Fazzini, </em>the instant defendant denied that he was making this choice. Nevertheless, the vehement negation of one choice \u2014 to proceed with his current counsel \u2014 constituted the acceptance of the only remaining option available \u2014 to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">I agree with the lower courts and believe that defendant consistently failed to assert a valid reason to have new court-appointed counsel, and thus voluntarily waived his right to trial counsel. The trial court asserted that \u201cMr. Nunzio is a man of considerable professional ability,\u201d with an extensive history of trial work, and is an \u201cextremely capable\u201d and \u201cwell-respected\u201d defense attorney. Further, Nunzio himself apprised the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">Your honor, I am prepared to try the case. I am not only familiar with all the issues surrounding this case, but I have dealt with these cases numerous times in the last number of years. And I have communicated all of those relevant issues that I have explored. The discovery is complete. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to look at discovery. I talked to the prosecutor in this case regarding this case. I am more than capable at this point in time trying the case</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">But counsel is ready to proceed to trial at this point in time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Later, after defendant asserted \u201cthat Mr. Nunzio is not representing me in a proper[] fashion,\u201d the trial court responded, \u201cI don\u2019t see that. I see no indication that Mr. Nunzio has done anything wrong at all.\u201d I agree with the trial court and the Court of Appeals and find no evidence in the record to suggest that Nunzio\u2019s representation of defendant \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness . ...\u201d <em>People v Gonzalez, </em>468 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>636, 644; 664 NW2d 159 (2003). Nor does defendant present any evidence to the contrary. Because I believe that this Court should follow federal precedent, holding that an unreasonable insistence on the appointment of a new attorney operates as a waiver of the right to counsel, and that defendant\u2019s protests to the contrary do not render that waiver ambiguous, I dissent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">To constitute a valid waiver of the right to trial counsel, the trial court must also be satisfied that in representing himself, defendant \u201cwill not disrupt, unduly inconvenience and burden the court and the administration of the court\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 368. Because the trial court, in fact, allowed defendant to represent himself, I would hold that the trial court was persuaded that defendant, in representing himself, would not disrupt or otherwise inconvenience or burden the court and, thus, fulfilled the third requirement of <em>Anderson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Further, although the requirements in <em>Anderson </em>have been satisfied, the trial court must \u201csubstantially comply\u201d with MCR 6.005(D) for a valid waiver to occur. <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 726. \u201cA particular court\u2019s method of inquiring into and satisfying these concepts is decidedly up to it, as long as the concepts in these requirements are covered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725. I would hold that MCR 6.005(D) was satisfied here because defendant was fully advised of the nature of the charges against him and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>possible punishments in the information,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and of the risks involved in self-representation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Finally, the court should \u201cindulge every <em>reasonable </em>presumption [de-italicize presumption] against waiver\u201d of a defendant\u2019s right to trial counsel. <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 721 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). \u201c \u2018The record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandably rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adkins, supra </em>at 721 (citations omitted). As previously discussed, defendant here intelligently waived his right to trial counsel by repeatedly stating that he did not want Nunzio to represent him. <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u201cThe determination of whether there has been an intelligent waiver of the right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including [the] <em>conduct of the accused.\u201d Johnson, supra </em>at 464 (emphasis added). I would conclude that defendant\u2019s conduct, under the circumstances of this case \u2014 his informed and unequivocal refusal to accept <em>any </em>of the other three options offered to him by the trial court \u2014 constituted an acceptance of the only remaining option, and that defendant thereby \u201cintentional[ly] relinquish[ed] or abandoned] \u201d his right to trial counsel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">I believe that defendant, by his conduct alone, unequivocally waived his constitutional and statutory right to trial counsel. Further, I believe that defendant\u2019s waiver satisfied the requirements of <em>Anderson </em>and MCR 6.005(D). Accordingly, I would hold that defendant waived his right to trial counsel and thus affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-6\">CORRIGAN, C.J., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\"> The trial court permitted defendant\u2019s first appointed trial counsel, Paul Mitchell, to withdraw after defendant complained about the manner in which he represented defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\"> In order to accord defendant adequate opportunity to consult with Nunzio regarding the four options, the trial court took two recesses, the first for twenty minutes and the second for one-and-a-half hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\"> 254 Mich App 11, 22; 656 NW2d 817 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\"> Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 13 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">A suitor in any court of this state has the right to prosecute or defend his suit, either in his own proper person or by an attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">MCL 763.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-12\">On the trial of every indictment or other criminal accusation, the party accused shall he allowed to be heard by counsel and may defend himself, and he shall have a right to produce witnesses and proofs in his favor, and meet the witnesses who are produced against him face to face.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\"> MCR 6.005(D) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">The court may not permit the defendant to make an initial waiver of the right to be represented by a lawyer without first</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">(1) advising the defendant of the charge, the maximum possible prison sentence for the offense, any mandatory minimum sentence required by law, and the risk involved in self representation, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">(2) offering the defendant the opportunity to consult with a retained lawyer or, if the defendant is indigent, the opportunity to consult with an appointed lawyer.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\"> It was entirely proper for the trial court to require defendant to choose between proceeding to trial with his present attorney and representing himself.

The majority focuses on only a single sentence in that case, <em>ante </em>at 188 n 12, while ignoring the general rule repeatedly set forth in <em>Faretta </em>that it is a violation of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial counsel to \u201ccompel a defendant to accept a lawyer he does not want.\u201d <em>Faretta, supra </em>at 833.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\"> To further support my assertion that defendant unequivocally waived his right to trial counsel, I note that defendant did not contradict Nunzio, who, after meeting with defendant during an hour-and-a-half recess, told the trial court, \u201cI believe Mr. Russell still contends he wishes to represent himself.\u201d If, as the majority asserts, defendant \u201cconsistently denied that his choice was self-representation,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 192, I question why defendant, who was decidedly vocal in expressing any disagreements that he had during trial proceedings, did not challenge the truth of this statement by Nunzio.
