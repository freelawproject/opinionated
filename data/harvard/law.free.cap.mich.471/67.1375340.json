He argues, through his mother as next friend, that these conditions are the proximate results of defendants\u2019 negligence in treating his mother during her labor leading to his delivery. Specifically, plaintiff maintains that defendants administered an excessive amount of a contraction-inducing medication to his mother and were unable to detect signs of fetal distress because they failed to make appropriate use of fetal monitoring devices. The trial court denied defendants\u2019 request to hold a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing on expert testimony that purported to draw a causal connection between these breaches of the standard of care and plaintiffs present neurological and physiological condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">Following a five week trial, the jury returned a verdict in plaintiffs favor. The trial court thereafter determined that defendant Henry Ford Health System <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>was liable as a successor corporation to defendant Associated Physicians, EC. The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of liability, but ordered remittitur on lost wage earning capacity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse and remand the matter for entry of judgment in defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">This appeal arises out of the events surrounding plaintiffs birth on July 16, 1980. Plaintiffs mother, Kimberly Craig, received prenatal care from defendant Associated Physicians, EC. Associated Physicians employed four obstetricians, including defendants Dr. Elias Gennaoui and Dr. Ajit Kittur.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ms. Craig met with each obstetrician at some point before plaintiffs birth, but was primarily attended to by Dr. Gennaoui during plaintiffs delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Ms. Craig\u2019s amniotic and chorionic membranes ruptured at approximately 5:30 A.M. on July 16, 1980, and she was admitted to defendant Oakwood Hospital within a half hour. The resident doctor on call at the time noted that plaintiffs fetal heart tones were within a normal range. Dr. Kittur, who was the attending physician on staff when Ms. Craig was admitted, requested that Ms. Craig be given an intravenous (IV) \u201ckeep open\u201d line to maintain hydration and to establish a channel for the intravenous administration of medication, should the need arise. Nurses applied an external fetal-uterine monitor to Ms. Craig at approximately 9:30 A.M., at which time she still had not experienced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>contractions. At 10:00, Ms. Craig began to receive 1000 cc of a <em>5% </em>Ringer\u2019s lactate solution through the \u201ckeep open\u201d IV line.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Dr. Gennaoui, who had taken over for Dr. Kittur sometime after Ms. Craig was admitted, met with Ms. Craig at approximately 11:00 A.M. He was concerned that Ms. Craig and her child had been exposed to infection since her membranes burst earlier that morning,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and concluded that Ms. Craig should be given ten units of Pitocin<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in order to induce labor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>From 11:30 A.M. to 6:00 P.M., Ms. Craig was given doses of Pitocin in increasing amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">One of the central issues at trial was the precise amount of Pitocin administered to Ms. Craig and whether, as plaintiff argued, she had mistakenly received a double dosage. Plaintiffs standard of care expert, Paul Gatewood, M.D., testified that Ms. Craig\u2019s medical records reveal that she was inadvertently given two doses of Pitocin. The first was administered shortly after 11:00 A.M. upon Dr. Gennaoui\u2019s order. Nurse Quinlan wrote a check on Dr. Gennaoui\u2019s order for Pitocin to indicate, according to Dr. Gatewood, that she had performed Dr. Gennaoui\u2019s request and had administered Pitocin through the 5% Ringer\u2019s lactate solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Dr. Gatewood noted, however, that another nurse, Tyra, had written in Ms. Craig\u2019s records that she had administered Pitocin through a solution other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>than the <em>5% </em>Ringer\u2019s lactate Ms. Craig was already receiving intravenously. Thus, according to Dr. Gate-wood\u2019s testimony, Dr. Gennaoui had given a single order for Pitocin that had been filled twice \u2014 once by Nurse Quinlan through the 5% Ringer\u2019s lactate solution, and once by Nurse Tyra through the D5W solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Also contested at trial was whether Ms. Craig\u2019s labor presented any complications. Medical records compiled after plaintiffs birth show that Ms. Craig began experiencing contractions of \u201cmoderate\u201d strength after receiving Pitocin and that \u201cmoderate\u201d contractions continued until plaintiffs delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Plaintiff contends, however, that the records from a fetal uterine monitor tell a different story. These records, according to Dr. Gatewood, show that plaintiff experienced recurrent decelerations of his heart rate, or bradycardia, after Ms. Craig began to receive Pitocin. Dr. Gatewood explained at trial that the decelerations occurred because the Pitocin administered to Ms. Craig caused contractions of excessive intensity and duration. Plaintiffs umbilical cord became compressed because of these contractions, thereby decreasing the amount of blood flowing to plaintiff. The result was the pattern of decelerations in heart rate shown by the fetal uterine monitor and a decrease in the amount of oxygen flowing to plaintiffs brain, or \u201chypoxia\u201d in medical parlance.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Plaintiff was born shortly before 7:00 P.M. that day. His Apgar scores, 8 and 9 (on a one to ten scale), were well within the typical range,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> indicating that plaintiff appeared to be a normal, healthy baby. Plaintiff also contests this Apgar assessment, maintaining that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>picture of plaintiff taken shortly after his birth depicts an infant who had recently suffered head trauma. Specifically, plaintiff points to a \u201clarge ridge\u201d across his forehead as evidence of \u201cfacial or brow molding,\u201d and argues that the photograph clearly reveals bruising and edema,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> both sure signs of trauma. In addition, plaintiff contends that the postdelivery picture shows him \u201cgazing\u201d to the right while holding his left hand in a cortical position and that these \u201care indicative of acute brain injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Two days after his birth, plaintiff was examined by pediatrician Dr. Carolyn Johnson, who concluded that plaintiff seemed to be healthy and displayed normal cognitive functions. Plaintiff received a vastly different diagnosis approximately one year later. On June 6, 1981, Ms. Craig had plaintiff examined by Dr. Michael Nigro, a pediatric neurologist, after noticing that plaintiff began to seem developmentally slow after his third month. Dr. Nigro diagnosed plaintiff with nonprogressive encephalopathy<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> with global developmental delay and mild spasticity. He concluded at the time and maintained throughout this trial that the etiology or cause of plaintiffs condition was unclear.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Plaintiff initiated the present lawsuit in 1994 through his mother, Kimberly Craig, as next friend. He alleged that Drs. Gennaoui and Kittur committed medical malpractice in failing to monitor plaintiffs heartbeat with an internal uterine catheter until 2:30 P.M. on July 16, 1980. Further, he alleged that Dr. Gennaoui and his colleagues negligently administered Pitocin to Ms. Craig despite the fact that she presented physical symptoms indicating that Pitocin was unnecessary and potentially harmful. As a result, plaintiff alleged, plaintiff sustained brain damage either through hypoxia or through the pounding of plaintiffs head against his mother\u2019s \u201cpelvic rim\u201d before birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Plaintiff also named Associated Physicians, PC., the employer of Drs. Kittur and Gennaoui, under a theory of vicarious liability. In addition, plaintiff named Oakwood Hospital, where plaintiff was delivered, and named Henry Ford Hospital under a successor liability theory.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">On January 21, 1997, defendant asked the Court to exclude the testimony of Dr. Ronald Gabriel, plaintiffs proposed causation expert, or, in the alternative, to conduct <em>a.Davis-Frye </em>hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Henry Ford filed a successful motion to sever. However, the trial court found after conducting a bench trial that Henry Ford was liable to plaintiff as a successor to Associated Physicians, PC.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">After the jury found in plaintiffs favor, the court entered judgment of $21 million, reflecting the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>value of the $36 million awarded by the jury. The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">On February 1, 2002, the Court of Appeals affirmed the jury verdict in plaintiffs favor, but ordered remittitur because of the jury\u2019s overestimation of plaintiffs lost wage earning capacity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The panel also affirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Henry Ford was liable to plaintiff as a successor corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We granted defendants\u2019 applications for leave to appeal on September 12, 2003, limiting the parties to the following issues: \u201c(1) Whether the witnesses\u2019 testimony was based on facts not in evidence and whether the trial court erred in permitting the testimony of plaintiffs expert witnesses; (2) Whether the trial court erred in finding defendant Henry Ford Hospital liable on a successor liability theory.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We denied plaintiffs application for leave to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">We review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A court necessarily abuses its discretion when it \u201cadmits evidence that is inadmissible as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, any error in the admission or exclusion of evidence will not warrant appellate relief \u201cunless refusal to take this action appears .. . inconsistent with substantial justice,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or affects \u201ca substantial right of the [opposing] party.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>We review de novo a trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In conducting this review de novo, we \u201c \u2018review the evidence and all legitimate inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Only when \u201cthe evidence viewed in this light fails to establish a claim as a matter of law\u201d is the moving party entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The doctrine of successor liability is \u201c \u2018derived from equitable principles.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Its application is therefore subject to review de novo.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">III. IMPROPER ADMISSION OF EXPERT TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We turn, first, to the trial court\u2019s erroneous conclusion that defendant Oakwood Hospital was not entitled to a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing before the admission of Dr. Ronald Gabriel\u2019s expert testimony. Defendant contends that the trial court erred when it denied its motion to exclude the expert opinion testimony of Dr. Gabriel or, in the alternative, to hold a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">A. MRE 702 AND <em>DAVIS-FRYE </em>ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Expert testimony is admitted pursuant to MRE 702, which provided, at the pertinent times:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">If the court determines that recognized scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">In construing this rule of evidence, we must apply \u201c \u2018the legal principles that govern the construction and application of statutes.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> When the language of an evidentiary rule is unambiguous, we apply the plain meaning of the text \u201c \u2018without further judicial construction or interpretation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The plain language of MRE 702 establishes three broad preconditions to the admission of expert testimony.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> First, the proposed expert witness must be \u201cqualified\u201d to render the proposed testimony.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Generally, the expert may be qualified by virtue of \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In a medical malpractice action such as this one, the court\u2019s assessment of an expert\u2019s \u201cqualifications\u201d are now guided by MCL 600.2169(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">In determining the qualifications of an expert witness in an action alleging medical malpractice, the court shall, at a minimum, evaluate all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">(a) The educational and professional training of the expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">(b) The area of specialization of the expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">(c) The length of time the expert witness has been engaged in the active clinical practice or instruction of the health profession or the specialty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>(d) The relevancy of the expert witness\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Second, the proposed testimony must \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue . .. ,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In other words, the expert opinion testimony \u201cmust serve to give the trier of fact a better understanding of the evidence or assist in determining a fact in issue.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Finally, under MRE 702 as it read when this matter was tried, expert testimony must have been based on a \u201crecognized\u201d form of \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals properly construed this language in <em>Nelson v American Sterilizer Co (On Remand):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">The word \u201crecognized\u201d connotes a general acknowledgement of the existence, validity, authority, or genuineness of a fact, claim or concept. The adjective \u201cscientific\u201d connotes a grounding in the principles, procedures, and methods of science. Finally, the word \u201cknowledge\u201d connotes more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation. The word applies to any body of known facts or to any body of ideas inferred from such facts or accepted as truths on good grounds.[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Continuing along these lines, the word \u201ctechnical\u201d signifies grounding in a specialized field of knowledge, or a particular \u201cart, science, or the like.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Similarly, \u201cspecialized\u201d suggests a foundation in a specific field of study or expertise.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">When this case was tried, the admission of expert testimony was subject not only to the threshold requirements of MRE 702, but also to the standard articulated in <em>People v </em>Davis,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>now generally known in Michigan as the <em>Davis-Frye </em>test.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In <em>Davis, </em>we held that expert opinion based on novel scientific techniques is admissible only if the underlying methodology is generally accepted within the scientific community.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thus, in determining whether the proposed expert opinion was grounded in a \u201crecognized\u201d field of scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge as was required by MRE 702, a trial court was obligated to ensure that the expert opinion was based on accurate and generally accepted methodologies.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The proponent of expert testimony bears the burden of proving general acceptance under this standard.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">B. THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO PERFORM ITS GATEKEEPING ROLE UNDER MRE 702</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In this case, defendant Oakwood Hospital moved in limine to exclude the testimony of Dr. Ronald Gabriel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>on the basis that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s theory of how plaintiff sustained brain damage was not generally accepted within the medical community, as required by <em>Davis-Frye. </em>Dr. Gabriel\u2019s etiological theory, as summarized by defendant in arguing its motion, was that \u201chyperstimulat[ion]\u201d of the uterus caused the head of the fetus (plaintiff) to pound against his mother\u2019s pelvic anatomy, thereby producing permanent brain damage. This theory, according to defendant, was novel enough to be excluded and, at best, was admissible only once it passed through the crucible of <em>Davis-Frye </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In response to this motion, plaintiffs attorney produced several articles and authorities that were meant to demonstrate a link between the use of Pitocin and the type of injury sustained by plaintiff. But while some of these articles described a correlation between the use of Pitocin and generalized brain injury, none of these authorities supported the theory of causation actually put forth by Dr. Gabriel. That is, none supported a causal connection between Pitocin and brain injury incurred through repeated pounding of the fetal head against maternal anatomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">However, the court did not rely on authorities proffered by plaintiff in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing. Instead of consulting plaintiffs proffered scientific and medical literature, the court erroneously assigned the burden of proof under <em>Davis-Frye </em>to defendant \u2014 the party <em>opposing </em>the admission of Dr. Gabriel\u2019s testimony \u2014 and held that defendant was not entitled to a hearing because it failed to prove that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s theory <em>lacked </em>\u201cgeneral acceptance.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>When the MRE 702 principles described above are properly applied, it is evident that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing. This abuse of discretion was predicated on two fundamental legal errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">First, the trial court erred in concluding that it had no obligation to review plaintiffs proposed expert testimony unless defendant introduced evidence that the expert testimony was \u201cnovel.\u201d Under MRE 702, the trial court had an independent obligation to review <em>all </em>expert opinion testimony in order to ensure that the opinion testimony satisfied the three <em>Beckley </em>preconditions noted above \u2014 that it was rendered by a \u201cqualified expert,\u201d that the testimony would \u201cassist the trier of fact,\u201d and, under the rules of evidence in effect during this trial, that the opinion testimony was rooted in \u201crecognized\u201d scientific or technical principles. These obligations applied irrespective of the type of expert opinion testimony offered by the parties.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> While a party may waive any claim of error by failing to call this gatekeeping obligation to the court\u2019s attention, the court <em>must </em>evaluate expert testimony under MRE 702 once that issue is raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Second, the trial court erred in concluding that there was no justification for a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing. At issue was Dr. Gabriel\u2019s opinion that Pitocin administered to Ms. Craig produced contractions of excessive duration and force, that these contractions caused plaintiffs head to be repeatedly ground against Ms. Craig\u2019s pelvic anatomy, and that the resulting head trauma caused plaintiffs cerebral palsy. This causal sequence, defendant argued, has \u201cnever been described in medical literature\u201d and was at odds with the testimony of plaintiffs other expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Plaintiff failed to introduce a single authority that truly supported Dr. Gabriel\u2019s theory in response to defendant\u2019s motion. Instead, plaintiff repeatedly stressed that medical literature amply supported the proposition that Pitocin could cause brain damage \u2014 a proposition defendant did not contest \u2014 and supplied the court with literature to that effect. But this literature had little to do with Dr. Gabriel\u2019s causal theory and therefore did not counter the proposition that his expert opinion was based on novel science.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Therefore, a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing was more than justified in light of the information before the trial court when it ruled on defendant\u2019s motion in limine. The proponent of expert opinion testimony bears the burden of proving that the contested opinion is based on generally accepted methodology.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Because there was no evidence to indicate that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s theory was anything <em>but </em>novel, the trial court was required to conduct the <em>Davis-Frye </em>inquiry requested by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Had the trial court conducted the assessment required by MRE 702, it might well have determined that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s theory was not \u201crecognized\u201d as required by our rules of evidence. Indeed, the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>plaintiff offered in support of Dr. Gabriel should have provided sufficient notice to the trial court that his theory lacked general acceptance in the medical community. For one thing, Dr. Gabriel was unable to cite a single study supporting his traumatic injury theory during a voir dire conducted at trial. The only authorities he offered for the proposition that excessive amounts of Pitocin may cause cerebral palsy through the traumatic mechanism he described at trial were studies he cited in which Pitocin caused cerebral palsy in animals when given in excessive amounts. These studies did not involve the \u201cbumping and grinding\u201d mechanism on which Dr. Gabriel\u2019s expert testimony relied. In fact, Dr. Gabriel expressly distinguished the mechanism to which he attributed plaintiffs injuries from those at work in the animal studies. It would appear, then, that there was little evidence that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s theory was \u201crecognized,\u201d much less generally accepted, within pediatric neurology.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Second, had the court conducted the MRE 702 inquiry requested by defendant, it might have discovered that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s theory lacked evidentiary support. Dr. Gabriel was unable to identify the specific part of Ms. Craig\u2019s anatomy with which, according to his theory, plaintiffs head repeatedly collided during labor. Indeed, Dr. Gabriel pointedly refused to identify this anatomical structure on a chart, contending that such testimony was beyond his expertise. This failure to root his causal theory in anything but his own hypothetical depiction of female anatomy indicates that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s testimony may have been too speculative under MRE 702 to assist the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Finally, a Davis-Fryef.MRE 702 hearing should have alerted the court to the error described in part IV. At no point did Dr. Gabriel opine that the traumatic and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>vascular mechanisms he described could cause cerebral palsy, or that those mechanisms might produce the asymmetrical development shown in plaintiffs MRI. Thus, Dr. Gabriel\u2019s testimony supported plaintiffs medical malpractice claim only if the jury was permitted to assume, without supporting evidence, that a causal connection existed between these elements. As shown in part IV, this is not a permissible inference. Consequently, the court again had reason to conclude that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s testimony could not have \u201cassist[ed] the trier of fact\u201d given the yawning gap between Dr. Gabriel\u2019s testimony and the conclusions plaintiff hoped the jury would draw from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Although the trial court clearly erred in declining to review Dr. Gabriel\u2019s testimony before its admission, we need not determine whether reversal on this basis alone is warranted under the \u201csubstantial justice\u201d standard of our court rules.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, remand for <em>SiDavis-Frye </em>hearing is unnecessary given plaintiffs failure to establish the causation element of his medical malpractice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">IV JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Even if plaintiff were able to show upon remand that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s testimony was properly admitted, defendants would nevertheless be entitled to JNOV. The record reveals that the proofs submitted by plaintiff do not support the verdict rendered by the jury because of plaintiffs failure to establish that defendants\u2019 breach of the applicable standard of care proximately caused his cerebral palsy. We therefore reverse and remand for entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>A. STATUTORY AND COMMON LAW BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In order to establish a cause of action for medical malpractice, a plaintiff must establish four elements: (1) the appropriate standard of care governing the defendant\u2019s conduct at the time of the purported negligence, (2) that the defendant breached that standard of care, (3) that the plaintiff was injured, and (4) that the plaintiffs injuries were the proximate result of the defendant\u2019s breach of the applicable standard of care.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> These common-law elements have been codified in MCL 600.2912a, which requires a plaintiff alleging medical malpractice to show that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">[t]he defendant, if a specialist, failed to provide the recognized standard of practice or care within that specialty as reasonably applied in light of the facilities available in the community or other facilities reasonably available under the circumstances, and as a proximate result of defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Furthermore, the plaintiff in a medical malpractice case must establish the proximate causation prong of his prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u201cProximate cause\u201d is a legal term of art that incorporates both cause in fact and legal (or \u201cproximate\u201d) cause.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> We defined these elements in <em>Skinner v Square D Co:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">The cause in fact element generally requires showing that \u201cbut for\u201d the defendant\u2019s actions, the plaintiffs injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>would not have occurred. On the other hand, legal cause or \u201cproximate cause\u201d normally involves examining the foreseeability of consequences, and whether a defendant should be held legally responsible for such consequences.[<footnotemark>47</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">As a matter of logic, a court must find that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a cause in fact of the plaintiffs injuries before it can hold that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate or legal cause of those injuries.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Generally, an act or omission is a cause in fact of an injury only if the injury could not have occurred without (or \u201cbut for\u201d) that act or omission.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> While a plaintiff need not prove that an act or omission was the <em>sole </em>catalyst for his injuries, he must introduce evidence permitting the jury to conclude that the act or omission was <em>a </em>cause.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">It is important to bear in mind that a plaintiff cannot satisfy this burden by showing only that the defendant <em>may </em>have caused his injuries. Our case law requires more than a mere possibility or a plausible explanation.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Rather, a plaintiff establishes that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a cause in fact of his injuries only if he \u201cset[s] forth specific facts that would support a reasonable inference of a logical sequence of cause and effect.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> A valid theory of causation, therefore, must be based on facts in evidence.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> And while \u201c \u2018[t]he evidence need not negate all other possible causes,\u2019 \u201d this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>has consistently required that the evidence \u201c \u2018exclude other reasonable hypotheses with a fair amount of certainty.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In <em>Skinner, </em>for example, we held that the plaintiff failed to show that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused the decedent\u2019s electrocution. <em>Skinner </em>was a product liability action in which the plaintiff claimed that the decedent was killed because an electrical switch manufactured by the defendant had malfunctioned.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The plaintiffs decedent had built a tumbling machine that was used to wash metal- parts, and had used the defendant\u2019s switch to turn the machine on and off.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Wires from the defendant\u2019s switch were attached to the tumbling machine with alligator clips.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Immediately before his death, the plaintiffs decedent was found with both alligator clips in his hands while electricity coursed through his body.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In order to find that a flaw in the defendant\u2019s product was a cause in fact of that electrocution, the jury would have had to conclude, in effect, that the decedent had disconnected the alligator clips and that the machine had somehow been activated again, despite being disconnected from its power source.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Not only was this scenario implausible, but there was no evidence to rule out the possibility that the decedent had been electrocuted because he had mistakenly touched wires he knew to be live. There was no evidence to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>plaintiffs theory of causation.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Consequently, we concluded that the trial court had properly granted summary disposition to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><em>Mulholland v DEC </em>Int\u2019l,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> provides a useful factual counterpoint to <em>Skinner. </em>In <em>Mulholland, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 herd of milking cows contracted mastitis, a bacterial infection of the udder, after the plaintiffs began to use a milking system built by the defendants.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Key expert testimony was provided by Sidney Beale, an expert in agriculture and dairy science. Mr. Beale had observed a milking at the plaintiffs\u2019 farm and deduced that the mastitis was related to the improper configuration of the milking system.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> He suggested that the plaintiffs implement certain changes, and, indeed, once these were put into practice, the plaintiffs noticed \u201ca decrease in mastitis and an increase in milk production in the herd.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We held, on the basis of this expert testimony, that the trial court improperly granted a directed verdict to the defendant.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Because Mr. Beale\u2019s testimony was based on his direct observation of the milking machinery, its use on the plaintiffs\u2019 herd, and teat inflammation in the plaintiffs herd following milking, a jury could have reasonably concluded, on the basis of this testimony, that the milking machinery caused mastitis.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> While Mr. Beale\u2019s testimony did not rule out every other potential cause of mastitis, this fact merely re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>lated to the credibility of his testimony; his opinion was nevertheless admissible and sufficient to support a finding of causation.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">B. PLAINTIFF\u2019S FAILURE TO ESTABLISH CAUSATION</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The statutory and common-law background provided above makes it clear that a plaintiffs prima facie case of medical malpractice must draw a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s breach of the applicable standard of care and the plaintiffs injuries. In this case, the evidence adduced at trial cannot support the jury\u2019s verdict because plaintiff has failed to make the necessary causal links. Even if plaintiff had shown that defendants breached the standard of care, the jury had no basis in the record to connect this breach to the cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and other injuries now presented by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">At trial, plaintiff attempted to connect defendants\u2019 purported violations of the applicable standard of care to plaintiffs injuries through the expert testimony of Drs. Paul Gatewood and Ronald Gabriel. Dr. Gatewood testified principally as a standard of care witness, interpreting the medical records of plaintiff and Ms. Craig, and opining that defendants breached the applicable standard of care by administering excessive amounts of Pitocin and by failing to use an internal uterine pressure catheter. Dr. Gatewood also testified that records from fetal and uterine monitors indicated that Ms. Craig experienced excessive and severe contractions, and that these reduced the flow of oxygenated blood to plaintiff both by compressing the umbilical cord and by reducing the periods of oxygenation between contractions. Dr. Gatewood testified that, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>result, plaintiff suffered from hypoxia and correlated decelerations in his heart rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">While Dr. Gatewood\u2019s testimony connected defendants\u2019 alleged breach of the standard of care to physiological symptoms displayed by plaintiff before his birth, he specifically declined to connect these prebirth conditions to the particular injuries for which plaintiff sought compensation. Indeed, Dr. Gatewood denied he had the requisite expertise to make the causal linkage and expressly refused to testify to a causal relationship between plaintiffs neurological diseases and his prenatal care. He insisted instead that \u201cwhat happened to the baby\u2019s brain\u201d was \u201c[within] the purview of a neurologist.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Plaintiff contended that the link between defendants\u2019 negligence and plaintiffs injuries was to be supplied instead by the expert testimony of Dr. Ronald Gabriel. Dr. Gabriel opined that plaintiffs injuries were attributable to two mechanisms that affected plaintiffs brain before delivery; he referred to these mechanisms as \u201ctraumatic\u201d and \u201cvascular.\u201d According to Dr. Gabriel\u2019s testimony, plaintiff sustained \u201ctraumatic\u201d injuries when excessive uterine contractions induced by Pitocin caused plaintiffs head to be \u201cpounded or grinded [sic] into [his mother\u2019s] pelvic rim\u201d during her labor. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>cause of this pounding, plaintiffs brain sustained compression injuries, which resulted in elevated venous \u201cpressures\u201d and impeded \u201carter[ial] blood flow.\u201d Dr. Gabriel analogized this \u201cvenous component\u201d to the distribution of water through a lawn sprinkler system, explaining that increased pressure in certain areas of the brain reduced the flow of oxygenated blood to outlying, \u201cwatershed\u201d regions of the brain just as \u201cthe last sprinkler who [sic] gets the pressure is the least able to provide water for that area of the lawn.\u201d The crux of Dr. Gabriel\u2019s theory, then, was that plaintiff suffered traumatic head injury during labor and was detrimentally affected by that trauma and the accompanying vascular effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Even if we accept Dr. Gabriel\u2019s testimony in full, a fatal flaw remains in plaintiffs prima facie case: Dr. Gabriel never testified that the injuries stemming from this pounding and its accompanying vascular effects could cause cerebral palsy, mental retardation, or any of the other conditions now presented by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Dr. Gabriel began his testimony by explaining that an MRI image showed that plaintiffs brain tissue had developed asymmetrically. He failed, however, to trace this asymmetric development either back to the traumatic and vascular mechanisms he described or forward to the specific neurological conditions presently displayed by plaintiff. Thus, how exactly the mechanisms he described led to cerebral palsy (as opposed to any other neurological impairment) and how they were connected to the asymmetric brain development depicted in plaintiffs MRI was never explained.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>It is axiomatic in logic and in science that correlation is not causation.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> This adage counsels that it is error to infer that A causes B from the mere fact that A and B occur together. Given the absence of testimony on causation supplied by Dr. Gabriel, the jury could have found for plaintiff only if it indulged in this logical error \u2014 concluding, in effect, that evidence that plaintiff may have sustained a head injury, combined with evidence that plaintiff now has cerebral palsy, leads to the conclusion that the conduct that caused plaintiffs head injury also caused his cerebral palsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Such indulgence is prohibited by our jurisprudence on causation. We have long required the plaintiff to show \u201cthat <em>\u2018but for\u2019 </em>the defendant\u2019s actions, the plaintiffs injury would not have occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Where the connection between the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct and the plaintiffs injuries is entirely speculative, the plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of negligence.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Here, any causal connection between plaintiffs cerebral palsy and the events described by Dr. Gabriel had to be supplied <em>ex nihilo </em>by the jury. Therefore, the trial court erred as a matter of law in denying defendants\u2019 motion for JNOV. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">V SUCCESSOR LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Although we have established that plaintiff has failed to state a valid claim of medical malpractice, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>also correct an erroneous legal conclusion in the published opinion of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The panel held that Henry Ford Health Care Corporation (Henry Ford)<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> was liable as a corporate successor to Associated Physicians, EC. To the contrary, we conclude that the trial court erroneously imposed successor liability on Henry Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">At the time of the alleged malpractice in 1980, defendant Drs. Kittur and Gennaoui were employees of Associated Physicians, EC., which was a medical professional corporation organized under the Professional Service Corporation Act.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Six years after plaintiffs birth, Associated Physicians, EC., began to consider the possibility that Henry Ford might take over its administrative and bookkeeping services. While Henry Ford was interested in pursuing this arrangement with Associated Physicians, the latter\u2019s corporate form posed an obstacle. As a professional corporation, Associated Physicians, EC., could neither legally merge with nor sell its shares to Henry Ford, given that Henry Ford\u2019s shareholders were not physicians.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Consequently, Associated Physicians, EC., split into two entities. Its administrative portion was incorporated Associated Physicians Medical Center, Inc., a business corporation in which nonphysicians could legally share ownership and control. Its medical practice, however, became APMC, EC., a new professional corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Henry Ford purchased all the shares of Associated Physicians Medical Center, Inc., in accordance with the Business Corporation Act.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Henry Ford thereby became the parent corporation of Associated Physicians Medical Center, Inc. As the parties intended before the sale, APMC, EC., entered into an agreement with Associated Physicians Medical Center, Inc., in which the latter controlled billing, record keeping, and other administrative aspects of the medical practice. This arrangement ended in 1993, when APMC, EC., dissolved before the initiation of the present lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Henry Ford argued that, because it assumed the ownership of only the administrative portion of Associated Physicians, EC. (which was vicariously liable to plaintiff), the equitable concerns that justify the imposition of successor liability are not present in this case. The trial court severed the issue of Henry Ford\u2019s successor liability. After a one-hour bench trial, the trial court held that Henry Ford was liable as a successor corporation to Associated Physicians, EC. The Court of Appeals agreed. Both courts relied in part on the factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>listed in <em>Turner v Bituminous Cas Co</em><footnotemark><em>77</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as supporting the imposition of successor liability.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">We recently described the scope of successor liability in <em>Foster v Cone-Blanchard Machine Co.</em><footnotemark><em>79</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There, we observed the \u201ctraditional rule\u201d that successor liability requires an examination of \u201cthe nature of the transaction between predecessor and successor corporations.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> In a merger in which stock is exchanged as consideration, the successor corporation \u201cgenerally assumes all its predecessor\u2019s liabilities.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> When the successor purchases assets for cash, however, the successor corporation assumes its predecessor\u2019s liabilities <em>only</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">(1) where there is an express or implied assumption of liability; (2) where the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger;[<footnotemark>82</footnotemark>] (3) where the transaction was fraudulent; (4) where some of the elements of a purchase in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>faith were lacking, or where the transfer was without consideration and the creditors of the transferor were not provided for; or (5) where the transferee corporation was a mere continuation or reincarnation of the old corporation.[<footnotemark>83</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Plaintiff has not alleged that the sale of Associated Physicians Medical Center, Inc., was fraudulent, in bad faith, or lacking in consideration. Likewise, plaintiff has adduced no evidence that Henry Ford expressly or impliedly assumed the liabilities of Associated Physicians Medical Center, Inc. Our inquiry therefore must focus on whether (1) the transaction was a consolidation or merger (either de jure or de facto), and (2) whether Henry Ford is a \u201cmere continuation\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> of Associated Physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Plaintiffs claim fails on both accounts. First, plaintiff does not allege that a de jure merger took place, and he has not demonstrated that a de facto merger occurred. A de facto merger exists when each of the following requirements is met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">(1) There is a continuation of the enterprise of the seller corporation, so that there is a continuity of management, personnel, physical location, assets, and general business operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">(2) There is a continuity of shareholders which results from the purchasing corporation paying for the acquired assets with shares of its own stock, this stock ultimately coming to be held by the shareholders of the seller corporation so that they become a constituent part of the purchasing corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">(3) The seller corporation ceases its ordinary business operations, liquidates, and dissolves as soon as legally and practically possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">(4) The purchasing corporation assumes those liabilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>and obligations of the seller ordinarily necessary for the uninterrupted continuation of normal business operations of the seller corporation. [<footnotemark>85</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">This transaction is not a de facto merger simply because Henry Ford, the purchasing corporation, paid in cash rather than stock. Thus, there is no \u201ccontinuity of shareholders which results from the purchasing corporation paying for the acquired assets with shares of its own stock . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We also conclude that Henry Ford is not a \u201cmere continuation\u201d of Associated Physicians Medical Center, Inc. As the history recited above shows, Associated Physicians split into two entities immediately before Henry Ford\u2019s purchase of Associated Physicians Medical Center, Inc. The professional corporation\u2014 Associated Physicians\u2019 medical practice \u2014 became APMC, PC. Henry Ford was therefore able to purchase only the administrative aspects of the former professional corporation. The core functions of the entity that originally became vicariously liable to plaintiff were carried on exclusively by APMC, PC., a professional corporation, rather than the business corporation purchased by Henry Ford. Having analyzed the \u201cnature of the transaction,\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> we can only conclude that the only company even arguably liable as a successor to Associated Physicians, PC., is that which continued its medical practice \u2014 namely, APMC, PC.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Moreover, we have never applied successor liability in the medical malpractice context. Plaintiff has adduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>no reason why we should do so in this case. Not only are the <em>Turner/Foster </em>requirements not met here but, more important, the policies that justify the imposition of successor liability are noticeably inapplicable here. We stated in <em>Foster </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">[t]he thrust of the decision in <em>Turner </em>was to provide a remedy to an injured plaintiff in those cases in which the first corporation \u201clegally and/or practically becomes defunct.\u201d . .. The underlying rationale for the <em>Turner </em>Court\u2019s decision to disregard traditional corporate law principles was to provide a source of recovery for injured plaintiffs.[<footnotemark>88</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Here, plaintiff has already sought and obtained a judgment from Drs. Gennaoui and Kittur, from Associated Physicians, EC., and from Oakwood Hospital. Because plaintiff obtained a judgment against other sources, there was no need to impose successor liability on Henry Ford, even if the <em>Turner/Foster </em>factors had justified such liability. The trial court erred in imposing successor liability on Henry Ford and the Court of Appeals erroneously affirmed this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">We conclude that the trial court erred when it refused to grant defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Plaintiff failed to present any evidence from which the fact-finder could reasonably conclude that any breach of the applicable standard of care by defendants proximately caused his cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and other neurological conditions. In addition, the trial court improperly denied defendant Oak-wood Hospital\u2019s motion to compel an evidentiary hearing regarding the qualifications and theories propounded by one of the plaintiffs expert witnesses. Finally, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>court erred in concluding that Henry Ford Health Care Corporation was a corporate successor to the professional medical corporation that employed Dr. Gennaoui. For those reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the matter for entry of judgment in defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-4\">Corrigan, C.J., and Weaver, Taylor, and Markman, JJ., concurred with YOUNG, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> 249 Mich App 534; 643 NW2d 580 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-9\"> Dr. Kittur is not a party to this appeal because the jury determined that he was not negligent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\"> Dr. Gennaoui testified that amniotic fluid, which was discharged when plaintiffs amniotic and chorionic membranes burst, protected the fetus from infection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\"> \u201cPitocin\u201d is a brand name for synthetic oxytocin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b218-10\"> Plaintiff contends that records from a fetal uterine monitor show that Ms. Craig was, in fact, experiencing contractions before Dr. Gennaoui\u2019s decision to administer Pitocin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b218-11\"> Dr. Gatewood described this solution as a mix of dextrose and water.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\"> An Apgar score represents an evaluation of a newborn infant\u2019s physical condition immediately after birth.

I also disagree that there was insufficient evidence of causation. I agree with the conclusion that Henry Ford Hospital is not liable under the theory of successor liability. Therefore, with respect to the defendants other than Henry Ford Hospital, I would affirm the rulings of both lower courts for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">THE <em>DAVIS-FRYE </em>HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Defendant Oakwood Hospital failed to present any substantiation for its motion asserting that the testimony of plaintiffs causation expert, Dr. Ronald Gabriel, was inadmissible because it was not recognized in the scientific community. Rule 2.119(A)(1)(b) of the Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>gan Court Rules requires that a motion state with particularity the grounds and authority on which it is based. All that defendant stated was a conclusory and overbroad statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">[t]he testimony and opinions regarding plaintiffs condition and the causes for it that were offered by Dr. Ronald Gabriel in deposition are groundless in the extreme and, by his own admission, without support or even mention in modern medical literature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">To this statement, defendant attached several pages of Dr. Gabriel\u2019s deposition testimony. After reviewing them, I find that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s only relevant admission is that few recent studies regarding fetal head compression exist because it occurs rarely. The reason it occurs rarely is that fetal heart monitors and other medical technology help detect the conditions associated with it so that head compression is averted.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">A lack of recent studies does not necessarily indicate that a scientific theory has been abandoned or has fallen into disrepute. It may indicate that the theory has become generally accepted. For instance, although there are no recent scientific studies showing the shape of the earth, the statement, \u201cThe earth is round,\u201d would be accepted in the scientific community.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In its response to defendant\u2019s motion, plaintiff cited the Physician\u2019s Desk Reference and quoted a textbook describing the effects of labor on a fetus. Defendant offered nothing in response. Had it set forth specific grounds and authority to support the motion, a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing would have been appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Under the majority\u2019s relaxed standard articulated today, whenever in the future a party claims that a theory is \u201cgroundless in the extreme,\u201d it appears that party will be entitled to a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing. This effectively removes from the trial court the discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>decide whether a hearing is needed, making it automatic. Criminal defendants questioning proffered testimony regarding the psychological effect their actions had on a child victim could receive a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing on the bald assertion that the testimony is unacceptable in the scientific community.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Defendant\u2019s written motion was vague. Attached to it was some of Dr. Gabriel\u2019s deposition testimony in which he stated that a compression injury occurred and that it resulted from the administration of excessive Pitocin. The court heard oral argument on the motion. In focusing on the expert testimony that it believed was inadmissible, defendant referred to Dr. Gabriel\u2019s testimony that plaintiff had experienced a traumatic head injury during childbirth. It asked for a hearing at which it might present an expert to testify that there is no scientific support for this theory. Defendant did not have an expert nor did it provide an affidavit signed by an expert indicating that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s theory is not recognized in the scientific community.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In denying the motion, the judge noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">The problem with your [defendant\u2019s] motion is you don\u2019t have any Affidavits. You don\u2019t have any evidence in there that \u2014 I mean, that there should be a Davis Frye Hearing. I mean, it\u2019s just you as an attorney saying that... [granting a hearing without any support for defendant\u2019s argument] would mean that everybody can come in here and allege that whatever everybody\u2019s expert is saying is not supported by scientific data, and I would have to hold a Davis Frye Hearing in every single case where any expert had to testify. And that\u2019s not the standard. You have to submit some evidence to me that I need a Davis Frye Hearing, other than you just saying it.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The judge indicated a willingness to revisit the motion should defendant provide support for its contention: \u201c[Y]ou can submit anything additional. I will take a look at it. But that\u2019s my ruling today.\u201d Defendant never renewed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The Michigan Rules of Evidence grant considerable deference to a trial judge in ruling on motions. With regard to preliminary questions, MRE 104(a) provides that questions regarding the qualification of a person to be a witness and the admissibility of evidence \u201cshall be determined by the court.... In making its determination, it is not bound by the Rules of Evidence except those with respect to privileges.\u201d Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertions and in accordance with this rule, the trial court was not bound by MRE 702, which governs the testimony of expert witnesses, when it ruled on defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>It is without question that, once a defendant shows that a genuine issue exists with regard to a theory\u2019s acceptance, the theory\u2019s proponent must prove its acceptance in the medical community. But before that, the party raising the issue must present more than a conclusory allegation that an issue exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Defendant failed to make the necessary showing in this case. It never provided support for counsel\u2019s proposition that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s traumatic injury theory lacked recognition in the scientific community. Even given the opportunity to provide support to the court, defendant was either unwilling or unable to do so. Hence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to hold a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">THE EVIDENCE OF CAUSATION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Defendants assert that plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence that his damages were caused by defendants\u2019 medical malpractice to allow the case to go to the jury. In presenting its evidence of a prima facie case, a plaintiff must show causation but need not use any particular formulation of words.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In this case, plaintiffs expert did not say \u201cAntonio Craig\u2019s cerebral palsy was caused by hypoxia resulting from defendants\u2019 breaches of the standard of care.\u201d Although desirable, such precision is simply not mandated. \u201c[T]he plaintiffs evidence is sufficient if it \u2018establishes a logical sequence of cause and effect, notwithstanding the existence of other plausible theories ....\u2019\u201d <em>Skinner v Square D Co, </em>445 Mich 153, 159-160; 516 NW2d 475 (1994), quoting <em>Mulholland v DEC Int\u2019l Corp, </em>432 Mich 395, 415; 443 NW2d 340 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The trial court ruled that plaintiff presented sufficient evidence. After the jury found for plaintiff, defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>dants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The motion was denied, and on appeal defendants challenge that ruling. They question the sufficiency of the evidence only with respect to the element of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The standard for reviewing a decision on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is deferential to the nonmoving party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">If reasonable jurors could disagree, neither the trial court nor this Court has the authority to substitute its judgment for that of the jury. <em>[Matras v Amoco Oil Co, </em>424 Mich 675, 682; 385 NW2d 586 (1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">Dr. Donn testified that Pitocin can cause both trauma and hypoxia. Dr. Gatewood testified that Pitocin can cause compression, and compression can cause head injury. Dr. Dombrowski testified that Pitocin can cause trauma and hypoxia. Dr. Gabriel testified that Antonio suffered a brain injury during labor and delivery, based on the character of the labor and delivery, based on the fetal monitoring, based on the positioning of the head, based on the MRI findings, it was caused by the use of Pitocin. He testified that there was compression of the head in the pelvic ridge. There was elevation of the venous pressure and loss of blood flow and the loss of oxygen and fusing the brain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Testimony was also presented that an excessive dose of Pitocin causes cerebral palsy in animals. The majority notes that animal experiments are the only authority that plaintiff offered showing a correlation between excessive amounts of Pitocin and cerebral palsy. The implication is that animal studies are insufficient evidence upon which to base medical expert testimony. That is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Dr. Gabriel\u2019s authority was sufficient for a jury reasonably to infer that the same effects occur in humans. Dr. Gabriel also testified that the animal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>studies were the types \u201cupon which the American Medical Establishment formulated their warnings on the use of oxytoxic drugs.\u201d These warnings appear in medical reference materials discussing the effects of Pitocin. Defendants did not refute these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Dr. Gabriel testified that he believed that excessive Pitocin caused plaintiffs condition. He testified that the drug affected plaintiff in two ways. It produced both a vascular effect and a traumatic effect. At trial, Dr. Gabriel used the terms \u201cpounding and grinding\u201d to explain the traumatic component of the injury. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">In part, what happened to Antonio I think is more complicated because I think there is a traumatic component as well as a vascular component. Those studies showed the vascular component, that is to say the reduced blood flow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">Antonio also suffered from the trauma of the head being pounded or grinded [sic] into the pelvic rim with successive uterine contractions which were of a high pressure and which resulted in marked decelerations. So I think it\u2019s a combination of vascular and trauma.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Dr. Gabriel testified that what happened to Antonio Craig would not have happened without the administration of Pitocin.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The majority focused attention on Dr. Gabriel\u2019s \u201cpounding and grinding\u201d theory as if it were the only theory that plaintiff presented. It was not. Dr. Gabriel testified that there were two different contributors to plaintiffs injuries. He claimed that plaintiff suffered from both a decreased blood flow and from a traumatic compression injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>In addition to Dr. Gabriel, Dr. Paul Gatewood testified for plaintiff regarding the standard of care. He stated that an excessive dosage of Pitocin was given to plaintiffs mother. In his expert opinion, this was a deviation from the standard of care. Dr. Gatewood also explained that the administration of excessive Pitocin was the proximate cause of Antonio\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">After Dr. Gatewood established a breach of duty, Dr. Gabriel testified that excessive Pitocin causes fetal brain damage and cerebral palsy in animals. In Dr. Gabriel\u2019s opinion, the excessive Pitocin caused the fetal brain damage that led to Antonio\u2019s cerebral palsy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In all, there was sufficient evidence to establish the element of causation. The jury was entitled to decide the case on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The failure to hold a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing was not an abuse of discretion under the facts of this case. Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>dant Oakwood had an obligation to provide support for the claim that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s traumatic injury theory was not accepted within the scientific community.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Moreover, plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to establish the element of causation. Both Dr. Gabriel and Dr. Gatewood testified effectively that an excessive dosage of Pitocin gave rise to the conditions that caused the baby\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Therefore, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals on all issues except that Henry Ford Hospital is liable under a theory of successor liability. In that regard, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Court of Appeals was incorrect. With that exception, the decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\"> <em>People v Davis, </em>343 Mich 348; 72 NW2d 269 (1955), and <em>Frye v United States, </em>54 App DC 46; 293 F 1013 (1923).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\"> As did the judge in this case, others have noted the difference between the burden of persuasion, which is on the proponent of the evidence, and the initial burden of production. \u201cBecause of judicial economy and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u2018liberal thrust\u2019 of the rules pertaining to experts, it seems reasonable to place the initial burden of production on the opponent for purposes of [a] hearing.\u201d <em>Gentry v Magnum, </em>195 W Va 512, 522; 466 SE2d 171 (1995). Appellate decisions in the area offer \u201clittle guidance on how trial courts should procedurally accomplish their gatekeeping responsibilities without frustrating\u201d the policy of liberal admissibility of expert evidence. <em>Alberts v Wickes Lumber Co, </em>1995 US Dist LEXIS 5893 (ND Ill, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Commentators have also addressed the problem. They have noted that allocating the initial burden of production to the opponent of the evidence \u201cfurthers the [] gatekeeping objective without hampering the \u2018liberal thrust\u2019 of the [rules of evidence].\u201d Accordingly, the opponent\u2019s burden is merely to go forward with evidence showing that the plaintiffs expert proof is inadmissible. \u201cPlaintiff bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the expert\u2019s opinion is admissible.\u201d Berger, <em>Procedural paradigms for applying the Daubert test, </em>78 Minn L Rev 1345, 1365-1366 (1994). See, also, Brown, <em>Procedural issues under Daubert, </em>36 Hous L Rev 1133, 1140-1141 (1999). While these decisions and articles deal with the newer <em>Daubert </em>test, the inquiry about who bears the burden of production is not affected. See <em>Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc, </em>509 US 579; 113 S Ct 2786; 125 L Ed 2d 469 (1993). The change occasioned by the adoption of the <em>Daubert </em>test relates only to what the proponent must show to prove admissibility once the determination is made that a hearing is warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b252-10\"> The majority maintains that \u201cDr. Gabriel did not testify that an excessive dosage of Pitocin <em>alone </em>... could have caused plaintiffs cerebral palsy.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 91 n 68 (emphasis in original). Yet, the majority begins its causation discussion by noting that \u201c[e]ven if plaintiff were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>able to show upon remand that Dr. Gabriel\u2019s testimony was properly admitted, defendants would nevertheless be entitled to JNOV.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 85. Thus, for purposes of its causation discussion, the majority assumes both theories were admissible. Were this not the case, the proper outcome should be a remand for a <em>Davis-Frye </em>hearing, not an appellate ruling that the defendants were entitled to jnov. The testimony of Dr. Gabriel indicates that excessive Pitocin causes reduced blood flow (\u201cthe vascular component\u201d). The studies showed a link between this vascular component and cerebral palsy. There was sufficient evidence of causation, regardless of the majority\u2019s reading of the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b253-12\"> When plaintiffs counsel asked whether these deviations \u201cwere the proximate causes of the reduced oxygen, reduced blood flow to the fet[us] here Antonio Craig,\u201d the doctor answered \u201c[Tjhese deviations are a result in the hypoxic episodes ... all of these factors contributed to the development and prolongation of the interim hypoxia that this baby\u2019s brain suffered.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b253-13\"> When asked whether Antonio\u2019s cerebral palsy was related to the administering of Pitocin, the doctor testified that \u201cwithout Pitocin this would not have happened.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
