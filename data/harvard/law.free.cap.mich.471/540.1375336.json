Regarding the first issue, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision that MCL 600.6304(1) did not permit the trier of fact to offset defendants\u2019 fault on the basis of plaintiffs alleged pre-treatment negligence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the basis of the clear and unambiguous language of \u00a7 6304(1), we hold that a trier of fact is permitted in \u201cpersonal injury, property damage, [and] wrongful death\u201d tort actions, which necessarily include medical malpractice actions, to consider a plaintiffs pretreatment negligence in offsetting a defendant\u2019s fault where reasonable minds could differ with regard to whether such negligence constituted \u201ca proximate cause\u201d \u2014 a foreseeable, natural, and probable cause \u2014 of the plaintiffs injury and damages. Further, on the basis of the evidence presented, we believe that reasonable minds could find that- plaintiff s pre-treatment negligence in this case \u2014 her failing to regularly take her prescribed blood pressure medication during the year preceding her fatal stroke \u2014 constituted a foreseeable, natural, and probable cause of her fatal stroke, and thus we remand this case to the trial court for proceedings consistent with the opinions of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Regarding the second issue, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision that the higher medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap of \u00a7 1483 applies to a wrongful death action. Consistent with our recent decision in <em>Jenkins v Patel, </em>471 Mich 158, 173; 684 NW2d 346 (2004), in which we held that the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap of MCL 600.1483 applies to a wrongful death action based on an underlying claim of medical malpractice, we affirm the decisions of both lower courts and hold that the higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap of \u00a7 1483 applies where the injured person, at any time before his death and as a result of a defendant\u2019s negligent conduct, fits within the ambit of MCL 600.1483(l)(a), (b), or (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Regarding the third issue, the Court of Appeals, finding that MCL 600.6311 applies in this case because both the personal representative and the decedent were or would have been sixty years of age or older at the time of judgment, affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision that plaintiffs award of future damages should not be reduced to present value. Because the term \u201cplaintiff,\u201d as used in \u00a7 6311, refers, for purposes of a wrongful death action, to the decedent, and because Mrs. Shin-holster, the decedent, was sixty-one at her death and at the time of judgment, we agree with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 6311, and hold that, on remand, the trial court cannot reduce any future damages awarded to plaintiff to their present value.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In this medical malpractice action, Betty Shinholster (Shinholster), the decedent, made four visits to defendant Annapolis Hospital in April 1995, complaining of dizziness. Defendant Dr. Dennis Adams (Adams)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> examined plaintiff on April 7 and April 10, and defendant Dr. Mary Ellen Flaherty (Flaherty) examined Shinholster on April 14. Shinholster\u2019s fourth visit on April 16 was precipitated by a massive stroke, after which she entered a coma for several months and died at the age of sixty-one. On behalf of his deceased wife, Johnnie Shinholster filed suit against Adams, Flaherty, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Annapolis Hospital, alleging that they had negligently treated his wife on April 10 and April 14 by failing to recognize that she had been experiencing transient ischemic attacks, or \u201cmini-strokes\u201d that often precede a full-blown, serious stroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The jury found in plaintiffs favor and awarded the following damages: (1) $220,000 for past economic damages; (2) $564,600 for past noneconomic damages; (3) $9,700 each year in future economic damages for the years 1999 through 2003; and (4) $62,500 each year in future noneconomic damages for the years 1999 through 2003. The jury further concluded that Shinholster had been twenty percent comparatively negligent in her actions after April 7, 1995, by not regularly taking her prescribed blood pressure medication. Consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court entered judgment for plaintiff in the amount of $916,480, \u201csubject to any applicable statutory limitation, statutory cap, adjustment regarding the computation of comparative negligence or adjustment pursuant to the collateral source rule.\u201d The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration. The Court of Appeals affirmed but remanded for the recalculation of damages. <em>Shinholster v Annapolis Hosp, </em>255 Mich App 339, 360; 660 NW2d 361 (2003). Defendants now appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Statutory interpretation is an issue of law that is reviewed de novo. <em>People v Morey, </em>461 Mich 325, 329; 603 NW2d 250 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">This Court\u2019s primary task in construing a statute is to discern and give effect to the intent of the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ture. <em>Murphy v Michigan Bell Tel Co, </em>447 Mich 93, 98; 523 NW2d 310 (1994). \u201cThe words of a statute provide \u2018the most reliable evidence of [the Legislature\u2019s] intent ....\u2019\u201d <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999), quoting <em>United States v Turkette, </em>452 US 576, 593; 101 S Ct 2524; 69 L Ed 2d 246 (1981). In discerning legislative intent, a court must \u201cgive effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute .. ..\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas Co v Old Republic Ins Co, </em>466 Mich 142, 146; 644 NW2d 715 (2002). The Court must consider \u201cboth the plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as \u2018its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sun Valley, supra </em>at 237, quoting <em>Bailey v United States, </em>516 US 137, 145; 116 S Ct 501; 133 L Ed 2d 472 (1995). \u201cThe statutory language must be read and understood in its grammatical context, unless it is clear that something different was intended.\u201d <em>Sun Valley, supra </em>at 237. \u201cIf the language of a statute is unambiguous, the Legislature must have intended the meaning clearly expressed, and the statute must be enforced as written.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">A. PLAINTIFF\u2019S PRE-TREATMENT NEGLIGENCE</p>\n<p id=\"AZq\">1. MCL 600.6304</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">MCL 600.6304 generally provides that the trier of fact in a tort action shall determine by percent the comparative negligence of all those who are a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury and subsequent damages. In relevant part \u00a7 6304 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">(1) In an action based on tort. .. seeking damages for personal injury... or wrongful death involving fault of more than 1 person,... the court... shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories or, if there is no jury, shall make findings indicating both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>(a) The total amount of each plaintiffs damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">(b) The percentage of the total fault of all persons that contributed to the death or injury, including each plaintiff....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">(2) In determining the percentages of fault under subsection (l)(b), the trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the conduct of each person at fault and the extent of the causal relation between the conduct and the damages claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">(6) If an action includes a medical malpractice claim against a person or entity described in section 5838a(l), 1 of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">(a) If the plaintiff is determined to be without fault under subsections (1) and (2), the liability of each defendant is joint and several....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-10\">(b) If the plaintiff is determined to have fault under subsections (1) and (2)... the court shall determine whether all or part of a party\u2019s share of the obligation is uncollectible from that party, and shall reallocate any uncollectible amount among the other parties ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">(8) As used in this section, \u201cfault\u201d includes an act, an omission, conduct, including intentional conduct, a breach of warranty, or a breach of a legal duty, or any conduct that could give rise to the imposition of strict liability, that is a proximate cause of damage sustained by a party.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>On the basis of this statute, defendants contend that the trial court erred in not allowing the jury to consider Shinholster\u2019s behavior as manifesting comparative negligence when she failed to regularly take her prescribed blood pressure medication for at least a year before her first visit to the emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">While the Court of Appeals acknowledged that \u00a7 6304, on its face, requires a trier of fact to consider such negligence, it nonetheless relied on inferences drawn from this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Podvin v Eickhorst, </em>373 Mich 175; 128 NW2d 523 (1964), and authority from other states to reach its holding that the statute did not control the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The Court of Appeals erred, in our judgment. Subsection 6304(l)(b) is unambiguous and calls for the trier of fact to assess by percentage \u201cthe total fault of <em>all </em>persons that contributed to the death or injury, <em>including each </em>plaintiff,\u201d (emphasis added), as long as that fault constituted a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury and subsequent damage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">With regard to what cause constitutes proximate cause,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in <em>Parks v Starks, </em>342 Mich 443, 448; 70 NW2d 805 (1955), we quoted with approval the following from 38 Am Jur, Negligence, \u00a7 55, p 703:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">\u201cThe proximate cause of an injury is not necessarily the immediate cause; not necessarily the cause nearest in time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>distance, or space. Assuming that there is a direct, natural, and continuous sequence between an act and an injury, * * * the act can be accepted as the proximate cause of the injury without reference to its separation from the injury in point of time or distance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Thus, under \u00a7 6304, if a defendant presents evidence that would allow a reasonable person to conclude that a plaintiffs negligence constituted a proximate cause of her injury and subsequent damage,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the trier of fact must be allowed to consider such evidence in apportioning fault.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">With regard to the Court of Appeals and Justice CAVANAGH and Justice WEAVER\u2019S reliance, in their concurrence/dissents, on out-of-state authority reaching a different conclusion than our Legislature did on this issue, we presume that the legislators were aware of those approaches and chose to depart from them in establishing Michigan law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Moreover, the Court of Appeals reliance on inferences drawn from <em>Podvin </em>(the plaintiffs negligence in causing a car accident could not be cited as contributory negligence for subsequent medical malpractice in treating car accident injuries) is misplaced. This case is not relevant because it was decided at a time when any contributory negligence barred a plaintiffs lawsuit. If it was ever relevant, it stopped being so when this Court adopted pure comparative negligence. <em>Placek v Sterling Hts, </em>405 Mich 638, 701; 275 NW2d 511 (1979). Moreover, to the extent that the inferences drawn from <em>Podvin </em>are inconsistent with MCL 600.6304, the statute must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The Court of Appeals also erred by mischaracterizing Shinholster\u2019s conduct as merely creating the <em>condition </em>that led her to seek treatment. Decedent\u2019s conduct may have done more than that. Her failure to properly take her medications may in fact have constituted a proximate cause of her death.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>2. LIMITED REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Because the trial court ruled that not all decedent\u2019s pre-treatment negligence could be considered, defendants were limited to submitting evidence that decedent was comparatively negligent only from April 7 onward, when she first visited the emergency room. Yet, it is apparent from that testimony that, had a wider scope of questioning been allowed, just as defendants\u2019 expert testimony supported the proposition that failure for ten days (April 7 through April 16) to regularly take her medications constituted a proximate cause,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>well have supported the same conclusion for a greater period. Accordingly, the trial court clearly erred in precluding evidence made admissible by \u00a7 6304, and this prevented defendants from receiving a fair trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>with regard to the apportionment of damages. MCR 2.611(A)(1)(a). Because the jury in this case has already determined that defendants breached their standard of care, a determination that I note defendants have never appealed,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>1 would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case for calculation of damages only, ordering that the jury be permitted to consider Shinholster\u2019s pre-treatment negligence in apportioning fault concerning plaintiffs damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">While I do not dispute the correctness of the Chief Justice\u2019s analysis in her concurrence/dissent concerning the prima facie elements of a tort cause of action, <em>post </em>at 586-587, I nonetheless believe that such analysis must be placed within the proper context. In a tort action, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving his prima facie case by demonstrating, as the Chief Justice has noted: (1) duty, (2) breach, (3) proximate causation, and (4) damages. If in this case, plaintiff had been permitted to present evidence demonstrating defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>dant\u2019s breach \u2014 which evidence was later held to be inadmissible \u2014 a remand for an entirely new trial might well be required, because such evidence would, in fact, implicate whether defendant had breached a duty, and, therefore, whether plaintiff had satisfied the prima facie elements of a tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">In the instant case, as in all tort actions, plaintiff bore the burden of proving her prima facie case, irrespective of her own negligent conduct. It was only after the jury determined that plaintiff had satisfied this burden, and that defendants were liable, that the jury should have considered whether defendants satisfied <em>their </em>burden of demonstrating that, despite their own liability, they were not exclusively liable because plaintiff herself was also negligent. Because the challenged evidence in this case has nothing to do with defendants\u2019 conduct, and thus nothing to do with whether plaintiff has satisfied her prima facie tort case, I believe that the Chief Justice\u2019s assertion that \u201c[l]imiting the new trial to damages only ignores the important fact that proximate cause is essential to a plaintiffs prima facie case,\u201d is incorrect. <em>Post </em>at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">It is important to remember that the conduct of plaintiff, not that of defendants, is at issue here, and that the issue is whether defendants satisfied their burden of demonstrating that, although liable, they are not exclusively liable for plaintiffs injury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That is, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>are not considering whether plaintiff satisfied her initial burden of proof relating to whether defendants were a proximate cause of her injury and, thus, are hable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Certainly, defendants could have argued that, had the jury been permitted to consider plaintiffs pre-treatment negligence, it would not have found that defendants had breached their standard of care at all or that defendants\u2019 breach constituted a proximate cause of plaintiffs injury. However, defendants did not make such an argument. Instead, they argued only that evidence of plaintiffs own negligence should be considered by the jury in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>determine the <em>extent </em>to which defendants were liable for plaintiffs injury. (Defendants alleged: \u201cHad the jury been properly instructed [concerning plaintiffs pretreatment negligence], it is likely that the percentage of her comparative fault would have been determined at a much higher level.\u201d)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">B. CAP ON NONECONOMIC DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">For the reasons stated in Jenkins, <em>supra </em>at 166-173, we hold that the noneconomic damages cap found in MCL 600.1483 applies to a wrongful death action based on an underlying claim of medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>MCL 600.1483 contains two caps on noneconomic damages and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\">(1) In an action for damages alleging medical malpractice by or against a person or party, the total amount of damages for noneconomic loss recoverable by all plaintiffs, resulting from the negligence of all defendants, shall not exceed $280,000.00 unless, as the result of the negligence of 1 or more of the defendants, 1 or more of the following exceptions apply as determined by the court pursuant to section 6304, in which case damages for noneconomic loss shall not exceed $500,000.00:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">(a) The plaintiff is hemiplegic, paraplegic, or quadriplegic resulting in a total permanent functional loss of 1 or more limbs caused by 1 or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">(i) Injury to the brain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">(ii) Injury to the spinal cord.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">(b) The plaintiff has permanently impaired cognitive capacity rendering him or her incapable of making independent, responsible life decisions and permanently incapable of independently performing the activities of normal, daily living.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">(c) There has been permanent loss of or damage to a reproductive organ resulting in the inability to procreate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">While defendants have not contested that, as a result of her stroke, Shinholster satisfied \u00a7 1483(l)(a) and (b), they and the Chief Justice contend that the higher damages cap applies only if the injured person continues to suffer one of the enumerated conditions set forth in \u00a7 1483 <em>at the time of judgment. Post </em>at 592-593. Because Mrs. Shinholster was dead at the time of judgment, defendants and the Chief Justice reason that the higher cap cannot apply. In support of their position, they rely upon the fact that the statute specifically uses the present tense of verbs, i.e., \u201cis\u201d and \u201chas,\u201d and that the statute provides that the lower tier is to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>unless, as the result of the negligence of 1 or more of the defendants, \u201c 1 or more of the following exceptions apply <em>as determined by the court pursuant to section 6304 ... Post </em>at 593 (emphasis added). Because a trial court reduces damages pursuant to \u00a7 6304 only after the jury has rendered its verdict, defendants and the Chief Justice conclude that the present tense verbs in the statute refer to that precise moment in time at which \u201cthe trial court makes its post-verdict determination concerning whether the cap requires adjustment of the verdict.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 592-593.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> While the trial court noted that the Legislature used the present tense words \u201cis . . . hemiplegic,\u201d it also observed that the Legislature did not specify at which time plaintiff must have sustained that condition for the higher cap to apply. The trial court disagreed with defendants\u2019 construction of the statute and ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\">[T]he only sensible way to interpret the statute is to hold that the Legislature intended [the higher cap] to apply to people who had been rendered cognitively incapable, quadriplegic, etc., from the accident in question. Betty Shinholster met this condition here: as the jury found, she suffered the requisite injuries from the accident \u2014 she endured these injuries in the several months she lay in a coma before she died. We thus hold that the higher, $500,000 cap applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>We construe the statute in accordance with the trial court\u2019s ruling. Indeed, the adoption of defendants\u2019 position would lead to absurd and unfair results. For example, a person who endured months of paraplegia caused by medical malpractice but died of an unrelated and independent cause before the court\u2019s verdict adjustments would be subject to the lower cap, whereas a similar person who died a day after the court\u2019s verdict adjustments would be subject to the higher cap. We view the better approach to be that advocated by plaintiff and adopted by the trial court. Under this approach, the point of reference for determining whether the injured person fits within MCL 600.1483(l)(a), (b), or (c) is anytime after and as a result of the negligent action. Therefore, because Shinholster was rendered incapacitated by defendants\u2019 negligence, the higher cap applies. <em>[Shinholster, supra </em>at 354.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We agree with the results reached by the lower courts and hold that \u00a7 1483 permits a plaintiff to recover a maximum of $500,000 in medical malpractice noneconomic damages if, as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct, the plaintiff at some point thereafter, and while still living, suffered one of the enumerated conditions of \u00a7 1483. We base this interpretation on several textual indicators contained in \u00a7 1483 and other pertinent statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">First, this interpretation of \u00a7 1483 is consistent with the text of the statute itself, which, as noted, provides that the lower tier applies \u201cunless, <em>as the result of the negligence of 1 or more of the defendants, </em>1 or more of the following exceptions apply.. ..\u201d (Emphasis added.) As long as, at some point after the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence occurred and before the decedent\u2019s death, it could be said that, \u201cas the result of the negligence of 1 or more of the defendants .. . [t]he plaintiff is hemiplegic\u201d or the plaintiff \u201chas permanently impaired cognitive capacity\u201d or \u201c[t]here has been permanent loss of or damage to a reproductive organ,\u201d the higher damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>cap tier applies.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Not only is this understanding of \u00a7 1483, and specifically its use of the present tense of verbs, consistent with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Michalski v Bar-Levav, </em>463 Mich 723, 732-733; 625 NW2d 754 (2001) (construing provisions of the Handicappers Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.1101, which are also written in the present tense, yet holding that the \u201cpresent\u201d tense refers to events existing during the pendency of the plaintiffs employment, when her cause of action arose), but it also avoids the arguably incongruous results about which the trial court and Court of Appeals were concerned.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Second, we believe that the text of the wrongful death act, MCL 600.2922(1), (2), and (6), provides additional support for our understanding of \u00a7 1483. These provisions state that \u201cthe personal representative of the estate of the deceased person\u201d be able to \u201cmaintain an action and recover damages [against] the person who or the corporation that would have been liable, if death had not ensued . . ..\u201d Subsection 2922(6) expressly permits the deceased\u2019s estate to recover \u201creasonable compensation for the pain and suffering, while conscious, undergone by the deceased person during the period intervening between the time of the injury and death . . . .\u201d Accordingly, while we agree with the Chief Justice that the Legislature is free to make \u201ca policy decision that the survivors of dead medical malpractice victims are entitled to lesser damages than are living medical malpractice victims who are suffering from one of the three types of permanent conditions enumerated in [\u00a7 1483],\u201d <em>post </em>at 592, we see no indication in the statute that the Legislature, in fact, <em>made </em>such a decision; rather, we believe that the Legislature made a quite contrary policy decision in \u00a7 2922(1), (2), and (6) by permitting a decedent\u2019s estate to recover <em>everything </em>that the decedent would have been able to recover had she lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Third, we believe that the interplay between the wrongful death act, particularly \u00a7 2922(6), and \u00a7 1483 provides additional textual support for our understand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ing of \u00a7 1483. Subsection 2922(6) states that in a wrongful death action \u201cthe court or jury may award .. . <em>reasonable compensation </em>for the pain and suffering, while conscious, undergone by the <em>deceased </em>person during the period intervening between the time of the injury and death .. . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 1483 provides that pain and suffering resulting from certain enumerated injuries are compensable at a higher rate. Thus, the Legislature has apparently determined that \u201creasonable compensation\u201d for such pain and suffering may sometimes be in excess of $280,000. However, by concluding that, no matter what type of injuries resulted in a decedent\u2019s death, survivors in a wrongful death action may <em>never </em>recover under \u00a7 1483\u2019s higher cap if the decedent is dead at the time of judgment, defendants and the Chief Justice effectively preclude the awarding of \u201creasonable compensation\u201d under \u00a7 2922(6) for the conscious pain and suffering undergone by at least some decedents before their death, where such pain and suffering resulted from one of the enumerated injuries in \u00a7 1483. That is, we believe that defendants and the Chief Justice overlook the express directive of \u00a7 2922(6) that the jury may award \u201creasonable compensation\u201d for a decedent\u2019s conscious pain and suffering \u2014 compensation which, in the Legislature\u2019s estimation, may sometimes be in excess of $280,000 if conscious pain and suffering results from an injury enumerated in \u00a7 1483.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Finally, in asserting that the higher damages cap of \u00a7 1483 applies only where the plaintiff is suffering one of the conditions enumerated in the statute <em>at the time of judgment, </em>we believe that defendants and the Chief Justice give extraordinary and undue weight to the fact that the Legislature has used the present tense of the verbs in \u00a7 1483(1) (a) and (b). Particularly, in concluding that \u201cthe structure of \u00a7 1483(1) indicates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Legislature intended that an exception, if it is applicable, apply at the time [of judgment],\u201d <em>post </em>at 592, we note that the Chief Justice fails to ensure that her own interpretation of \u00a7 1483 is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s use of the verb tense \u201chas been\u201d in \u00a7 1483(l)(c). This use of the <em>past </em>tense of the verb indicates an intention by the Legislature that an injured party need not always be alive at the time of judgment for the higher cap to apply, but rather only have suffered, at some point in the past as the result of a defendant\u2019s negligent conduct, the type of injury enumerated in \u00a7 1483(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Further, we note that, had the Legislature truly intended that an injured party must continue to suffer the higher tier injury at the time of judgment, it knew how to make that intent specific, as shown by MCL 600.6311, <em>infra, </em>in which the Legislature states that this provision is to apply if \u201ca plaintiff... is 60 years of age or older <em>at the time of judgment\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Unlike \u00a7 6311, \u00a7 1483 does not provide such a clear temporal framework. Moreover, had the Legislature intended that the term \u201cis,\u201d as used in \u00a7 6311, mean what defendants and the Chief Justice assert it means in \u00a7 1483 (i.e., at the time of judgment), we see no indication in \u00a7 6311 that the Legislature qualified the term within the temporal framework of \u201cat the time of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Defendants and the Chief Justice fail to explain why the use of the present tense of verbs in \u00a7 1483(l)(a) and (b) demonstrates that the Legislature intended that a plaintiff suffer from one of the enumerated conditions at the time of judgment, rather than at the time the action is filed, the jury is selected, opening statements are made, the first witness takes the stand, closing statements are made, at the beginning of jury delibera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>tions, or at the time at which the jury renders its verdict.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Defendants and the Chief Justice assert that the Legislature showed an intent to set the temporal framework at the time of judgment by stating that the higher tier exception applies <em>\u201cas determined by the court pursuant to section 6304 </em>. . . .\u201d However, in our judgment, references in \u00a7 1483 to \u00a7 6304 serve merely to clarify under which statute the court is authorized and required to reduce the damages award consistent with \u00a7 1483. We do not read into this reference a legislative intent to bar a plaintiff, whose decedent has suffered while still alive and has suffered \u201cas the result of the negligence of 1 or more of the defendants, 1 or more of the following [injuries],\u201d from recovering pursuant to the higher tier merely because the plaintiffs decedent was unfortunate enough to die before the post-verdict damages determination. Rather, on the basis of the statutory language previously discussed, we believe that the better interpretation of the statute is that, as long as a plaintiff suffers, while still living and as a result of a defendant\u2019s negligent conduct, one of the enumerated conditions set forth in \u00a7 1483, the statute\u2019s higher damages cap applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Because plaintiff in this case presented evidence from which it could be rationally concluded that, \u201cas the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>result of the negligence of 1 or more of the defendants,\u201d it could have been said at some time before her death that she \u201cis hemiplegic, paraplegic, or quadriplegic [as a result of] [i]njury to the brain,\u201d or \u201chas permanently impaired cognitive capacity,\u201d we agree with the determination made by the lower courts that the higher damages cap of \u00a7 1483 applies under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">C. MCL 600.6311</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">While MCL 600.6306(l)(c), (d), and (e) provide that all future damages awarded to a plaintiff be reduced to gross present value,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> MCL 600.6311 creates an exception to this general rule by stating, \u201cSections 6306(l)(c), (d), and (e)... do not apply to a plaintiff who is 60 years of age or older at the time of judgment.\u201d Thus, only when a plaintiff is younger than sixty years of age at the time of judgment, must the trial court reduce the plaintiffs future damages to present cash value.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Plaintiff asserts that, for purposes of \u00a7 6311, the term \u201cplaintiff\u201d in a wrongful death action is either the personal representative or the decedent, based on the age that the decedent would have been had she been alive at the time of judgment. On the other hand, defendants and the Chief Justice contend that \u00a7 6311 is a limited exception that does not apply to a wrongful death action because the \u201cplaintiff\u201d in such an action is the estate, which cannot have an age. <em>Post </em>at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The trial court held that, for purposes of \u00a7 6311, the term \u201cplaintiff\u201d refers to the decedent in a wrongful death case, and that because Shinholster was sixty-one at the time of her death, she necessarily would have been \u201c60 years of age or older at the time of judgment.\u201d Thus, \u00a7 6306(l)(c), (d), and (e) do not apply. Although the Court of Appeals found that \u00a7 6311 is \u201cambiguous with regard to the term \u2018plaintiff as applied to wrongful death cases,\u201d <em>Shinholster, supra </em>at 357, that Court declined to resolve the issue, holding that \u00a7 6311 applies because <em>both </em>the personal representative and the decedent were or would have been sixty years of age or older at the time of judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">MCL 600.6311 specifically refers to \u201ca <em>plaintiff </em>who is 60 years of age or older ...\u201d (emphasis added). Accordingly, we could potentially hold that because the plaintiff here\u2014 Shinholster\u2019s personal representative \u2014 was over sixty, the MCL 600.6311 exception applied. However, we note that MCL 600.6306 also uses the term \u201cplaintiff\u201d in referring to comparative negligence. See MCL 600.6306(3)(\u201cthe total judgment amount shall be reduced ... by an amount equal to the percentage of plaintiffs fault\u201d). Clearly, this reference to \u201cplaintiff\u201d is not a reference to a personal representative in a wrongful death case, because the personal representative would not be the one evaluated for comparative negligence; instead, the decedent would be so evalu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ated. We conclude that the statues at issue are essentially ambiguous with regard to the term \u201cplaintiff\u201d as applied to wrongful death cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">However, it is not necessary, in the instant case, to resolve the ambiguity in MCL 600.6311. Indeed, both the \u201cplaintiff\u201d (i.e., the personal representative and the person who brought the lawsuit) and the decedent in this case satisfied the MCL 600.6311 exception. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by refusing to reduce the amount of future damages to present value. <em>[Shinholster, supra </em>at 356-357.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>i.e., that \u201ca word or phrase is given meaning by its context or setting,\u201d affords us some assistance in interpreting \u00a7 6311. See <em>G C Timmis &amp; Co v Guardian Alarm Co, </em>468 Mich 416, 420; 662 NW2d 710 (2003). We apply this doctrine to include the other provisions of Chapter 63 of the Revised Judicature Act because the term \u201cplaintiff\u201d does not stand alone here, and cannot be read in a vacuum. Instead, \u201c[i]t exists and must be read in context with the entire act, and the words and phrases used there must be assigned such meanings as are in harmony with the whole of the statute . . . .\u201d <em>Arrowhead Dev Co v Livingston Co Rd Comm, </em>413 Mich 505, 516; 322 NW2d 702 (1982). \u201cAlthough a phrase or a statement may mean one thing when read in isolation, it may mean something substantially different when read in context.\u201d <em>G C Timmis &amp; Co, supra </em>at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">MCL 600.6305(2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">In the event of death, the calculation of future damages shall be based on the losses during the period of time the plaintiff would have lived but for the injury upon which the claim is based.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Further, MCL 600.6306(3) provides, \u201cIf the plaintiff was assigned a percentage of fault. . . the total judgment amount shall be reduced ... by an amount equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>to the percentage of plaintiffs fault.\u201d As described by the Court of Appeals, these \u201creference^] to \u2018plaintiff [are] not.. . reference^] to a personal representative [or an estate] in a wrongful death case, because [neither] would... be the one evaluated for comparative negligence; instead, the decedent would be so evaluated.\u201d <em>Shinholster, supra </em>at 357.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We agree with the trial court and hold that, for purposes of \u00a7 6311, the term \u201cplaintiff\u201d refers to the decedent, Mrs. Shinholster.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">However, our inquiry into the application of \u00a7 6311 in the instant case does not stop there. Rather, \u00a7 6311 states that it applies if the plaintiff is \u201c60 years of age or older <em>at the time of judgment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Because the term \u201cplaintiff\u201d refers to the decedent in a wrongful death action, and because Shinholster was sixty-one at her death and at the time of judgment,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we agree with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 6311, and hold that, on remand, the trial court cannot reduce any future damages awarded to plaintiff to their present value.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Because \u00a7 6304(1) requires, without exception, that a trier of fact be permitted in all \u201cpersonal injury, property damage, [and] wrongful death\u201d tort actions to consider the conduct of all parties whose conduct has constituted a proximate cause of plaintiffs damages, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>and because, on the basis of the evidence presented by defendants, reasonable minds could find that plaintiffs pre-treatment negligence here constituted \u201ca proximate cause\u201d \u2014 a foreseeable, natural, and probable cause \u2014 of her fatal stroke, we remand this case to the trial court for proceedings consistent with the opinions of this Court. Further, based on our decision in <em>Jenkins, </em>where we held that the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap of \u00a7 1483 applies to a wrongful death action based on an underlying claim of medical malpractice, we affirm the decisions of both lower courts and hold that the higher cap of \u00a7 1483 applies when the injured person, at any time while still living and as a result of a defendant\u2019s negligent conduct, fits within the ambit of \u00a7 1483 (l)(a), (b), or (c). Finally, because the term \u201cplaintiff,\u201d as used in \u00a7 6311, refers, for purposes of a wrongful death action, to the decedent, and because Mrs. Shinholster, the decedent, was sixty-one at her death and at the time of judgment, we agree with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 6311, and hold that the trial court cannot reduce any future damages award to plaintiff to their present value.</p>\n<judges id=\"b718-5\">Corrigan, C.J., and Taylor and Young, JJ., joined in section 111(A) and with the determination in section III(B) that the medical malpractice cap of \u00a7 1483 applies to a wrongful death action based on an underlying claim of medical malpractice.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b718-6\">CAVANAGH and KELLY, JJ., joined in section III(C) and concurred in the result only with regard to section 111(B).</judges>\n<judges id=\"b718-7\">WEAVER, J., joined in sections III(B) and III(C).</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\"> 255 Mich App 339, 352-354; 660 NW2d 361 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b693-8\"> Because Adams died during the pendency of this case, his wife, Katherine Adams, was appointed as the personal representative of his estate and substituted as a party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b696-12\"> See, also, MCL 600.2959, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-13\">In an action based on tort or another legal theory seeking damages for personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death, the court shall reduce the damages by the percentage of comparative fault of the person upon whose injury or death the damages are based....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\"> Moreover, MCL 600.6304(6) expressly acknowledges that a plaintiff may be determined \u201cto have fault\u201d in \u201ca medical malpractice claim ....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b697-10\"> See, also, <em>Skinner v Square D Co, </em>445 Mich 153, 162-163; 516 NW2d 475 (1994), and M Civ JI 15.01 which provides the following definition of proximate cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-11\">When I use the words \u201cproximate cause\u201d I mean first, that the negligent conduct must have been a cause of plaintiffs injury, and second, that the plaintiffs injury must have been a natural and probable result of the negligent conduct.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\"> Because damage cannot arise on its own, but must flow from an injury, we disagree with Justice Cavanagh\u2019S assertion in his concurrence/dissent that the majority \u201csubverts the text of MCL 600.6304\u201d by focusing on \u201cplaintiffs injury\u201d rather than \u201cplaintiffs damage.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 598.

Here, neither at trial nor on appeal have defendants argued that plaintiffs pre-treatment negligence affected the proper standard of care defendants owed to plaintiff. Defendants have only sought to admit evidence of plaintiff\u2019s pre-treatment negligence in an effort to offset the extent of their liability. That is, while defendants acknowledge that they have breached the appropriate standard of care, and, thus, are liable to some extent for plaintiff\u2019s injuries because they were \u201ca\u201d proximate cause of such injuries, they also assert that plaintiff\u2019s pre-treatment negligence also was \u201ca\u201d proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries and, thus, have requested that such negligence be considered by the jury in determining which party is responsible for what percentage of proximate causation. Accordingly, given the particular facts and circumstances of this case, I would remand for damages only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\"> In response to Chief Justice CORRIGAN\u2019S assertion in her concurrence/dissent that \u201cdefendants have preserved the argument that a new trial on all issues is required because the proximate cause issue affects liability,\u201d <em>post </em>at 586 n 2, I note that in the quoted portion of defendants\u2019 brief, defendants only contend that, had plaintiffs pretreatment negligence been considered by the jury, it may have found that \u201csuch negligence was <em>a </em>proximate cause of the fatal stroke\u201d (emphasis added). That is, defendants never contend that they are not liable because, had plaintiffs pre-treatment negligence been considered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>jury, it would have determined that they were not a proximate cause of plaintiffs injury, but they contend only that, had the jury been able to consider such negligence, the extent of their own liability would have been reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Further, I find the citations of MCL 600.2959 and M Civ JI 11.01 unpersuasive in support of such position. <em>Post </em>at 588-589. Both the statute and the jury instruction expressly address comparative fault, which generally comes into play only during the damages phase of trial, <em>after </em>the jury has determined that a plaintiff has proven her prima facie tort case. While, as the Chief Justice correctly asserts, evidence may be presented throughout trial regarding a plaintiffs comparative fault, <em>post </em>at 589, such evidence generally does not affect whether a defendant was liable at all for a plaintiffs injury, but rather the <em>extent </em>of his liability. Where such evidence <em>is </em>sufficiently intertwined with liability, however, there is absolutely no barrier to the appellate court remanding for an entirely new trial. Because defendants themselves, unlike the concurrence/dissent, have never argued that, \u201chad the jury been permitted to consider plaintiffs pre-treatment negligence, it would not have found that defendants breached their standard of care or that defendants\u2019 breach was a proximate cause of plaintiffs injury,\u201d I continue to believe that a remand for damages only is warranted under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b704-9\"> A majority of this Court favors remanding this case to the trial court, but there is no majority in favor of any specific type of remand. Three justices favor remanding this case for an entirely new trial, one justice favors remanding this case for a determination of damages only, and three justices favor no form of remand at all. It is regrettable that no further guidance can he offered to the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\"> I am concerned that, if this Court were to accept Chief Justice Corrigan\u2019S assertion that this case he remanded for an entirely new trial, we would be required to remand for an entirely new trial in virtually all cases in which not <em>every </em>single aspect of a plaintiffs pre-treatment negligence was fully considered at trial. For instance, assume a case in which a defendant-doctor is found to be liable in a medical malpractice action in which he has breached the appropriate standard of care and has been determined to have been a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury and subsequent damages. The trial judge has allowed the defendant to present evidence regarding the plaintiffs own alleged negligence and the jury accordingly has found the plaintiff to be ten percent liable for the damages and the doctor to be ninety percent hable. However, the defendant wanted evidence admitted at trial of one additional, albeit slight, instance of the plaintiffs own negligence that the trial judge ruled inadmissible. The defendant believes that, had this evidence been admitted, the jury would have found the plaintiff to have been twelve percent hable rather than ten percent and, thus, the defendant to have been eighty-eight percent rather than ninety percent hable. If an appehate court finds that the trial judge erred in ruling the additional evidence of the plaintiffs neghgence inadmissible, should a remand for an entirely new trial be required? In my judgment, it makes considerable sense, and represents a far more prudent use of judicial resources to remand for a redetermination of damages only in such a case, which would allow the defendant to present the additional evidence and the jury to determine whether the plaintiffs percentage of liability should be increased, and the defendant\u2019s percentage of liability decreased, accordingly. Nothing, of course, would prohibit an appehate court from remanding for an entirely new trial in subsequent cases if the facts require.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\"> Thus, for example, assume that a jury renders a $500,000 verdict at 5 P.M. on a Monday in favor of an injured party who, at the time of such verdict, was alive and clearly satisfied one of the enumerated higher cap injuries of \u00a7 1483. However, later that evening, the injured party dies. The next morning at 9 A.M., the trial court, expecting to grant damages pursuant to the higher tier, prepares to enter his post-verdict determination as required by \u00a7 6304. He is informed, however, that the injured party has died the prior evening. In accordance with the Chief Justice\u2019s understanding, the judge would now be required to award the decedent\u2019s survivors damages pursuant to the lower tier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b709-4\"> In asserting that, because the \u201cdeath exception was eliminated when the statute was amended in 1993 to its current form,\u201d this shows \u201cthat the Legislature intended to exclude death from the exceptions giving rise to application of the higher cap,\u201d <em>post </em>at 592, we believe that the Chief Justice accords unmerited weight to the elimination of the \u201cdeath exception\u201d in interpreting the current version of \u00a7 1483. The 1986 version of \u00a7 1483 provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">(1) In an action for damages alleging medical malpractice against a person or party specified in section 5838a, damages for noneconomic loss which exceeds $225,000.00 shall not be awarded unless 1 or more of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">(a) There has been a death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Thus, under the former \u00a7 1483, which had a single-tiered system of noneconomic damages cap, if a death occurred, there was no cap on damages. However, the current \u00a7 1483 contains a too-tiered system of noneconomic damages cap, and no longer contains a \u201cdeath exception.\u201d By. eliminating the \u201cdeath exception,\u201d we believe the Legislature intended nothing more than that one of the statute\u2019s two caps apply to limit noneconomic damages in every medical malpractice action, including those filed under the wrongful death act. We are unclear about the rationale relied upon by the Chief Justice in assuming that, because the Legislature eliminated death as an outright exception to the application of any cap, that it must have intended that death always fall under the <em>lower </em>cap. We see no rationale for assuming such a conclusion from the Legislature\u2019s actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\"> We note that defendants\u2019 and the Chief Justice\u2019s positions, taken to their inevitable conclusions, might just as well require that, if the injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>party is deceased at the time of judgment, the higher cap tier would <em>always </em>apply. This is because: (1) a deceased person always \u201chas permanently impaired cognitive capacity rendering him or her incapable of making independent, responsible life decisions and permanently incapable of independently performing the activities of normal, daily living\u201d; and (2) if the injured person is deceased, \u201c[tjhere has [always] been permanent loss of or damage to a reproductive organ resulting in the inability to procreate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b713-5\"> Absent specific language in \u00a7 1483 stating otherwise, and in light of the textual evidence set forth in this section, we are simply not persuaded that, whether the higher tier applies is to be viewed as a function of wholly arbitrary facts and circumstances concerning the specific time at which final judgment is rendered, such as the nature and congestion of the trial court\u2019s docket, the existence of scheduling conflicts of the parties and their attorneys, or the sheer length of a trial. Nor can it reasonably be dispositive of whether the higher tier applies that a plaintiff has died shortly before or after the end of trial, or shortly before or after the post-verdict damages and cap determinations.

PREVIOUS JURISPRUDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Not only does the clear language of MCL 600.6304 support the majority interpretation, but I believe that this interpretation is consistent with this Court\u2019s previous jurisprudence concerning an original tortfeasor\u2019s liability in light of subsequent medical malpractice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the context of medical malpractice, it has long been held that negligent medical treatment of an injury is foreseeable and is ordinarily not a superseding cause that cuts off the causal contribution of the act that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>caused the injury. In <em>People v Townsend, </em>214 Mich 267; 183 NW 177 (1921), the defendant was driving drunk when he ran off the road and hit a tree, severely lacerating a passenger\u2019s legs. Although the passenger was immediately taken to the hospital, her lacerations became infected because of medical malpractice committed by the hospital\u2019s doctors, and she died twelve days later from blood poisoning. As a result of this death, the defendant was charged with and convicted of involuntary manslaughter. The defendant appealed his conviction, contending that his passenger\u2019s death was a natural and probable result, not of the defendant\u2019s drunk driving, but rather of the doctors\u2019 negligence. This Court disagreed and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">\u201cIf a wound or other injury cause a disease, such as gangrene, empyema, erysipelas, pneumonia, or the like, from which deceased dies, he who inflicted the wound or other injury is responsible for the death... . He who inflicted the injury is liable even though the medical or surgical treatment which was the direct cause of the death was erroneous or unskilful, or although the death was due to the negligence or failure by the deceased to procure treatment or take proper care of the wound.. .. This rule is sometimes stated with the qualification that the wound must have been mortal or dangerous; but it is usually held that defendant is liable, although the wound was not mortal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">. . . Defendant cannot exonerate himself from . .. liability by showing that under a different or more skilful treatment the doctor might have saved the life of the deceased and thereby have avoided the natural consequences flowing from the wounds. Defendant was not entitled to go to the jury upon the theory claimed unless the medical treatment was so grossly erroneous or unskilful as to have been the cause of the death, for it is no defense to show that other or different medical treatment might or would have prevented the natural consequences flowing from the wounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The treatment did not cause blood poisoning; the wounds did that, and the most that can be said about the treatment is that it did not prevent blood poisoning but might have done so had it been different. <em>[Id. </em>at 278-279 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Accordingly, under <em>Townsend, </em>the original tortfeasor may be liable for a doctor\u2019s subsequent negligence where such negligence merely failed to prevent a result that was a \u201cnatural consequence!] flowing from\u201d such tortfeasor\u2019s actions. See also <em>People v Bailey, </em>451 Mich 657, 679; 549 NW2d 325 (1996) (\u201cIn the medical treatment setting, evidence of grossly negligent treatment constitutes evidence of a sole, intervening cause of death. Anything less than that constitutes, at most, merely a contributory cause of death, in addition to the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Where evidence exists in a medical malpractice action that a doctor\u2019s negligence was not the sole proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury, the trier of fact must be permitted to consider other proximate causes for such injury, including the plaintiffs own pre-treatment negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>n. COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In holding that in a medical malpractice action, the trier of fact should not be permitted to consider a plaintiffs pre-treatment negligence in apportioning fault, the Court of Appeals failed to recognize that \u00a7 6304 is predicated upon a comparative negligence scheme that \u201creduces the amount of the plaintiffs recovery, allocating liability in proportion to fault,\u201d <em>Jennings v Southwood, </em>446 Mich 125, 131; 521 NW2d 230 (1994), rather than upon a contributory negligence scheme that \u201cact[s] as an absolute bar to plaintiffs who were only slightly at fault,\u201d <em>Klinke v Mitsubishi </em>Motors Corp, 458 Mich 582, 607; 581 NW2d 272 (1998) (Kelly, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">\u201cIt would be anomalous to posit, on the one hand, that a health provider is required to meet a uniform standard of care in its delivery of medical services to all patients, but permit, on the other hand, the conclusion that, where a breach of that duty is established, no liability may exist if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the patient\u2019s own preinjury conduct caused the illness or injury which necessitated the care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">[W]e conclude that the trial court did not err in ruling that the jury could not consider Shinholster\u2019s potential negligence in causing the condition for which she sought medical treatment in the first place. Given the preventable nature of many illnesses, to accept a contrary position would allow many health-care professionals to escape liability for negligently treating ill patients. <em>[Shinholster v Annapolis Hosp, </em>255 Mich App 339, 347-348; 660 NW2d 361 (2003), quoting <em>Harvey v Mid-Coast Hosp, </em>36 F Supp 2d 32, 38 (D Maine, 1999).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Stemming from its concern that \u201c \u2018no liability may exist if the patient\u2019s own preinjury conduct caused the illness or injury which necessitated the care,\u2019 \u201d or that if a trier of fact was permitted to consider a plaintiffs pretreatment negligence in apportioning fault, \u201cmany health-care professionals [would] escape liability for negligently treating ill patients,\u201d the Court of Appeals apparently believed that \u00a7 6304 set forth a contributory negligence scheme that barred a plaintiff from recovering for injuries resulting from a defendant\u2019s negligence if the plaintiff was even slightly at fault for such injuries. These beliefs are unfounded because, as previously mentioned, \u00a7 6304 sets forth a comparative negligence scheme. Nothing in \u00a7 6304 states or implies that it constitutes a contributory negligence scheme. By adopting a comparative negligence scheme in \u00a7 6304, the Legislature recognized, as this Court did in <em>Placek v Sterling Hts, </em>405 Mich 638, 660; 275 NW2d 511 (1979), that such doctrine \u201cmost nearly accomplishes the goal of a fair system of apportionment of damages ... [by] \u2018truly distributing] responsibility according to fault of the respective parties.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>that a doctor negligently undertook to treat an existing condition may be an important, and in many cases the overriding, factor in the trier of fact\u2019s apportionment of fault in determining damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no reason to believe that a reasonable trier of fact will not accord that circumstance as much weight and consideration as it deserves in the particular case. However, there may sometimes be additional factors that will also be relevant in the apportionment of fault in determining damages, including evidence that the plaintiffs own conduct was either negligent, grossly negligent, or even intentional.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">III. ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The majority opinion states that \u201cunder \u00a7 6304, if a defendant presents evidence that would allow a reasonable person to conclude that a plaintiffs negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>constituted a proximate cause of her injury and subsequent damages, the trier of fact must be allowed to consider such evidence when appointing fault.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 552. However, the majority opinion does not elaborate regarding what type of evidence may satisfy this standard. In my judgment, only where the defendant presents sufficient relevant evidence, which generally will be based on substantiated scientific or other documented, reliable, and verifiable findings, that a reasonable person could have foreseen that his injury and subsequent damages were the \u201cnatural and probable consequence\u201d of his own conduct, will \u00a7 6304 require that the trier of fact determine whether such conduct \u201ccontributed\u201d to the plaintiffs injury and subsequent damages, thereby offsetting to some degree the defendant\u2019s exclusive liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Further, section 6304 does not require a trier of fact to consider <em>when </em>the fault occurred, but merely <em>whether </em>the fault was \u201ca proximate cause of damage sustained by a party.\u201d That is, contrary to the beliefs of the trial court, Court of Appeals, and plaintiff, \u00a7 6304 does not apparently distinguish between a plaintiffs \u201cpretreatment\u201d and \u201cpost-treatment\u201d negligence by providing that only the latter may be considered in apportioning fault and determining damages. Rather, \u00a7 6304 specifically requires that a trier of fact be permitted to consider the negligence of \u201ceach plaintiff,\u201d be it pretreatment or post-treatment negligence, if such negligence was \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of the plaintiffs injury and subsequent damages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Concern has been expressed at argument that, if a plaintiffs pre-treatment conduct may be considered under \u00a7 6304, this will enable a negligent doctor to avoid, at least in part, liability for his malpractice. For example, assume that a plaintiff, whose doctor has negligently failed to diagnosis her impending heart attack, files a medical malpractice action against the doctor on the basis of such negligence. At trial, the defendant attempts to offset a portion of his fault by introducing evidence that the plaintiff herself was a proximate cause of her heart attack because she had eaten a bag of potato chips daily for the past twenty years. In my judgment, the plaintiffs injuries and subsequent damages in such a circumstance would be far \u201ctoo insignificantly related to\u201d and \u201ctoo remotely affected\u201d by such conduct, and thus wholly inadequate to establish \u201ca proximate cause\u201d relationship between the plaintiffs conduct and her injury and damages. See <em>Davis v Thornton, </em>384 Mich 138, 145; 180 NW2d 11 (1970). It is simply not a foreseeable, natural, or probable consequence that such conduct will result in a heart attack. The instant case is clearly (distinguishable because plaintiff here failed to regularly take medication that was prescribed by her doctor in order <em>precisely </em>to prevent the specific fatal injury that she suffered. That is, there is a far closer and more direct connection between plaintiffs negligent conduct and her injury, and thus I believe that such conduct may reasonably be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>considered by a trier of fact as \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of her injury and subsequent damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">In summary, in a medical malpractice action in determining whether the plaintiffs own negligence has been <em>\u201ca </em>proximate cause\u201d of her injury and damages, I believe that the trial court must ensure that the defendant has sustained its burden of proof in presenting relevant evidence, that such evidence is sustained by either scientific or other reliable and verifiable findings, and that such evidence demonstrates that the plaintiffs specific injury and damages were a genuinely foreseeable, natural, and probable consequence of her negligence. In cases such as this, in which a plaintiffs allegedly negligent conduct relates to a specific diagnosed condition, combined with a failure to comply with a doctor\u2019s prescribed regimen for that specific condition, I agree with the majority that a question of fact for the jury regarding whether plaintiffs own conduct constitutes a sufficiently \u201cproximate cause\u201d of her own injury has been presented. Because in most instances I do not believe that such matters bear a \u201cproximate cause\u201d relationship to injuries and damages suffered by a medical malpractice plaintiff, I do not view \u00a7 6304 as allowing defendants to speculate about, or to engage in generalized investigations concerning, a plaintiffs lifestyle, exercise habits, or diet.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Here, there was one indivisible injury, Shinholster\u2019s fatal stroke, allegedly caused by the separate, independent acts of Shinholster herself and defendants. Had the injury been caused by the separate, independent negligent acts of defendants and another tortfeasor, the liability of each would be determined by the fault attributable to each. See <em>Townsend, supra </em>at 279. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Under \u00a7 6304, the principle is the same where evidence exists that the negligence of Shinholster herself was a proximate cause of her fatal stroke and subsequent damages. Further, because the jury in this case has already determined that defendants breached their standard of care, a determination that I note defendants have not appealed, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case for calculation of damages only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\"> I believe that the distinctions plaintiff, the trial court, the Court of Appeals, and other courts have attempted to draw between \u201cpretreatment\u201d negligence and \u201cpost-treatment\u201d negligence are, not only without statutory basis, but also irrelevant. Why should a doctor who has treated the plaintiff in the past be held less at fault for his negligence than a doctor who has not treated the plaintiff in the past? Take, for example, the instant case, where Dr. Normita Vicencio, approximately one year before plaintiffs fatal stroke, prescribed to plaintiff medication to lower her blood pressure. Assuming that plaintiff had sought additional treatment from Dr. Vicencio, instead of defendants, and assuming further that Dr. Vicencio had acted in the same alleged negligent manner as defendants, plaintiffs alleged negligence would be considered \u201cpost-treatment\u201d negligence, and, thus, admissible under both the lower courts\u2019 and plaintiffs interpretation of \u00a7 6304. However, because defendants had not treated plaintiff in the past, plaintiffs alleged negligence would be considered \u201cpre-treatment\u201d negligence, and, thus, inadmissible under both the lower courts\u2019 and plaintiffs interpretation of \u00a7 6304. Accordingly, defendants would be held more at fault because the trier of fact would not be permitted to consider plaintiffs \u201cpre-treatment\u201d negligence in apportioning fault in relation to determining plaintiffs damages. Because I see no basis in treating defendants any differently than Dr. Vicencio, I cannot agree with the lower courts\u2019 and plaintiffs interpretation of \u00a7 6304. Plaintiffs alleged negligence should be considered regardless of whether defendants had treated plaintiff in the past.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-5\"> \u201cThe assumption of a duty to protect the decedent while in defendant\u2019s custody merely establishes a legal basis for holding defendant negligent. The mere existence of a duty does not automatically lead to the conclusion that the decedent\u2019s fault should not be considered\u201d when appointing fault. <em>Hickey v Zezulka (On Resubmission), </em>439 Mich 408, 448; 487 NW2d 106 (1992) (opinion by Riley, J., joined by three other justices).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\"> In permitting the trier of fact in a medical malpractice case to consider a plaintiffs negligence in apportioning fault and in determining the extent of a defendant\u2019s liability, the majority is not altering the law of this state regarding the application of comparative fault in a tort action.

MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>600.1483(1) provides that the lower cap applies <em>unless </em>one of the enumerated exceptions applies. Death is not an enumerated exception.

MCL 600.6311 provides that the reduction to present value does not apply to <em>\u201ca </em>plaintiff who is 60 years of age or older at the time of judgment.\u201d I believe that MCL 600.6311 cannot apply in wrongful death cases because, in such cases, the true \u201cplaintiff\u201d is the estate, which is not a person and does not have an \u201cage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">I. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">A. A NEW TRIAL ON ALL ISSUES IS REQUIRED</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Although I agree with the majority that decedent\u2019s pretreatment negligence is a matter properly submitted to the jury, I do not agree that the new trial should be limited to damages only. Because of the trial court\u2019s ruling that all decedent\u2019s pretreatment negligence could not be considered, defendants were limited to submitting evidence that decedent was comparatively negligent from April 7 onward, when she first visited the emergency room. Yet, it is apparent from that testimony that had a wider scope of questioning been allowed, just as defendants\u2019 expert testimony supported the proposition that her failure for ten days (April 7 through April 16) to take her medications was a proximate cause,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it surely would have supported the same conclusion for a greater period \u2014 the previous year. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Accordingly, the trial court clearly erred in precluding evidence made admissible by MCL 600.6304 and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>prevented defendants from receiving a fair trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MCR 2.611(A)(1)(a). New trials limited only to damage issues are disfavored. See <em>Burns v Detroit, </em>468 Mich 881; 658 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>NW2d 468 (2003); <em>Garrigan v LaSalle Coca-Cola Bottling Co, </em>373 Mich 485, 489; 129 NW2d 897 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">More importantly, the jury must make a determination of <em>liability </em>(including comparative fault), taking into account the improperly excluded evidence; thus, a new trial limited to damages only would not be appropriate. Whether defendants contested the jury\u2019s finding that the standard of care was breached is irrelevant. In order to establish a prima facie case, plaintiff must prove: (1) a breach of the standard of medical care; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>injury; (3) proximate cause \u2014 a definitive legally recognized linkage between the breach and the injury; and (4) damages. <em>Cox v Flint Bd of Hosp Managers, </em>467 Mich 1, 10; 651 NW2d 356 (2002). Simply proving that there was a breach of the standard of care, without more, does not prove liability. A breach of the standard of care is only relevant if the trier of fact determines that that breach is a <em>proximate cause </em>of the plaintiffs injury. It is entirely possible for a defendant to admit negligence and still argue there is no liability because the negligence was not the proximate cause of the injury. Here, defendants were precluded from offering evidence that any breach of the standard of care was not the proximate cause of the decedent\u2019s injury, given her pretreatment negligence. Had the evidence been presented, the jury could reasonably have concluded that even if defendants had breached the standard of care, they still were not liable because any breach was not a proximate cause of the decedent\u2019s injuries. Therefore, a new trial on all issues, including liability, is necessary. Limiting the new trial to damages only ignores the important fact that proximate cause is essential to a plaintiffs prima facie case, and improperly conflates two separate and necessary elements of liability: of a breach of a standard of care <em>and </em>a showing that that breach was a proximate cause of the injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>In fact, under our statutory scheme, the issues of liability and damages, as they relate to comparative negligence, are inextricably linked. MCL 600.2959 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">In an action <em>based on tort </em>or another legal theory seeking damages for personal injury, property damage, <em>or wrongful death, </em>the court shall reduce the damages by the percentage of comparative fault of the person upon whose injury or death the damages are based as provided in section 6306. <em>If that person\u2019s percentage of fault is greater than the aggregate fault of the other person or persons, </em>whether or not parties to the action, the court shall reduce economic damages by the percentage of comparative fault of the person upon whose injury or death the damages are based as provided in section 6306, <em>and noneconomic damages shall not be awarded. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In addition, M Civ JI 11.01, the standard jury instruction regarding comparative negligence, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">The total amount of damages that the plaintiff would otherwise be entitled to recover shall be reduced by the percentage of plaintiffs negligence that contributed as a proximate cause to <em>[his </em>/ <em>her] [injury /property damage].</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">This is known as comparative negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>(The plaintiff, however, is not entitled to noneconomic damages if <em>[he </em>/ <em>she] </em>is more than 50 percent at fault for <em>[his </em>/ her] injury.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">In other words, the standard jury instruction simply reduces MCL 600.2959 to its mathematical equivalent: in order for the plaintiff or the decedent\u2019s fault to be more than the aggregate sum of the fault of all other applicable persons, the jury must place the plaintiffs fault at more than fifty percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Thus, both MCL 600.2959 and M Civ JI 11.01 assume that the jury has properly heard all evidence regarding liability and reached a determination of fault before damages can be assessed. If, during the trial, the jury was improperly precluded from considering evidence regarding the decedent\u2019s comparative negligence, it follows that the jury\u2019s determination of liability is flawed. If this determination of liability is flawed, it is impossible to ascertain the correct amount of damages. Therefore, I do not believe that it is possible to separate the issues of liability and damages, and believe a new trial on all issues is required. I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">B. THE LOWER DAMAGES CAP APPLIES</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">For the reasons stated in <em>Jenkins v Patel, </em>471 Mich 158; 684 NW2d 346 (2004), I agree with the majority that the noneconomic damages cap found in MCL 600.1483 applies to wrongful death actions alleging medical malpractice. I cannot agree, however, that the higher tier of the damages cap applies to such cases. Instead, I would hold that the lower tier applies to wrongful death actions alleging medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">MCL 600.1483(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>In an action for damages alleging medical malpractice by or against a person or party, the total amount of damages for noneconomic loss recoverable by all plaintiffs, resulting from the negligence of all defendants, shall not exceed $280,000.00 unless, as the result of the negligence of 1 or more of the defendants, 1 or more of the following exceptions <em>apply as determined by the court pursuant to section 6304, </em>in which case damages for noneconomic loss shall not exceed $500,000.00:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\">(a) The plaintiff <em>is </em>hemiplegic, paraplegic, or quadriplegic resulting in a total permanent functional loss of 1 or more limbs caused by 1 or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">(i) Injury to the brain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">(ii) Injury to the spinal cord.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">(b) The plaintiff <em>has </em>permanently impaired cognitive capacity rendering him or her incapable of making independent, responsible life decisions and permanently incapable of independently performing the activities of normal, daily living.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">(c) There <em>has been </em>permanent loss of or damage to a reproductive organ resulting in the inability to procreate. [Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>As an initial matter, MCL 600.1483(1) requires the <em>trial court </em>to determine whether one of the statutory exceptions, and thereby the higher cap, applies. Here, however, <em>the jury </em>was improperly instructed to return a special verdict that required answers to the following questions: \u201cDid [the decedent] suffer hemiplegia, paraplegia, or quadriplegia resulting in a total or permanent functional loss of one or more limbs caused by injury to the brain?\u201d and \u201cDid [the decedent] suffer permanently impaired cognitive capacity rendering her incapable of making independent, responsible life decisions and permanently incapable of independently performing the activities of normal, daily living?\u201d The jury answered \u201cyes\u201d to both questions, and the trial court determined that the higher, $500,000 cap was therefore applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">These questions should not have been submitted to the jury because the applicability of \u00a7 1483 is a question for the court. I would, therefore, take this opportunity to clarify that the question of the application of \u00a7 1483 is solely an issue for the trial court, not the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Further, I believe that the lower tier damages cap of \u00a7 1483 applies in wrongful death actions alleging malpractice. In any wrongful death action, the plaintiff is seeking to recover for the decedent\u2019s <em>death, </em>and death is not one of the statutory exceptions giving rise to the application of the higher cap. This Court does not have the authority to create an exception the Legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>not included in the statute. Had the Legislature wished to include negligence causing death as an exception, it could have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In fact, it <em>did </em>do so in the previous version of the statute, but this death exception was eliminated when the statute was amended in 1993 to its current form. 1993 PA 78, effective October 1,1993. The history of the current version of \u00a7 1483 indicates that the Legislature intended to exclude death from the exceptions giving rise to the application of the higher cap. Although death was one of the exceptions enumerated in the prior version of the statute, it is conspicuously absent from the present version of the statute. The Legislature apparently made a policy decision that the survivors of dead medical malpractice victims are entitled to lesser damages than are living medical malpractice victims who are suffering from one of the three types of permanent conditions enumerated in the statute. This choice makes sense because it is not the surviving, permanently, and severely injured patient who is recovering damages in a wrongful death action, but the patient\u2019s relatives or other survivors who have not suffered from these permanent conditions. Further, in enacting this aspect of tort reform legislation, the Legislature could well have chosen a policy that would help to limit the cost of malpractice insurance. Whether one agrees with such policy decisions, those decisions are solely within the Legislature\u2019s authority to make. This Court may not question the wisdom of the Legislature\u2019s policy choices; rather, this Court must enforce the statutory language as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Finally, the structure of \u00a7 1483(1) indicates that the Legislature intended that an exception, if it is applicable, apply <em>at the time </em>that the trial court makes its postverdict determination concerning whether the cap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>requires adjustment of the verdict. First, \u00a7 1483(1) imposes the $280,000 cap unless \u201c1 or more of the ... exceptions <em>apply </em>as determined by the court pursuant to section 6304....\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 6304(5), in turn, directs the trial court to \u201creduce an award of damages\u201d as required by the limitations set forth in \u00a7 1483(1). This language supports the conclusion that the exception must be applicable at the time the verdict is adjusted by the trial court. Second, the language of subsections 1(a) and (b) of the cap statute, \u00a7 1483, is in the present tense (\u201c[t]he plaintiff <em>is </em>hemiplegic\u201d; \u201c[t]he plaintiff <em>has </em>permanently impaired cognitive capacity\u201d), clearly requiring that the enumerated conditions <em>currently </em>exist. Here, at the time of the postverdict decision regarding the amount recoverable, the decedent would not have been described as someone who was paraplegic or someone who had a permanently impaired cognitive capacity; rather, the decedent would have only been described as deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">For the same reasons stated in <em>Jenkins, supra </em>at 171-173, applying the lower damages cap does not frustrate the purpose of MCL 600.2922(6), which provides that the court or jury in a wrongful death action \u201cmay <em>award . . </em>. reasonable compensation for the pain and suffering, while conscious, undergone by the deceased person during the period intervening between the time of the injury and death....\u201d (Emphasis added.) As we noted in <em>Jenkins, </em>applying the lower damages cap to limit the amount of actual <em>recovery </em>by the plaintiff does not in any way limit the amount of the jury\u2019s <em>award. </em>The jury or court may still award whatever amount it concludes is reasonable under MCL 600.2922(6); that amount, however, is subject to reduction under MCL 600.1483.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Therefore, because MCL 600.1483 does not include death as one of the enumerated exceptions to the lower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>damages cap, and because the statutory syntax suggests that the plaintiff must currently fall into one of the enumerated exceptions at the time of the postverdict recovery determination, I believe that the lower tier damages cap applies in wrongful death actions alleging medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">C. MCL 600.6311 DOES NOT APPLY TO WRONGFUL DEATH ACTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">MCL 600.6306 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">(1) After a verdict rendered by a trier of fact in favor of a plaintiff, an order of judgment shall be entered by the court. Subject to section 2959, the order of judgment shall be entered against each defendant, including a third-party defendant, in the following order and in the following judgment amounts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">(c) All future economic damages, less medical and other health care costs, and less collateral source payments determined to be collectible under section 6303(5) reduced to gross present cash value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-10\">(d) All future medical and other health care costs reduced to gross present cash value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-11\">(e) All future noneconomic damages reduced to gross present cash value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-12\">(2) As used in this section, \u201cgross present cash value\u201d means the total amount of future damages reduced to present value at a rate of 5% per year for each year in which those damages accrue, as found by the trier of fact as provided in section 6305(1)(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>MCL 600.6311, however, provides an exception to the requirement in MCL 600.6306 of a reduction to present value:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\">Sections 6306(l)(c), (d), and (e), 6307, and 6309 do not apply to a plaintiff who is 60 years of age or older at the time of judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Here, the trial court ruled that in wrongful death cases, the \u201cplaintiff\u201d referred to in \u00a7 6311 was the decedent. Because the decedent was over age sixty at the time of judgment, the trial court held that \u00a7 6311 applied. The Court of Appeals declined to determine whether \u00a7 6311 applied to the decedent or to the personal representative because both the decedent and the personal representative were over age sixty; therefore, the Court held that \u00a7 6311 applied in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">I believe that the exception does not apply in the case of a decedent: it applies only to a plaintiff who <em>\u201cis </em>60 years of age or older at the time of judgment.\u201d At the time of judgment in a wrongful death action, the decedent is dead. Moreover, the decedent is not generally recognized as the \u25a0 \u201cplaintiff\u201d in a wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">At common law, a cause of action did not survive death. As we noted in <em>Hawkins v Regional Med Laboratories, PC, </em>415 Mich 420, 428-429; 329 NW2d 729 (1982), \u201cunder common law, [causes of action] were terminated by the death either of the person injured or the tortfeasor. 1846 Rev Stats, ch 101, \u00a7 5.\u201d The Legislature subsequently changed the common-law rule through the wrongful death provisions, allowing causes of actions to survive death through the creation of a \u201cnew\u201d plaintiff, the estate. The estate is then represented by the personal representative: MCL 600.2922(2) provides that \u201c[e]very action under this section [the wrongful death provision] <em>shall be brought </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>by, and in the name of, the personal representative of the estate of the deceased person\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Indeed, the named plaintiff in the instant case is \u201cEstate of Betty Jean Shinholster,\u201d <em>\u201cby\u201d </em>the personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Section 2922(2) does not compel the conclusion that the \u201cplaintiff\u201d in a wrongful death action is the personal representative. Rather, \u00a7 2922(2) simply requires that the action be brought \u201cby\u201d and \u201cin the name of\u201d that representative. The true plaintiff remains the decedent\u2019s estate. Those who are entitled to share in the proceeds of a judgment obtained in the wrongful death action are enumerated in MCL 600.2922(3), and include relatives, a spouse\u2019s children, and devisees and beneficiaries. These persons can be relevant only because they all may be entitled to a portion of the decedent\u2019s <em>estate. </em>Unlike a living person, an estate does not have an \u201cage\u201d; therefore, \u00a7 6311 cannot apply to an estate. Because \u00a7 6311 does not apply to estates, it cannot be applied in wrongful death actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">I agree with the majority that the clear and unambiguous language of MCL 600.6304(1) and MCL 600.2959 requires that a jury is permitted in all medical malpractice actions to consider a plaintiffs pretreatment negligence as comparative negligence to offset a defendant\u2019s fault, provided evidence has been admitted that would allow a reasonable person to conclude such negligence was \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of the plaintiffs injury.

Defendants preserved the issue at trial by objecting to the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit evidence regarding the decedent\u2019s pretreatment negligence. Defendants also objected to the trial court\u2019s modified jury instruction regarding the decedent\u2019s comparative negligence, arguing that the jury should have been able to consider all of the decedent\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">On appeal, defendants again preserved the argument regarding liability and proximate cause. Issue I of defendants\u2019 brief argues that \u201cdefendants were denied a fair trial by the trial court\u2019s instruction on comparative negligence, which improperly restricted the jury\u2019s consideration and proper allocation of the decedent\u2019s comparative fault.\u201d Defendants argued that the trial court\u2019s limitation of evidence regarding the decedent\u2019s comparative negligence, and the resulting modified jury instruction, \u201cdenied [defendants\u2019] right to have their responsibility determined in accordance with the facts and the law, and for this, they must be granted a new trial.\u201d Finally, defendants argued that defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\u201cpresented expert testimony supporting their claim that [the decedent\u2019s] persistent failure or refusal to comply with [] clearly communicated medical advice was a proximate cause of [the decedent\u2019s] death. The trial court\u2019s instruction, however, prevented the Jury from considering this negligence on [the decedent\u2019s] part as a cause of her injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">On appeal to this Court, defendants also argued that a new trial was required because the trial court improperly limited evidence of comparative negligence, thus precluding the jury from considering all evidence regarding proximate cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">The jury should have been allowed to consider whether the injury was proximately caused by the separate, independent act of the plaintiffs decedent.... If the stroke was caused by the separate and independent negligent acts of these doctors or even another tortfeasor . . . , the liability of each would be determined by the fault attributed to each....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\">Based on the evidence that was presented, and further evidence that could have been presented, it can only he concluded that a jury could have found that the decedent was neghgent prior to April 7, 1995 and that such negligence was a cause of the fatal stroke. The trial court\u2019s limitation on the admission of evidence and its instructions to the jury were erroneous and inconsistent with substantial justice and not harmless error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">Thus, defendants have preserved the argument that a new trial on all issues is required because the proximate cause issue affects liability, as well as the argument that, in the alternative, their damages should be reduced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b733-4\"> In fact, this view is supported by the standard jury instruction regarding the burden of proof for malpractice cases.

With respect to the applicability of the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap, I concur only in the result because I remain committed to my position in <em>Jenkins v Patel, </em>471 Mich 158; 684 NW2d 346 (2004). And finally, I must respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision allowing the trier of fact to consider plaintiffs alleged pretreatment negligence. I agree with the trial court and the Court of Appeals, as well as the Restatement and a majority of other jurisdictions, that it would be improper for the jury to consider plaintiffs pretreatment negligence. Thus, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Today, a plurality of this Court makes a mockery of tort law by holding that a jury can consider a plaintiffs pretreatment negligence to determine liability. Justice MARKMAN\u2019s approach, allowing the jury to consider plaintiffs pretreatment negligence only when deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>mining damages, is also contrary to general tort principles. While Justice Markman claims that allowing the jury to consider a plaintiffs pretreatment negligence in a medical malpractice action is consistent with prior law, <em>ante </em>at 575 n 3, a close reading of this Court\u2019s precedent shows that it does not support Justice MARK-MAN\u2019s argument. Make no mistake, allowing a jury to consider a plaintiffs pretreatment negligence in a medical malpractice action is a sweeping new decision, with no basis in this Court\u2019s prior rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">It is an axiom of tort law that the defendant takes the plaintiff as he finds her. <em>Wilkinson v </em>Lee, 463 Mich 388, 396; 617 NW2d 305 (2000). Potentially eviscerating a defendant\u2019s liability or reducing a plaintiffs damages on the basis of a condition that a plaintiff brings to the table ignores this foundational principle of tort law. It also opens the door to scrutiny of a medical malpractice plaintiffs pretreatment health habits and lifestyle in nearly every medical malpractice action. \u201c[W]hatever the wisdom or folly of our lifestyles, society, through its laws, has not yet imposed a normative life-style on its members.\u201d <em>Ostrowski v Azzara, </em>111 NJ 429, 444; 545 A2d 148 (1988). Today\u2019s majority imposes a judicially created normative lifestyle on the citizens of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The majority also subverts the text of MCL 600.6304 when it holds that \u00a7 6304 requires the trier of fact to determine the comparative negligence of all who are a proximate cause of the plaintiffs <em>injury. </em>The statute actually states: \u201c \u2018fault\u2019 includes an act. . . that is a proximate cause of <em>damage </em>sustained by a party.\u201d MCL 600.6304(8) (emphasis added). While the majority focuses on plaintiffs injury, its attention would be more properly focused on the plaintiffs damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The plaintiffs damage in a medical malpractice action is determined by the difference between the dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>dent\u2019s hypothetical life without the negligence of the doctor and the actual result. In this case, the damage plaintiff claims is the difference between the life of a woman who suffered a mini-stroke that was properly treated and a dead woman. The majority potentially ehminates all doctors\u2019 liability for all negligent behavior by mischaracterizing the damage. It is absurd to assert that plaintiffs pretreatment behavior can be considered the proximate cause of the damage inflicted by the doctor\u2019s malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">\u201cAs a general rule, negligence by a patient that occurred before the malpractice and provided the occasion for the treatment that is the subject of the malpractice claim cannot give rise to a defense of comparative negligence.\u201d Moore &amp; Gaier, <em>A Plaintiff\u2019s Culpable Conduct, </em>NY Law J 3 (Mar 3, 1998). Comment m to Restatement Torts, 3d, Apportionment of Liability, \u00a7 7, provides that the jury in a medical malpractice action cannot consider the plaintiffs conduct that created the condition that the doctor was employed to remedy. So, in this case, the trial court was correct to prevent the jury from considering plaintiffs failure to regularly take her medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In addition to the Restatement, I am persuaded by the wealth of authority from other jurisdictions that have refused to allow juries to consider a plaintiffs pretreatment negligence in medical malpractice actions. For example, the Florida Court of Appeals, in <em>Matthews v Williford, </em>318 So 2d 480, 483 (1975), persuasively held that \u201cconduct of a patient which may have contributed to his illness or medical condition ... simply is not available as a defense to malpractice which causes a distinct subsequent injury.. ..\u201d See, also, <em>Mercer v Vanderbilt Univ, Inc, </em>134 SW3d 121, 129-130 (Tenn, 2004); <em>DeMoss v Hamilton, </em>644 NW2d 302, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>306-307 (Iowa, 2002); <em>Harding v Deiss, </em>300 Mont 312, 318; 3 P3d 1286 (2000); <em>Smith v Kennedy, </em>2000 US Dist LEXIS 9897, 11-12 (D Kan, 2000); <em>Harvey v Mid-Coast Hosp, </em>36 F Supp 2d 32, 37-38 (D Me, 1999); <em>Durphy v Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Mid-Atlantic States, Inc, </em>698 A2d 459, 465-467 (DC App, 1997); <em>Fritts v McKinne, </em>934 P2d 371, 374 (Okla Civ App, 1996); <em>Spence v Aspen Skiing Co, </em>820 F Supp 542, 544 (D Colo, 1993); <em>Van Vacter v Hierholzer, </em>865 SW2d 355, 359 (Mo App, 1993); <em>Martin v Reed, </em>200 Ga App 775, 777; 409 SE2d 874 (1991); <em>Jensen v Archbishop Bergan Mercy Hosp, </em>236 Neb 1, 15; 459 NW2d 178 (1990); <em>Cowan v Doering, </em>215 NJ Super 484, 495; 522 A2d 444 (1987); <em>Owens v Stokoe, </em>115 Ill 2d 177, 183; 503 NE2d 251 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Justice MARKMAN attempts to make a distinction between a distinct subsequent injury and an injury that would be part of the \u201cnatural and foreseeable result of the plaintiffs original negligence.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 554 n 9. This distinction, however, is a distinction without a difference when examining the proper damage in a medical malpractice action. Because a tortfeasor must take a plaintiff as he finds her, the plaintiff in Justice MARK-MAN\u2019s examples would be taken as a plaintiff with a broken leg. Without the negligence of the doctor, a plaintiff with a broken leg could expect full recovery. Regardless of whether the doctor\u2019s negligence results in death or in a poorly set leg, the damage in the case is the difference between the expected full recovery and the actual result. In neither example, can the plaintiffs negligence in breaking her leg be a proximate cause of the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Because the majority mischaracterizes the damage and allows the jury to consider plaintiffs pretreatment negligence, I must respectfully dissent. I refuse to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>part in the judicial determination of what is and is not socially acceptable behavior. Smokers, couch potatoes, and fast food connoisseurs pick your doctors carefully because after today, no matter how negligent a doctor is in treating you, the jury will be able to consider your poor health habits when deciding whether to hold the doctor liable.

Deciding proximate cause is a policy determination of the courts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">\u201cProximate cause\u201d \u2014 in itself an unfortunate term \u2014 is merely the limitation which the courts have placed upon the actor\u2019s responsibility for the consequences of the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tor\u2019s conduct. In a philosophical sense, the consequences of an act go forward to eternity, and the causes of an event go back to the dawn of human events, and beyond. But any attempt to impose responsibility upon such a basis would result in infinite liability for all wrongful acts, and would \u201cset society on edge and fill the courts with endless litigation. As a practical matter, legal responsibility must be limited to those causes which are so closely connected with the result and of such significance that the law is justified in imposing liability. Some boundary must be set to liability for the consequences of any act, upon the basis of some social idea of justice or policy.

In <em>Mercer </em>the court held that \u201ca patient\u2019s negligent conduct that occurs prior to a health care provider\u2019s negligent treatment and provides only the occasion for the health care provider\u2019s subsequent negligence may not be compared to the negligence of the health care provider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b750-4\"> But see, contra, <em>Wyatt v United States, </em>939 F Supp 1402 (ED Mo, 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b751-6\"> MCL 600.1483 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">(1) In an action for damages alleging medical malpractice by or against a person or party, the total amount of damages for noneconomic loss recoverable by all plaintiffs, resulting from the negligence of all defendants, shall not exceed $280,000.00 unless, as the result of the negligence of 1 or more of the defendants, 1 or more of the following exceptions apply as determined by the court pursuant to section 6304, in which case damages for noneconomic loss shall not exceed $500,000.00:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>(a) The plaintiff is hemiplegic, paraplegic, or quadriplegic resulting in a total permanent functional loss of 1 or more limbs caused by 1 or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">(i) Injury to the brain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">(ii) Injury to the spinal cord.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">(b) The plaintiff has permanently impaired cognitive capacity rendering him or her incapable of making independent, responsible life decisions and permanently incapable of independently performing the activities of normal, daily living.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">(c) There has been permanent loss of or damage to a reproductive organ resulting in the inability to procreate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">(2) In awarding damages in an action alleging medical malpractice, the trier of fact shall itemize damages into damages for economic loss and damages for noneconomic loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-13\">(3) As used in this section, \u201cnoneconomic loss\u201d means damages or loss due to pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, physical disfigurement, or other noneconomic loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-14\">(4) The state treasurer shall adjust the limitation on damages for noneconomic loss set forth in subsection (1) by an amount determined by the state treasurer at the end of each calendar year to reflect the cumulative annual percentage change in the consumer price index.
