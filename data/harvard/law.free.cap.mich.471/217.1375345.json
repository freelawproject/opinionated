(MH-SAA), a private, nonprofit entity that organizes and supervises interscholastic athletic events for its voluntary members, is a \u201cpublic body\u201d as that term is defined at MCL 15.232(d) of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), MCL 15.231 <em>et seq. </em>Plaintiffs contend that the MHSAA is a public body within the meaning of the FOIA because (1) it is \u201cprimarily funded by or through state or local authority,\u201d MCL 15.232(d)(iv); (2) it is \u201ccreated by state or local authority,\u201d MCL 15.232(d)(iv); and (3) it is an \u201cagency\u201d of a school district, MCL 15.232(d)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The trial court held that the MHSAA was \u201cprimarily funded by or through state or local authority\u201d and that it was therefore subject to the FOIA as a public body under \u00a7 232(d)(iv). The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that neither \u00a7 232(d) (iv) nor \u00a7 232(d) (iii) applied to the MHSAA. Because we agree that the MHSAA does not qualify as a public body under \u00a7 232(d) (iii) or (iv), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"ACG\">A. THE MHSAA</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">The MHSAA was originally founded in 1924 to exercise control over the interscholastic athletic activities of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>public schools in the state through agreement with the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The MHSAA was housed within the Michigan Department of Education, and its handbook, rules, and regulations were part of the Administrative Code of the state of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">In 1972, the MHSAA became an incorporated, nonprofit membership organization. In that year, the Legislature transferred control of interscholastic athletics from the State Board of Education to the individual school boards, but retained the status of the MHSAA as the official association of the state. See MCL 340.379 (repealed by 1976 PA 451, \u00a7 1851); MCL 380.1289 (before its amendment by 1995 PA 289, \u00a7 1); MCL 380.1521 (repealed by 1995 PA 289, \u00a7 2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1995, the Legislature adopted the Revised School Code, MCL 380.1 <em>et seq., </em>which repealed and amended several statutes. Through the Revised School Code, the MHSAA was removed as the \u201cofficial\u201d organization overseeing interscholastic sports. Under MCL 380.11a(4), a school district\u2019s membership in any athletic organization remains entirely voluntary (school districts <em>\u201cmay . . . </em>join organizations as part of performing the functions of the school district\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The MHSAA is governed by a representative council made up of nineteen voting members, including fourteen members elected by member schools, four mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>bers appointed by the council, and one representative of the state superintendent of education. The council has control of interscholastic athletic policies, and a five-member executive committee makes rules necessary for the control and government of interschool activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The MHSAA regulates interscholastic athletic competition between member schools and sets standards for school membership and eligibility of students to participate in interscholastic athletics. Apparently, the vast majority of high schools in Michigan are members of the MHSAA. Approximately seven hundred Michigan high schools are members of the MHSAA and more than eighty percent of those schools are public. Member schools pay no membership dues and no tournament entry fees. The only funds collected from schools are (1) payments for the cost of publications provided to a school in excess of the quantity already provided to members and (2) meeting expenses (for example, the cost of lunch).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The majority \u2014 approximately ninety percent \u2014 of the MHSAA\u2019s revenues are gate receipts at post-season athletic tournaments for football and basketball. The gate receipt revenues come directly from the sale of the MHSAA\u2019s tickets to members of the public who attend MHSAA-sponsored events. In some cases, the MHSAA itself does not sell the tickets, but member schools remit to the MHSAA gate receipts collected from tickets sold by the schools for the MHSAA-sponsored events.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Because no revenues are derived either during the regular season or from most of the tournaments sponsored by the MHSAA, the positive cash flow from the football and basketball tournaments is used to fund these other activities. Services provided by the MHSAA to its members include the provision of medical insurance for student-athletes; dissemination of play rule books; organization of meetings for coaches and officials; pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>vision of several school and officials publications; provision of trophies and medals; training; direction and management of tournaments; and the services of the MHSAA staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">B. PLAINTIFFS\u2019 FOIA PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Plaintiffs are the parents of a high school student who was prohibited from participating in a ski meet sponsored by the MHSAA because he had previously participated in an unsanctioned event in violation of MHSAA rules. Plaintiffs filed a request under the FOIA seeking information related to that decision. The MHSAA refused to comply with the request, asserting that it was not a public body and was therefore not subject to the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The trial court granted summary disposition to plaintiffs, holding that the MHSAA is \u201cprimarily funded by or through state or local authority\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 232(d) (iv) because the vast majority of its funding comes from gate receipts at the athletic events it sponsors. The trial court held that the gate receipts that comprised the majority of the MHSAA\u2019s revenue were received \u201cthrough\u201d the schools because the MHSAA essentially \u201c \u2018enjoys the schools\u2019 moneymaking capacity as its own,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Brentwood Academy v Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>531 US 288; 121 S Ct 924; 148 L Ed 2d 807 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the MHSAA was not a public body under either \u00a7 232(d) (iv) or \u00a7 232(d)(iii). 255 Mich App 567, 581-582, 583; 662 NW2d 413 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The majority first addressed plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the MHSAA was \u201ccreated by state or local authority\u201d under \u00a7 232(d)(iv). The majority held that, although it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>was originally created under such authority, the modern incarnation of the MHSAA was a unique, private entity that had ceased being the official athletic association for the state. This unique entity was not \u201ccreated\u201d by state or local authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The majority further rejected the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the MHSAA is primarily funded by or through state or local authority. The panel noted that the state provides no financial resources to fund the MHSAA\u2019s activities, and that the MHSAA actually paid fees for the use of host facilities. Member schools pay no fees or dues to the MHSAA. The MHSAA is a private, nonprofit organization that hires and trains its own officials and pays its own employees; furthermore, its revenues are derived from the sale of its own tickets for its own events. The majority further noted that schools are not forced to join the MHSAA and that member schools voluntarily chose to engage the MHSAA\u2019s services. The individual schools have authority over their own interscholastic events and have no independent authority over the MHSAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Finally, the majority rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the MHSAA is an \u201cagent\u201d of the state and therefore subject to the FOIA under \u00a7 232(d)(iii). The majority looked to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th ed), where \u201cagency\u201d was defined as \u201c[a] fiduciary relationship created by express or implied contract or by law, in which one party (the <em>agent) </em>may act on behalf of another party (the <em>principal) </em>and bind that other party by words or actions.\u201d The majority further noted that, pursuant to <em>St Clair Intermediate School Dist v Intermediate Ed Ass\u2019n, </em>458 Mich 540, 558 n 18; 581 NW2d 707 (1998), \u201can agency relationship arises only where the principal \u2018has the right to control the conduct of the agent with respect to matters entrusted to him.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>(citations omitted). The majority held that the MHSAA was governed by its board of directors, not the individual schools who voluntarily became its members. No one school or district could control the MHSAA, because it was controlled by its own board. Therefore, the majority held, the MHSAA was not an \u201cagent\u201d of its member schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Judge JANSEN dissented, opining that the public policy behind the FOIA favored disclosure and that the MHSAA was primarily funded by or through state or local authority because its gate receipts came to it only through or by means of the schools\u2019 authority to regulate sporting events. Judge JANSEN opined that the majority\u2019s holding was contrary to two cases, <em>State Defender Union Employees v Legal Aid &amp; Defender Ass\u2019n of Detroit, </em>230 Mich App 426, 432; 584 NW2d 359 (1998), and <em>Kubick v Child &amp; Family Services, </em>171 Mich App 304; 429 NW2d 881 (1988), in which the Court of Appeals had held, respectively, that (1) \u201cfunded\u201d for purposes of the FOIA definition of \u201cpublic body\u201d meant the receipt of a governmental grant or subsidy and (2) funding that amounted to less than half the total funding of a corporation did not amount to primary funding. Judge JANSEN opined that the gate receipts remitted to the MHSAA were the functional equivalent of a grant or subsidy and that virtually the entire budget of the MHSAA came from gate receipts. Finally, Judge JANSEN opined that the majority\u2019s holding was contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Brentwood </em>that the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA), an organization that is allegedly analogous to the MHSAA, was a state actor for Fourteenth Amendment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">We granted plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal. 469 Mich 952 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">This case involves questions of statutory interpretation, which are reviewed de novo. <em>Roberts v Mecosta Co Gen Hosp, </em>466 Mich 57, 62; 642 NW2d 663 (2002). We review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AT\">A. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The FOIA generally requires disclosure, upon written request, of public records in the possession of a \u201cpublic body.\u201d MCL 15.233(1). \u201cPublic body\u201d is defined in MCL 15.232(d) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">(i) A state officer, employee, agency, department, division, bureau, board, commission, council, authority, or other body in the executive branch of the state government, but does not include the governor or lieutenant governor, the executive office of the governor or lieutenant governor, or employees thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">(ii) An agency, hoard, commission, or council in the legislative branch of the state government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">(iii) A county, city, township, village, intercounty, intercity, or regional governing body, council, school district, special district, or municipal corporation, or a board, department, commission, council, <em>or agency thereof.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">(iv) Any other body which is <em>created by state or local authority </em>or which is <em>primarily funded by or through state or local authority.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\">(v) The judiciary, including the office of the county clerk and employees thereof when acting in the capacity of clerk to the circuit court, is not included in the definition of public body. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">B. THE MHSAA IS NOT PRIMARILY FUNDED BY OR THROUGH STATE OR LOCAL AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">We agree with and adopt the reasoning of the Court of Appeals majority in holding that the MHSAA is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u201cpublic body\u201d as that term is defined by MCL 15.232(d)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">In granting summary disposition for plaintiffs, the trial court held that the MHSAA was \u201cprimarily funded through state or local authority\u201d and thus qualified as a public body under \u00a7 232(d)(iv). The court, noting that it was required to give effect to each word and provision of the statute, held that the use of the terms \u201cby\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cthrough\u201d indicated that funds received both directly and indirectly would be considered in determining whether an entity was a public body under \u00a7 232(d)(iv). The court concluded that, although the MHSAA did not receive money directly from the schools, it \u201c \u2018enjoy[ed] the schools\u2019 moneymaking capacity as its own,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Brentwood, supra, </em>and was therefore publicly funded.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Although we agree that the statutory terms \u201cby\u201d and \u201cthrough\u201d must each be accorded their unique meanings, and that this terminology suggests that even <em>indirect </em>public funding might satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 232(d)(iv), we find persuasive the analysis of the Court of Appeals majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">We read \u201cby or through\u201d to distinguish between the different meanings of the word \u201cauthority,\u201d that is, funding \u201cby\u201d a governmental authority (an <em>entity) </em>and funding \u201cthrough\u201d governmental decision-making authority (the <em>power </em>to regulate). Under our reasoning, the former refers to an entity that directly distributes its financial resources to the disputed organization, while the latter refers to the disputed organization indirectly receiving funds through some action or decision of the governmental body. [255 Mich App 579-580 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The MHSAA is funded neither \u201cby\u201d nor \u201cthrough\u201d a governmental authority. As our Court of Appeals held in <em>State Defender Union Employees, </em>\u201cfunded,\u201d as used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u00a7 232(d)(iv), means \u201cthe receipt of a governmental grant or subsidy.\u201d The MHSAA is not the recipient of any governmental grant or subsidy. The MHSAA\u2019s member schools do not distribute their financial resources to the MHSAA; nor do the schools indirectly fund the MHSAA through allocations of public monies. Rather, the MHSAA \u2014 an independent, nonprofit corporation \u2014 is primarily funded by the sale of its own tickets to private individuals who have voluntarily paid a fee to observe an MHSAA-sponsored athletic event. Member schools pay no dues or fees to the MHSAA, the MHSAA pays fees for the use of host facilities, and it receives no funds from host concessions; thus, the state provides absolutely no public resources to the MHSAA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Nor, contrary to the holding of the trial court and the opinion of our dissenting colleague, does the MHSAA \u201cenjoy[] the schools\u2019 moneymaking capacity as its own.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The MHSAA organizes postseason tournaments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>rents the game venues and sells tickets for those games. Without the MHSAA\u2019s leadership and organizational effort, no revenue from tournament games would be generated for any entity, including MHSAA member schools. In short, MHSAA creates its own \u201cmarket\" and revenue therefrom that would otherwise not exist without its effort. Finally, it is worth noting that member schools have <em>voluntarily </em>relinquished to the MHSAA any interest they may have had in ticket sales for athletic tournaments sponsored by the MHSAA, and the MHSAA, in turn, is fully responsible for the organization and administration of the tournament.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In this vein, we agree with the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in <em>State Defender Union, supra </em>at 432-433, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">an otherwise private organization is not \u201cfunded by or through state or local authority\u201d merely because public monies paid in exchange for goods provided or services rendered comprise a certain percentage of the organization\u2019s revenue. Earned fees are simply not a grant, subsidy, or funding in any reasonable, common-sense construction of those synonymous words. Rather, it is clear that, in the FOIA, <em>funded, </em>means something other than an exchange of services or goods for money, even if the source of money is a governmental entity. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The MHSAA, as noted, provides numerous services for its member schools, such as medical insurance for students, publications, training, and many other benefits that schools would not otherwise be in a position to provide. Here, even assuming that the private ticket-sale revenue at issue somehow passes \u201cthrough\u201d a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>governmental entity, these funds are received by the MHSAA in exchange for the multitude of services it performs for its members, most significantly the administration of the tournaments for which the tickets are sold. The MHSAA is therefore not \u201cfunded\u201d by or through a governmental entity within the meaning of \u00a7 232(d)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">C. THE MHSAA IS NOT CREATED BY STATE OR LOCAL AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Plaintiffs contend that the MHSAA is a \u201ccreature\u201d of the schools and that it is therefore \u201ccreated by state or local authority\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 232(d)(iv). In support of this rather tenuous argument, plaintiffs cite <em>Kirby v MHSAA, </em>459 Mich 23, 39 n 17; 585 NW2d 290 (1998), in which this Court stated that the MHSAA \u201cis a creature of its members, with no independent authority over schools or students. The schools can and should exercise appropriate oversight of the MHSAA.\u201d Plaintiffs additionally, and inconsistently, argue that the MHSAA is a \u201cde facto public body\u201d because it has retained much of the same authority that was originally bestowed upon it in 1924: the authority to exercise control over the interscholastic athletic activities of all high schools of the state. Plaintiffs stress that high schools have no practical choice but to join the MHSAA if they want to participate in interscholastic sports.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">We agree with the Court of Appeals majority that the MHSAA is no longer the same entity that was arguably \u201ccreated\u201d by state authority in 1924. Rather, the modern incarnation of the MHSAA is a wholly different organization from the entity that was at one time legislatively designated as the official organization for the regulation of interscholastic sports in Michigan and that was housed within the Michigan Department of Education. The MHSAA is now a private corporation that is wholly self-regulated. Membership is, by statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>completely voluntary. See MCL 380.11a(4) (providing that \u201c[a]... school district may join organizations as part of performing the functions of the school district\u201d). In short, the MHSAA in its current form is not \u201ccreated by state or local authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We further note that our comment in <em>Kirby </em>\u2014 that the MHSAA \u201cis a creature of its members, with no independent authority over schools or students\u201d \u2014 merely lends further credence to our conclusion that the MHSAA is not a public body. Michigan schools are in no way obligated to join the MHSAA, and they remain free to join other athletic organizations in lieu of, or in addition to, the MHSAA. Member schools do not relinquish authority or decision-making capacity to the MHSAA, nor does the MHSAA have any independent authority over its members.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is simply no basis for concluding that this private corporation is \u201ccreated\u201d by any governmental authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">D. THE MHSAA IS NOT AN AGENCY OF THE SCHOOLS</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Finally, plaintiffs contend that the MHSAA acts as an \u201cagent\u201d for its member schools and that it is therefore a public body as defined by \u00a7 232(d)(iii):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>A county, city, township, village, intercounty, intercity, or regional governing body, council, <em>school district, </em>special district, or municipal corporation, or a board, department, commission, council, <em>or agency thereof. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The Court of Appeals majority and the parties appear to have assumed that \u00a7 232(d) (iii) includes \u201cagents\u201d of enumerated governmental entities in the definition of \u201cpublic body.\u201d We disagree and believe that there is a fundamental difference between the terms \u201cagent\u201d and \u201cagency\u201d as the latter term is used in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">As we have noted on many occasions, a statutory term cannot be viewed in isolation, but must be construed in accordance with the surrounding text and the statutory scheme.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201cContextual understanding of statutes is generally grounded in the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis: </em>\u2018it is known from its associates,\u2019 see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed), p 1060. This doctrine stands for the principle [of interpretation] that a word or phrase is given meaning by its context or setting.\u201d .. . Although a phrase or a statement may mean one thing when read in isolation, it may mean something substantially different when read in context. <em>[Sweatt v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>468 Mich 172, 179-180; 661 NW2d 201 (2003) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Although the noun \u201cagency\u201d may be used to describe a business or legal relationship between parties, it is wholly evident from the context of \u00a7 232(d) (iii) that this is not the sense in which that term is used. Section 232(d) (iii) designates several distinct governmental units as public bodies, and proceeds to include in this definition any \u201cagency\u201d of such a governmental unit. In this specific context, the word \u201cagency\u201d clearly refers to a <em>unit or division of government </em>and not to the <em>relationship </em>between a principal and an agent. Had the Legislature intended any \u201cagent\u201d of the enumerated governmental entities to qualify under \u00a7 232(d)(iii), it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>have used that term rather than <em>\u201cagency </em>Thus, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the MHSAA acts as an \u201cagent\u201d of its member schools and that it thus qualifies as an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 232(d)(iii).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The MHSAA, a private, nonprofit organization having a wholly voluntary membership of private and public schools, is not a \u201cpublic body\u201d within the meaning of the FOIA and is therefore not subject to the FOIA\u2019s provisions. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-8\">Corrigan, C.J., and Cavanagh, Taylor, and Markman, JJ., concurred with YOUNG, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\"> MCL 380.1289(1) provided, until 1995, that \u201c[a] board of a school district... may join an organization, association, or league which has as its object the promotion and regulation of sport and athletic... contests ....\u201d Section 1289(2) further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">An association established for the purpose of organizing and conducting athletic events, contests, or tournaments among schools <em>shall be the official association of the state. </em>The association is responsible for the adoption and enforcement of regulations relative to eligibility of pupils in schools for participation in interscholastic athletic events, contests, or tournaments. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-6\"> The dissent has extracted broad dictionary definitions of the words \u201cby\u201d and \u201cthrough\u201d to suggest that the receipt of any monies <em>\u201cby virtue of\u2019 </em>an entity\u2019s <em>relationship </em>with a state or local governmental body is sufficient to render that entity \u201cfunded by or through state or local authority.\u201d The dissent\u2019s analysis, aside from conflating the distinct meanings of the words \u201cby\u201d and \u201cthrough,\u201d completely disregards the meaning of the statutory term <em>\u201cfunded.\" </em>As we have explained, the word \u201cfunded\u201d does not connote the simple receipt of payment in return for services or materials provided; it connotes receipt of an allocation of resources or a subsidization. See <em>State Defender Union Employees, supra </em>at 432; <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1997). Yet the dissent does not even require that an entity doing business with the government collect fees for goods or services in order to qualify as a public body; the <em>relationship </em>alone seems critical. Such an extreme position is neither warranted by the language of the statute nor fathomable within the bounds of common sense. Taken to its logical conclusion, the dissent\u2019s version of the statute would place within the ambit of \u00a7 232(d) (iv) any contractor or other business that obtains a majority of its income from sales made or services rendered to governmental bodies. See <em>Brentwood, supra </em>at 311 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\u201cthe [Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association\u2019s] \u2018fiscal relationship with the State is not different from that of many contractors performing services for the government.\u2019\u201d). (Citation deleted.) Consider, for example, the nonprofit College Board, which administers the SAT to hundreds of Michigan students in the classrooms of participating public schools each year. Public school students pay the examination fee directly to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>College Board, but under the dissent\u2019s rationale the Board would be a \u201cpublic body\u201d subject to foia disclosure requirements simply because it derives income \u201cby virtue\u201d of the fact that the public schools have facilitated an opportunity for the Board to administer this test in the schools.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\"> Our holding today is limited to the specific question whether the MHSAA is a \u201cpublic body\u201d within the meaning of the FOIA. We express no opinion concerning the relevance of <em>Brentwood, supra, </em>insofar as it may apply to the due process implications of the actions of the mhsaa. We have before us no constitutional question and decline to address whether the mhsaa is a \u201cstate actor\u201d for purposes of 42 USC 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment, as it would be inappropriate to import the concept of and analysis relevant to state action into our statutory analysis. Rather, we are constrained to apply the plain language of the FOIA\u2019s definitional provisions in determining whether the mhsaa is subject to the requirements of the foia.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">While our dissenting colleague acknowledges this fact, see <em>post </em>at 239-240, she nevertheless appears to contend that the definition of \u201cstate actor\u201d under federal law is \u201cpertinent\u201d in defining \u201cpublic body\u201d under the FOIA. This is particularly true of Justice Weaver\u2019s focus on \u201centwinement\u201d as a relevant inquiry for defining \u201cpublic body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">There is a rather straightforward answer to the dissent\u2019s utilization of \u201cstate actor\u201d analysis: it is possible for mhsaa to be a state actor under \u00a7 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment without being a \u201cpublic body\u201d under the FOIA <em>if the Legislature has defined \u201cpublic body\u201d in a manner inconsistent with Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence in the </em>FOIA. The dissent apparently cannot accept the possibility that the Legislature has the discretion to define \u201cpublic body\u201d in any way it chooses; yet she offers no support for the proposition that the Legislature was bound by or had in mind the definition of \u201cstate actor\u201d under federal law when it drafted the FOIA. And, of course, there <em>is </em>no support for that proposition. The Legislature was free to define \u201cpublic body\u201d in the FOIA as narrowly or broadly as it wished. We give meaning to the Legislature\u2019s terms while the dissent is in search of alternate meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">The dissent not only conflates the meaning of \u201cstate actor\u201d under \u00a7 1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment with the definition of a \u201cpublic body\u201d under the FOIA, but she goes on to extract from <em>Brentwood </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>concept that the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (tssaa) (and, by analogy, the mhsaa) \u201cenjoys the schools\u2019 moneymaking capacity as its own.\u201d As stated <em>supra </em>in note 2, the mhsaa is not \u201cfunded\u201d by participating school districts but provides services in the activities it conducts and for which it collects gate receipts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\"> Justice Weaver\u2019s assertion that the school districts \u201chave delegated the authority to the mhsaa to make policy decisions,\u201d <em>post </em>at 246-247, is flatly incorrect. As noted above, the school districts have <em>voluntarily assumed </em>the athletic eligibility conditions set by the mhsaa. Again, -while \u201centwinement\u201d may be a relevant constitutional inquiry for defining who might be a state actor, it has no relevance to our obligation to give meaning to \u201cpublic body\u201d as the Legislature has defined it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\"> The dissent\u2019s analysis suffers for placing undue emphasis on the historical connection between what is now a private, not-for-profit corporation and its previous incarnation as a state-controlled entity. See <em>post </em>at 237-238. This historical connection to the state, however interesting, is irrelevant to the question currently before the Court. At issue is not whether the 1924 incarnation of the mhsaa is a \u201cpublic body,\u201d but whether today\u2019s <em>private </em>corporation composed of <em>voluntary </em>members is a \u201cpublic body\u201d under the foia. When one engages in this inquiry without conflating the present private corporation with its public ancestor, it is manifest that the mhsaa is not a \u201cpublic body\u201d under the foia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b379-10\"> The Department of Labor and Economic Growth, for example, is a governmental \u201cagency,\u201d but a real estate office hired to sell governmental property is <em>not </em>a governmental \u201cagency.\u201d Indeed, it would defy logic (as well as the plain language of \u00a7 232[d][iii]) to conclude that the Legislature intended that any person or entity qualifying as an \u201cagent\u201d of one of the enumerated governmental bodies would be considered a \u201cpublic body\u201d for purposes of the FOIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b379-11\"> Moreover, even if we were to conclude that the term \u201cagency\u201d as used in \u00a7 232(d)(iii) includes agents of the enumerated governmental entities, the mhsaa is an independent body that is in no way the \u201cagent\u201d of its members. As noted by the Court of Appeals majority in this case, \u201c[i]t is a fundamental principle of hornbook agency law that an agency relationship arises only where the principal \u2018has the right to control the conduct of the agent with respect to matters entrusted to him.\u2019 \u201d <em>St Clair Intermediate School Dist, supra </em>at 557-558 (citations omitted). The MHSAA is governed by its own internal board. The individual school members have no authority over the actions of the MHSAA. Moreover, by joining the mhsaa, member schools are required to relinquish to the mhsaa complete authority over the rules and officiating of MHSAA-sponsored athletics.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b379-9\">Weaver, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjC\">(dissenting).

The MHSAA disqualified plaintiffs\u2019 son from competing with his public high school ski team during the 2002 season because he skied in one race that the MHSAA did not sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The question in this case is whether the MHSAA is a public body that must comply with the disclosure requirements of the FOIA. Until the revision of the public school code by 1995 PA 289, there was no dispute that the MHSAA was subject to the FOIA. However, the majority holds that the 1995 revision of the school code insulated the MHSAA from public scrutiny previously available under the FOIA. I disagree and would hold that the MHSAA is a public body subject to the FOIA because it is both created by and primarily funded by or through public school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The FOIA was enacted to continue the common-law right Michigan citizens have traditionally possessed to access government documents. See <em>Walen v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>443 Mich 240, 253; 505 NW2d 519 (1993) (Riley, J. concurring in part); <em>Evening News Ass\u2019n v Troy, </em>417 Mich 481, 494-495; 339 NW2d 421 (1983) (discussing Michigan\u2019s established history of requiring public agency disclosure). As <em>Nowack v Auditor General, </em>243 Mich 200, 203-204; 219 NW 749 (1928), explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">If there be any rule of the English common law that denies the public the right of access to public records, it is repugnant to the spirit of our democratic institutions. Ours is a government of the people. Every citizen rules. ... Undoubtedly, it would be a great surprise to the citizens and taxpayers of Michigan to learn that the law denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>them access to their own books for the purpose of seeing how their money was being expended and how their business was being conducted. There is no such law and never was either in this country or in England. Mr. Justice MORSE was right in saying:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">\u201cI do not think that any common law ever obtained in this free government that would deny to the people thereof the right of free access to, and public inspection of, public records.\u201d <em>Burton v.

The right is based on the interest which citizens necessarily have in the matter to which the records relate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">This right to access provides the policy foundation underlying the FOIA. \u201cThe FOIA was enacted to continue this tradition of openness.\u201d <em>Walen, supra </em>at 254 (Riley, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The FOIA specifically provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">all persons ... are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those who represent them as public officials and public employees, consistent with this act. The people shall be informed so that they may fully participate in the democratic process. [MCL 15.231(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The FOIA subjects \u201cpublic bodies\u201d to its public records disclosure requirements. MCL 15.235. The FOIA provides several definitions of \u201cpublic body,\u201d any one of which subjects an entity to the FOIA\u2019s public record disclosure requirements. MCL 15.232(d)(iv) defines one sort of public body as \u201c[a]ny other body which is created by state or local authority or which is primarily funded by or through state or local authority.\u201d I would hold that the MHSAA is a public body because it is both \u201ccreated by state or local authority\u201d and \u201cprimarily funded by or through state or local authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Statutory language is to be read according to its ordinary and generally accepted meaning. <em>Tryc v Michigan Veterans\u2019 </em>Facility, 451 Mich 135; 545 NW2d 642 (1995). If the language at issue is plain and unambiguous, we assume the Legislature intended its plain meaning and enforce the statute as written. <em>Lorencz v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 370, 376; 483 NW2d 844 (1992). It is appropriate to refer to a dictionary to discern a statute\u2019s plain meaning. <em>State ex rel Wayne Co Prosecuting Attorney v Levenberg, </em>406 Mich 455, 465-466; 280 NW2d 810 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Public school districts are expressly listed as public bodies under the statute. MCL 15.232(d)(iii). Moreover, the provision of interscholastic athletics has long been and now remains a proper function of public school districts, and the MHSAA\u2019s relationship with the public schools in the provision of interscholastic athletics is firmly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">THE MHSAA IS \u201cCREATED BY\u201d SCHOOL DISTRICTS</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Under 1923 PA 237, the superintendent of public instruction was delegated the authority to supervise and control interscholastic athletic activities. The MH-SAA was first organized in 1924 for the purpose of coordinating and regulating interscholastic athletic activities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Within the first year of its creation, the MHSAA presented a \u201cSuggested Set of Standards and Practices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>of Athletic Administration.\u201d Regarding these standards, the superintendent of public instruction wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">Any athletic program to be worth having at all must contribute something to the educational value to its board. To do that it must be the result of the cooperative effort on the part of the superintendent, principal, althletic director, and student body. Complete control of the program must remain in the school itself. Any set of standards and practices must guide all these various groups.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Until 1972, the MHSAA was apparently \u201choused within the Michigan Department of Education, and its Executive Director was known as the \u2018State Director of Athletics.\u2019 \u201d <em>Communities for Equity v Michigan High School Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>178 F Supp 2d 805, 810-811 (WD Mich, 2001). The MHSAA\u2019s handbook, rules, and regulations were part of the Michigan Administrative Code. <em>Id. </em>at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">In 1972, the school code was amended and the authority over interscholastic athletics was moved from the State Board of Education to individual school districts. <em>Id. </em>The Legislature expressly provided that school districts could join \u201can organization, association or league which has as its object the promotion of sport. .. and regulation of athletic . . . contests .. . .\u201d Former MCL 340.379. Although the statute did not expressly designate the MHSAA as the official organization for interscholastic athletics, it did provide that <em>\u201cAn association </em>established for the purpose of organizing and conducting athletic events, contests, or tournaments among schools shall be the official association of the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). It has been assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>that the Legislature was referencing the MHSAA. See <em>Communities for Equity, supra </em>at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Also in 1972, the MHSAA reorganized as a private not-for-profit corporation. The MHSAA\u2019s purpose remained essentially unchanged after 1972. As stated in the 1972 articles of incorporation, the MHSAA was intended</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">to create, establish and provide for, supervise and conduct interscholastic athletic programs throughout the state consistent with the educational values of the high school curriculums [sic]....[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">As under the former law, membership in the MHSAA was voluntary. Nevertheless, once a school district joins the MHSAA, it was and is bound by the MHSAA\u2019s rules.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">There is no express mention of athletics in the school code as revised in 1995. The law now simply authorizes school districts to \u201cjoin organizations <em>as part of performing the functions of the school district.\u201d </em>MCL 380.11a(4) (emphasis added). However, the Kevised School Code further provides that the powers of school districts are not diminished \u201c[ujnless expressly provided in the amendatory act. . . .\u201d MCL 380.11a(9). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Thus, it can be concluded that the provision of athletics remains a proper function of school districts. It is also undisputed that the MHSAA remains the primary statewide organization that coordinates the interscholastic athletics for public school districts in Michigan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Given this history, the majority\u2019s suggestion that the MHSAA is <em>\u201ca </em>wholly different organization from the entity that was at one time legislatively designated as the official organization for the regulation of interscholastic sports in Michigan and that was housed within the Michigan Department of Education,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 230, is inaccurate. As noted above, the MHSAA was not expressly named in the statute as the \u201cofficial\u201d state interscholastic organization after 1972. Further, the majority suggests that the \u201cvoluntary\u201d nature of membership in the MHSAA is a new reality under the 1995 Revised School Code. This is not true. Membership has always been and remains voluntary. At any point since 1924, a school district could decide to not participate in interscholastic athletics and to not join the MHSAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">School districts allow the MHSAA to coordinate sports events because the MHSAA is the dominant statewide organization of interscholastic athletics, and failure to join and comply with the MHSAA rules would effectively prevent the schools from participating in interscholastic athletics. Moreover, the MHSAA\u2019s written materials demonstrate that the MHSAA is intertwined with the school districts. Specifically included in the MHSAA\u2019s eligibility guidelines are requirements that the student athlete passes at least twenty credit hours and not have been enrolled in more than eight semesters in high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>school.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, not only is the MHSAA involved in the athletic activities of the students, it also establishes rules concerning the scholastic performance of the student athletes.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">As noted in <em>Communities for Equity, supra </em>at 811, the 1995 amendment of the Revised School Code, \u201cresulted in no substantive changes in the structure or operation of the MHSAA or in its relationships with its member schools.\u201d The MHSAA was created by school districts that came together in 1924 to organize interscholastic athletics, and the organization of interscholastic athletics remains the MHSAA\u2019s purpose. When school districts join the MHSAA through annual resolutions passed by the school boards, they adopt the MHSAA\u2019s constitution, by-laws, rules and regulations \u201cas their own.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, under the FOIA the MHSAA should be treated as a \u201cpublic body\u201d because it is \u201ccreated by state or local authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The United States Supreme Court case of <em>Brentwood Academy v Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>531 US 288; 121 S Ct 924; 148 L Ed 2d 807 (2001), supports the conclusion that the MHSAA is a public body that was created by state or local authority. In <em>Brentwood, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association (TSSAA) was a state actor subject to constitutional limitations. While it is unnecessary to decide whether the MHSAA is a state actor to determine whether the MHSAA is subject to the FOIA, the <em>Brentwood </em>Court\u2019s discussion of the TSSAA is of interest and relevant to this case because of the TSSAA\u2019s similarities to the MHSAA. In <em>Brentwood, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the TSSAA, like the MHSAA, was a not-for-profit corporation that was formed to oversee the interscholastic sports programs among public and private high schools in the state. The TSSAA imposed sanctions against plaintiff Brentwood Academy based on recruiting violations. In finding that the TSSAA was a state actor, the United States Supreme Court noted that \u201cthe nominally private character of the Association is overborne by the pervasive entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its composition and workings ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298. <em>Brentwood </em>also noted the TSSAA\u2019s membership consisted of predominantly public schools, its revenue came from its membership dues and gate receipts from tournaments held at member schools, state officials were given ex officio status on the legislative council, and TSSAA employees were eligible for the state employees retirement system. <em>Id. </em>at 298-300.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is notable that before the United States Supreme Court in <em>Brentwood </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>reversed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the TSSAA was <em>not </em>a state actor, the MHSAA argued that it was \u201cvery similar in structure\u201d to the TSSAA and \u201cthat the nature and function of the MHSAA is virtually identical to that of the TSSAA.\u201d See <em>Communities for Equity, supra </em>at 846-847. To suggest that an entity like the MHSAA could be a state actor, but not also a \u201cpublic body\u201d under the FOIA would undercut the stated purpose of the FOIA that \u201c [a]ll persons ... are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government. .. .\u201d MCL 15.231(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">THE MHSAA IS PRIMARILY FUNDED BY OR THROUGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The MHSAA is \u201cprimarily funded\u201d as a result of its relationship with the public school districts. The majority definition of \u201cfunded\u201d as narrowly pertaining only to \u201cthe receipt of a governmental grant or subsidy,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 224, 226-227, defies common sense. The majority\u2019s definition originates in a Court of Appeals decision<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that first cites a dictionary definition of \u201cfund\u201d (as a verb), and then skips to a synonym, \u201csubsidize,\u201d that the panel discovered in a thesaurus. Apparently preferring \u201csubsidize\u201d to \u201cfund,\u201d even though the term \u201cfund\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>used by the Legislature,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the panel then turned to a dictionary definition of \u201csubsidy\u201d (a noun) and discovered that a \u201csubsidy\u201d is defined as \u201ca direct financial aid furnished by a government.. . [or] any grant or contribution of money.\u201d Thus, by mixing verbs and nouns and substituting words for those employed by the Legislature, the panel creatively narrowed \u201cis... funded\u201d under the statute to mean the \u201creceipt of a government grant or subsidy.\u201d While it is appropriate to refer to dictionary definitions to understand the ordinary meaning of words, it is not appropriate to pick and choose among synonyms that may only have \u201cnearly the same\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> meaning and substitute those for the words specifically employed by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">I would conclude, that a \u201cfund\u201d can be understood to be \u201cmoney available for use\u201d so that when something \u201cis funded\u201d it is provided for \u201cby a fund,\u201d i.e. by \u201cmoney available for use . . . .\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>(3d ed). Michigan public schools represent eighty percent of the MHSAA\u2019s membership and approximately ninety to ninety-five percent of the MHSAA\u2019s funding is from gate receipts from postseason athletic tournaments for football and basketball involving public school teams. Without the voluntary participation of the public school districts in the MHSAA organized interscholastic athletic season and postseason tournaments, as well as the school districts\u2019 relinquishment of the gate receipts to MHSAA, it would cease to exist because its primary source of money available for its use would disappear.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>However, the question remains whether the MHSAA\u2019s gate receipt funding is derived \u201cby or through\u201d public school districts. There are many inapplicable definitions of the terms \u201cby\u201d and \u201cthrough.\u201d But in the context of MCL 15.232(d)(iv), the most applicable definition of \u201cby\u201d in <em>Webster\u2019s </em>addresses the term as used to express permission or sanction. In that sense, \u201cby\u201d is-defined as \u201cwith the authority or sanction of <em>[by </em>your leave].\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The applicable definitions of \u201cthrough\u201d in <em>Webster\u2019s </em>are \u201cby means of <em>[through </em>her help]\u201d and \u201cas a result of; because of [done <em>through </em>error].\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Thus, the plain meaning approach to \u201cby\u201d or \u201cthrough\u201d in the context of the statute at issue is whether the gate receipts amount to funding that the MHSAA receives with the authority or sanction of the school districts or by means of, as a result of, or because of the school districts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> I would hold that because the MHSAA receives its primary funding as with the authority of (by) and as a result of (through) the voluntary membership of public school districts in the MHSAA and the school districts\u2019 voluntary participation in the interscholastic athletic seasons and postseason tournaments organized by the MHSAA, the MHSAA is primarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>funded \u201cby or through\u201d the schools and is a public body under MCL 15.232(d)(iii) of the FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Rather than look at the plain meaning of the words at issue, the majority suggests that the terms \u201cby\u201d and \u201cthrough\u201d must refer to different kinds of governmental authority. The majority adopts the analysis of the Court of Appeals and concludes that \u201cby\u201d refers to an entity that directly distributes its financial resources to the disputed organization. The majority then says \u201cthrough\u201d refers to the disputed organization indirectly receiving funds through some action or decision of the governmental body. <em>Ante </em>at 226. However, to understand the statute, it is not necessary to engraft concepts of direct and indirect funding or to conclude that the Legislature intended to reference different kinds of governmental authority when it only used the term authority once. The majority\u2019s approach defies the plain language of the statute and unduly constricts the definitions of \u201cpublic body\u201d and of \u201cfunded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In <em>Brentwood, </em>the United States Supreme Court addressed the nature of gate receipts received by a similar state school athletic organization for its organization and sponsorship of public school athletic tournaments and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">Unlike mere public buyers of contract services, whose payments for services rendered do not convert the service providers into public actors,... the schools here obtain membership in the service organization and give up sources of their own income to their collective association. The Association ... exercises the authority of the predominantly public schools to charge admission to their games; the Association does not receive this money from the schools, but enjoys the moneymaking capacity as its own. <em>[Brentwood, supra </em>at 299.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Like the TSSAA, the MHSAA is more than a public contractor exchanging payments for services. By collecting gate receipts at tournaments, the MHSAA enjoys the schools\u2019 moneymaking capacity as its own.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">This underscores the conclusion that the MHSAA receives its primary funding \u201cby or through\u201d the schools\u2019 authority. The majority argues that the MHSAA \u201ccreates its own \u2018market,\u2019 \u201d and stresses that without the MH-SAA\u2019s effort \u201cno revenue from tournament games would be generated for any entity, including MHSAA member schools.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 229. The majority thus concludes that the MHSAA is merely a service provider and that the gate receipts are simply fees paid for services.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">However, as noted above, the MHSAA is not simply in a situation where the organization provides a particular service for a fee. True, the MHSAA does organize interscholastic seasons and postseason tournaments. It also provides medical insurance, publications, and training to its members. However, schools do not join the MHSAA or allow it to sell tickets to events featuring student athletes simply because the MHSAA provides medical insurance, publications, or training. As already explained, school districts allow the MHSAA to coordinate events and relinquish related gate receipts to the MHSAA because the MHSAA is the dominant statewide organization of interscholastic athletics, and failure to join and comply with MHSAA rules would effectively prevent the schools from participating in interscholastic athletics.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">It should be noted that the MHSAA is distinguishable from ordinary service providers to the schools. The school districts have delegated the authority to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>MHSAA to make policy decisions. These decisions are within the proper function of school districts to regulate athletics, MCL 380.11a(4); MCL 380.11a(9), such as athletic eligibility and training, participation in outside sports activities and required scholastic achievement for participating athletes. This intertwinement between the MHSAA and the school districts makes the MHSAA subject to the FOIA where an ordinary service provider would not be.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">It has been and remains the submission of public school districts to the rules and regulations of the MHSAA that allows the MHSAA to exist. It can thus be concluded that the MHSAA was created by the school districts. MCL 15.232(d)(iv). It is similarly by and through the MHSAA\u2019s relationship with the schools that it may sell tickets for tournaments featuring public school athletes. It follows that the gate receipts the MHSAA receives for those events are received \u201cby or through\u201d the authority of the schools as those words are used in MCL 15.232(d)(iv). The purpose of the FOIA is to allow citizens to fully participate in the democratic process regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those who represent them. MCL 15.231(2). The school districts have effectively delegated the responsibility for those official acts, as they pertain to school athletics, to the MHSAA by repeatedly adopting its rules as their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Thus, both to follow the language of the FOIA and remain true to the purpose behind its enactment, I would hold that the MHSAA is a public body that must comply with the disclosure requirements of the FOIA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-9\">KELLY, J., concurred with WEAVER, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-11\"> Since the founding of the MHSAA the state superintendent of public instruction has been an ex-officio member of the Representative Council that governs the MHSAA.
