The jury awarded plaintiff $10 million in noneconomic damages. The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion for remittitur or a new trial, concluding that the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap does not apply to wrongful death actions. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Because we conclude that the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap does apply to wrongful death actions where the underlying claim is medical malpractice, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the constitutional issues raised by plaintiff that were not resolved by the Court of Appeals in light of its analysis of the statutory issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Plaintiff brought this wrongful death action against defendants, seeking to recover damages for the death of her mother that allegedly resulted from defendants\u2019 medical malpractice. Plaintiffs decedent began treating with defendant Dr. Jayesh Patel shortly after being hospitalized for a stroke. Plaintiff contends that Dr. Patel negligently managed the decedent\u2019s renal disease and hypertension, which ultimately led to her death. Plaintiff sought damages for the loss of society and companionship sustained by the decedent\u2019s seven children and seven siblings. The jury awarded plaintiff $10 million in noneconomic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Defendants filed a motion for remittitur or for a new trial, arguing that the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap, MCL 600.1483(1), requires a reduction in the damage award, and, in the alternative, that the award is excessive. The trial court held that the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap does not apply to wrongful death actions. The trial judge further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>held that, although the award is excessive, he could not determine an appropriate amount of damages because he was not personally present at the trial to hear the testimony of the witnesses and judge their credibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, he let the jury\u2019s $10 million verdict stand. In a published decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision that the medical malpractice non-economic damages cap does not apply to wrongful death actions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals, however, remanded the case to the trial court, holding that the trial court, having found the award to be excessive, must either set a remittitur amount or grant a new trial on damages only.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One of the judges on the panel wrote a concurring opinion to emphasize her belief that the language of the wrongful death act precludes application of the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap. We granted defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Whether the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap, MCL 600.1483(1), applies to a wrongful death action where the underlying claim is medical malpractice is an issue of statutory interpretation, which is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. <em>Morales v Auto-Owners Ins Co (After Remand), </em>469 Mich 487, 490; 672 NW2d 849 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>hi. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">MCL 600.1483, also referred to as the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">(l)In an action for damages alleging medical malpractice by or against a person or party, the total amount of damages for noneconomic loss recoverable by all plaintiffs, resulting from the negligence of all defendants, shall not exceed $280,000.00 unless, as the result of the negligence of 1 or more of the defendants, 1 or more of the following exceptions apply as determined by the court pursuant to section 6304, in which case damages for noneconomic loss shall not exceed $500,000.00:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">(a) The plaintiff is hemiplegic, paraplegic, or quadriplegic resulting in a total permanent functional loss of 1 or more limbs caused by 1 or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">(1) Injury to the brain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">(ii) Injury to the spinal cord.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">(b) The plaintiff has permanently impaired cognitive capacity rendering him or her incapable of making independent, responsible life decisions and permanently incapable of independently performing the activities of normal, daily living.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">(c) There has been permanent loss of or damage to a reproductive organ resulting in the inability to procreate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-11\">(2) In awarding damages in an action alleging medical malpractice, the trier of fact shall itemize damages into damages for economic loss and damages for noneconomic loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-12\">(3) As used in this section, \u201cnoneconomic loss\u201d means damages or loss due to pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, physical disfigurement, or other non-economic loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">The wrongful death act, MCL 600.2922, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>(1) Whenever the death of a person or injuries resulting in death shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect, or fault of another, and the act, neglect, or fault is such as would, if death had not ensured, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages, the person who or the corporation that would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death was caused under circumstances that constitute a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">(2) Every action under this section shall be brought by, and in the name of, the personal representative of the estate of the deceased person ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">(6) In every action under this section, the court or jury may award damages as the court or jury shall consider fair and equitable, under all the circumstances including reasonable medical, hospital, funeral, and burial expenses for which the estate is liable; reasonable compensation for the pain and suffering, while conscious, undergone by the deceased person during the period intervening between the time of the injury and death; and damages for the loss of financial support and the loss of the society and companionship of the deceased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">There is no common-law right to recover damages for a wrongfully caused death. Instead, the wrongful death act provides the exclusive remedy under which a plaintiff may seek damages for a wrongfully caused death. <em>Courtney v Apple, </em>345 Mich 223, 228; 76 NW2d 80 (1956). That does not mean, however, that the wrongful death act is the only act that is applicable in a wrongful death action. For instance, the medical malpractice statute of limitations, MCL 600.5838a, applies to wrongful death actions where the underlying claim is medical malpractice because \u201cin all actions brought under the wrongful death statute, the limitations pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>riod will be governed by the provision applicable to the liability theory of the underlying wrongful act.\u201d <em>Hawkins v Regional Medical Laboratories, PC, </em>415 Mich 420, 436; 329 NW2d 729 (1982); <em>Waltz v Wyse, </em>469 Mich 642; 677 NW2d 813 (2004). Additionally, actions brought under the wrongful death act \u201caccrue as provided by the statutory provisions governing the underlying liability theory . ...\u201d <em>Hawkins, supra </em>at 437. Accordingly, when the underlying claim is medical malpractice, the medical malpractice accrual statute, MCL 600.5838a, applies to a wrongful death action. Further, this Court has recently applied the medical malpractice notice of intent requirement of MCL 600.2912b, the medical malpractice tolling provision of MCL 600.5856(d), the medical malpractice affidavit of merit requirement of MCL 600.2912d, and the medical malpractice expert witness qualification requirements of MCL 600.2169(l)(a) to wrongful death actions. <em>Waltz, supra; Grossman v Brown, </em>470 Mich 593; 685 NW2d 198 (2004); <em>Halloran v Bhan, </em>470 Mich 572; 683 NW2d 129 (2004).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Clearly, the wrongful death act is not the only act that is pertinent in a wrongful death action. \u201cThe mere fact that our legislative scheme requires that suits for tortious conduct resulting in death be filtered through the so-called \u2018death act\u2019, MCL 600.2922; MSA 27A.2922, does not change the character of such actions except to expand the elements of damage available.\u201d <em>Hawkins, supra </em>at 436. That is, a wrongful death action grounded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>in medical malpractice is a medical malpractice action in which the plaintiff is allowed to collect damages related to the death of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The statute at issue here, MCL 600.1483, specifically provides that it applies to \u201can action for damages alleging medical malpractice ... .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs action is clearly an \u201caction for damages alleging medical malpractice . .. .\u201d Section 1483(1). This fact is undisputed. Although the Court of Appeals recognized that \u201c\u00a7 1483 applies in an action for damages alleging medical malpractice, and that the case before us, with respect to the subject matter from which the negligence arose, is such an action,\u201d <em>Jenkins v Patel, </em>256 Mich App 112, 122; 662 NW2d 453 (2003), it went on to conclude that \u201cthe Legislature did not intend [\u00a7 1483\u2019s noneconomic] damages cap to limit those damages in a wrongful-death, medical-malpractice action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125-126. It reached this conclusion on the basis that \u00a7 1483(3)\u2019s definition of \u201cnoneconomic loss\u201d does not specifically include losses related to wrongful death, such as loss of society and companionship.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Section 1483(3) defines \u201cnoneconomic loss\u201d as \u201cdamages or loss due to pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, physical disfigurement, or other noneconomic loss.\u201d The wrongful death act, MCL 600.2922(6), specifically provides that \u201cthe loss of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>society and companionship of the deceased\u201d is an available remedy in a wrongful death action. The Court of Appeals concluded that the damages referred to in \u00a7 1483(3) \u201crelate to damages sustained by an individual surviving plaintiff rather than damages sustained by next of kin in a wrongful-death action ....\u201d <em>Jenkins, supra </em>at 124. Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u00a7 1483 is not meant to limit damages that a next of kin would seek for his own suffering, such as loss of society and companionship.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning is flawed, in our judgment, because it fails to give meaning to all the words of the statute and \u201c[c]ourts must give effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute and avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory.\u201d State <em>Farm Fire &amp; Cas Co v Old Republic Ins Co, </em>466 Mich 142, 146; 644 NW2d 715 (2002). If the definition of \u201cnoneconomic loss\u201d in \u00a7 1483(3) does not encompass damages sought by a next of kin under the wrongful death act for his own suffering, as the Court of Appeals concluded, then such definition also would not encompass such damages when sought by a next of kin of a plaintiff who survived the medical malpractice. If that is so, then the Legislature\u2019s specific directive that \u00a7 1483 limits the total damages recoverable by \u201call plaintiffs\u201d means nothing. However, this language has to mean something. In our judgment, the \u201call plaintiffs\u201d language means that the plaintiff who most directly suffered from the medical malpractice is not necessarily the only plaintiff in a medical malpractice action. Rather, the \u201cplaintiffs\u201d next of kin may also be plaintiffs in a medical malpractice action and they may seek damages for the losses that they have suffered as a result of the medical malpractice, such as the loss of society and companionship. <em>Blackwell v Citizens Ins Co of America, </em>457 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>662, 664 n 1; 579 NW2d 889 (1998)(a plaintiffs husband\u2019s loss of consortium claim is derivative of the plaintiffs medical malpractice claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Furthermore, \u00a7 1483(3)\u2019s definition of \u201cnoneconomic loss\u201d is not limited to \u201cdamages or loss due to pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, [and] physical disfigurement. . . .\u201d Rather, \u00a7 1483(3) specifically includes within the definition of \u201cnoneconomic loss\u201d all the things mentioned above and \u201cother non-economic loss.\u201d Therefore, just because a noneconomic loss, such as loss of society, is not specifically listed under \u00a7 1483(3), does not mean that it is not a covered noneconomic loss. Section 1483(2) directs the trier of fact to \u201citemize damages into damages for economic loss and damages for noneconomic loss.\u201d Noneconomic damages are subject either to the $280,000 cap or the $500,000 cap, while economic damages are not subject to either of these caps.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Damages awarded in an action for medical malpractice can obviously only be economic or noneconomic. The damages awarded in this case for loss of society and companionship are clearly noneconomic damages. <em>Rusinek v Schultz, Snyder &amp; Steele Lumber Co, </em>411 Mich 502, 504-505; 309 NW2d 163 (1981)(loss of consortium, which is defined as including loss of society and companionship, is a noneconomic loss). This fact is undisputed. Accordingly, we agree with defendants that \u00a7 1483\u2019s definition of \u201cnoneconomic losses,\u201d which includes \u201cother noneconomic loss,\u201d includes noneconomic losses not specifically listed, including those sought by plaintiffs next of kin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>for their own pain and suffering. Otherwise, a plaintiffs next of kin would not be able to recover for such things as loss of consortium, loss of society, and loss of companionship in a medical malpractice action, and, as discussed above, a medical malpractice plaintiffs next of kin can most certainly recover such damages. See <em>Blackwell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Further support for our conclusion that the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap applies to a wrongful death action where the underlying claim is medical malpractice can be found in the allocation of liability statute, MCL 600.6304. Section 1483(1) refers expressly to \u00a7 6304, stating that if the court determines, pursuant to \u00a7 6304, that one of the enumerated exceptions apply, then the $500,000 cap, rather than the $280,000 cap, is applicable. Section 6304 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">(1) In an action based on tort or another legal theory-seeking damages for personal injury, property damage, or <em>wrongful death .. </em>. the court, unless otherwise agreed by all parties to the action, shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories or, if there is no jury, shall make findings indicating both of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">(a) The total amount of each plaintiffs damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">(b) The percentage of the total fault of all persons that contributed to the death or injury ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">(3) The court shall determine the award of damages to each plaintiff in accordance with the findings under subsection (1), subject to any reduction under subsection (5).. . and shall enter judgment against each party, including a third-party defendant.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>(5) In an action alleging medical malpractice, the court shall reduce an award of damages in excess of 1 of the limitations set forth in section 1483 to the amount of the appropriate limitation set forth in section 1483. The jury shall not be advised by the court or by counsel for either party of the limitations set forth in section 1483 or any other provision of section 1483. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Section 6304(1), requiring the jury to allocate fault among all persons, expressly applies to wrongful death actions, because it explicitly states, \u201cIn an action based on . .. wrongful death . . . .\u201d Section 6304(3) then requires the court to reduce the plaintiffs award in all subject actions, including wrongful death actions, according to the jury\u2019s allocation of fault and subject to any reduction required under subsection 5. As noted above, subsection 5 is the subsection requiring the court to apply the noneconomic damages cap of \u00a7 1483. Thus, subsection 3 of \u00a7 6304 incorporates the noneconomic damages cap of \u00a7 1483 into wrongful death actions by ensuring that in any action subject to \u00a7 6304, expressly including wrongful death actions, the court will reduce the plaintiffs verdict both on the basis of the allocation of fault and on the basis of \u00a7 1483 \u2014 the noneconomic damages cap for medical malpractice cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Plaintiff argues that the wrongful death act expressly precludes application of the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap to wrongful death actions. As noted above, MCL 600.2922(6) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">In every action under this section, the court or jury may award damages as the court or jury shall consider fair and equitable, under all the circumstances including reasonable medical, hospital, funeral, and burial expenses for which the estate is liable; reasonable compensation for the pain and suffering, while conscious, undergone by the deceased person during the period intervening between the time of the injury and death; and damages for the loss of financial support and the loss of the society and companionship of the deceased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Plaintiff argues that this provision governs damages in wrongful death claims, in such a manner that other provisions are rendered inapplicable. However, this Court has held that other statutory and common-law limitations on the amount of damages apply to wrongful death actions. For instance, comparative negligence principles and the collateral source setoff rule, MCL 600.6303(1), apply to wrongful death actions. <em>Solomon v Shuell, </em>435 Mich 104; 457 NW2d 669 (1990); <em>Rogers v Detroit, </em>457 Mich 125; 579 NW2d 840 (1998), overruled on other grounds by <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439; 613 NW2d 307 (2000).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Contrary to plaintiffs contention, \u00a7 1483 and \u00a7 2922(6) are not incompatible. Notwithstanding \u00a7 1483, in accordance with \u00a7 2922(6), \u201c[i]n every action under\u201d the wrongful death act, \u201cthe court or jury may award damages as the court or jury shall consider fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>and equitable,\u201d including \u201creasonable compensation for the pain and suffering, while conscious, undergone by the deceased person during the period intervening between the time of the injury and death; and damages for the loss of financial support and the loss of the society and companionship of the deceased.\u201d Only after the court or jury has, in its discretion, awarded damages as it considers fair and equitable does the court, pursuant to \u00a7 6304(5), apply the noneconomic damages cap of \u00a7 1483. This is made explicitly clear in \u00a7 6098(1), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">A judge presiding over an action alleging medical malpractice shall review each verdict to determine if the limitation on noneconomic damages provided for in section 1483 applies. If the limitation applies, the court shall set aside any amount of noneconomic damages in excess of the amount specified in section 1483.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Section 6304(5) similarly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">In an action alleging medical malpractice, the court shall reduce an award of damages in excess of 1 of the limitations set forth in section 1483 to the amount of the appropriate limitation set forth in section 1483. The jury shall not be advised by the court or by counsel for either party of the limitations set forth in section 1483 or any other provision of section 1483.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Although \u00a7 1483 reduces the damages awarded by the trier of fact, it does nothing to impinge upon the trier of fact\u2019s ability to determine an amount that is \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d That is, \u00a7 1483 does not diminish the ability of the trier of fact to render a fair and equitable award of damages; it merely limits the plaintiffs ability to recover the full amount awarded in cases where the cause of action is based upon medical malpractice and the amount exceeds the cap.

The Court of Appeals analysis and decision concerning this issue were correct and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">This Court has often repeated the proper approach to interpreting statutes. We recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">\u201cThe paramount rule of statutory interpretation is that we are to effect the intent of the Legislature. <em>Tryc v Michigan Veterans\u2019 </em>Facility, 451 Mich 129, 135; 545 NW2d 642 (1996). To do so, we begin with the statute\u2019s language. If the statute\u2019s language is clear and unambiguous, we assume that the Legislature intended its plain meaning and we enforce the statute as written. <em>People v Stone, </em>463 Mich 558, 562; 621 NW2d 702 (2001). In reviewing the statute\u2019s language, every word should be given meaning, and we should avoid a construction that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory. <em>Altman v Meridian Twp, </em>439 Mich 623, 635; 487 NW2d 155 (1992).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>[Omelenchuk v City of Warren, </em>466 Mich 524, 528; 647 NW2d 493 (2002), quoting <em>Wickens v Oakwood Healthcare Sys, </em>465 Mich 53, 60; 631 NW2d 686 (2001).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">THE WRONGFUL DEATH ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The wrongful death act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is the exclusive remedy in wrongful death cases. <em>Courtney v Apple, </em>345 Mich 223, 228; 76 NW2d 80 (1956). The Court of Appeals correctly reasoned that the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap found in MCL 600.1483 does not apply to actions brought under the act. <em>Jenkins v Patel, </em>256 Mich App 112; 662 NW2d 453 (2003). Furthermore, the Court of Appeals concurring opinion of Judge KELLY underscores that a plain language reading of the act precludes the application of the MCL 600.1483 cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The wrongful death act was passed to ensure the preservation of claims that, at common law, would have terminated with the death of the victim or the tortfeasor. <em>Hawkins v Regional Medical Laboratories, PC, </em>415 Mich 420, 428-429; 329 NW2d 729 (1982). To ensure the survival of a claim, a wrongful death claim must be filed in conformity with the provisions of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">An injured plaintiff may file suit under other statutory provisions. However, if he dies in the course of litigation, to recover damages for the death, his estate must file a claim under the wrongful death act. MCL 600.2921. The act contains no cap on the damages available. See MCL 600.2922. It was not amended by tort reform legislation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>In this case, the decedent\u2019s estate sought damages for losses sustained by the decedent\u2019s seven children and seven siblings. A malpractice action brought on behalf of the decedent had she been alive would not have survived her. Plaintiff had no alternative but to file suit under the wrongful death act.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The act contains the substance, procedures, and the measure of damages in an action brought against one who has caused the death of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">MCL 600.2922(6) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">In every action under this section, the court or jury may award damages as the court or jury shall consider fair and equitable, under all the circumstances including reasonable medical, hospital, funeral, and burial expenses for which the estate is liable; reasonable compensation for the pain and suffering, while conscious, undergone by the deceased person during the period intervening between the time of the injury and death; and damages for the loss of financial support and the loss of the society and companionship of the deceased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Indisputably, plaintiffs action is governed by the specific provisions of the act. I agree with the Court of Appeals majority that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">standing alone, the [wrongful death act] mandates recovery in any amount, limited only by the requirement that the amount be fair and equitable, for noneconomic losses, including those for loss of society and companionship. Without taking into consideration the damages cap ... the [act] clearly and unambiguously governs a medical-malpractice action involving death and the accompanying request for damages. This was clearly the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the [act]. Tort-reform legislation, which included the damages cap, did not result in any amendment of the [act], <em>[Jenkins, supra </em>at 119-120.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">In short, the only limitation intended by the Legislature on noneconomic damages under the wrongful death act is that the amount be fair and equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>THE MEDICAL MALPRACTICE NONECONOMIC DAMAGES CAP STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">I agree with Court of Appeals Judge KELLY that the wrongful death act and the medical malpractice damages cap statute need not be read in pari materia. The statutes serve different purposes. The medical malpractice damages cap serves to limit liability in a medical malpractice action. As stated above, the wrongful death act provides for the survival of an action once the victim dies. It allows the estate to recover damages for the value to the estate of the life of the deceased. While the Legislature could have made the medical malpractice damages cap expressly applicable to wrongful death actions, it chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The wrongful death act specifically provides for damages in actions filed in accordance with its provisions. See MCL 600.2922(6). Just as this Court should not expand the remedies available under the act, it should not narrow them, absent an explicit indication that the Legislature intended it.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">If the Legislature wanted the medical malpractice damages cap statute to apply in wrongful death actions, some indication of that intention would be present in the language of the wrongful death act. Furthermore, although the Legislature was aware of the exclusive damages provision in the wrongful death act, it made no reference to a limitation on damages in the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The Legislature is presumed to have knowledge of existing laws. It is assumed to have measured the effect of new laws on all existing laws. <em>Walen v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>443 Mich 240, 248; 505 NW2d 519 (1993). It is presumed to know that the wrongful death act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>provides specifically and exclusively for damages in wrongful death claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Therefore, it is significant that the Legislature declined the opportunity to list death as an injury subject to the damages cap in either the wrongful death act or the medical malpractice noneconomic damages cap statute. The inference is strong that the damages cap does not apply in wrongful death cases arising from underlying medical malpractice claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">OTHER LEGISLATION</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The Legislature has specifically addressed death in other legislation. In the products liability cap act, MCL 600.2946a,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">a statute analogous to the damages cap, the Legislature not only specifically addressed death, but identified death as one of the two injuries that results in the second-tier cap:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE9\">\u201cIn an action for product liability, the total amount of damages for noneconomic loss shall not exceed $280,000.00, unless the defect in the product caused either the person\u2019s death or permanent loss of a vital bodily function, in which case the total amount of damages for noneconomic loss shall not exceed $500,000.00.\u201d [MCL 600.2946a(l).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">Thus, while the Legislature was clearly aware that death is a possible injury in medical-malpractice claims just as in products-liability claims, it chose not to identify it as an injury subject to the damages cap. <em>[Jenkins, supra </em>at 135-136 (Kelly, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">MCL 600.6098(1) lends support to the plaintiffs argument. The language of this section requires a judge presiding over an action alleging medical malpractice to determine</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>if the limitation of noneconomic damages provided for in section 1483 applies. If the limitation applies, the court shall set aside any amount of noneconomic damages in excess of the amount specified in section 1483.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cif\u201d in MCL 600.6098(1) suggests that the limitation on noneconomic damages does not always apply in an \u201caction alleging medical malpractice.\u201d This language supports the conclusion that the medical malpractice damages cap does not apply in wrongful death actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The majority claims that this section means that the cap is applicable only where the amount of a damage award exceeds the damages cap. It believes that the limitation does not apply if the jury award is less than the damages cap amount. I disagree. The cap is applicable even in that case. When it has not been necessary to reduce the award, the cap is unapplied, not inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The majority references cases in which, it says, this Court has applied other statutes to the wrongful death act. <em>Ante </em>at 165. See <em>Halloran v Bhan </em>470 Mich 572; 683 NW2d 129 (2004); <em>Grossman v </em>Brown, 470 Mich 593; 685 NW2d 198 (2004). This is accurate; however, the issue was not raised in those cases. The issue in <em>Halloran </em>and <em>Grossman </em>was not whether the statutes mentioned were properly applied to claims made under the wrongful death act. The parties in those cases raised questions involving medical malpractice expert witness\u2019s qualifications to testify. The parties did not question whether the statutes in question applied to the wrongful death act.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Likewise, contrary to the majority\u2019s characterization of <em>Solomon</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Rogers,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court did not <em>hold </em>\u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>other statutory and common-law limitations on the amount of damages apply to wrongful death actions.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 171. Again, those cases involved different issues. <em>Rogers </em>involved questions of governmental immunity, attorney misconduct, and various evidentiary claims. The only reference to wrongful death is in the factual background of the case. <em>Solomon </em>involved whether certain evidence was admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule. It also involved the application of the rescue doctrine. Again, reference to the wrongful death nature of the case is mentioned only in the factual background. While the Court assumed the application of these statutes, that is a far cry from deciding an issue raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Furthermore, whether the savings provision in the wrongful death act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> applies to medical practice actions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> has little bearing on whether the Legislature intended that the <em>damages cap </em>statute applies. The wrongful death act specifically references the relevant statute of limitations provision of the underlying claim. MCL 600.5852; <em>Waltz v Wyse, </em>469 Mich 642, 658-659; 677 NW2d 813 (2004) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The Legislature made no mention in the wrongful death act to there being a cap on damages available under it. No other act, including MCL 600.1483, makes the medical malpractice damages cap applicable to wrongful death actions. I conclude that the Legislature did not intend that the medical malpractice damages cap should be applied to wrongful death actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Therefore, the Court of Appeals analysis and decision regarding this issue should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b327-5\">CAVANAGH, J., concurred with KELLY, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-11\"> MCL 600.2922.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-12\"> The most recent amendment to the wrongful death act occurred in 2000.
