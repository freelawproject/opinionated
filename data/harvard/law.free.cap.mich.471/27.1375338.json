We hold that the Court of Appeals has improperly extended the doctrine, contrary to its original purpose, to include injuries to those involved in the performance of dangerous work. The purpose of the doctrine is to protect innocent third parties injured as a result of an inherently dangerous undertaking. Because plaintiff was an employee of an independent contractor rather than a third party, the doctrine does not apply in this case. We thus reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>I. UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Defendants Norman and Pauline Nielsen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> own and reside on a 130-acre farm in Leelanau County, Michigan. The land is used primarily to farm corn and operate a cherry orchard. A neighbor manages the cherry tree operation, and defendants are not involved in pruning or cutting the trees. Defendants hired an independent contractor, Charles Anderson, to fell and delimb small poplar trees and to clean up the tops of trees that a previous logger had left on the property. Anderson, an experienced timber cutter, had previously performed woodcutting for defendants. Under the arrangement between defendants and Anderson, Anderson would keep the tree tops for firewood and pay defendants for the poplar that he cut. The parties did not discuss how the felling and delimbing was to be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Anderson hired plaintiff Robert DeShambo to help him with the work on defendants\u2019 property. On plaintiffs first day of work, he was delimbing trees when he heard someone yelling. Plaintiff turned around and saw a tree falling toward him as Anderson felled it. The tree hit plaintiff on the shoulder and then struck some logs on the ground, causing one log to spin, strike him in the back, and pin him between the log and the fallen tree. The incident has left plaintiff paralyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Plaintiff filed a negligence action against defendants and Anderson, but subsequently dismissed his claims against Anderson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that defendants were liable for Anderson\u2019s negligence be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>cause timber cutting was an inherently dangerous activity. Defendants moved for summary disposition, arguing that plaintiff could not establish liability under any recognized exception to the general rule precluding the liability of a landowner for injuries that an independent contractor negligently causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The trial court granted summary disposition for defendants, ruling that logging was not an inherently dangerous activity and that defendants were not sophisticated landowners knowledgeable of the risks inherent in cutting timber. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that a question of fact existed regarding whether defendants reasonably anticipated the risks inherent in logging.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court reasoned that defendants had previously hired logging companies to conduct tree removals on their property and that defendant Norman Nielsen had admitted that logging was risky. The Court further stated that because plaintiff presented evidence of the hazardous elements of logging, the determination whether logging is inherently dangerous is a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We granted defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal, directing the parties to address \u201cwhether the \u2018inherently dangerous activity\u2019 doctrine has been appropriately extended beyond its original application to only third parties to extend liability to landowners and general contractors for injuries to <em>employees </em>of independent contractors doing dangerous work.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Whether the \u201cinherently dangerous activity\u201d doctrine has been properly extended to include injuries to employees of independent contractors who are injured while performing dangerous work is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo. Likewise, we review de novo a lower court\u2019s decision on a summary disposition motion. <em>Quality Products &amp; Concepts Co v Nagel Precision, Inc, </em>469 Mich 362, 364; 666 NW2d 251 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">It has been long established in Michigan that a person who hires an independent contractor is not liable for injuries that the contractor negligently causes. <em>Lake Superior Iron Co v Erickson, </em>39 Mich 492, 496 (1878); <em>DeForrest v Wright, </em>2 Mich 368, 370 (1852). Over time, exceptions to this general rule have developed, including the \u201cinherently dangerous activity\u201d doctrine. The class of persons protected under the doctrine has undergone a transformation since the doctrine\u2019s inception.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">A. APPLICATION OF THE <em>INHERENTLY DANGEROUS ACTIVITY DOCTRINE </em>TO THIRD PARTIES</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Early cases giving rise to the inherently dangerous activity doctrine limited the exception to injuries to third parties. In <em>Rogers v Parker, </em>159 Mich 278; 123 NW 1109 (1909), this Court first discussed an exception to the general rule of nonliability for damages caused to a third party by an independent contractor\u2019s performance of an act likely to do harm to that third party. The question before this Court was whether a landowner who employed an independent contractor to clear farmland was liable for damages to neighboring property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>resulting when a fire that the contractor had set spread to neighboring land. This Court resolved the issue on statutory grounds, but discussed in obiter dictum the common-law principles that would have applied, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">[T]he rule relieving the employer where the work has been committed to an independent contractor is subject to the well-established exceptions that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\u201cIf the thing to be done is in itself unlawful, or if it is <em>per se </em>a nuisance, or if it cannot be done without doing damage, he who causes it to be done by another, be the latter servant, agent, or independent contractor, is as much liable for injuries which may happen <em>to third persons </em>from the act done as though he had done the act in person. So it is the duty of every person who does in person, or causes to be done by another, an act which from its nature is liable, <em>unless precautions are taken, to do injury to others, to see to it that those precautions are taken, and he cannot escape this duty by turning the whole performance over to a contractor.\u201d [Id. </em>at 282-283 (citation omitted; some emphases added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In <em>Inglis v Millersburg Driving Ass\u2019n, </em>169 Mich 311; 136 NW 443 (1912), this Court elaborated on the above common-law exception. In that case, agents of the defendant association had set fires on fairgrounds property in the defendant\u2019s possession to clear it, and the fires spread to the plaintiffs adjoining land, causing damage. This Court held that the defendant was es-topped to argue that independent contractors, rather than the unincorporated association itself, were responsible for the damage, because it had not pleaded that defense or argued it at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 317-318. This Court opined in obiter dictum, however, that an exception would have applied to the general rule of nonliability of landowners for the actions of independent contractors. While this Court cited its decision in <em>Rogers </em>and various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>other formulations of the rule, perhaps the best articulation of the principle was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">\u201cThe doctrine of independent contractor, whereby one who lets work to be done by another, reserving no control over the performance of the work, is not liable to third persons for injuries resulting from negligence of the contractor or his servants, is subject to several important exceptions. One of these ... is where the employer is, from the nature and character of the work, under a duty to others to see that it is carefully performed. It cannot be better stated than in the language used by Cockburn, C.J., in <em>Bower v. Peate, </em>1 Q.B. Div. 321, 326, a leading and well-considered case. It is, \u2018that a man who orders a work to be executed, from which, in the natural course of things, injurious consequences <em>to his neighbor </em>must be expected to arise, unless means are adopted by which such consequences may be averted, is bound to see the doing of that which is necessary to prevent mischief, and cannot relieve himself of his responsibility by employing some one else\u2014 whether it be the contractor employed to do the work from which the danger arises, or some independent person \u2014 or to do what is necessary to prevent the act he has ordered done from becoming unlawful.\u2019. .. This does not abrogate the law as to independent contractor. It still leaves abundant room for its proper application. \u2018There is,\u2019 as stated by Cockburn, \u2018an obvious difference between committing work to a contractor to be executed, from which, if properly done, no injurious consequences can arise, and handing over to him work to be done from which mischievous consequences will arise unless precautionary measures are adopted.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u201cThe weight of reason and authority is to the effect that, where a party is under a duty <em>to the public, or third person, </em>to see that work he is about to do, or have done, is carefully performed, so as to avoid injury to others, he cannot, by letting it to a contractor, avoid his liability, in case it is negligently done to the injury of another.\u201d <em>Covington, etc., Bridge Co. v. Steinbrock &amp; Patrick, </em>61 Ohio St. 215 (55 N.E. 618 [1899], and cases cited. <em>[Inglis </em>at 320-321 (citations omitted; emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Thus, the above rule, which has come to be known as the \u201cinherently dangerous activity exception,\u201d is founded on the existence of a duty on behalf of the landowner, or employer of an independent contractor, and the duty must be of the type that is nondelegable. The employer or landowner must also be aware that the danger exists and that it necessarily involves danger to others. Notably, the type of danger contemplated by the <em>Inglis </em>Court was danger to <em>third parties </em>and not to those involved in the dangerous activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Over the next several decades, this Court reaffirmed that, under this doctrine, the landowner must itself owe some duty to the specific third party, that the negligent act that causes the injury cannot be collateral to the work contracted for, and that the injury that occurs must be reasonably expected by the landowner. See <em>Cary v Thomas, </em>345 Mich 616; 76 NW2d 817 (1956); <em>Barlow v Kreighoff Co, </em>310 Mich 195; 16 NW2d 715 (1944); <em>Grinnell v Carbide &amp; Carbon Chemicals Corp, </em>282 Mich 509; 276 NW 535 (1937); <em>Tillson v Consumers Power Co, </em>269 Mich 53; 256 NW 801 (1934); <em>Watkins v Gabriel Steel Co, </em>260 Mich 692; 245 NW 801 (1932); <em>Wight v H G Christman Co, </em>244 Mich 208; 221 NW 314 (1928). Notably, under this Court\u2019s precedent, the doctrine applied only to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">B. EXPANSION OF THE <em>INHERENTLY DANGEROUS ACTIVITY DOCTRINE </em>TO A CONTRACTOR\u2019S EMPLOYEES</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In <em>Vannoy v City of Warren, </em>15 Mich App 158; 166 NW2d 486 (1968), the Court of Appeals purported to expand the scope of the inherently dangerous activity doctrine to hold a landowner hable not to a third party, but to the estate of a deceased employee of an independent contractor. The Court expressly rejected the landowner\u2019s argument that the doctrine applied only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>third parties and not to the employees of an independent contractor engaged in the inherently dangerous activity. <em>Id. </em>at 164-165. The Court stated that limiting the exception to third persons \u201cviolate[d] the absolute character of the duty . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In <em>McDonough v Gen Motors Corp, </em>388 Mich 430; 201 NW2d 609 (1972), a plurality of this Court reversed a directed verdict for the defendant landowner, concluding that the inherently dangerous activity exception could be applied to impose liability on the owner for injuries to a subcontractor\u2019s employee. The plurality quoted Justice COOLEY\u2019s formulation of the rule that this Court cited in <em>Inglis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\"><em>\u201c \u2018If </em>I employ a contractor to do a job of work for me which, in the progress of its execution, obviously exposes others to unusual perils, I ought, I think, to be responsible, * * * for I cause acts to be done which naturally expose others to injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>[McDonough </em>at 438, quoting <em>Inglis, supra </em>at 319, quoting 2 Cooley Torts (3d ed), p 109.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Without explanation, the plurality assumed that the \u201cothers\u201d quoted above included the contractor\u2019s employees and not only third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Justice BRENNAN dissented,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> contending that the inherently dangerous activity exception protects \u201cstrangers\u201d and does not apply to \u201ca plaintiff who was himself actively engaged in the inherently dangerous activity.\u201d <em>McDonough </em>at 453. His dissent stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">The application of this well settled exception is clear in cases where the injured person is a <em>stranger </em>to the inherently dangerous activity. In <em>Inglis [supra], </em>the inherently dangerous activity was burning, and the plaintiff was a neighboring landowner; in <em>Grinnell [supra], </em>the danger was explosion, the plaintiff a purchaser of a stove; in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Watkins [supra], </em>the dangerous activity was elevated steel construction, the plaintiff a mason contractor; in <em>Olah v Katz, </em>234 Mich 112 [207 NW 892] (1926), the danger was an open pit, the plaintiff a neighboring child; in <em>Detroit v Corey, </em>9 Mich 165 (1861), the danger was an open ditch, the plaintiff a passer-by; in <em>Darmstaetter v Moynahan, </em>27 Mich 188 (1873), the danger was a wall of ice in the roadway, the plaintiff a sleigh rider; in <em>McWilliams v Detroit Central Mills Co, </em>31 Mich 274 (1875), the danger was a railroad switching operation, the plaintiff a passer-by.. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">Indeed, there are almost no cases which have come to notice in which the suit is brought by or on behalf of a plaintiff who was himself actively engaged in the inherently dangerous activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">Those few precedents which are cited seem to be founded upon other grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">[T]he rule of liability is designed to protect innocent third parties injured by the execution of an inherently dangerous undertaking. The rule is not designed, nor was it ever intended to benefit the contractor who undertakes the dangerous work, or his employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">Thus, if I employ a contractor to remove a tree stump from my yard by use of explosives, I am liable to my neighbor whose garage is damaged by the concussion. This is because it is I who have set the project in motion; it is I who have created the unusual peril; it is for my benefit that the explosives were used. As between myself and my neighbor, I ought not to be permitted to plead that it was the contractor\u2019s negligence and not my own which damaged his property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-10\">But if the contractor should blow up his own truck, I should not be liable. He is the expert in explosives and not me [sic], I had neither the legal right nor the capability to supervise his work. The same would be true if the contractor\u2019s workman had injured himself, or been injured by the carelessness of a fellow workman or the negligence of his employer. Neither the contractor nor his employees are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u201cothers\u201d, as contemplated in Cooley\u2019s statement of the rule. Indeed, they are privy to the contract which creates the peril.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">The mischief of today\u2019s decision is not its result, but its logic. One assumes that a company like General Motors has no want of access to expertise. It may well have safety engineers on its payroll far more knowledgeable about structural steel than the decedent\u2019s employer. But to predicate liability here on the <em>Inglis, Olah, Wight and Watkins </em>line of cases is to impose upon many, many other, less sophisticated defendants the same burden to attend to the safety of the employees of independent contractors. <em>[McDonough, supra </em>at 453-456.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In <em>Bosak v Hutchinson, </em>422 Mich 712, 724; 375 NW2d 333 (1985), this Court relied on <em>Vannoy </em>and <em>McDonough </em>for the proposition that the inherently dangerous activity exception has, on occasion, been applied to employees of contractors performing dangerous work. This Court did not provide further analysis of this issue, however, given its holding that assembling a crane after hours, the activity involved in that case, did not constitute a dangerous activity, but a routine construction activity. <em>Id. </em>at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Further, in <em>Justus v Swope, </em>184 Mich App 91; 457 NW2d 103 (1990), on which the trial court in the instant case relied, the Court of Appeals stated, \u201cThe inherently dangerous activity doctrine has, thus far, been found to impose liability in cases involving owners fully capable of recognizing the potential danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, citing <em>McDonough, Vannoy, </em>and others. The Court declined to impose liability on \u201cmere homeowners,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 96, for injuries that an employee of an independent contractor sustained while removing a dead tree from the homeowners\u2019 yard. The Court stated that it was unreasonable to expect the homeowners to be cognizant of the particular risks inherent in tree removal. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>97-98. Thus, the Court seemingly would have imposed liability if the homeowners had been aware of such risks. The Court opined that imposing liability in that case, however, was exactly the fear that Justice BRENNAN expressed in his dissent in <em>McDonough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">C. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The analysis in Justice BRENNAN\u2019s <em>McDonough </em>dissent is persuasive and consistent with the longstanding common-law principles discussed in our case law. When a landowner hires an independent contractor to perform work that poses a peculiar danger or risk of harm, it is reasonable to hold the landowner liable for harm <em>to third parties </em>that results from the activity. If an employee of the contractor, however, negligently injures himself or is injured by the negligence of a fellow employee, it is not reasonable to hold the landowner liable merely because the activity involved is inherently dangerous. As Justice BRENNAN recognized, the inherently dangerous activity doctrine was designed to protect third parties, not those actively involved in the dangerous activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The Restatement of Torts echoes the above principle. 2 Restatement of Torts, 2d, \u00a7 416 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">One who employs an independent contractor to do work which the employer should recognize as likely to create during its progress a peculiar risk of physical harm <em>to others </em>unless special precautions are taken, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to them by the failure of the contractor to exercise reasonable care to take such precautions, even though the employer has provided for such precautions in the contract or otherwise. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Similarly, 2 Restatement of Torts, 2d, \u00a7 427 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>One who employs an independent contractor to do work involving a special danger <em>to others </em>which the employer knows or has reason to know to be inherent in or normal to the work, or which he contemplates or has reason to contemplate when making the contract, is subject to liability for physical harm caused <em>to such others </em>by the contractor\u2019s failure to take reasonable precautions against such danger. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The text of the above provisions applies to \u201cothers.\u201d The term \u201cothers\u201d necessarily refers to persons other than those directly involved in the dangerous activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Moreover, all the illustrations in the Restatement pertaining to \u00a7\u00a7 416 and 427 involve injuries to innocent third parties and not to those directly involved in the activity. For example, the first illustration under \u00a7 416 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">1. A employs B, an independent contractor, to erect a building upon land abutting upon a public highway. The contract entrusts the whole work of erection to B, and contains a clause requiring the contractor to erect a sufficient fence around the excavations necessary for the erection of the building. It contains also a clause by which the contractor assumes all liability for any harm caused by his work. B digs the excavation but fails to erect a fence. In consequence, C, while walking along the highway at night, falls into the cellar and is hurt. A is subject to liability to C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">In the above illustration, C is an innocent third party and is not directly involved in the dangerous activity. Similarly, C in the following illustration under \u00a7 427 is an innocent third party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">3. A employs B, an independent contractor, to excavate a sewer in the street. B leaves the trench unguarded, without warning lights, and C drives his automobile into it in the dark. The danger is inherent in the work, and A is subject to liability to C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Although a plurality of this Court in <em>McDonough </em>cited \u00a7\u00a7 416 and 427 of the Restatement when discussing the inherently dangerous activity exception, the plurality failed to recognize that the term \u201cothers\u201d refers to third parties, and not to those persons involved in the dangerous activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Vannoy </em>improperly extended the inherently dangerous activity doctrine to include employees of independent contractors. We thus overrule the Court of Appeals holding in <em>Vannoy. </em>We also reject this Court\u2019s obiter dictum in <em>Bosak </em>to the extent that it approved of Vannoy\u2019s extension of the doctrine. As our longstanding precedent, before <em>McDonough, </em>and the Restatement make clear, the inherently dangerous activity exception is limited to third parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Further, as Justice BRENNAN recognized in <em>McDonough, </em>allowing liability to be imposed on landowners for injuries resulting to an independent contractor\u2019s employees will necessarily result in liability imposed not only on large corporations fully capable of assessing and providing safety precautions, but also on \u201cless sophisticated\u201d landowners who may be unaware of such dangers or unable to provide precautionary measures to avoid the inherent risk. Indeed, in many situations it may be the risk itself that prompts a landowner to hire an independent contractor in the first instance. A contractor who may specialize and routinely engage in the activity would likely be better able to perform the activity in a safe manner. Likewise, the contractor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>probably better able to implement reasonable safety precautions for the protection of its employees who perform the dangerous work, and this duty accordingly lies with the contractor. We thus adhere to the established common-law principle that this Court had consistently followed before <em>McDonough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Because the inherently dangerous activity exception does not apply when the injured party is an employee of an independent contractor rather than a third party, the exception does not apply in the instant case. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary disposition for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">We conclude that the inherently dangerous activity exception is limited to third parties and does not apply to employees of independent contractors injured while performing dangerous work. Because plaintiff was an employee of an independent contractor rather than a third party, the doctrine is inapplicable in this case. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-8\">Cavanagh, Weaver, Taylor, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with CORRIGAN, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\"> Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his claims against defendant Charles W Anderson.

An exception has been made where the landowner retained control of the job site and inherently hazardous activities were undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The Court holds today that a landowner is not liable for a contractor\u2019s negligence that injures the contractor\u2019s employee engaged in an inherently dangerous activity. <em>Ante </em>at 38. The Court adopts Justice BRENNAN\u2019s dissenting analysis in <em>McDonough v Gen </em>Motors<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and holds that the landowner has \u201c \u2018neither the legal right nor the capability to supervise [the independent contractor\u2019s] work.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 36, quoting <em>McDonough </em>at 456. The landowner here is not alleged to have retained control of the job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">As previously indicated, a landowner is liable to a contractor\u2019s employee if he retained control over hazardous work and was positioned to ensure that the contractor took adequate precautions. <em>Funk v General Motors Corp, </em>392 Mich 91, 105; 220 NW2d 641 (1974), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Hardy v Monsanto Enviro-Chem Systems, Inc, </em>414 Mich 29; 323 NW2d 270 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The retained control doctrine is a distinct theory of liability. It applies where the entity engaging the services of the independent contractor has the legal right and the capability to supervise the work. <em>Plummer v Bechtel Constr Co, </em>440 Mich 646, 659; 489 NW2d 66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>(1992) (opinion by Levin, J.). The doctrine is applicable regardless of whether the employer is a landowner or a general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">This case was argued and submitted together with <em>Ormsby v Capital Welding, Inc. </em>The Court in <em>Ormsby </em>holds that the retained control doctrine, applied to general contractors who utilize subcontractors, is merely an element of the common work area doctrine. It is not an independent theory of liability. <em>Ormsby </em>at 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">If <em>Ormsby </em>is held to apply to landowners, the decisions here and in <em>Ormsby, </em>read together, could have unfortunate unintended results in future cases. The inference to be drawn from them is this: a landowner who retains control of inherently dangerous work on a job site will not be liable for injuries to a contractor\u2019s employee unless the injury occurred in a common work area. The majority denies the validity of this inference. <em>Id. </em>at 60 n 13. However, the opinion\u2019s language strongly belies that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Under the tort-reform statutes, liability is almost always several only and not joint. MCL 600.2956. Legal liability is distinct from fault, although it is based on fault. Fault is determined by the trier of fact<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who assigns it, regardless of whether a party can be held legally liable. MCL 600.6304(1). However, an injured party can recover only from a party that can be held legally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Under the preceding tort-reform statutes, the trier of fact can assign fault to a landowner who has directed the actions of an independent contractor engaged in an inherently dangerous activity. The Court\u2019s opinions in <em>DeShambo </em>and <em>Ormsby </em>could be interpreted to hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>that such a negligent landowner could escape all liability for injury caused to the employee of his contractor. The landowner cannot be held liable under the inherently dangerous activity doctrine. <em>DeShambo. </em>Neither can he be held liable under the retained control doctrine. <em>Ormsby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">I believe that this result would be inconsistent with principles underlying the common law. Moreover, it would be inconsistent with the intent of the tort-reform statutes. A negligent actor is intended to be legally liable for his actions. The majority potentially undermines this principle with the holdings in these two cases. Absent language correcting this problem, the analysis in the majority opinion is unacceptable to me and I concur only in the result reached by the majority.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-9\"> I dissented from the decision in <em>Ormsby </em>on the ground that the inherently dangerous activity doctrine and the retained control doctrine are distinct theories of tort liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-10\"> <em>McDonough v Gen Motors Corp, </em>388 Mich 430; 201 NW2d 609 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\"> MCL 600.2957(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
