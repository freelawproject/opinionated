FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">On January 16, 1999, a get-together took place at the home of defendant Erick Limmer. Along with Limmer, the other defendants, Joshua Cole, Daniel Brayman, and Nicholas Holtschlag, were watching television, drinking alcohol, and smoking marijuana with three fourteen-year-old girls. At least one of the defendants put gamma hydroxybutrate or gamma hydroxybutyric acid (both known as GHB) in the girls\u2019 drinks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two of the girls became sick and, after several hours, were taken to the hospital. One of the girls, Samantha Reid, died. The other slipped into a coma but eventually recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Defendants Brayman, Holtschlag, and Cole were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and two counts each of mixing a harmful substance in a drink, which is a felony. Defendant Limmer was convicted of accessory after the fact to manslaughter, mixing a harmful substance in a drink, delivery or manufacture of marijuana, and possession of GHB.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Defendants appealed, the appeals were consolidated, and the Court of Appeals stated that to support an involuntary manslaughter conviction under a gross negligence theory, the prosecutor had to establish that defendants performed a <em>lawful </em>act in a grossly negligent manner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because mixing a harmful substance in the girls\u2019 drinks was an unlawful act that is a felony, the Court vacated the involuntary manslaughter convictions and accessory after the fact conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Determining the elements of common-law involuntary manslaughter is a question of law. We review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>questions of law de novo. <em>People v Riddle, </em>467 Mich 116, 124; 649 NW2d 30 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">There are primarily two issues to address in this case. The first concerns the defendants\u2019 contention that they cannot be convicted of involuntary manslaughter because the homicide at issue occurred during the commission of a felony and involuntary manslaughter, defendants argue, is, in part, defined by this Court as the killing of another during the commission of an unlawful act that is <em>not </em>a felony. The second issue concerns defendants\u2019 contention that to be convicted of involuntary manslaughter under a gross negligence theory, which was the theory under which the prosecutor proceeded at trial, the homicide must have occurred during the commission of a <em>lawful </em>act, and in this case it occurred during the commission of an unlawful (felonious) act.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">A. IS MANSLAUGHTER PRECLUDED BECAUSE OF A \u201cFELONY\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Regarding the first issue, some insight into the early common-law history of the crime of manslaughter and, particularly, its development alongside the felony-murder doctrine, is necessary. Under Lord Coke\u2019s traditional \u201cfelony-murder\u201d doctrine, a homicide that occurred during the commission of an unlawful act was \u201cmurder\u201d punishable by death. See <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672, 692; 299 NW2d 304 (1980), in which this Court thoroughly articulated the elusive history of the felony-murder doctrine. The premise behind the traditional felony-murder doctrine was the idea that the intention to perpetrate the unlawful act sufficiently showed the existence of malice aforethought \u2014 the req<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>uisite mens rea for murder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 717. This was considered true whatever the nature of the underlying crime may have been. <em>Id. </em>at 692. Lord Coke\u2019s traditional doctrine was heavily criticized for the harsh results it engendered, and it was severely limited even in early common-law history. <em>Id. </em>at 693-699. One of the earliest limitations on the traditional doctrine was limiting its application to those homicides that occurred during the commission of a felony or during the commission of an act that was intended to inflict great bodily injury. <em>Id. </em>at 696-697.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Additionally, in the early days of the English common law, the crime of \u201cmanslaughter\u201d was developed. The crime of manslaughter in Michigan is adopted from that early common-law crime. See <em>People v Datema, </em>448 Mich 585, 594; 533 NW2d 272 (1995): \u201c \u2018The law of manslaughter as it exists today has been adopted from the old English common law.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) Whereas, as noted above, malice is the mens rea required for murder, manslaughter requires a less culpable mens rea. \u201c \u2018Manslaughter is the unlawful and felonious killing of another without malice, either express or implied.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Austin, </em>221 Mich 635, 643; 192 NW 590 (1923) (citation omitted). Involuntary manslaughter has, first and foremost, always been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>considered the \u201ccatch-all\u201d homicide crime. Thus, in <em>Datema, supra </em>at 594-595, we explained, quoting Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed), p 105, that \u201c[i]nvoluntary manslaughter is a catch-all concept including all manslaughter not characterized as voluntary: \u2018Every unintentional killing of a human being is involuntary manslaughter if it is neither murder nor voluntary manslaughter nor within the scope of some recognized justification or excuse.\u2019 \u201d Thus, the catch-all crime of involuntary manslaughter is typically characterized in terms of what it is <em>not, </em>and ascertaining whether a homicide is involuntary manslaughter requires essentially questioning first whether it is murder, voluntary manslaughter, or a justified or excused homicide. If it is none of those, then the homicide, generally, is involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In attempting to describe the catch-all crime of involuntary manslaughter in terms of what it <em>is, </em>as opposed to what it is <em>not, </em>it made sense, starting in the days of early common law, to refer to those homicides that occurred during the commission of an unlawful act that was not intended to cause great bodily injury. This is because, as already explained, under traditional common law, a homicide that occurred during the commission of an unlawful act that was intended to cause great bodily injury constituted murder. Thus, as early as 1886, this Court elucidated the difference between murder and manslaughter in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">If an act is unlawful, or is such as duty does not demand, and of a tendency directly dangerous to life, however unintended, it will be murder. But if the act, though dangerous, is not directly so [i.e., is not directly dangerous to life], yet sufficiently dangerous to come under condemnation of the law [i.e., yet it is unlawful], and death unintended results from it, the offense is manslaughter; or if it is one of a nature to be lawful properly performed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>it is performed improperly, and death comes from it unexpectedly, the offense still is manslaughter. <em>[People v Stubenvoll, </em>62 Mich 329, 340; 28 NW 883 (1886) (quoting 2 Bishop, Criminal Law, \u00a7 689).][<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In 1923, in recognition of the felony-murder doctrine, which was by then widely accepted, this Court presented a somewhat modified version of <em>Stubenvoll\u2019s </em>manslaughter characterization, stating that manslaughter is \u201c \u2018the killing of another without malice and unintentionally, but in doing some unlawful act not amounting to a felony nor naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm, or in negligently doing some act lawful in itself, or by the negligent omission to perform a legal duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Ryczek, </em>224 Mich 106, 110; 194 NW 609 (1923) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Until this Court issued <em>Aaron, Ryczek\u2019s </em>description of the catch-all crime of involuntary manslaughter as consisting of those homicides occurring without malice and unintentionally, but in doing some unlawful act not amounting to a felony nor naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm, was more or less apt. This is because, generally, a homicide that occurred with malice or intentionally or in committing a felony or in committing an unlawful act naturally tending to cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>death constituted murder. However, in <em>Aaron, </em>we formally abolished the traditional felony-murder doctrine in Michigan and held that a homicide that occurred during the commission of any crime, including a felony, constitutes murder only if the prosecutor specifically proves the existence of malice. <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 727-728. In other words, we held that the intent to commit the underlying felony by itself no longer sufficiently shows the existence of malice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Since this Court\u2019s 1980 abrogation of the common-law felony-murder rule in <em>Aaron, </em>it is no longer the case that a homicide that occurs during the commission of a felony is, generally, murder per se and, thus, it is no longer apt to describe the catch-all crime of involuntary manslaughter as encompassing crimes that occur during the commission of an unlawful act that is not a felony. However, the premise of the <em>Aaron </em>decision was the rule that a crime is only murder if the prosecutor proves malice. We stated in <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 726-727, \u201c \u2018Both murder and manslaughter deal with the wrongful killing of another person.... To hold that in all cases it is murder if a killing occurs in the commission of any felony would take from the jury the essential question of malice.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>\u201cIf </em>the jury concludes that malice existed, they can find murder----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730 (emphasis added). Thus, <em>Aaron </em>relied on the long-standing principle that the distinguishing characteristic between murder and manslaughter is malice. This point was made by this Court as long ago as 1923, when we stated, \u201c[h]omicide is the killing of a human being by a human being. It... is either murder or manslaughter .... To constitute murder, the killing must have been perpetrated with malice aforethought, either express or implied.\u201d <em>Austen, supra </em>at 644. \u201c \u2018Manslaughter is the unlawful and felonious killing of another without malice, either express or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>implied. \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 643 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This point was recently reiterated by this Court in <em>People v Mendoza, </em>468 Mich 527, 536; 664 NW2d 685 (2003), in which we stated, \u201cthe <em>sole element </em>distinguishing manslaughter and murder is malice.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Thus, it becomes clear that any <em>post-Aaron </em>deficiency in <em>Ryczek\u2019s </em>description of involuntary manslaughter is not that the description fails now to expressly reference unlawful acts that <em>are </em>felonies, but rather that the description continues to reference unlawful acts that are <em>not </em>felonies. This is because the relevant question in determining whether a homicide is murder or involuntary manslaughter is whether it occurred with malice, and not whether it occurred during the commission of an unlawful act \u2014 felony or not. For this reason, defendants cannot opportunistically rely on <em>Ryczek\u2019s </em>preAaron description of the catch-all crime of involuntary manslaughter to argue that, because the homicide at issue occurred during the commission of a felony, they cannot be guilty of manslaughter. That a \u201cfelony\u201d has been committed is simply not dispositive in determining whether either \u201cmurder\u201d or \u201cmanslaughter\u201d has been committed and, thus, the \u201cfelony\u201d language in <em>Ryczek\u2019s </em>manslaughter description is essentially irrelevant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Defendants argue that, if we hold that a homicide that occurs during the commission of a felony may constitute manslaughter, we nonetheless may not apply the holding in this case because to do so would violate the constitutional provision against ex post facto laws. See US Const, art I, \u00a7 10, cl 1: \u201cNo State shall.. . pass any... ex post facto Law . . . .\u201d In <em>Bouie v Columbia, </em>378 US 347, 353; 84 S Ct 1697; 12 L Ed 2d 894 (1964), the United States Supreme Court explained that an ex post facto law is one \u201c \u2018that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action ....\u2019\u201d (Citation omitted.) We disagree with defendants because a homicide committed during the course of a felony could never have been considered an \u201cinnocent\u201d homicide merely because it occurred during the commission of a felony. On the contrary, espousing the defendants\u2019 argument in this case \u2014 that a homicide that occurs during the course of a felony cannot, as a matter of law, be manslaughter \u2014 leads to the conclusion then that the homicide (unless justified or excused) is instead murder. It <em>does not </em>lead to a conclusion that the homicide is innocent, i.e., a non offense. Thus, our decision in this case does not criminalize that which was, before this decision, \u201cinnocent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Moreover, <em>Ryczek\u2019s </em>description of involuntary manslaughter was never meant to define the <em>elements </em>of the crime of manslaughter. Rather, it was meant to provide guidance to the courts in understanding the circumstances under which the catch-all crime of manslaughter may occur. Therefore, it has never been held by this Court that the prosecutor must specifically prove that the homicide occurred during the commission of an unlawful act that was <em>not </em>a felony in order to prove a manslaughter charge. On the contrary, this Court has implicitly and expressly recognized in a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>cases, some decided even before <em>Aaron, </em>that while a homicide occurring during the commission of a felony could (pursuant to the felony-murder doctrine) constitute murder, the homicide also could constitute manslaughter \u2014 this despite the \u201cfelony\u201d language in <em>Ryczek\u2019s </em>manslaughter description that, during the <em>pre-Aaron </em>days, actually had significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In <em>People v Pavlic, </em>227 Mich 562; 199 NW 373 (1924), this Court considered whether a defendant could be convicted of manslaughter for a homicide that resulted from the commission of a felony. In <em>Pavlic, </em>a man died after drinking liquor sold by the defendant. At the time, selling intoxicating liquor was a felony. Notwithstanding the description of involuntary manslaughter given by this Court in <em>Ryczek </em>just one year before \u2014 which description, as noted, refers to manslaughter as \u201c \u2018the killing of another ... in doing some unlawful act not amounting to a felony,\u2019 \u201d <em>Ryczek, supra </em>at 110 (citation <em>omitted) </em>\u2014 Pavlic held that the homicide at issue could \u201cconstitute manslaughter if performed under such circumstances as to supply the intent to do wrong and inflict some bodily injury.\u201d <em>Pavlic, supra </em>at 566. The reason the <em>Pavlic </em>Court so held was because selling intoxicating liquor is only a \u201cmalum prohibitum\u201d felony and not a \u201cmalum in se\u201d felony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 566-567. This may appear to be grounds to distinguish <em>Pavlic </em>from this case, but the essential point is that <em>Pavlic </em>recognized that a homicide occurring during the commission of a \u201cfelony\u201d could be manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Moreover, in so holding, the <em>Pavlic </em>Court noted that the important consideration in determining whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>homicide is murder or simply manslaughter in \u201cfelony\u201d cases is whether the felony is one that is \u201cin itself directly and naturally dangerous to life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565. The implication is that the <em>Pavlic </em>Court understood that the important question is whether the defendant acted with malice. If the defendant committed a felony that is directly and naturally dangerous to life, then he acted with malice and, therefore, could be convicted of murder. If not, then a manslaughter conviction might be proper. Thus, even in 1924, one year after <em>Ryczek </em>and fifty-six years before <em>Aaron, </em>this Court impliedly acknowledged that, despite the commission of a felony and the \u201cfelony\u201d language in <em>Ryczek, </em>the distinguishing element between murder and manslaughter is malice and, therefore, the killing of another in doing some unlawful act that amounts to a felony <em>may </em>constitute manslaughter rather than murder, depending on the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In <em>People v Treichel, </em>229 Mich 303; 200 NW 950 (1924), an elderly gentleman was tied to a bed during the commission of a robbery. He was eventually found dead, and the suspects were charged with first- and second-degree murder and manslaughter and were convicted of manslaughter. The defendants appealed, arguing that they should have been charged only with first-degree murder because the death \u201cwas occasioned by act committed in the perpetration of a burglary... .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308. The defendants contended that they should have been either convicted of first-degree murder or acquitted, much as the instant defendants seem to be arguing. The <em>Treichel </em>Court, in affirming the defendants\u2019 manslaughter convictions, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">Conceding the verdict might have been for murder in the first degree, because death was occasioned by act committed in the perpetration of a burglary, was such a verdict the only one permissible? We cannot so hold. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>think the evidence left the question of degree and the included crime of manslaughter to the jury and the court avoided instead of committed error in so submitting it. <em>[.Id].</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Thus, in <em>Treichel, </em>again just one year after <em>Ryczek, </em>this Court affirmed a manslaughter conviction for a homicide that occurred during the commission of a felony despite the \u201cfelony\u201d language in <em>Ryczek. </em>Presumably, if the Court intended to preclude such convictions by virtue of <em>Ryczek\u2019s </em>\u201cfelony\u201d language, it would not have affirmed the convictions in <em>Treichel, </em>but, instead, would have agreed with the defendants that they should have been either convicted of first-degree murder or acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In <em>People v Andrus, </em>331 Mich 535; 50 NW2d 310 (1951), the defendants burglarized a store and, while doing so, inflicted severe wounds on the owner of the store, who eventually died. As in <em>Treichel, </em>the defendants were charged with first- and second-degree murder and manslaughter and were convicted of manslaughter. The defendants appealed, arguing that the manslaughter charge and convictions constituted error. Again, despite the \u201cfelony\u201d language of <em>Ryczek </em>and the felony-murder doctrine, this Court affirmed the manslaughter convictions in <em>Andrus. </em>In doing so, the Court acknowledged that the pivotal issue is the existence of malice: \u201c[Wjhere there is testimony from which the jury might find the absence of such a felonious intent as is necessary to constitute murder [i.e., malice], an instruction that they might convict of manslaughter should be given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In <em>People v Carter, </em>387 Mich 397; 197 NW2d 57 (1972), the defendants stole a car in order to rob a bank and, in doing so, put the owner of the car in its trunk. The victim died as a result, and all three defendants were convicted of first-degree murder. In that case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>defendants appealed, arguing that the jury should have been instructed on manslaughter as well as murder. This Court, notwithstanding the \u201cfelony\u201d language in <em>Ryczek, </em>agreed, vacated the defendants\u2019 convictions, and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Simply put, case law demonstrates that the \u201cfelony\u201d language in <em>Ryczek\u2019s </em>description of manslaughter does not have the meaning ascribed to it that defendants would like to have. That is, this language does not mean, as was impliedly acknowledged as long ago as 1924 and was impliedly reaffirmed as recently as 2003, that a defendant may not be convicted of manslaughter if the homicide occurred during the commission of a felony. The pertinent question in distinguishing manslaughter from murder is, as was made absolutely clear in <em>Mendoza, </em>whether the defendant acted with malice. If not, then a manslaughter conviction may be proper despite the fact that the death resulted from the commission of an underlying felony. We believe that, in light of the long history of relevant case law and the fact that the homicide in question would never have been an \u201cinnocent\u201d homicide, there is no ex post facto violation in affirming Limmer\u2019s conviction of accessory after the fact to involuntary manslaughter and the remaining defendants\u2019 involuntary manslaughter convictions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>B. UNLAWFUL-ACT MANSLAUGHTER AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Defendants likewise argue that their convictions of manslaughter cannot be sustained because \u201cgross negligence\u201d manslaughter, which is the mens rea that the prosecutor in this case argued that defendants possessed, requires that a lawful act have been committed, whereas the act committed in this case, pouring GHB into Samantha Reid\u2019s drink, was clearly unlawful. In support of this contention, defendants again refer to <em>Ryczek, </em>wherein this Court described manslaughter as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">[the killing of another without malice and unintentionally, but in doing some unlawful act not amounting to a felony nor naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm, <em>or in negligently doing some act lawful in itself, </em>or by the negligent omission to perform a legal duty. <em>[Ryczek, supra </em>at 110, citation omitted, emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Defendants\u2019 argument has no merit. In <em>Datema, supra </em>at 596, this Court explained that <em>Ryczek </em>\u201csets forth three different theories giving rise to involuntary manslaughter liability. These theories are not mutually exclusive, and, under the proper circumstances, multiple theories may be appropriate.\u201d Thus, it is possible to determine, on the basis of the specific facts at issue, that the act committed by the defendant that resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>in death was, for instance, not only unlawful, but also committed with a mens rea of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In <em>People v Townsend, </em>214 Mich 267, 273-274; 183 NW 177 (1921), this Court provided some early guidance regarding the proofs necessary to demonstrate the \u201cunlawful-act\u201d theory of involuntary manslaughter and the \u201clawful-act\u201d theory. <em>Townsend </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">The distinction between involuntary manslaughter committed while perpetrating an unlawful act not amounting to a felony and the offense arising out of some negligence or fault in doing a lawful act in a grossly negligent manner and from which death results must be kept in mind upon the question of pleading. In the former case it is sufficient to allege the unlawful act with sufficient particularity to identify it and then to charge that as a consequence the defendant caused the death of the deceased, and there is no need to aver in detail the specific acts of the accused; but in case of manslaughter committed through gross or culpable negligence while doing a lawful act the duty which was neglected or improperly performed must be charged as well as the acts of the accused constituting failure to perform or improper performance. <em>[Id. </em>at 273-274.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">This statement in <em>Townsend </em>essentially means that if the defendant committed an <em>unlawful </em>act that resulted in death, it is sufficient to allege the commission of the unlawful act and the resulting death; whereas, if the defendant committed a lawful act resulting in death, the prosecutor must specifically allege the manner in which the defendant\u2019s actions were grossly or culpably negligent. That is, under <em>Townsend, </em>lawful-act manslaughter requires that the defendant acted with a mens rea of culpable negligence; whereas unlawful-act manslaughter does not require that the defendant acted with a specific mens rea \u2014 all that is required is that the defendant committed the unlawful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>In <em>Pavlic, </em>this Court considered, as noted above, whether a defendant can be convicted of involuntary manslaughter for a death resulting after the defendant committed the unlawful act of selling intoxicating liquor. The Court explained that a manslaughter conviction may be appropriate, but that, because this unlawful act is only malum prohibitum rather than malum in se, it is only appropriate if the prosecutor specifically proves that the defendant acted with a culpable mens rea. The Court essentially equated malum prohibitum unlawful acts with lawful acts, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">The act of selling or furnishing intoxicating liquor in violation of the statute is what the law terms an act <em>malum prohibitum, </em>a crime existing only by reason of statutory prohibition. An unlawful act of this character which unintentionally causes the death of another, is not in itself a sufficient basis for a charge of involuntary manslaughter.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] But the commission of such an [malum prohibitum] unlawful act will constitute manslaughter if performed under such circumstances as to supply the intent to do wrong and inflict some bodily injury. ... The rule is well stated in <em>Thiede v. State, </em>106 Neb 48 (182 N.W 570 [1921]), as follows: \u201cWe believe the rule to be that though the act made unlawful by statute is an act merely <em>malum prohibitum </em>and is ordinarily insufficient, still when such an act is accompanied by negligence or further wrong so as to be in its nature, dangerous, or as to manifest a reckless disregard for the safety of others, then it may be sufficient to supply the wrongful intent essential to criminal homicide [and] when such an act results in the death of another, may constitute involuntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>[Pavlic, supra </em>at 566.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Thus, similar to <em>Townsend, </em>what may be gleaned from <em>Pavlic </em>is that, traditionally, commission of a malum in se unlawful act that results in an unintended death is sufficient in itself to constitute manslaughter; whereas an unintended death resulting from either a lawful act or a malum prohibitum unlawful act requires specific proof of a culpable mens rea, which may consist of an intent to inflict bodily injury or of gross negligence showing a reckless disregard for the safety of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In a more recent case, <em>Datema, </em>this Court again addressed the mens rea necessary to sustain a manslaughter conviction. Citing <em>Pavlic, </em>we held that where an act is malum prohibitum unlawful or lawful, a mens rea of \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d is required to prove manslaughter, and this requirement is met if the defendant <em>either </em>intended to inflict some bodily injury on another <em>or </em>if the defendant acted carelessly in such a manner that manifests a reckless disregard for another\u2019s life-that is, if the defendant acted with gross negligence. <em>Datema, supra </em>at 598-599. \u201cGross negligence is only necessary if an intent to injure cannot be established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Regarding malum in se unlawful-act manslaughter, <em>Datema </em>first noted that under traditional common law (as expressed in <em>Townsend </em>and Pavlic), \u201c[w]hen an unintentional killing occurred during the commission of [a malum in se unlawful] act . . , the commission of the underlying malum in se [act] supplied the mens rea for involuntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599-600. Further, <em>Datema </em>noted that \u201c[u]nlike the second and third theories of involuntary manslaughter liability, the [unlawful act] rule does not require negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The defendant in <em>Datema </em>argued that, just as <em>Aaron </em>held that proof that a defendant committed the underlying felony is no longer sufficient to show malice and thus constitute murder, proof that the defendant committed the underlying malum in se unlawful act should no longer \u201cin itself\u201d be sufficient to constitute manslaughter. We declined to address this issue in <em>Datema </em>because the unlawful act that the defendant committed, assault and battery, itself showed that the defendant acted with a specific intent to injure and, thus, the defendant acted with a culpable manslaughter mens rea. Thus, <em>Datema </em>concluded that the defendant was properly convicted of involuntary manslaughter because \u201c[a]n unlawful act committed with the intent to injure or in a grossly negligent manner that proximately causes death is involuntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We, too, need not consider whether the prosecutor was <em>required </em>in this case to specifically prove that defendants acted with a culpable mens rea or whether proof that defendants committed the malum in se unlawful act itself furnishes a sufficient mens rea for involuntary manslaughter<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because, in either case, the prosecutor did prove that defendants acted with a culpable mens rea of gross negligence. Pursuant to <em>Datema, </em>if the prosecutor proves that defendants committed \u201c[a]n unlawful act. . . with the intent to injure <em>or in a grossly negligent manner </em>that proximately cause[d] death,\u201d <em>id., </em>an involuntary manslaughter conviction may be appropriate. Therefore, the prosecutor did not err in proceeding under a gross negligence theory. Moreover, it is apparent that, at the very least, the prosecutor sufficiently proved its case. Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>may not seek relief on the basis that the prosecutor may have \u201cover-proved\u201d its case by demonstrating that defendants acted with a mens rea of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">To summarize, the language in <em>Ryczek </em>regarding the commission of an \u201cunlawful act not amounting to a felony\u201d does not mean that a defendant may not be convicted of involuntary manslaughter for an unintentional death resulting from the commission of a felony. Disregarding the reference to an \u201cunlawful act not amounting to a felony,\u201d <em>Ryczek\u2019s </em>description of involuntary manslaughter remains a useful tool in discerning the circumstances under which involuntary manslaughter may occur. However, we emphasize that <em>Ryczek\u2019s </em>description is just that \u2014 a useful tool, and not a definitive statement regarding the elements of involuntary manslaughter. More importantly, it must be kept in mind that \u201cthe sole element distinguishing manslaughter and murder is malice,\u201d <em>Mendoza </em>at 536, and that \u201c[ijnvoluntary manslaughter is a catch-all concept including all manslaughter not characterized as voluntary: \u2018Every unintentional killing of a human being is involuntary manslaughter if it is neither murder nor voluntary manslaughter nor within the scope of some recognized justification or excuse.\u2019 \u201d <em>Datema, supra </em>at 594-595. (Citation omitted.) If a homicide is not voluntary manslaughter or excused or justified, it is, generally, either murder or involuntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If the homicide was committed with malice, it is murder.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If it was committed with a lesser mens rea of gross negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>or an intent to injure, and not malice, it is not murder, but only involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Defendants in this case purposefully committed a malum in se unlawful act when they poured GHB into Samantha Reid\u2019s drink and, in doing so, caused her death. Her death was not voluntary manslaughter or excused or justified. Whether or not defendants acted with malice, the jury found, in either case, that they acted with a diminished mens rea of gross negligence sufficient to sustain a conviction of manslaughter. In short, defendants, by their purposeful, willful, reckless, and unlawful behavior, unintentionally killed another person, and this is exactly the type of homicide that fits within the parameters of involuntary manslaughter. Therefore, we overrule the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant Limmer\u2019s conviction of accessory after the fact to involuntary manslaughter and the remaining defendants\u2019 involuntary manslaughter convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-6\">Corrigan, C.J., and Weaver, Taylor, and Young, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-10\"> Ghb is sometimes known as the \u201cdate rape drug.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-11\"> Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued March 27, 2003 (Docket Nos. 226715, 227941, 227942, and 241661).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\"> \u201cMens rea\u201d is a term of art referring to the \u201cstate of mind that the prosecutor, to secure a conviction, must prove that a defendant had when committing a crime.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th ed). \u201cMalice\u201d is defined as: \u201c1.

In any case, the Court in <em>Stubenvoll </em>recognized the necessity to prove malice in order to convict of murder. <em>Stubenvoll, supra </em>at 332. Thus, it is apparent that by holding that a homicide occurring during the commission of an unlawful act that directly tends to cause death is murder, the Court was, in effect, acknowledging that the existence of malice is sufficiently demonstrated if the defendant commits an unlawful act that tends to directly cause danger to human life.

Thus, we held in <em>Mendoza </em>that if a defendant is charged with murder, the jury, upon the defendant\u2019s request, must also be instructed on manslaughter if a rational view of the evidence supports such an instruction. <em>Id. </em>Defendants attempt to explain their position under <em>Mendoza </em>by arguing that, because <em>Ryczek </em>refers to unlawful acts that are not felonies, a rational view of the evidence will never support an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>instruction on manslaughter in a case based on the commission of a felony. However, the \u201crational view of the evidence\u201d proviso in <em>Mendoza </em>concerns whether the facts of the specific case rationally fit within the legal purview of manslaughter \u2014 the language is not meant to nullify <em>Mendoza\u2019s </em>statement concerning the legal elements of manslaughter: i.e., that \u201cthe sole element distinguishing manslaughter and murder is malice\u201d and that manslaughter is an unintended homicide with a diminished mens rea. <em>Mendoza, supra </em>at 536, 541. Accordingly, as clearly explained in <em>Mendoza, </em>determining whether a rational view of the evidence may support a manslaughter conviction requires considering whether a rational jury could conclude that the defendant did not act with malice, and not whether death resulted from the commission of a felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\"> The corollary of this assertion is that an unlawful act which is not malum prohibitum, but is rather malum in se, is \u201cin itself\u201d a sufficient basis for a charge of involuntary manslaughter. This is essentially the position taken in <em>Townsend, supra, </em>that (malum in se) unlawful-act manslaughter does not require that defendant acted with a specific mens rea \u2014 all that is required is that defendant committed the (malum in se) unlawful act and that death resulted therefrom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> Thus, in fact, <em>Datema </em>makes clear that it is not the case, as defendants seem to assert, that lawful-act manslaughter <em>requires </em>that the prosecutor prove that the defendant acted with \u201cgross negligence.\u201d The prosecutor may prove lawful-act manslaughter by demonstrating that the defendant acted with either gross negligence or with an intent to injure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"> We note, however, that were we to hold that the prosecutor was not required to specifically prove a mens rea, defendants would not be entitled to relief on the basis that the prosecutor, in proving a mens rea of gross negligence, proved more than was required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\"> Statutory exceptions to the common-law catch-all crime of manslaughter exist.

Unlike the majority, I believe that a defendant can be convicted of involuntary manslaughter when the committed act is a felony, but only when the felony does not naturally tend to cause death or great bodily harm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The manslaughter statute, MCL 750.321, provides the following: \u201cAny person who shall commit the crime of manslaughter shall be guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison, not more than 15 years or by fine of not more than 7,500 dollars, or both, at the discretion of the court.\u201d No distinction is made in the statute between voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Because the statute at issue, MCL 750.321, does not define manslaughter, the common-law definition must be used. <em>People v Townes, </em>391 Mich 578, 588; 218 NW2d 136 (1974). Involuntary manslaughter is defined as \u201c \u2018the killing of another without malice and unintentionally, but in doing some unlawful act not amounting to a felony nor naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm, or in negligently doing some act lawful in itself, or by the negligent omission to perform a legal duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Herron, </em>464 Mich 593, 604; 628 NW2d 528 (2001), quoting <em>People v Ryczek, </em>224 Mich 106, 110; 194 NW 609 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s claim that this Court did not provide a definition in <em>Ryczek </em>but merely offered \u201cguidance\u201d and \u201ca useful tool. \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 11, 21. I find this claim to be disingenuous. This Court <em>in Ryczek, supra </em>at 109, stated that the term \u201cinvoluntary manslaughter\u201d is \u201cwell defined\u201d and then went on to provide the definition. This Court in <em>Herron, supra </em>at 604, stated that \u201cthe <em>definition </em>[of involuntary manslaughter] is left to the common law. . . . This Court has <em>defined </em>the common-law offense of involuntary manslaughter as . ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Further, in <em>Townes, supra </em>at 590, this Court similarly stated that in <em>Ryczek, </em>\u201cthe Court approved the following <em>definition of </em>involuntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>manslaughter ...(Emphasis added.) While the majority now chooses to characterize the definition as a descriptive tool, I believe it is clear that the <em>Ryczek </em>definition is, in fact, a definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">I believe a proper reading of the definition of involuntary manslaughter dictates that a person cannot be convicted of involuntary manslaughter when he commits a felony that naturally tends to cause death or great bodily harm. If the defendant commits a felony that does not naturally tend to cause death or great bodily harm, such as larceny of an ornamental tree, MCL 750.367, he can be convicted of involuntary manslaughter if death to a person results. This conclusion is consistent with this Court\u2019s prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">This Court has previously rejected the argument that a defendant cannot be convicted of involuntary manslaughter merely because the act committed was a felony. See, e.g., <em>People v Carter, </em>387 Mich 397, 422; 197 NW2d 57 (1972); <em>People v Pavlic, </em>227 Mich 562, 565-567; 199 NW 373 (1924). In <em>Pavlic, </em>a man died after drinking liquor sold by the defendant. At the time, selling intoxicating liquor was a felony. This Court stated that violating the liquor law is only criminal because it is prohibited by statute; it is a malum prohibitum act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIt is not inherently criminal. Notwithstanding the fact that the statute has declared it to be a felony it is an act not in itself directly and naturally dangerous to life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565. The commission of a malum prohibitum act \u201cwill constitute manslaughter if performed under such circumstances as to supply the intent to do wrong and inflict some bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>566. Selling intoxicating liquor was insufficient to support the manslaughter conviction in <em>Pavlic </em>because the defendant did not possess an intent to inflict injury or a reckless disregard for the safety of the victim. However, if the circumstances had been different, for example, if the liquor had contained certain poisonous ingredients that the defendant had known about, the defendant would have been guilty of involuntary manslaughter. <em>Id. </em>at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">My reasoning is consistent with past opinions and orders of this Court, and does not require a finding, as the majority now does, that this Court\u2019s order in <em>People v Rode, </em>449 Mich 912 (1995), was impliedly overruled by this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>People v Mendoza, </em>468 Mich 527, 534; 664 NW2d 685 (2003). In <em>Rode, </em>this Court\u2019s order peremptorily reinstated the defendant\u2019s convictions of second-degree murder and felony-firearm possession on the basis of the reasoning of the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals. The dissenting judge argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">Because shooting at the other vehicle full of people was \u201can unlawful act\u201d amounting to \u201ca felony and would naturally tend to cause death or great bodily harm,\u201d it was not conduct within the definition of involuntary manslaughter for a killing committed \u201cin doing some unlawful act <em>not amounting to a felony nor naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm ....\u201d [Rode, supra </em>at 914 (Levin, J., dissenting, citing Jansen, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part, unpublished opinion per curiam, issued March 3, 1995 [Docket No. 179942]).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In essence, this Court adopted the dissenting judge\u2019s statement that shooting at a car full of people is not involuntary manslaughter because that act constitutes a felony that would naturally tend to cause death or great bodily harm. Further, in <em>Datema, supra </em>at 597, this Court stated, \u201cwhere a defendant commits an unlawful act that is malum prohibitum or a lawful act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>executed negligently that causes death, involuntary manslaughter may be premised on criminal negligence.\u201d While this Court was considering the misdemeanor-manslaughter rule in <em>Datema, </em>the general principles articulated are relevant to the issue at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Finally, the underlying felony in this case \u2014 mixing a harmful substance in a drink \u2014 does not naturally tend to cause death or great bodily harm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There are numerous harmful substances that could be mixed into a drink that would not naturally lead to death or great bodily harm. Unfortunately, GHB (gamma hydroxybutrate) was mixed in the girls\u2019 drinks in amounts that led to one girl\u2019s death, but that does not mean that defendants\u2019 underlying felony is one that naturally tends to cause death or great bodily harm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, I believe that the prosecutor had to specifically allege and prove, as he did, that defendants were grossly negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Therefore, while I agree with the result reached by the majority, I disagree with the majority\u2019s rationale. Accordingly, I concur in the result only.</p>\n<judges id=\"b172-7\">KELLY, J., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\"> Although I still believe that \u201c[g]ross negligence should be recognized as the mens rea standard for all common-law forms of involuntary manslaughter,\u201d as expressed in my dissent in <em>People v Datema, </em>448 Mich 585, 609; 533 NW2d 272 (1995), this interpretation of the law was not shared by a majority of this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\"> \u201cThere is but one offense of manslaughter in this State.\u201d <em>People v Rogulski, </em>181 Mich 481, 494; 148 NW 189 (1914).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\"> \u201cAn act is malum prohibitum if it is an \u2018act which, is not inherently immoral, but becomes so because its commission is expressly forbidden by positive law <em>Datema, supra </em>at 597 n 13, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th ed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b172-8\"> MCL 750.436(1) states, in pertinent part, \u201cA person shall not...
