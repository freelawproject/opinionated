In this case, Wayne County would use the power of eminent domain to condemn defendants\u2019 real properties for the construction of a 1,300-acre business and technology park. This proposed commercial center is intended to reinvigorate the struggling economy of southeastern Michigan by attracting businesses, particularly those involved in developing new technologies, to the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Defendants argue that this exercise of the power of eminent domain is neither authorized by statute nor permitted under article 10 of the 1963 Michigan Constitution, which requires that any condemnation of private property advance a \u201cpublic use.\u201d Both the Wayne Circuit Court and the Court of Appeals rejected these arguments \u2014 compelled, in no small measure, by this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Poletown Neighborhood Council v Detroit.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We granted leave in this case to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>legality of the proposed condemnations under MCL 213.23 and art 10, \u00a7 2 of our 1963 Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We conclude that, although these condemnations are authorized by MCL 213.23, they do not pass constitutional muster under art 10, \u00a7 2 of our 1963 constitution. Section 2 permits the exercise of the power of eminent domain only for a \u201cpublic use.\u201d In this case, Wayne County intends to transfer the condemned properties to private parties in a manner wholly inconsistent with the common understanding of \u201cpublic use\u201d at the time our Constitution was ratified. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the Wayne Circuit Court for entry of summary disposition in defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">In April 2001, plaintiff Wayne County initiated actions to condemn nineteen parcels of land immediately south of Metropolitan Airport. The owners of those parcels, defendants in the present actions, maintain that these condemnations lack statutory authorization and exceed constitutional bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">This dispute has its roots in recent renovations of Metropolitan Airport. The county\u2019s $2 billion construction program produced a new terminal and jet runway and, consequently, raised concerns that noise from increased air traffic would plague neighboring landowners. In an effort to obviate such problems, the county, funded by a partial grant of $21 million from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), began a program of purchasing neighboring properties through voluntary sales. Eventually, the county purchased approximately five hundred acres in nonadjacent plots scattered in a checkerboard pattern throughout an area south of Metropolitan Airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Wayne County\u2019s agreement with the FAA provided that any properties acquired through the noise abatement program were to be put to economically productive use. In order to fulfill this mandate, the county, through its Jobs and Economic Development Department, developed the idea of constructing a large business and technology park with a conference center, hotel accommodations, and a recreational facility. Thus, the \u201cPinnacle Project\u201d was born.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The Pinnacle Project calls for the construction of a state-of-the-art business and technology park in a 1,300-acre area adjacent to Metropolitan Airport. The county avers that the Pinnacle Project will</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">create thousands of jobs, and tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue, while broadening the County\u2019s tax base from predominantly industrial to a mixture of industrial, service and technology. The Pinnacle Project will enhance the image of the County in the development community, aiding in its transformation from a high industrial area, to that of an arena ready to meet the needs of the 21st century. This cutting-edge development will attract national and international businesses, leading to accelerated economic growth and revenue enhancement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">According to expert testimony at trial, it is anticipated that the Pinnacle Project will create thirty thousand jobs and add $350 million in tax revenue for the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The county planned to construct the business and technology park in a 1,300-acre area that included the five hundred acres purchased under the federally funded noise abatement program. Because the county needed to acquire more land within the project area, it began anew to solicit voluntary sales from area landowners. This round of sales negotiations enabled the county to purchase an additional five hundred acres within the project area.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Having acquired over one thousand acres, the county determined that an additional forty-six parcels distributed in a checkerboard fashion throughout the project area were needed for the business and technology park. The county apparently determined that further efforts to negotiate additional voluntary sales would be futile and decided instead to invoke the power of eminent domain. Thus, on July 12, 2000, the Wayne County Commission adopted a Resolution of Necessity and Declaration of Taking (Resolution of Necessity) authorizing the acquisition of the remaining three hundred acres needed for the Pinnacle Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The remaining properties were appraised as required by the Uniform Condemnation Procedures Act (UCPA),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the county issued written offers based on these appraisals to the property owners. Twenty-seven more property owners accepted these offers and sold their parcels to the county. But according to the county\u2019s estimates, nineteen additional parcels were still needed for the Pinnacle Project. These properties, owned by defendants, are the subject of the present condemnation actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In late April 2001, plaintiff initiated condemnation actions under the UCPA In response, each property owner filed a motion to review the necessity of the proposed condemnations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They argued, first, that the county lacked statutory authority to exercise the power of eminent domain in this manner. Second, defendants contended that acquisition of the subject properties was not necessary as required by statute. Finally, they challenged the constitutionality of these condemnation actions, maintaining that the Pinnacle Project would not serve a public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>An evidentiary hearing on the consolidated cases was held over four weeks in the Wayne Circuit Court. On December 19, 2001, the trial court affirmed the county\u2019s determination of necessity. The court held that the takings were authorized by MCL 213.23, that the county did not abuse its discretion in determining that condemnation was necessary, and that the Pinnacle Project served a public purpose as defined by <em>Poletown. </em>The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motions for reconsideration on January 24, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Defendants appealed the matter to the Court of Appeals, which granted leave on April 24, 2003. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The panel concluded that the proposed condemnations passed statutory and constitutional muster under MCL 213.21 <em>et seq. </em>and our <em>Poletown </em>decision. Judge MURRAY, joined by Judge FITZGERALD, concurred with Presiding Judge O\u2019CONNELL, but opined that <em>Poletown </em>was poorly reasoned, wrongly decided, and ripe for reversal by this Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">We granted defendants\u2019 applications for leave to appeal on November 17,2003.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our grant order directed the parties to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">(1) whether plaintiff has the authority, pursuant to MCL 213.23 or otherwise, to take defendants\u2019 properties; (2) whether the proposed taking, which are at least partly intended to result in later transfers to private entities, are for a \u201cpublic purpose,\u201d pursuant to <em>Poletown Neighborhood Council v Detroit, </em>410 Mich 616 (1981); and (3) whether the \u201cpublic purpose\u201d test set forth in <em>Poletown, supra, </em>is consistent with Const 1963, art 10, \u00a7 2 and, if not, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>this test should be overruled. Further, the parties should discuss whether a decision overruling <em>Poletown, supra, </em>should apply retroactively or prospectively only, taking into consideration the reasoning in <em>Pohutski v City of Allen Park, </em>465 Mich 675 (2002).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We also solicited briefs amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">STANDARD of review</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Statutory construction is a question of law subject to review de novo.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the eminent domain context, the UCPA limits our review of a public agency\u2019s determination that a condemnation is necessary. We may vacate an agency\u2019s finding that a condemnation serves a public necessity only if a party establishes that the finding is predicated on \u201cfraud, error of law, or abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Constitutional issues, like questions of statutory construction, are subject to review de novo.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A-8\">A. MCL 213.23</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Defendants, the property owners whose lands Wayne County now seeks to condemn, assert that the proposed takings exceed the county\u2019s statutory and constitutional authority. If it were correct that the county lacks statutory authorization to condemn defendants\u2019 properties, this Court need not \u2014 and must not, under well-established prudential principles \u2014 determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the takings also violate our Constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We begin, therefore, with the county\u2019s contention that MCL 213.23 authorizes the proposed condemnations.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">MCL 213.23 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">Any public corporation or state agency is authorized to take private property necessary for a public improvement or for the purposes of its incorporation or for public purposes within the scope of its powers for the use or benefit of the public and to institute and prosecute proceedings for that purpose. When funds have been appropriated by the legislature to a state agency or division thereof or the office of the governor or a division thereof for the purpose of acquiring lands or property for a designated public purpose, such unit to which the appropriation has been made is authorized on behalf of the people of the state of Michigan to acquire the lands or property either by purchase, condemnation or otherwise. For the purpose of condemnation the unit may proceed under the provisions of this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">In interpreting this statutory language, this Court\u2019s primary goal is to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the Legislature has clearly expressed its intent in the language of a statute, that statute must be enforced as written, free of any \u201ccontrary judicial gloss.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Wayne County is a \u201cpublic corporation\u201d as the term is used in this statute,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and is therefore subject to the provisions of this section. Under MCL 213.23, a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>demnation must be \u201cnecessary\u201d for one of three ends: \u201ca public improvement or for the purposes [to be advanced by the public corporation or state agency\u2019s] incorporation or for public purposes within the scope of [the corporation\u2019s or agency\u2019s] powers . . . Additionally, a proposed condemnation must be \u201cfor the use or benefit of the public ... .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Plaintiff does not argue that the takings at issue are a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d or that they advance purposes of the county\u2019s incorporation. Consequently, this Court must determine only whether the proposed condemnations are <em>necessary </em>for <em>public purposes, </em>whether those purposes are <em>within the scope of the county\u2019s powers, </em>and whether the takings are <em>\u201cfor the use or benefit of the public </em>... .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">1. \u201cFOR PUBLIC PURPOSES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ITS POWERS\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Wayne County\u2019s assertion that the proposed condemnations are \u201cfor public purposes within the scope of its powers\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> raises two discrete questions \u2014 first, whether Wayne County is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain at all and, second, whether this particular exercise of the eminent domain power is within the county\u2019s powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">There is no question that the <em>state </em>possesses the power of eminent domain.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The state\u2019s authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>condemn private property for public use is preserved by our Constitution<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and has been expressly acknowledged by this Court on a number of occasions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But whether that eminent domain power extends to counties within the state is another matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Plaintiff argues that the Legislature has expressly conferred that power upon public corporations such as Wayne County through the plain language of MCL 213.23. This statute begins by stating that \u201c[a]ny public corporation or state agency <em>is authorized </em>to take private property ... .\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Plaintiff argues that this language is a separate and independent delegation of the power to condemn private property for public purposes. Because \u00a7 23 \u201cauthoriz[es]\u201d public corporations to condemn property in certain circumstances, a public corporation need not rely on any other statutory provision in order to exercise the power of eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Defendants maintain, however, that plaintiffs reading renders the second sentence of MCL 213.23 a nullity. This sentence provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">When funds have been appropriated by the legislature to a state agency or division thereof or the office of the governor or a division thereof for the purpose of acquiring lands or property for a designated public purpose, such unit to which the appropriation has been made <em>is authorized </em>on behalf of the people of the state of Michigan to acquire the lands or property either by purchase, condemnation or otherwise.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">If the first sentence of MCL 213.23 is a separate grant of authority to condemn, defendants argue, the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>sentence \u2014 which also confers the authorization to condemn land \u2014 is redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">A careful reading of MCL 213.23 reveals that this statute is indeed a separate grant of authority and, thus, that plaintiff has parsed this statute correctly. The first sentence of MCL 213.23 states that a public corporation such as Wayne County \u201cis authorized\u201d to condemn private property if the other preconditions of \u00a7 23 are met. To \u201cauthorize\u201d is to \u201cto give the authority or official power to\u201d or \u201cto empower.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> By its plain language, this first sentence is an affirmative grant of eminent domain power to public corporations and state agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Contrary to defendants\u2019 arguments, giving effect to the plain language of the first sentence does not render the remainder of \u00a7 23 nugatory. The second sentence applies only to condemnation by the state, its agencies or their divisions; thus, it applies to a subset of the groups covered by the first sentence. Further, it establishes a precondition to the condemnation for a public purpose designated by the Legislature \u2014 namely, the appropriation of funds to the state agency or division for that purpose. Finally, the second sentence, unlike the first, authorizes specific methods of exercising the power of eminent domain. Accordingly, the second sentence of MCL 213.23 does not alter the plain meaning of the first: Wayne County, as a public corporation, is authorized by MCL 213.23 to condemn property, albeit subject to other constitutional and statutory limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The second question raised by the county\u2019s reliance on the \u201cfor public purposes within the scope of its powers\u201d phrase in \u00a7 23 is whether these <em>particular </em>condemnations are \u201cwithin the scope of [Wayne County\u2019s] powers.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The power upon which plaintiff relies \u2014 the authority to condemn \u201cfor public purposes <em>within the scope of its powers\u201d </em>\u2014 calls for an analysis of the scope of Wayne County\u2019s \u201cpowers,\u201d and an assessment of whether the proposed condemnations are within those powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Art 7, \u00a7 1 of our 1963 Constitution provides that \u201c[e]ach organized county shall be a body corporate with powers and immunities provided by law.\u201d The Constitution also declares that a county may codify in its charter the power \u201cto adopt resolutions and ordinances relating to its concerns.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> These constitutional provisions are to be \u201cliberally construed\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">The provisions of this constitution and law concerning counties, townships, cities and villages shall be liberally construed in their favor. Powers granted to counties and townships by this constitution and by law shall include those fairly implied and not prohibited by this constitution.[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Given the broad authority conferred by the Constitution upon local governments, this Court has acknowledged that Michigan \u201cis a home rule state,\u201d in which \u201clocal governments are vested with general constitutional authority to act on all matters of local concern not forbidden by state law.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Legislature has also recognized that the Michigan constitution establishes a system of home rule. The charter county act,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> enacted in 1966, states that county charters may expressly provide for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">[t]he authority to perform at the county level any function or service not prohibited by law, which shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>include, by way of enumeration and not limitation: Police protection, fire protection, planning, zoning, education, health, welfare, recreation, water, sewer, waste disposal, transportation, abatement of air and water pollution, civil defense, <em>and any other function or service necessary or beneficial to the public health, safety, and general welfare of the </em>county.[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Plaintiff Wayne County has claimed all the authority granted by these constitutional and statutory provisions. Its charter states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">Wayne County, a body corporate, possesses home rule power enabling it to provide for any matter of County concern and all powers conferred by the constitution or law upon charter counties or upon general law counties, their officers, or agencies.[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">With this charter provision, Wayne County has claimed for itself the power to act in all matters not specifically reserved by statute or constitution to the state. The county\u2019s \u201cpowers\u201d include the authority to pursue any end that is \u201cnecessary or beneficial to the public health, safety, and general welfare\u201d of the county,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> assuming that the pursuit of that objective is not reserved by our Constitution or by statute to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">In this case, Wayne County has condemned the defendants\u2019 real properties for the following purposes: \u201c(1) the creation of jobs for its citizens, (2) the stimulation of private investment and redevelopment in the county to insure a healthy and growing tax base so that the county can fund and deliver critical public services, (3) stemming the tide of disinvestment and population loss, and (4) supporting development opportunities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>which would otherwise remain unrealized.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The analysis provided in this opinion demonstrates that, unless the pursuit of one or more of these objectives has been assigned to the state by law, any condemnation in furtherance of these goals is \u201cwithin the scope of Wayne County\u2019s powers,\u201d as required by MCL 213.23. Defendants have adduced no constitutional or statutory support for the proposition that a home rule county such as Wayne County may not pursue these objectives. Accordingly, the proposed condemnations are \u2014 at least for statutory purposes \u2014 within the scope of Wayne County\u2019s powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The pursuit of the goals cited above is within the scope of Wayne County\u2019s powers, and each goal certainly advances a \u201cpublic purpose.\u201d A \u201cpublic purpose\u201d has been defined as that which \u201c \u2018 \u201chas for its objective the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, general welfare, security, prosperity, and contentment of all the inhabitants or residents within the municipal corporation, the sovereign powers of which are used to promote such public purpose.\u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> A transition from a declining rustbelt economy to a growing, technology-driven economy would, no doubt, promote prosperity and general welfare. Consequently, the county\u2019s goal of drawing commerce to metropolitan Detroit and its environs by converting the subject properties to a state-of-the-art technology and business park is within this definition of a \u201cpublic purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">That is not to say, of course, that the exercise of eminent domain in this case passes constitutional muster. While the proposed condemnations satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>broad parameters established by MCL 213.23, it must also be determined whether these condemnations pass the more narrow requirements of our Constitution. We address this question later.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">2. \u201cNECESSARY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">For a public corporation to condemn property under MCL 213.23, a proposed taking must not only advance one of the three objectives listed in that statute, but it must also be \u201cnecessary\u201d to that end. The Legislature has vested the authority to determine the necessity required under MCL 213.23 in those entities authorized to condemn private property under that statute.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Accordingly, Michigan\u2019s courts are bound by a public corporation\u2019s determination that a proposed condemnation serves a public necessity unless the party opposing the condemnation demonstrates \u201cfraud, error of law, or abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Defendants advance three basic arguments for the proposition that plaintiff has failed to establish that the takings are \u201cnecessary\u201d as required by MCL 213.23 and therefore abused its discretion in condemning the subject properties. They contend, first, that the county has neither identified specific private purchasers for each of the defendants\u2019 parcels nor demonstrated that the parcels will be put to productive use now or in the immediate future. Thus, defendants argue that Wayne County is impermissibly using the power of eminent domain to \u201cstockpile\u201d land for speculative future use, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>practice expressly prohibited fifty years ago in <em>Grand Rapids Bd of Ed v </em>Baczewski.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">We disagree. The proposed condemnations are quite unlike the exercise of eminent domain prohibited in <em>Baczewski. </em>There, a local board of education attempted to condemn property near a high school because it surmised that the high school would need to expand in approximately thirty years. The affected landowner challenged the condemnation under the 1908 Constitution,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> which \u2014 in contrast to the 1963 Constitution<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>\u2014 expressly required any exercise of eminent domain to be \u201cnecessary.\u201d This Court held that a condemnation is \u201cnecessary\u201d only if the condemned property will be used \u201cimmediately\u201d or \u201cwithin a period of time that the jury determines to be the \u2018near future\u2019 or a \u2018reasonably immediate use.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The speculative need for property in thirty years time lacked any of the urgency of a \u201cnecessary\u201d condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Even if we grant, arguendo, that the definition of \u201cnecessity\u201d under the 1908 Constitution applies to MCL 213.23 as well, the present case is nevertheless distinguishable from <em>Baczewski. </em>Whereas the school board in <em>Baczewski </em>admitted that it would not need the defendant\u2019s property for thirty years after its condemnation, plaintiff has a definite plan for defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>properties and intends to construct a business and technology park as soon as possible. According to the trial court\u2019s summary of testimony at trial, the acquisition of defendants\u2019 properties would also enable the county to achieve a \u201ccritical mass of property,\u201d and would thereby facilitate investment in the project. <em>Baczewski </em>does not bar an exercise of the power of eminent domain simply because the ultimate owner of the condemned land has yet to be identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Second, defendants argue that the proposed condemnations are not \u201cnecessary\u201d under MCL 213.23 because plaintiff must still clear a number of procedural hurdles in order to proceed with the Pinnacle Project. These include the need for a special exclusion from the FAA in order to use land acquired through the noise abatement program for the Pinnacle Project, environmental concerns that may arise if construction of the project disturbs extant wildlife habitats, and the creation of a local district finance authority and a tax increment finance plan under the Local Development Financing Act.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">This argument is unpersuasive. MCL 213.23 requires a proposed condemnation to be \u201cnecessary\u201d to advance one of the specified purposes. It does not, however, require that the condemning authority clear all other statutory and procedural hurdles before commencing condemnation proceedings. In arguing that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate necessity, defendants have essentially read new requirements into MCL 213.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Finally, defendants assert, without supporting argument, that plaintiff has failed to establish that \u201cthe [business and technology] park is necessary for the public.\u201d Given defendants\u2019 failure to brief the issue, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Court may consider it abandoned.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In any event, the argument erroneously shifts the burden of proof to plaintiff when the party opposing condemnation bears the burden of proving fraud, error of law, or abuse of discretion by the condemning authority.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">3. \u201cFOR THE USE OR BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">A condemnation that is necessary for a public purpose within the scope of the condemning authority\u2019s powers must also be \u201cfor the use or benefit of the public\u201d in order to be valid under MCL 213.23. There is ample evidence in the record that the Pinnacle Project would benefit the public. The development is projected to bring jobs to the struggling local economy, add to tax revenues and thereby increase the resources available for public services, and attract investors and businesses to the area, thereby reinvigorating the local economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In fact, defendants do not dispute that the proposed condemnations would benefit the public. Instead, relying on <em>City of Lansing v Edward Rose Realty, Inc,</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>defendants argue that the benefits that private parties will receive through the Pinnacle Project outweigh any benefits that the general public is likely to receive and, therefore, that plaintiff has failed to establish a \u201cpublic use or benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The two <em>Edward Rose </em>passages on which defendants rely, however, concern issues quite distinct from those under consideration here. The <em>Edward Rose </em>Court first engaged in a balancing of public and private interests in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>addressing whether a city ordinance authorizing the condemnation of private property was a legitimate exercise of the general authority conferred upon Lansing as a home rule city.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Court then returned to the balancing of public and private interests when evaluating the city\u2019s ordinance under the \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d test of Poletown,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Neither passage concerns the meaning of the phrase \u201cpublic benefit,\u201d much less the meaning of \u201cpublic benefit\u201d as used in MCL 213.23. Moreover, <em>Edward Rose </em>nowhere suggests that the \u201cpublic use or benefit\u201d element of MCL 213.23 requires a balancing of public and private benefits, or that public benefits must predominate over private ones under this statute. As such, defendants have failed to persuade us that the proposed condemnations will fail to provide a \u201cpublic benefit\u201d within the meaning of MCL 213.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the condemnations sought by Wayne County are consistent with MCL 213.23 and that this statute is a separate and independent grant of eminent domain authority to public corporations such as Wayne County. If the authority to condemn private property conferred by the Legislature lacked any constitutional limits, this Court would be compelled to affirm the decisions of the circuit court and the Court of Appeals. But our state Constitution does, in fact, limit the state\u2019s power of eminent domain. Therefore, it must be determined whether the proposed condemnations pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">B. ART 10, \u00a7 2</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Art 10, \u00a7 2 of Michigan\u2019s 1963 Constitution provides that \u201c[p]rivate property shall not be taken for public use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>without just compensation therefor being first made or secured in a manner prescribed by law.\u201d Defendants contend that the proposed condemnations are not \u201cfor public use,\u201d and therefore are not within constitutional bounds. Accordingly, our analysis must now focus on the \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement of art 10, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">1. \"PUBLIC USE\u201d AS A LEGAL TERM OF ART</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The primary objective in interpreting a constitutional provision is to determine the text\u2019s original meaning to the ratifiers, the people, at the time of ratification.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> This rule of \u201ccommon understanding\u201d has been described by Justice COOLEY in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">\u201cA constitution is made for the people and by the people. <em>The interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great </em>mass <em>of the people themselves, would give it. </em>\u2018For as the Constitution does not derive its force from the convention which framed, but from the people who ratified it, <em>the intent to be arrived at is that of the people, </em>and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, <em>but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, </em>and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u2019 \u201d[<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">In short, the primary objective of constitutional interpretation is to realize the intent of the people by whom and for whom the constitution was ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">This Court typically discerns the common understanding of constitutional text by applying each term\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>plain meaning at the time of ratification.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> But if the constitution employs technical or legal terms of art, \u201cwe are to construe those words in their technical, legal sense.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Justice COOLEY has justified this principle of constitutional interpretation in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">[I]t must not be forgotten, in construing our constitutions, that in many particulars they are but the legitimate successors of the great charters of English liberty, whose provisions declaratory of the rights of the subject have acquired a well-understood meaning, which the people must be supposed to have had in view in adopting them. We cannot understand these provisions unless we understand their history, and when we find them expressed in technical words, and words of art, we must suppose these words to be employed in their technical sense. When the law speaks of an ex post facto law, it means a law technically known by that designation; the meaning of the phrase having become defined in the history of constitutional law, and being so familiar to the people that it is not necessary to employ language of a more popular character to designate it. The technical sense in these cases is the sense popularly understood, because that is the sense fixed upon the words in legal and constitutional history where they have been employed for the protection of popular rights.[<footnotemark>48</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-x\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Thus, in <em>Silver Creek, </em>for example, we determined that the phrase \u201cjust compensation\u201d was a legal term of art of enormous complexity, and that its meaning could be discerned only by canvassing legal precedent on \u201cjust compensation\u201d before 1963 to determine how an indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>vidual versed in the law before the Constitution\u2019s ratification would understand that concept.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Indeed, we have held that the <em>whole </em>of art 10, \u00a7 2 has a technical meaning that must be discerned by examining the \u201cpurpose and history\u201d of the power of eminent domain.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\u201cPublic use\u201d is a legal term of art every bit as complex as \u201cjust compensation.\u201d It has reappeared as a positive limit on the state\u2019s power of eminent domain in Michigan\u2019s constitutions of 1850,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> 1908,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and 1963,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> and each invocation of \u201cpublic use\u201d has been followed by litigation over the precise contours of this language. Consequently, this Court has weighed in repeatedly on the meaning of this legal term of art. We can uncover the common understanding of art 10, \u00a7 2 only by delving into this body of case law, and thereby determining the \u201ccommon understanding\u201d among those sophisticated in the law at the time of the Constitution\u2019s ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">This case does not require that this Court cobble together a single, comprehensive definition of \u201cpublic use\u201d from our pre-1963 precedent and other relevant sources. The question presented here is a fairly discrete one: are the condemnation of defendants\u2019 properties and the subsequent transfer of those properties to private entities pursuant to the Pinnacle Project consistent with the common understanding of \u201cpublic use\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>at ratification? For the reasons stated below, we answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">2. \u201cPUBLIC USE\u201d AND PRIVATE OWNERSHIP</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">When our Constitution was ratified in 1963, it was well-established in this Court\u2019s eminent domain jurisprudence that the constitutional \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement was not an absolute bar against the transfer of condemned property to private entities.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> It was equally clear, however, that the constitutional \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement worked to prohibit the state from transferring condemned property to private entities for a <em>private </em>use.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Thus, this Court\u2019s eminent domain jurisprudence \u2014 at least that portion concerning the reasons for which the state may condemn private property \u2014 has focused largely on the area between these poles.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Justice RYAN\u2019s <em>Poletown </em>dissent accurately describes the factors that distinguish takings in the former category from those in the latter according to our pre-1963 eminent domain jurisprudence.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the transfer of condemned property is a \u201cpublic use\u201d when it possesses one of the three characteristics in our pre-1963 case law identified by Justice Ryan.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>First, condemnations in which private land was constitutionally transferred by the condemning authority to a private entity involved \u201cpublic necessity of the extreme sort otherwise impracticable.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The \u201cnecessity\u201d that Justice RYAN identified in our pre-1963 case law is a specific kind of need:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\">[T]he exercise of eminent domain for private corporations has been limited to those enterprises generating public benefits whose very <em>existence </em>depends on the use of land that can be assembled only by the coordination central government alone is capable of achieving.[<footnotemark>58</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Justice RYAN listed \u201chighways, railroads, canals, and other instrumentalities of commerce\u201d as examples of this brand of necessity.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> A corporation constructing a railroad, for example, must lay track so that it forms a more or less straight path from point A to point B. If a property owner between points A and B holds out \u2014 say, for example, by refusing to sell his land for any amount less than fifty times its appraised value \u2014 the construction of the railroad is halted unless and until the railroad accedes to the property owner\u2019s demands. And if owners of adjoining properties receive word of the original property owner\u2019s windfall, they too will refuse to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The likelihood that property owners will engage in this tactic makes the acquisition of property for railroads, gas lines, highways, and other such \u201cinstrumentalities of commerce\u201d a logistical and practical nightmare. Accordingly, this Court has held that the exercise of eminent domain in such cases \u2014 in which collective action is needed to acquire land for vital instrumentali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>ties of commerce \u2014 is consistent with the constitutional \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Second, this Court has found that the transfer of condemned property to a private entity is consistent with the constitution\u2019s \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement when the private entity remains accountable to the public in its use of that property.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Indeed, we disapproved of the use of eminent domain in <em>Portage Twp Bd of Health </em>in part because the entity acquiring the condemned land would not be subject to public oversight.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> As Justice RYAN observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">[T]his Court disapproved condemnation that would have facilitated the generation of water power by a private corporation because the power company \u201cwill own, lease, use, and control\u201d the water power. In addition, [we] warned, \u201cLand cannot be taken, under the exercise of the power of eminent domain, unless, after it is taken, it will be devoted to the <em>use </em>of the public, <em>independent of the will of the corporation taking it. </em>\u201d[<footnotemark>63</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">In contrast, we concluded in <em>Lakehead Pipe Line Co v Dehn </em>that the state retained sufficient control of a petroleum pipeline constructed by the plaintiff on condemned property.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> We noted specifically that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>tiff had \u201cpledged itself to transport in intrastate commerce,\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> that plaintiffs pipeline was used pursuant to directions from the Michigan Public Service Commission, and that the state would be able to enforce those obligations, should the need arise.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Thus, in the common understanding of those sophisticated in the law at the time of ratification, the \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement would have allowed for the transfer of condemned property to a private entity when the public retained a measure of control over the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Finally, condemned land may be transferred to a private entity when the selection of the land to be condemned is itself based on public concern.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> In Justice Ryan\u2019s words, the property must be selected on the basis of \u201cfacts of independent public significance,\u201d meaning that the underlying purposes for resorting to condemnation, rather than the subsequent use of condemned land, must satisfy the Constitution\u2019s public use requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The primary example of a condemnation in this vein is found in <em>In re Slum </em>Clearance,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> a 1951 decision from this Court. In that case, we considered the constitutionality of Detroit\u2019s condemnation of blighted housing and its subsequent resale of those properties to private persons. The city\u2019s <em>controlling purpose </em>in condemning the properties was to remove unfit housing and thereby advance public health and safety; subsequent resale of the land cleared of blight was \u201cincidental\u201d to this goal.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> We concluded, therefore, that the condemnation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>indeed a \u201cpublic use,\u201d despite the fact that the condemned properties would inevitably be put to private use. <em>In re Slum Clearance </em>turned on the fact that the act of condemnation <em>itself, </em>rather than the use to which the condemned land eventually would be put, was a public use.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Thus, as Justice RYAN observed, the condemnation was a \u201cpublic use\u201d because the land was selected on the basis of \u201cfacts of independent public significance\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> \u2014 namely, the need to remedy urban blight for the sake of public health and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The foregoing indicates that the transfer of condemned property to a private entity, seen through the eyes of an individual sophisticated in the law at the time of ratification of our 1963 Constitution, would be appropriate in one of three contexts: (1) where \u201cpublic necessity of the extreme sort\u201d requires collective action; (2) where the property remains subject to public oversight after transfer to a private entity; and (3) where the property is selected because of \u201cfacts of independent public significance,\u201d rather than the interests of the private entity to which the property is eventually transferred.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">3. <em>POLETOWN, </em>THE PINNACLE PROJECT, AND PUBLIC USE</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The exercise of eminent domain at issue here \u2014 the condemnation of defendants\u2019 properties for the Pinnacle Project and the subsequent transfer of those properties to private entities \u2014 implicates none of the saving elements noted by our pre-1963 eminent domain jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The Pinnacle Project\u2019s business and technology park is certainly not an enterprise \u201cwhose very <em>existence </em>depends on the use of land that can be assembled only by the coordination central government alone is capable of achieving.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> To the contrary, the landscape of our country is flecked with shopping centers, office parks, clusters of hotels, and centers of entertainment and commerce. We do not believe, and plaintiff does not contend, that these constellations required the exercise of eminent domain or any other form of collective public action for their formation.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Second, the Pinnacle Project is not subject to public oversight to ensure that the property continues to be used for the commonweal after being sold to private entities. Rather, plaintiff intends for the private entities purchasing defendants\u2019 properties to pursue their own financial welfare with the single-mindedness expected of any profit-making enterprise. The public benefit arising from the Pinnacle Project is an epiphenomenon of the eventual property owners\u2019 collective attempts at profit maximization. No formal mechanisms exist to ensure that the businesses that would occupy what are now defendants\u2019 properties will continue to contribute to the health of the local economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Finally, there is nothing about the <em>act </em>of condemning defendants\u2019 properties that serves the public good in this case. The only public benefits cited by plaintiff arise after the lands are acquired by the government and put to private use. Thus, the present case is quite unlike <em>Slum Clearance </em>because there are no facts of independent public significance (such as the need to promote health and safety) that might justify the condemnation of defendants\u2019 lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>We can only conclude, therefore, that no one sophisticated in the law at the 1963 Constitution\u2019s ratification would have understood \u201cpublic use\u201d to permit the condemnation of defendants\u2019 properties for the construction of a business and technology park owned by private entities. Therefore, the condemnations proposed in this case are unconstitutional under art 10, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Indeed, the only support for plaintiffs position in our eminent domain jurisprudence is the majority opinion in <em>Poletown. </em>In that opinion per curiam, a majority of this Court concluded that our Constitution permitted the Detroit Economic Development Corporation to condemn private residential properties in order to convey those properties to a private corporation for the construction of an assembly plant.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">As an initial matter, the opinion contains an odd but telling internal inconsistency. The majority first acknowledges that the property owners in that case \u201curge[d the Court] to distinguish between the terms \u2018use\u2019 and \u2018purpose\u2019, asserting they are not synonymous and have been distinguished in the law of eminent domain.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> This argument, of course, was central to the plaintiffs\u2019 case, because the Constitution allows the exercise of eminent domain only for a \u201cpublic <em>use.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>76</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court then asserted that the plaintiffs <em>conceded </em>that the Constitution allowed condemnation for a \u201cpublic use\u201d or a \u201cpublic purpose,\u201d despite the fact that such a concession would have dramatically undermined the plaintiffs\u2019 argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">There is no dispute about the law. All agree that condemnation for a public use or purpose is permitted. ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The heart of this dispute is whether the proposed condemnation is for the primary benefit of the public or the private user.[<footnotemark>77</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The majority therefore contended that the plaintiffs waived a distinction they had \u201curged\u201d upon the Court. And in so doing, the majority was able to avoid the difficult question whether the condemnation of private property for another private entity was a \u201cpublic use\u201d as that phrase is used in our Constitution.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">This inconsistency aside, the majority opinion in <em>Poletown </em>is most notable for its radical and unabashed departure from the entirety of this Court\u2019s pre-1963 eminent domain jurisprudence. The opinion departs from the \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of \u201cpublic use\u201d at the time of ratification in two fundamental ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">First, the majority concluded that its power to review the proposed condemnations is limited because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201c[t]he determination of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a legislative function, subject to review by the courts when abused, and the determination of the legislative body of that matter should not be reversed except in instances where such determination is palpable and manifestly arbitrary and incorrect.\u201d[<footnotemark>79</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The majority derived this principle from a <em>plurality </em>opinion of this Court<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> and supported the application of the principle with a citation of an opinion of the United States Supreme Court concerning judicial review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>congressional acts under the Fifth Amendment of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Neither case, of course, is binding on this Court in construing the takings clause of our state Constitution, and neither is persuasive authority for the use to which they were put by the <em>Poletown </em>majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">It is not surprising, however, that the majority would turn to nonbinding precedent for the proposition that the Court\u2019s hands were effectively tied by the Legislature. As Justice RYAN\u2019s dissent noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">In point of fact, this Court has <em>never </em>employed the minimal standard of review in an eminent domain case which is adopted by the <em>[Poletown] </em>majority .... Notwithstanding explicit legislative findings, this Court has always made an <em>independent </em>determination of what constitutes a public use for which the power of eminent domain may be utilized.[<footnotemark>82</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Our eminent domain jurisprudence since Michigan\u2019s entry into the union amply supports Justice RYAN\u2019s assertion.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Questions of public <em>purpose </em>aside, whether the proposed condemnations were consistent with the Constitution\u2019s \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement was a constitutional question squarely within the Court\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Gregory Marina </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>Berman </em>for the contrary position was, as Justice RYAN observed, \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Second, the <em>Poletown </em>majority concluded, for the first time in the history of our eminent domain jurisprudence, that a generalized economic benefit was sufficient under art 10, \u00a7 2 to justify the transfer of condemned property to a private entity. Before <em>Poletown, </em>we had never held that a private entity\u2019s pursuit of profit was a \u201cpublic use\u201d for constitutional takings purposes simply because one entity\u2019s profit maximization contributed to the health of the general economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Justice COOLEY considered a similar proposition<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> well over a century ago and held that incidental benefits to the economy did not justify the exercise of eminent domain for private, water-powered mills:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">The statute [allowing the condemnation of private property for the construction of private powermills] appears to have been drawn with studious care to avoid any requirement that the person availing himself of its provisions shall consult any interest except his own, and it therefore seems perfectly manifest that when a public use is spoken of in this statute nothing further is intended than that the use shall be one that, in the opinion of the commission or jury, will in some manner advance the public interest. But incidentally every lawful business does this.[<footnotemark>87</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Justice COOLEY was careful to point out that the Court was not ruling out the possibility that \u201cincidental benefits to the public\u201d might, in some cases, \u201cjustify an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>exercise of the right of eminent domain.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> But Wayne County has not directed us to a single case, other than <em>Poletown, </em>holding that a vague economic benefit stemming from a private profit-maximizing enterprise is a \u201cpublic use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Every business, every productive unit in society, does, as Justice COOLEY noted, contribute in some way to the commonweal.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> To justify the exercise of eminent domain solely on the basis of the fact that the use of that property by a private entity seeking its own profit might contribute to the economy\u2019s health is to render impotent our constitutional limitations on the government\u2019s power of eminent domain. Poletown\u2019s \u201ceconomic benefit\u201d rationale would validate practically <em>any </em>exercise of the power of eminent domain on behalf of a private entity. After all, if one\u2019s ownership of private property is forever subject to the government\u2019s determination that another private party would put one\u2019s land to better use, then the ownership of real property is perpetually threatened by the expansion plans of any large discount retailer, \u201cmegastore,\u201d or the like. Indeed, it is for precisely this reason that this Court has approved the transfer of condemned property to private entities only when certain other conditions \u2014 those identified in our pre-1963 eminent domain jurisprudence in Justice RYAN\u2019s <em>Poletown </em>dissent \u2014 are present.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Because Poletown\u2019s conception of a public use \u2014 that of \u201calleviating unemployment and revitalizing the economic base of the community\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> \u2014 has no support in the Court\u2019s eminent domain jurisprudence before the Constitution\u2019s ratification, its interpretation of \u201cpublic use\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>in art 10, \u00a7 2 cannot reflect the common understanding of that phrase among those sophisticated in the law at ratification. Consequently, the <em>Poletown </em>analysis provides no legitimate support for the condemnations proposed in this case and, for the reasons stated above, is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">We conclude that the condemnations proposed in this case do not pass constitutional muster because they do not advance a public use as required by Const 1963, art 10, \u00a7 2. Accordingly, this case is remanded to the Wayne Circuit Court for entry of summary disposition in defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">C. RETROACTIVITY</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In the process of determining that the proposed condemnations cannot pass constitutional muster, we have concluded that this Court\u2019s <em>Poletown </em>opinion is inconsistent with our eminent domain jurisprudence and advances an invalid reading of our Constitution. Because that decision was in error and effectively rendered nugatory the constitutional public use requirement, it must be overruled.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">It is true, of course, that this Court must not \u201clightly overrule precedent.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> But because <em>Poletown </em>itself was such a radical departure from fundamental constitutional principles and over a century of this Court\u2019s eminent domain jurisprudence leading up to the 1963 Constitution, we must overrule <em>Poletown </em>in order to vindicate our Constitution, protect the people\u2019s property rights, and preserve the legitimacy of the judicial branch as the expositor \u2014 not creator \u2014 of fundamental law.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>In the twenty-three years since our decision in <em>Pole-town, </em>it is a certainty that state and local government actors have acted in reliance on its broad, but erroneous, interpretation of art 10, \u00a7 2. Indeed, Wayne County's course of conduct in the present case was no doubt shaped by Poletown\u2019s disregard for constitutional limits on the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the license that opinion appeared to grant to state and local authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Nevertheless, there is no reason to depart from the usual practice of applying our conclusions of law to the case at hand.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Our decision today does not announce a new rule of law, but rather returns our law to that which existed before <em>Poletown </em>and which has been mandated by our Constitution since it took effect in 1963.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Our decision simply applies fundamental constitutional principles and enforces the \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement as that phrase was used at the time our 1963 Constitution was ratified.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Therefore, our decision to overrule <em>Poletown </em>should have retroactive effect, applying to all pending cases in which a challenge to <em>Poletown </em>has been raised and preserved.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">We conclude that the condemnation of defendants\u2019 properties is consistent with MCL 213.23. However, we also hold that the proposed condemnations do not advance a \u201cpublic use\u201d as required by art 10, \u00a7 2 of our 1963 Constitution. Therefore, the decisions of the lower courts are reversed and this matter is remanded for entry of an order of summary disposition in defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<judges id=\"b631-5\">CORRIGAN, C.J., and Taylor and MARKMAN, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\"> 410 Mich 616;

Therefore, the people may ratify a constitution with the understanding that it incorporates legal terms of art \u2014 or, in Justice Cooley\u2019s terms, words \u201cemployed in their technical sense.\u201d Cooley, <em>supra </em>at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">When one actually engages in the mode of analysis described by Justice Cooley and quoted by Justice Weaver, one need look no farther <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>than the Cooley treatise upon which the concurrence relies to see that \u201cpublic use\u201d is indeed a term of art. See Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (5th ed, 1998), pp 657-666. After surveying some of the many judicial opinions wrestling with this concept, Justice Cooley concludes: \u201cBut accepting as correct the decisions which have been made, it must be conceded that the term \u2018public use\u2019 as employed in the law of eminent domain, has a meaning much controlled by the necessity, <em>and somewhat different from that which it bears generally.\u201d </em>Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (5th ed, 1998), pp 664-665 (emphasis added). See also <em>id. </em>at 659 (\u201cWe find ourselves somewhat at sea, however, when we undertake to define in the light of the judicial decisions, what constitutes a public use.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Thus, the notion that the meaning of \u201cpublic use\u201d was \u201ccommonly understood by the people, learned and unlearned, who ratified the constitution,\u201d <em>post </em>at 499, is one that would have been quite foreign to Justice Cooley. In fact, this eminent jurist admitted to being \u201csomewhat at sea\u201d in attempting to cull a single definition of \u201cpublic use\u201d from the complex case law on the power of eminent domain. Cooley, <em>supra </em>at 659. This admission from our patron saint of constitutional interpretation stands in stark contrast to fictionalized \u201ccommon understanding\u201d proffered by the concurring opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Frankly, we are hard pressed to understand what differentiates Justice Weaver\u2019s construction from our own. Justice Weaver herself acknowledges that \u201cpublic use\u201d must be read as a technical term. See <em>post </em>at 497-498. Justice Weaver\u2019s recognition that \u201cpublic use\u201d must be read in light of its \u201clegal and constitutional history\u201d is precisely our point.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">If there is any meaningful difference between reading a constitutional term according to its legal history because the ratifiers understood that the term was one with a technical meaning (our position) or because the ratifiers themselves were familiar with that legal history (Justice Weaver\u2019s position) it is one we find difficult to discern. Under either Justice Weaver\u2019s locution or ours, \u201cpublic use\u201d is read according to its \u201clegal and constitutional history.\u201d Thus, it cannot be the case that our test leads more easily to \u201celitist\u201d abuse than hers, since Justice Weaver\u2019s \u201ccommon understanding\u201d approach is indistinguishable in result from our own.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> <em>Silver Creek, supra </em>at 376.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\"> <em>Peterman, supra </em>at 186-187.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b617-9\"> See Const 1850, art 15, \u00a7 9.

Unlike the majority, I would employ the long-established method of constitutional interpretation that restrains judges by requiring them to ascertain the common understanding of the people who adopted the constitution. The majority\u2019s focus on the understanding of those \u201csophisticated in the law\u201d is elitist; it perverts the primary rule of constitutional interpretation \u2014 that constitutions must be interpreted as the people, learned and unlearned, would commonly understand them.

CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Justice COOLEY\u2019s often-cited description of the primary rule of constitutional interpretation bears repeating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">\u201cA constitution is made for the people and by the people. <em>The interpretation that should he given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of people themselves, would give it. </em>\u2018For as the Constitution does not derive its force from the convention which framed, but from the people who ratified it, <em>the intent to he arrived at is that of the people, </em>and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, <em>hut rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, </em>and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971), quoting Cooley\u2019s Const Lim 81 (emphasis in <em>Traverse City School Dist).]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">To ascertain the common understanding of the Constitution, the Court may also consider the circumstances surrounding the adoption of a constitutional provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished by it. <em>Traverse City School Dist, supra </em>at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Contrary to Justice COOLEY\u2019S warnings, the majority claims that the relevant \u201ccommon understanding\u201d by which we must interpret art 10, \u00a7 2 is that of those \u201csophisticated in the law at the time of the Constitution\u2019s ratification.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 471. Until the majority\u2019s decision in this case, this Court has never asserted that the term \u201cpublic use\u201d is a term of such \u201cenormous complexity\u201d that the people who ratified the Constitution would be unable to grasp its meaning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court\u2019s first reliance on the perspective of those \u201csophisticated in the law\u201d was in <em>Michigan Coalition of State Employee Unions v Civil Service </em>Comm, 465 Mich 212; 634 NW2d 692 (2001). After appearing to acknowledge that constitutional language should be interpreted as it would have been understood by those who ratified it, the opinion asked, \u201cYet, what if the constitutional language had no plain meaning, but rather is a technical and legal term or phrase of art?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222. Citing, out of context, a statement by Justice COOLEY regarding commonly understood technical or legal terms that must be supposed to have been employed in their technical sense,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Court majority then erroneously equated such terms to words that are \u201cin no way part of the common vocabulary.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court majority next launched its unprecedented rule of constitutional interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>This, then, is the rule: if a constitutional phrase is a technical legal term or a phrase of art in the law, the phrase will be given the meaning that those sophisticated in the law understood at the time of the enactment unless it is clear from the constitutional language that some other meaning was intended. <em>[Id. </em>at 223.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">As in <em>Michigan </em>Coalition, the majority in this case claims to find support in Justice COOLEY\u2019S treatise on constitutional interpretation, in which he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">[I]t must not be forgotten, in construing our constitutions, that in many particulars they are but the legitimate successors of the great charters of English liberty, whose provisions declaratory of the rights of the subject have acquired a well-understood meaning, which the people must be supposed to have had in view in adopting them. We cannot understand these provisions unless we understand their history; and when we find them expressed in technical words, and words of art, we must suppose these words to be employed in their technical sense.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The majority takes this quote out of context and twists its meaning. When Justice COOLEY\u2019S statement is returned to its full context, it neither supports nor justifies the majority\u2019s abandonment of the people\u2019s common understanding of constitutional terms for the understanding of those \u201csophisticated or learned in the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">As is revealed in the full text, Justice COOLEY sought to convey that certain constitutional terms have technical or legal meaning that is known to every person, learned or unlearned. Regarding such terms, COOLEY suggested that it is unnecessary for the Court to give them a more popular or plainer meaning. Careful attention is warranted to Justice COOLEY\u2019S language that in context reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>In interpreting clauses we must presume that <em>words have been employed in their natural and ordinary meaning. </em>As <em>Marshall, </em>Ch. J., says: The framers of the constitution, and the people who adopted it, \u201cmust be understood to have employed the words in their natural sense, and to have intended what they have said.\u201d This is hut saying that no forced or unnatural construction is to he put upon their language: and it seems so obvious a truism that one expects to see it universally accepted without question; hut the attempt is made so often by interested subtlety and ingenious refinement to induce the courts to force from these instruments a meaning which their framers never held, that it frequently becomes necessary to re-declare this fundamental maxim. Narrow and technical reasoning is misplaced when it is brought to bear upon an instrument framed by the people themselves, for themselves, and designed as a chart upon which every man, learned and unlearned, may be able to trace the leading principles of government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">But it must not be forgotten, in construing our constitutions, that in many particulars they are but the legitimate successors of the great charters of English liberty, whose provisions declaratory of the rights of the subject have acquired a well-understood meaning, which the people must be supposed to have had in view in adopting them. We cannot understand these provisions unless we understand their history; and when we find them expressed in technical words, and words of art, we must suppose these words to be employed in their technical sense. When the Constitution speaks of an <em>ex post facto </em>law, it means a law technically known by that designation; the meaning of the phrase having become defined in the history of constitutional law, and being so familiar to the people that it is not necessary to employ language of a more popular character to designate it. The technical sense in these cases is the sense popularly understood, because that is the sense fixed upon the words in legal and constitutional history where they have been employed for the protection of popidar rights.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>This passage does not suggest that courts should defer to the understanding of those \u201clearned or sophisticated in the law.\u201d To the contrary, it simply affirms that certain legal and constitutional terms are so embedded in our constitutional law and history and their meanings so familiar to the people, that the court need not and must not attempt to redefine them. Clearly, Justice COOLEY does not suggest that the people\u2019s common understanding of such terms be replaced by a \u201csophisticated\u201d understanding that may be forced, by \u201cinterested subtlety and ingenious refinement,\u201d from constitutional language.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But this is the very danger that the majority\u2019s approach presents.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Justice COOLEY understood, as the majority refuses to accept, that the people do understand \u201cthe sense fixed upon the words in legal and constitutional history where they have been employed for the protection of popular rights.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> By substituting the \u201clearned and sophisticated\u201d understanding for that of the people\u2019s common understanding, the majority invites future judicial distortion of the Constitution, which was made by and for the people, and invites \u201cinterested subtlety and ingenious refinement\u201d to \u201cforce from these instruments a meaning which their framers never held.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Constitutional terms with commonly understood technical or legal meanings must, therefore, be distinguished from terms that have no meaning in the common vocabulary. For example, in <em>Walker v Wolverine Fabricating &amp; Mfg Co, Inc, </em>425 Mich 586, 596; 391 NW2d 296 (1986), the Court held that \u201c[ajppeals... tried de novo\u201d was a term that had no meaning in the common vocabulary. The Court noted that scholars disagreed and constitutional convention delegates expressed confusion regarding the term\u2019s meaning.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Walker </em>then explained the appropriate approach to the interpretation of such terms. In order to ascertain the common understanding, <em>Walker </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">First, one can look to the Constitutional Convention\u2019s Address to the People for its explanation of an ambiguous term. Second, one can survey contemporaneous judicial decisions and legal commentaries for evidence of a consensus within the legal community regarding the meaning of a term.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The process of ascertaining the meaning of terms in a constitution that are not part of the common vocabulary through a survey of judicial decisions reflects the rule that the \u201cframers of a Constitution are presumed to have knowledge of existing laws, . .. and act in reference to that knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, the process of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ascertaining the understanding of the framers should not be confused with the process of ascertaining the understanding of the ratifiers.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Adhering to the common understanding of the ratifiers, as opposed to that of the \u201csophisticated in the law,\u201d helps ensure that courts restrain themselves from substituting a different meaning of a word to suit a court\u2019s own policy preferences. As Justice COOLEY so wisely noted, \u201cMarrow and technical reasoning is misplaced when it is brought to bear upon an instrument framed by the people themselves, for themselves, and designed as a chart upon which every man, learned and unlearned, may be able to trace the leading principles of government.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is perhaps for this reason that Justice COOLEY concluded that \u201c[n]o satisfactory definition of the term \u2018public use\u2019 has ever been achieved <em>by the </em>courts.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">II.

We cannot understand these provisions unless we understand their history; and when we find them expressed in technical words, and words of art, we must suppose these words to be employed in their technical sense.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">To clarify the meaning understood by the ratifiers of art 10, \u00a7 2, <em>Peterman </em>cited an 1857 case discussing the power of and limitations on eminent domain and in a footnote provided the following historical context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">Before the American Revolution and the drafting of the United States Constitution, the sovereign was not only-empowered to take private property for public use, but such takings were almost always uncompensated... . Nevertheless, the newly formed republic became increasingly hostile to governmental infringement of property rights as states seized loyalist lands, suspended or remitted debts and the collection of taxes, printed inflationary paper money, and delayed legal enforcement of property rights. To address these abuses was born the requirement that government may not take private property for public use without just compensation. <em>[Id. </em>at 187 n 14.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Such historical perspective helps clarify the limitations on the exercise of eminent domain intended by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>ratifiers. <em>Peterman\u2019s </em>approach is entirely distinct from the majority\u2019s reliance on the \u201csophisticated\u201d understanding of case law addressing the public use limitation. <em>Peterman\u2019s </em>commitment to ascertaining the common understanding of the ratifiers stands in stark contrast to the majority\u2019s statement that the people\u2019s common understanding is \u201cfictionalized.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 469-470 n 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Determining whether a particular exercise of eminent domain is for a constitutionally permissible \u201cpublic use\u201d has traditionally and necessarily involved consideration of the use to which the condemned property will be put. In 1877, this Court held that to constitutionally exercise the power of eminent domain, the use must \u201cbe public in fact; in other words, that it should contain provisions entitling the public to accommodations.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, this Court upheld the condemnation of land for the laying out of a public highway;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the condemnation of land for the opening of a public avenue;<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> a statute delegating condemnation authority to cities, villages, townships, and counties for the construction of airports;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and a public school district\u2019s condemnation of property for use by the school.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In each of these cases the public retained the right to actually use the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">A statute authorizing condemnation that merely requires the use of condemned property to generally serve the public interest is insufficient to justify the exercise of eminent domain authority because, \u201cevery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>lawful business does this.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It is thus well-established that the \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement precludes the condemnation of property for private use even if the private use will generally benefit the public.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">\u201cThe public use implies a possession, occupation, and enjoyment of the land by the public at large, or by public agencies; and due protection to the rights of private property will preclude the government from seizing it in the hands of the owner, and turning it over to another, on vague grounds of public benefit, to spring from the more profitable use to which the latter may devote it. <em>[Portage Twp Bd of Health v Van Hoesen, </em>87 Mich 533, 538; 49 NW 894 (1891), quoting Cooley, Const Limitations (6th ed), p 654.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">This Court has held, therefore, that condemnation of land for a rail spur serving a single private company was an unconstitutional exercise of condemnation power because the private company could control its use and exclude the public.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Similarly, this Court has held that a statute authorizing condemnation of property to provide a private landowner access to his landlocked private property was unconstitutional.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Ultimate private ownership of lands proposed for condemnation, however, does not necessarily render the taking of land unconstitutional under the \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement. This Court has upheld the exercise of eminent domain involving lands that remain in private ownership (albeit new private ownership) where the public retains the right to use the lands taken.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">In every instance of turnpike, plank road, bridge, ferry, and canal companies, [eminent domain] has been employed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>as well as those of railroads. All this class of incorporations have been enacted upon the hypothesis that the lands taken for these purposes were taken for <em>public use, </em>and not for private endowment.... The right to purchase and hold lands for the purposes of the road, being a right delegated in virtue of the eminent domain of the government, and derogatory to those of the citizen whose property is condemned, must be construed as conferring no right to hold the property in derogation of the purposes for which it was taken. <em>[Swan, supra </em>at 439-440 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Thus, this Court upheld a statute providing for the appropriation of private property for a railroad designed to provide public travel<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and a statute authorizing the condemnation of property for an interstate bridge available for public travel.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In these cases, ultimate private ownership of condemned land did not offend the \u201cpublic use\u201d limitation even though the owner would profit from its ownership, because the owner was and could be compelled to continue to devote the condemned land to the public use for which it was condemned.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">While this Court\u2019s evaluation of whether a condemnation is for a \u201cpublic use\u201d has traditionally involved consideration of the public\u2019s use or control over the use of the property condemned, this Court has considered the government purposes to be achieved by the condemnation. For example, this Court held the transportation of oil throughout the state to be a valid legislative purpose and upheld the constitutionality of a statute allowing the condemnation of lands for a pipeline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>serve that purpose.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> There the Court concluded, however, that the pipeline was a \u201cpublic use benefiting the people of the State of Michigan\u201d and emphasized that the state retained control of the pipeline allowing it to ensure its devotion to public use.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The Court has also excused the absence of ultimate public use or control over lands taken and then transferred to a private entity in cases involving the removal of slums and blight that endangered public health, morals, safety, and welfare.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In these cases, the Court reasoned that \u201cslum clearance is in any event the one <em>controlling </em>purpose of the condemnation.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Until <em>Poletown, </em>this Court\u2019s decisions consistently distinguished \u201cpublic use,\u201d as that concept limits the exercise of eminent domain, from private uses and uses that only generally advance the public interest. This distinction was readily traceable in the law and must be assumed to have been well understood by Michigan citizens, the vast majority of whom are not lawyers and are not \u201csophisticated in the law.\u201d The distinction between a \u201cpublic use\u201d and uses that are strictly private or only generally beneficial to the public protects against the arbitrary exercise of the \u201cextraordinary\u201d sovereign power of eminent domain.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Wayne County\u2019s purpose supporting each of the condemnation proceedings at issue is the creation of a contiguous land mass of approximately 1,300 acres for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the development of the Pinnacle Aeropark Project. The county states that contiguity is necessary to attract investors and further that the development will create thousands of jobs and tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue, while broadening its primarily industrial tax base.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">However laudable these goals are, the facts remain that Wayne County intends to transfer these properties to private entities. These entities will be under no obligation to let the public in their doors or even on their lands. There is no way to characterize the county\u2019s transfer of dominion over these properties as accommodating \u201cpublic use.\u201d Further, Wayne County will not retain control over the properties or enterprises to ensure their devotion to public use. Nor can it be said that a controlling purpose of the condemnations is the removal of blight or slums that endanger the public health, morals, safety, and welfare. This case is indeed a very straightforward example of government taking one person\u2019s property for the sole benefit of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">III. THE MAJORITY ABANDONS THE COMMON UNDERSTANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The majority\u2019s application of its \u201csophisticated in the law\u201d approach to this case is unnecessary and subject to abuse: it invites the erosion of the limitations placed on the exercise of eminent domain. As noted by Justice COOLEY, \u201c[a] little investigation will show that any definition [of \u2018public use\u2019] attempted would exclude some subjects that properly should be included in, and include some subjects that must be excluded from, the operation of the words \u2018public use\u2019. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the majority opines that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>transfer- of condemned property to a private entity, seen through the eyes of an individual sophisticated in the law at the time of ratification of our 1963 Constitution, would be appropriate in one of three contexts: (1) where \u201cpublic necessity of the extreme sort\u201d requires collective action; (2) where the property remains subject to public oversight after transfer to a private entity; and (3) where the property is selected because of \u201cfacts of independent public significance,\u201d rather than the interests of the private entity to which the property is eventually transferred. <em>[</em><footnotemark><em>42</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The majority\u2019s categorization of Michigan case law addressing transfers of property to private entities is better suited to articles in law journals that have no force of law than it is to judicial opinions. If, instead of the common understanding of \u201cpublic use,\u201d future courts rely on \u201cfacts of independent public significance\u201d to determine whether a condemnation is for a \u201cpublic use,\u201d then it is easy to imagine how the people\u2019s limit on the exercise of eminent domain might be eroded. For example, a municipality could declare the lack of a two-car garage to be evidence of blight, as has been attempted in Lakewood, Ohio<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> or justify condemning a small brake repair business so that the property can be used for a hardware store, as has been attempted in Mesa, Arizona.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s \u201csophisticated in the law\u201d approach makes the intended protections from such encroachments on protected rights less certain because it moves away from the constitutional text.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The majority\u2019s categories are based on what the majority has determined is the \u201csophisticated\u201d understanding of case law. However, \u201csophisticated\u201d catego<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>rizations should not replace the traditional approach to ascertaining the common understanding of the ratifiers. Justice COOLEY aptly summarized the \u201cpublic use\u201d limitations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">[T]he <em>public use </em>implies a possession, occupation, and enjoyment of the land by the public at large, or by public agencies; and due protection to the rights of private property will preclude the government from seizing it in the hands of the owner, and turning it over to another on vague grounds of public benefit to spring from the more profitable use to which the latter may devote it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">We find ourselves somewhat at sea, however, when we undertake to define, in the light of the judicial decisions, what constitutes a public use.[<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Justice COOLEY\u2019s scholarly treatise follows this statement with a review of judicial decisions from various states regarding the meaning of \u201cpublic use\u201d and concludes that \u201cpublic use\u201d \u201chas a meaning much controlled by necessity, and somewhat different from that which it generally bears.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, Justice COOLEY does not justify invoking a cadre of legal \u201csophisticates\u201d to help ascertain the meaning of \u201cpublic use,\u201d rather it reveals that \u201cpublic use\u201d is indeed a constitutional term that must be understood not in its \u201cmore popular character,\u201d but rather in \u201cthe sense fixed upon the words in legal and constitutional history where they have been employed for the protection of popular rights.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The sense fixed upon the term in legal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>constitutional history is, in Justice COOLEY\u2019S words, \u201cfamiliar to the people.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The facts of each case involving a proposed condemnation should be considered in light of the \u201cpublic use\u201d limitation on the exercise of eminent domain as the limitation would have been commonly understood by the people, learned and unlearned, who ratified the Constitution. This ensures that the \u201csense fixed upon the words in the legal and constitutional history\u201d continue to serve to protect the \u201cpopular rights.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, the people\u2019s common understanding is not \u201cfictionalized.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 470 n 48. The people who ratified art 10, \u00a7 2 do understand the limitations they imposed on the exercise of eminent domain. As stated by Justice COOLEY:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">[I]t is always an invasion of liberty and of right when one is compelled to part with his possessions on grounds which are only colorable. A person may be very unreasonable in insisting on retaining his lands; but half the value of free institutions consists in the fact that they protect every man in doing what he shall choose, without liability to he called account for his reasons or motives, so long as he is doing only that which he has a right to do. <em>[Ryerson, supra </em>at 342.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Nevertheless, the majority substitutes the people\u2019s common understanding with that of those \u201csophisticated in the law.\u201d Apparently, the current majority does not share Justice COOLEY\u2019S respect for every person\u2019s understanding of their most basic and established constitutional protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">I agree with the majority\u2019s result and its decision to overrule <em>Poletown. Poletown </em>wrongly abandoned the express constitutional limitation on the exercise of eminent domain power when it held that land can be taken by the government and transferred to a private entity upon the mere showing that the economy will generally benefit from the condemnation. For the reasons stated by the majority, I agree that this decision should apply retroactively. Thus Wayne County may not condemn the properties of the defendants at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s reliance on its recently created and elitist rule of constitutional interpretation that gives constitutional terms the meaning that those \u201cversed\u201d and \u201csophisticated in the law\u201d would have given it at the time of the Constitution\u2019s ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">I also dissent from the majority\u2019s application of this new rule to the facts of this case. While the majority\u2019s application of its method of interpretation reaches the correct result in this case, this new rule of constitutional interpretation perverts the long-established and primary rule that constitutional terms are to be interpreted as they are understood by the citizen ratifiers, the vast majority of whom are not lawyers or judges and are not \u201csophisticated in the law.\u201d The majority\u2019s new rule of constitutional interpretation opens the door, as Justice COOLEY warned, for \u201cinterested subtlety and ingenious refinement\u201d to be forced on the Constitution\u2019s language \u2014 constitutional language that the people framed and adopted for themselves \u201cas a chart upon which every man, learned and unlearned, may be able to trace the leading principles of government.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Where a legal and constitutional term is so embedded in our constitutional law and history and so familiar to the people as to be commonly understood, this Court should not redefine it through the eyes of those \u201csophisticated in the law,\u201d but should give it the common understanding that the people who ratified the Constitution would have given the term.</p>\n<judges id=\"b651-4\">CAVANAGH, J., concurred only with respect to section I.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-11\"> I also concur in the majority\u2019s reasoning for applying this decision retroactively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> The public purposes achievable by public corporations through condemnation pursuant to MCL 213.23 must conform to the \u201cpublic use\u201d limitation of Const 1963, art 10, \u00a72.

The Court stated, \u201cThe statute under which these... proceedings were brought is silent on the subject of a jury.

I also concur with section I of Justice WEAVER\u2019S partial concurrence and partial dissent. I write separately, however, because I believe that the analysis offered by Justice RYAN in his dissent in <em>Poletown </em>offers the best rationale to explain why I believe <em>Poletown </em>should be overruled. Further, I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that today\u2019s decision should be applied retroactively. Contrary to the majority, I would apply today\u2019s decision prospectively only.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">This Court has determined that various factors must be considered when determining whether a decision should have retroactive application. In <em>Pohutski v City of Allen Park, </em>465 Mich 675, 696; 641 NW2d 219 (2002), this Court stated that these \u201cfactors are: (1) the purpose to be served by the new rule, (2) the extent of reliance on the old rule, and (3) the effect of retroactivity on the administration of justice.\u201d This Court also \u201crecognized an additional threshold question whether the decision clearly established a new principle of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, this Court has adopted a thoughtful approach to retroactivity to minimize chaos and maximize justice. See <em>Tebo v Havlik, </em>418 Mich 350, 360, 361, 363; 343 NW2d 181 (1984) (opinion by Brickley, J.); <em>Lindsey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>v Harper Hosp, </em>455 Mich 56, 68; 564 NW2d 861 (1997) (\u201cProspective application of a holding is appropriate when the holding overrules settled precedent....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The key factors in this case are Wayne County\u2019s reliance on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Poletown </em>and the effect retroactive application will have on Wayne County, as well as other communities that relied on <em>Poletown. </em>In brief, Wayne County has spent approximately $50 million on the project at issue in this case in reliance on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Poletown. </em>While I agree with the majority that <em>Poletown </em>improperly interpreted and applied the law, Wayne County\u2019s reliance on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Poletown </em>is clear and I do not believe that Wayne County and its taxpayers should be penalized because the county followed this Court\u2019s guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The majority states that \u201cWayne County\u2019s course of conduct in the present case was no doubt shaped by Poletown\u2019s disregard for constitutional limits on the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the license that opinion <em>appeared to </em>grant to state and local authorities.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 484 (emphasis added). The <em>Poletown </em>opinion did not <em>appear </em>to grant power to state and local authorities, it actually did so. Although we now overrule <em>Poletown </em>because it incorrectly interpreted our Constitution, there is no doubt that Wayne County\u2019s actions were a direct result of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Poletown </em>and were proper under the reasoning and holding in that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">I understand that prospective application would mean that defendants must accept just compensation in exchange for their properties. In an ideal situation, no one, including defendants, would have to sell property unless they wanted to sell. However, in examining the factors that this Court considers when determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>whether a decision should have retroactive application, I cannot penalize Wayne County and its taxpayers because the county followed this Court\u2019s prior direction. Therefore, while I concur with the majority in overruling <em>Poletown, </em>I dissent with respect to the retroactive application of the majority\u2019s decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b653-5\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
