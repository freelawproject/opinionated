The substitution of celluloid for glass for watch crystals and the like has not only been proposed (as the disclosure states), but was well known as patented art. Browne, 7,954 of 1893, British; Gilby, 12,157 of 1904, British. \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The use of celluloid in circular discs inserted by distortion into what is mechanically a bezel is displayed in patents for organ stop knobs and typewriter keys. Alden, 328,448 and 369,310; Voges, 771,950. And a whole series of patents for bottle stoppers display the same principles of introduction and retention.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">So far as (he mechanical, as distinct from the manual, introduction of disc into container is concerned, the principle of any machine capable of producing the patentee\u2019s combination has been known for nearly 40 years at least, and is displayed in Leonard\u2019s patent for \u201cbending pail bottoms\u201d (No. 335,079). We have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">\u201cThat invention is sometimes found in the transference from one art to another of a particular series of mechanical processes, but the difficulty or ingenuity of such transfer is to be considered in each instance, and where the degree thereof is so slight as is here displayed, nothing more than a fair mechanical knowledge of familiar devices was necessary to affect it.\u201d Rubes v. Willis, 234 Fed. 341, 148 C. C. A. 243.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">A device may be of utility, but, where its essence is either the imparting of motion or the result of motion so imparted, there can be no patentable invention, either in the method or the product, if both were known and used in many arts. Jacobs v. Almond, 177 Fed. 935, 101 C. C. A. 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The introduction of discs into supporting rings, smaller in diameter than the discs themselves, was old, and so was the production of a concavo-convex form. Nor is there any substantial difference between what plaintiff does with a celluloid disc and what has been done for generations with a glass crystal. The testimony on this record is plain that when a glass crystal is \u201csnapped into\u201d its bezel, both the bezel and the crystal \u201cgive.\u201d The elasticity of glass is much less than that of celluloid, so that, if an absolutely rigid ring or bezel be provided for the glass crystal, the glass will break before yielding sufficiently for introduction. Doubtless the celluloid bezel is so elastic that by comparison its metal ring or bezel may be regarded as rigid; that is, it is not necessary for the bezel to \u201cgive\u201d in order to receive the celluloid, as is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>necessary with the glass. But the principle is exactly the same, and very old.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">On this very complete record, therefore, we are unable to discover any patentable invention in the device disclosed, and it follows that the decree appealed from must be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
