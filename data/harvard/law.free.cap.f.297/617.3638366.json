The complaint in usual form was filed on United States letters patent No. 1,449,559, issued on March 27, 1923, to Walter Byrd So Belle for a game club. Plaintiff Yardsmore Golf Club Manufacturing Co. is assignee of So Itelle, and the other plaintiff is exclusive licensee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-13\">\u201cThis invention,\u201d the patentee states, \u201crelates to game clubs, such as golf clubs, and has for its object to provide an improved striking portion to impart a higher velocity and increase the travel of the ball. Different substances inserted in driving face of clubs have been used, but they are defective for one or more reasons. 0 - * I have discovered that a casein material, one form of which is known as galalith, overcomes the objections to previous materials, and gives decidedly more distance, as in a golf driver, brassy or spoon. This material is better adapted to striking surfaces and imparting a greater distance to the ball than any materials previously employed for inserts or facings, such as ivory, wood, hard rubber, vulcanized fiber, glass, lead, bakelite, horn, rubber, celluloid, fiber compositions, etc.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-15\">Claims I to 8 (except 5) are relied upon. Claim 3 reads: \u201cA golf club having at least a portion of its striking face of galalith.\u201d Claim 4 reads: <em>\u201cA </em>game club provided with a wooden impact portion and having a galalith insert in' its striking face.\u201d Claim 7 reads: \u201cA game device for striking elastic objects having at ieast a portion of its head of galalith.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b639-16\">Julian S. Wooster, of New York City (Frederick S. Duncan, of New York City, of counsel), for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b639-17\">Charles Neave and Stephen H. Philbin, both of New York City, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b639-18\">Before HOUGH, MANTON, and MAYER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b639-19\">MAYER,, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AJk\">(after stating the facts as above). Claim 3 relates to a golf club; claim 4 to any \u201cgame\u201d club; claim 7 to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\u201cgame device for striking elastic objects.\u201d The other claims of which these are typical are equally simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The question, briefly stated, is whether, on mere inspection of the patent, the court as matter of law can here say that there is not invention. That is another way of saying that the court determines a question of fact on the face of the patent, and that the presumption of validity is at once overcome. There is a ternptation so to rule where, because of private knowledge, the court is familiar with the subject-matter, and where, therefore, the alleged invention seems obvious to the ordinary man, not to speak of the traditional one skilled in the art; but one of .the dangers frequently present in such summary dispositions is the inability to draw the rather fine line which, at times, separates judicial from private knowledge. Mallory S. S. Co. v. Mitchell (C. C. A.) 291 Fed. 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">This is well illustrated by the letters patent (submitted by both counsel), in cases where the courts, as the case may be, have or have not held patents void on their face. Such examples do not help. Whether or not, within certain settled doctrines, there is invention, is in each case a controverted question of fact, which might be differently decided by different triers of the facts, just as one jury on the same facts might find for a plaintiff, and'another jury might find for a defendant. In Luten v. Kansas City Bridge Co. (C. C. A.) 285 Fed. 840, 844, 845, Judge. Sanborn, citing many well-known cases, recently restated the rule here applicable thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">\u201cThe question in this case, therefore, is whether it is clear, beyond all reasonable doubt, from the complaint, the patents, and the common knowledge of the art, of which the court may lawfully take cognizance, that no testimony or evidence could be produced that might convince that any of the combinations claimed and patented to the plaintiff rose to the dignity of an invention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The question here is whether, 'in effect, the court can say that it is \u201cclear, beyond all reasonable doubt\u201d that the substitution of galalith (a far from well-known substance) <em>in </em>a golf or <em>game </em>club cannot be invention. There are some cases where substitution has been held to be invention, and others where invention was not found in mere substitution. Many of the\u00e1e cases are collated in Columbia Metal Box Co. v. Halper, 220 Fed. 912, 136 C. C. A. 478. In that case, the rule, as stated by Judge Coxe, was approved by this court in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">\u201cWhether the substitution of one material fdr another amounts to patentable invention depends upon circumstances, and the rule governing the subject was well stated by Judge <em>Cox\u00e9 </em>in Union Hardward Co. v. Selchow (O. C.), 112 Fed. 1006 (1901). It was there said: \u2018Where the inventor has discovered new and unknown properties residing in a given material, or that a long sought for result, which has baffled an army.of skilled artisans, can be achieved by the change, in such cases the substitution of one material for another may reach the plane of invention. But substitution alone, unaccompanied by any actual advance in the art, or genuine benefit to the public, has uniformly been held insufficient to support a patent.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Applying the principles summarized in the Buten and Columbia Metal Box Co. Cases, supra, we cannot hold that invention is not disclosed on the face of the patent \"here concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Decree reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
