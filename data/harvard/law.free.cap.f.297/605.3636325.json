The charge of negligence was the failure to give timely warning of the approach of the train by whistle or bell. The verdict was for the defendant in error, and there was sufficient evidence to require the submission of the question of negligence of the plaintiff in error to the jury as a question of fact The question of the contributory negligence of the defendant in error was likewise a jury question. From a judgment entered thereon this writ of error is taken. It presents to us many assignments of error, but two of which require our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-21\">The defendant in error called a medical expert who testified to the condition of the defendant in error, saying, among other things, that he suffered from traumatic neurosis, from which he probably would never recover. On cross-examination he was asked if, \u201cwhen this is off his mind and done with, it will have a beneficial effect,\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>which we assume counsel referred to the law action and his recovery from traumatic neurosis. His answer was that it would have a beneficial effect. On redirect examination, counsel .for the defendant in error asked .the following: \u00b0 '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">\u201cQ. They have asked you what the effect of this suit on James was, and what the effect of the termination of this suit might be. Would it, in your judgment) make some difference how the suit terminated? A. I think it would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\"><em>' </em>\u201cQ. If it terminated in his favor, it would relieve him, wouldn\u2019t it? A. I think it would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\u201cQ. Suppose it terminated against him, and he found himself weighed down with a load of debt, which he couldn\u2019t pay, and without any chance of recovery, how would that affect him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">\u201cMr. Redmond: Objected to. My objection is \u2018weighed down by a load of debt which he couldn\u2019t .pay.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201cThe Court: You mean the expense of this lawsuit and his sickness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">\u201cMr. Prouty: Yes; his sickness, and getting his witnesses here, and all that; all the expense that attends a suit of this kind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">\u201cMr. Redmond: I object to this question as being wholly immaterial, that part of it in particular which says, in substance, being loaded with a debt which he could never pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">\u201cThe Court: Admitted. (Exception.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-12\">\u201cThe Court: Of course, the defendant opened up this part of the examination ; that is why you can cross-examine him; you can put leading questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-13\">\u201cMr. Redmond: I don\u2019t object on the ground of leading questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-14\">\u201cQ. What do you say to that, Doctor? A. It is my opinion that it would be the strongest drawback he could have, almost.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">The following questions were then asked and answered without objection or exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-16\">\u201cQ. Might it drive him crazy? A. Might; yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-17\">\u201cQ. As he would brood over it, night after night? A. Yes, Sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-18\">The evidence in the record indicates that the defendant in error was working for $18 per week, and since the accident continued, when able, to work for the same wages, and supported his wife and two children. There was no other evidence as to his financial ability to meet the obligations incurred by reason of the accident, or the institution of his suit to recover damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-19\">We cannot agree with the learned trial judge that counsel for the plaintiff in error opened the door to such redirect examination as counsel indulged in. The question on cross-examination was proper, since the claim of traumatic neurosis was made. It was limited, however, to a prospective cure that might be effected by the cause for anxiety or concern about his lawsuit being removed. A medical witness may state his opinion as to the length of time the injured plaintiff might live in the ordinary course of events, but he must do so, speaking with reasonable certainty. He may give opinion as to events which might affect his probable cure, speaking, of course, from his experience and with reasonable certainty. Evidence as to poverty and the amount of wages of an injured plaintiff is admissible, in a case where the defendant has drawn out testimony to show that the plaintiff has not had the best medical attention, care, and treatment, for the purpose of showing that he resorted to such means as were reasonably within his reach. Alberti v. N. Y., Lake Erie &amp; Western R. Co., 118 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>N. Y. <em>77, 23 </em>N. E. 35, 6 L. R. A. 765; McClain v. Brooklyn City Ry. Co., 116 N. Y. 468, 22 N. E. 1062. Otherwise it is not material. The use of the phrase \u201cweighed down with a load of debt which he couldn\u2019t pay, and without any chance of recovery,\u201d was objectionable, and the objection should have been sustained. However, in view of the record, we think that this was not such a prejudicial error as to require a reversal' of this judgment. The answer elicited from the witness refers to the effect as a \u201cdrawback to his cure.\u201d It was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Error is 'assigned for an alleged improper statement made by counsel for the defendant in error in the presence of the jury. It appeared from the evidence introduced by the plaintiff in error that a Mrs. Wingrove, wife of a witness, with two others, who were witnesses, drove over the crossing in question just before the accident, and met the automobile in which the defendant in error was approaching the crossing about 550 feet east. Mrs. Wingrove was in court at the trial, but was not called by either party. There was testimony by the passengers of this automobile that Mrs. Wingrove remarked to her husband, \u201cArtie, that crossing bell isn\u2019t ringing.\u201d Previous to the trial, an effort was made to take the testimony of Mrs. Wingrove, who resided in Boston. A few days before the trial, counsel for the defendant in error caused Mrs. Wingrove to be subpoenaed before a justice of the peace in Boston for the purpose of taking her deposition to be used at the trial. She did not appear before the justice, and a sufficient excuse therefor is set forth in the record. She came to this trial, accompanied by her husband. The record shows that her appearance was not known to the defendant in error until after he had rested his case. There was some discussion before the court relating to Mrs. Wingrove\u2019s failure to appear before th\u00e9 justice and as to her presence in court. Then the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\u201cMr. Redmond: * * * Mrs. Wingrove, he [Prouty] elicited from one witness, is here in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201cThe Court: She has not thus far been called by either party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201cMr. Prouty: That confirms my theory that the Grand Trunk have got her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">\u201cMr. Redmond: I desire an exception to that remark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Counsel for the plaintiff in error did not ask for any instruction to correct the impropriety of this remark. He did not request that the jury be cautioned to be uninfluenced by it, or that they disregard the remark. To make available the impropriety of this remark as an error at the trial, it was incumbent upon counsel for the plaintiff in error to ask for some instruction to the jury to disregard the remark, or be uninfluenced thereby. A mere exception to'the remark was insufficient. We must consider the remark as having been addressed to the court, and not to the jury. We think the claim that harm was done the plaintiff in error is without merit. Portland Gold Mining Co. v. Flaherty, 111 Fed. 312, 49 C. C. A. 361; Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. Conger, 56 Fed. 20, 5 C. C. A. 410; Strong &amp; Jarvis v. Oldsmobile Co., 96 Vt. 355, 120 Atl. 100; McAdory v. State, 62 Ala. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">During the course of the argument to the jury, counsel for the defendant in error referred to the fact that Mrs. Wingrove was present, and commented upon .the failure of the plaintiff in error to call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>her as a witness. Thereupon a discussion ensued between the court and counsel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\">\u201cThe Court: Does it' appear who brought her here?'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">\u201cMr. Prouty: Wouldn\u2019t come for me; I tried to get her testimony,- and I couldn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">\u201cMr. Redmond: Mrs. Wingrove was here with her husband.' A man takes his wife along \u2014 the evidence is that her husband was <em>here, </em>and she was here with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">\u201cThe Court: The evidence is that the railroad brought her husband here, and the evidence is that Mrs. Wingrove declined to give her testimony for the plaintiff. Isn\u2019t it fair to infer at least that the defendant brought her here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">\u201cMr. Redmond: No; <em>and, </em>if we did bring her here, she was just as available after she got here to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">\u201cThe Court: The plaintiff had rested his case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">\u201cMr. Redmond: <em>You </em>could have offered to put her on, and this court would never have refused it; but I say she was equally accessible to either party, and that appears.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-11\">\u201cThe Court: I hardly think so; she was out of the jurisdiction, and she refused to give a deposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-12\">\u25a0 \u201cMr. Redmond: All I want is an exception if that argument is allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-13\">\u201cThe Court: The court will.say here as long as this is under exception, that the evidence shows \u2014 the parties don\u2019t object to this \u2014 that Mrs. Win-grove was in the courtroom after the plaintiff rested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">Some further colloquy ensued, and the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-15\">\u201cThe Court: Now, just a moment; \u2022 where did it appear Mrs. Wingrove lived ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-16\">\u201cMr. Prouty: Boston.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-17\">\u201cThe Court: Boston is more than 100 miles from the place of trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-18\">\u201cMr. Prouty: We couldn\u2019t subpoena her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-19\">\u201cThe Court: There isn\u2019t any question about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-20\">\u201cMr. Prouty: None at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-21\">\u201cThe Court: Then/the witness must have been brought here under your' employment; the jury would have a right to infer she was brought here under your employment, by contractual arrangement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-22\">\u201cMr. Redmond: I desire an exception to the submission to the jury as to whether Mrs. Wingrove was brought here by our employ, because I say there is no evidence in the case that will warrant any such inference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-23\">This subject was not referred to .in the court\u2019s charge to the jury. We must deem what has been referred to as argument before the court by counsel for the purpose of securing a ruling thereon. There is no evidence that Mrs. Wingrove was in any contractual relation with the railroad company for her appearance at the trial. The remarks of counsel fully explained her appearance. It appears without contradiction that she came from a neighboring state, accompanied by her husband, and was in the courtroom, available to either party, if they desired to call her as a witness. Counsel for the plaintiff in error did not ask for an instruction to the jury, during the course of the charge, that no unfavorable inference could be drawn against the plaintiff in error for failure to call her as a witness. He was entitled to such instruction, if requested. The Oregon, 133 Fed. 629, 68 C. C. A. 603; Hayden v. N. Y. Rys. Co., 233 N. Y. 34, 134 N. E. 826; State v. Fitzgerald, 68 Vt. 125, 34 Atl. 429; Wood v. Agostines, 72 Vt. 51, 47 Atl. 108. We regard this incident of the trial as without prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-24\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
