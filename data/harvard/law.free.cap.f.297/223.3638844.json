We are not disposed to disturb the result as embodied in this temporary order. Therefore the order is affirmed, with a recommendation that the trial of the cause be expedited. This affirmance is not to be taken as an expression of opinion regarding the principal question, which will undoubtedly be presented when the cause comes on to be tried, .after examination and cross-examination \u25a0of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
