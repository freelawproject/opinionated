The \u2022 combination with' a receptacle, of a separate container secured therein as a partition to divide the receptacle into a plurality of compartments ; the container being adapted to receive material and keep the material therein separate from other materials in the receptacle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-16\">Claim. 2 differs from claim 1, in that it contains a limitation that the separate container mentioned in claim 1 is \u201cadjustably\u201d secured, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-17\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Applicant\u2019s purpose, according to his specification, was to fa- \u25a0 cilitate the handling of the various ingredients \u2014 gravel, sand, and cement \u2014 used in making concrete. He shows a so-called construction car with various compartments, which may be so divided as to contain the proper proportion of each of the concrete ingredients. When the car reaches its destination, it may be dumped, ready for immediate mixture. It is apparent that such a device will facilitate the handling of large quantities of concrete-forming materials in large structural undertakings. The Patent Office evidently recognized merit in applicant\u2019s structure, but was constrained to hold that his claims are too broad; that is, that they cover the prior art, and not the particular advance over it. The Assistant Commissioner fully discussed the question and we adopt his reasoning and conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-18\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> After a patent has issued, and it no longer is possible for the patentee to control the phraseology of his claims, the courts will so interpret them, if possible, as to protect him; but there is no reason, as we many times have observed, why an applicant in the Patent Office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>should not draw his claims to cover his actual invention only. For this reason we have uniformly ruled that claims will be given the broadest interpretation of which they reasonably are susceptible. This rule is a reasonable one, and tends not only to protect the real invention, but to prevent needless litigation after the patent has issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">We therefore are constrained to affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
