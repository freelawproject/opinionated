Specht, 297 Fed. 864, we shall assume that the plaintiff rendered services which brought about the agreement between the Framerican Industrial Development Corporation and the defendant for the sale of 500,000 tons of <em>coal, </em>297 Fed. 862, and the option between the same parties for the sale of 240.000 tons, Guionnet v. Specht (C. C. A.) 297 Fed. 871. Yet, as we have decided that the agreement was not consummated and therefore did not ripen into a contract of sale, and that the option, though given, was not exercised, it follows that the sales of coal for which alone the plaintiff would be entitled to commissions were never made. The status of the plaintiff\u2019s claim differs in no material respect from that of the plaintiff in Guionnet v. Specht, supra, and therefore the judgment which the District Court entered for the defendant must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">BUFFINGTON, Circuit Judge, took no part in the consideration or decision of this ease.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
