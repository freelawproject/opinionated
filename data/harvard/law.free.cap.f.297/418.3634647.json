F. Dawson, and the other to respondents Ernest Barnwell, John Adams,' and James Kimes. The informations were accompanied by affidavits of the persons assaulted and a copy of the restraining order, and charge an assault on S. J. Casper and W. E. Wooten, employees of the railroad company, they having accepted employment from said company in place of former employees, who had gone out on a strike. The responses to the rules to show cause were in the nature of general denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-22\">The cases as to all the respondents were consolidated, and on their demand the trial was to a jury. The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to each, and the four respondents were sentenced by the court to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>each a fine of $150, and to be imprisoned in the county jail at Ft. Smith for a period of three months each. Writs of error seek to reverse these judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">On account of the condition of this record as to assignments of error, we deem it not inappropriate to again call attention to the impropriety of burdening the record with a multiplicity of assignments of error. This court has condemned such practice in Pulver v. Union Investment Co., 279 Fed. 699. The Supreme Court of the United States and various United States Circuit Courts of Appeals have likewise entered their condemnation of the practice. \u2018 In Phillips, etc., Const. Co. v. Seymour et al., 91 U. S. 646, 648 (23 L. Ed. 341), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">\u201cThe object of the rule requiring an assignment of errors is to enable the court and opposing counsel to see on what points the plaintiff\u2019s counsel intend to ash a reversal of the judgment, and to limit the discussion to those points. This practice of unlimited assignments is a perversion of the rule, defeating all its purposes, bewildering the counsel of the other side, and leaving the court to gather from a brief, often as prolix as the assignments of error, which of the latter are really relied on. We can only try to respond to such points made by counsel as seem to be material to the judgment which we must render.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">To the same effect is the language of the Supreme Court in Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal Co. v. United States, 250 U. S. 123, 39 Sup. Ct. 407, 63 L. Ed. 889. See, also, Central Vermont Railway Co. v. White, 238 U. S. 507, 509, 35 Sup. Ct. 865, 59 L. Ed. 1433, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 252; Fitter v. United States, 258 Fed. 567, 169 C. C. A. 507; Clark v. United States, 258 Fed. 437, 169 C. C. A. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The record here presents 16 assignments of error. The first 6 and the sixteenth are that the verdict is contrary to the law and contrary to the evidence. These assignments are so general that they cannot be considered by an appellate court. This has been so many times decided that it would be superfluous to cite authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The eighth and fifteenth assignments of error relate to the alleged error of the court in refusing to direct a verdict of not guilty, as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">The seventh assignment of error relates to an alleged error of the court in permitting the witness Casper to testify as to a remark made by some member of the mob. Evidently this is regarded as so untenable that counsel in their brief do not discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Assignments, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 relate to the refusal of the court to give certain requests of defendants, which were, however, fully covered by the court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Assignments 8 and 15 raise the only question, therefore, that is in the record for our consideration, namely: Was the evidence sufficient to sustain the action of the District Court in refusing to direct a verdict of not guilty ?</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">There can be no serious question as to respondents Eawson, Adams, and Kimes. The evidence is amply sufficient to sustain a finding of guilt by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">As to Barnwell there is some difference in the status. The information and motion for rule to show cause against Barnwell, Adams, and Kimes recited that they \u201cdid willfully and knowingly assault S. R Cas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>per and W. E. Wooten, employees of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, for the purpose of intimidating and putting in fear the employees of the said Missouri Pacific Railroad Company.\" Barnwell is therefore before the court on an information charging that he participated in the assault upon Casper and Wooten, employees of the railroad Company. If as a peace'officer he not only neglected to protect Casper and Wooten, but actually aided and encouraged the mob in its assaults, his offense is the greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The theories of the respondent and the government as to this are naturally in direct conflict. The respondent\u2019s claim is that he was chief of police at Van Bur\u00e9n on the day in question, and received information that two armed men were on the street; that he proceeded to where they were, and inquired of them as to whether or not they were armed; that during the conversation some one came up and assaulted these two men, pushing the chief of police away, and that, before he could recover, one of the parties assaulted was thrown down on the street; that he did what he could to protect the two men. On the other hand, it was the theory of the government that he accused the two men assaulted of carrying arms for the very purpose of giving the mob an opportunity to assault them; that he stood by and permitted them to be assaulted and beaten; and that he not only aided, abetted, and encouraged the commission of the assault by refusing to perform his sworn duty, but that he actually engaged in the assault with the mob. That there,was a mob, and that the two employees of the railroad company were assaulted, is without question.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The court in his instructions called the attention of the jury particularly to the case as to Barnwell and set forth the theories of the respective sides. He instructed the jury that it was within the power of Barn-well as a police officer to make inquiry of these men as to whether they' were armed, and that, if he believed in good faith that either one of them was armed, he could malee the arrest; but that before they could convict Barnwell, the chief of police, they must believe from the testimony beyond a reasonable doubt that he made the arrest and failed to give the protection that he could have given by reason of a conspiracy between him, or an understanding between, him and others, that the assault should be made upon these men, and specifically said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">\u201cYou are\u201d instructed that under the law the chief of police, Mr. Barnwell, had a legal right to arrest any person having concealed weapons, and if he received information that Casper and Wooten were carrying concealed weapons he had a legal right to approach them and inquire of them if they were armed, and if he did so, and was acting in his official capacity, he would not be guilty of violating the injunction of this court, if that were done in good faith, and not for the purpose of aiding in an assault upon them because they were employees of the Missouri Pacific Itailroad Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The jury, in finding Barnwell guilty, evidently must have concluded that he was aiding and abetting the mob in its attack upon these two men. Was the evidence sufficient to warrant such finding? This requires an examination thereof. - The witness W E. Wooten testified concerning the assaults made specifically as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">\u201cQ. What became of the chief of police during the trouble? A. The chief of police was right among the crowd. He stood there while we were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>being searched, and while we were being assaulted, and took no part in trying to stop the assault that I could see.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Referring again to the crowd that made the assault, on page 46 of the record appears the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">\u201cQ. Among the men sitting before you now, can you identify any of these men as being in that crowd? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">\u201cQ. All right, just point them out. A. Mr. Barnwell there was one of them, the chief of police.- * ' * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\u201cQ. But you are positive as to Barnwell, Adams, and Hoag? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Testimony of witness S. J. Casper, one of the parties assaulted, after describing the riot and the assault, and the turning over of the witness by the chief of police to two men to take care of him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">\u201cQ. You may proceed, Mr. Oasper, and state what occurred after those two men \u2014 you say the chief of police was present? A. Yes, sir; he was present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">\u201cQ. Those two men that took hold of you; did they take hold of you under the directions of the chief of police? A. I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">\u201cQ. What was done after that? Were you struck? A. I (-) assaulted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\">\u201cQ. Assaulted by whom? A. By one of the parties that I recognized a man in my statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-13\">\u201cQ. What did he say to you? A. Just the words that I have said a few minutes ago. \u2018You dirty son\u2019 of a bitch; you had the nerve to come to our town, did you.\u2019 . '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-14\">\u201cQ. Can you identify among the defendants the man who Used that language to you? A. I believe so. This man right here [M. F. Lawson],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-15\">\u201cQ. Can you identify any other defendants that were there? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-16\">\u201cQ. Point them out. A. H. W. Roberts. This man was present [indicating G. W. Shirley]. Mr. Barnwell was also present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">The witness also, on page 53 of the Transcript, seems to identify Barnwell as one of the men taking part in assaulting him after he had been turned over to the two men for protection. He says (page 53, Transcript): \u201cThose men I have recognized took part in swinging their fists at me.\u201d Barnwell was one of the men he identified. Again this witness (page 54, Transcript):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-18\">\u201cQ. While you were being assaulted, as you have testified, you stated a moment ago that the chief of police came to you while you were being assaulted, threateningly A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-19\">\u201cQ. What did he say, if anything? A. Couldn\u2019t just exactly make out the words. He said, \u2018That is enough, boys,5 or \u2018That will do,\u2019 or something to that effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-20\">In the affidavit of witness Casper, concerning which he was asked by counsel for respondent and which was in evidence, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-21\">\u201cIn addition to the names given in a former affidavit, the following named parties were present and took part in assaulting me; Ernest Barnwell, John Adams, Jas. Kimes, and J. M. Riddle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-22\">The witness further testified (Transcript, page 59):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-23\">\u201cQ. I asked you to point out the men. A. I have pointed out the men to you and you have got the names of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-24\">\u201cQ. The only ones you pointed out were Lawson, Roberts, Shirley, Barnwell, and Leroy Cole. A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-25\">\u201cQ. Ho you know that those were the men that assaulted you? A. There is two of those men that you have the names that has not assaulted me; no, sir. Two men escorted me, one which I fail to recognize, and the other man made a rush at me, and passed that vulgar remark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The two men referred to, as disclosed by other evidence, were evidently Mr. Byrnes and Mr. Shirley. So here the witness testifies that Barnwell was one of those assaulting him. Again (Transcript, pages 62, 63), testimony of C. E. Jones:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">\u201cQ. I wish, Mr. Jones, from these men that are on trial here, you would point out the ones that you know, that you saw that day. A. I seen this man right in front of Mr. Kimes, with a sweater on [identified as Louis Byrnes]. Well, I seen Mr. Barnwell. I seen the whole bunch there, but they are the only ones I seen who had anything to do with the fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">\u201cQ. Now, can you point out any others that were present? A. No, sir; not in that bunch, I can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">\u201cQ. Any of these men? A. I don\u2019t see any other man that I know of. They could have been there, and I not know it, because there was quite a crowd there, and I couldn\u2019t say about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">\u201cQ. What was the chief of police doing? A. Well, he didn\u2019t do anything for a while. He finally told Mr. Kimes and Mr. Adams to stand back; that he would take the man, and told this man to go with him; that he would try and take care of him, if he would go with him. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">\u201cQ. You may state whether you saw the men that you testified about, Mr. Adams and Mr. Kimes, strike the big man. A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">\u201cQ. Did they do that in the presence of the chief of police? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">\"Q. You may state what the chief of police did, if anything, or whether or not he did anything, to prevent that. A. He did not. He was just \"standing there up until the time he told them to let him alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">\u201cQ. But, at the time of the striking him, he did not do or say anything? A. He never took hold of them, or pushed them back, or anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">There was testimony to support respondent\u2019s theory that he did not assault the railroad employees, or assist, abet,- or encourage the same, and that he was a law-abiding citizen and trustworthy officer. It is not for us, of course, to weigh the evidence. That was for the jury. In view of the evidence, we would not be warranted in saying that it was not sufficient for the jury to find that Barnwell, not only aided and abetted the assault by standing by and failing to perform his duty, but that he actually encouraged the commission of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">The judgment as to all of the respondents is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
