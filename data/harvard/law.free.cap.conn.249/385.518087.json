The plaintiffs, George Thomas, Barbara Thomas and John Finnell, appeal from the judgment of the court, <em>Hon. Frank S. Meadow, </em>judge trial referee, in favor of the defendants, the city of West Haven (city), the city\u2019s planning and zoning commission (commission), and two individual commissioners, Donald Lewis and David Saldibar. By that judgment, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly dismissed their action because they had established a prima facie case that: (1) Lewis and Saldibar had treated them maliciously and selectively in the consideration of their zone change application; and (2) a municipal policy of the city caused the plaintiffs to be deprived of their constitutional rights. We agree with both claims of the plaintiffs and, therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Certain facts and the procedural history are undisputed. In April, 1986, the plaintiffs filed an application with the commission requesting a change in the zoning of two parcels of land that they owned at 770 Campbell Avenue, West Haven.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs sought to change the zoning of both parcels from the existing C-2 (commercial local service) and R3-2 (residential two family) to R-5 (residential apartment building),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which would allow them to develop condominiums on the property. After a public hearing on May 13,1986, the commission denied the application with prejudice on May 20, 1986. Saldibar was the chairman and Lewis was the vice chairman of the commission during these proceedings. The plaintiffs appealed from the May 20, 1986 decision<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 8-8.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In January, 1987, following a trial, the court, <em>Schimelman, J., </em>sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, finding that \u201c[w]ith respect to the claim of predetermination due to the lack of a fair and impartial hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>. . . [the] plaintiff[s] [had] sustained [their] burden of proof as evidenced by the record.\u201d The plaintiffs subsequently requested a rehearing before the commission on their zone change application, which took place on June 23, 1987. The plaintiffs\u2019 application again was denied, and the plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Superior Court. In June, 1988, the court, <em>Flanagan, J., </em>sustained the appeal, finding that \u201c[t]he atmosphere created by the foregoing was one of hostility in which the applicant was unable to obtain the fair and reasonable hearing to which he was entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The plaintiffs then commenced the present action, alleging that the defendants<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> unconstitutionally: (1) had taken their property in violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to due process under both the state and federal constitutions; and (2) had denied them their rights, under both the federal and state constitutions, to due process of law and equal protection of the law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs sought redress for their federal claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In August, 1995, on competing motions for summary judgment by the plaintiffs, the city and the commission, the court, <em>Gordon, J., </em>rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the federal due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>claims. On June 5,1996, the commissioners filed a combined motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for permission to file summary judgment, and motion for summary judgment. On July 24, 1996, the court, <em>Booth, J., </em>denied the motion to dismiss and the motion for permission to file summary judgment, but granted the motion to strike the state due process claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The case proceeded to trial on the remaining counts before the court, <em>Meadow, J. </em>After the plaintiffs had completed their case-in-chief, the defendants moved for judgment of dismissal for failure to make out a prima facie case pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 302, now \u00a7 15-8.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and this appeal followed. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The plaintiffs first claim that the trial court improperly dismissed their case because they had \u201cestablished a prima facie case that . . .

In evaluating a motion to dismiss, [t]he evidence offered by the plaintiff is to be taken as true and interpreted in the light most favorable to [the plaintiff], and every reasonable inference is to be drawn in [the plaintiffs] favor. . . . <em>Angelo Tomasso, Inc. </em>v. <em>Armor Construction &amp; Paving, Inc., </em>187 Conn. 544, 548, 447 A.2d 406 (1982).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Bedford Realty Corp; </em>246 Conn. 594, 608, 717 A.2d 713 (1998). \u201cA party has the same right to submit a weak case as he has to submit a strong one. <em>Fritz </em>v. <em>Gaudet, </em>101 Conn. 52, 53, 124 A. 841 (1924).\u201d <em>Falker </em>v. <em>Samperi, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Further, we have stated that \u201c[t]he decisions of the federal circuit in which a state court is located are entitled to great weight in the interpretation of a federal statute.

In 1980, the plaintiffs<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>plans to develop an amusement center offering arcade games, pinball and pool tables. For this purpose, the plaintiffs intended to lease the property located at 770 Campbell Avenue, which was, at that time, the site of a boarded up building with ample parking. The property consisted of two separately zoned parcels, R3-2<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and C-2.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Operation as a pool hall was permissible on C-2 zoned property, but operation as a video arcade was considered an \u201caccessory use.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiffs sought approval from the commission to include video games. At the time that this approval was sought, Lewis was the chairman of the commission. George Thomas testified that Lewis \u201cwas highly upset that a pool hall was [already] allowed there and he argued strenuously to prevent [the plaintiffs] from putting the video games there . . . .\u201d Lewis\u2019 testimony affirms that he had been opposed to the plaintiffs\u2019 intentions for the property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The plaintiffs ultimately received the necessary approval<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and entered into the lease. In August, 1981, the plaintiffs exercised their option to purchase the property, and they operated an amusement center on the property until 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">After ceasing operation of the amusement center for business reasons, the plaintiffs attempted to lease the property. After being unsuccessful for approximately two years, the plaintiffs decided instead to develop condominiums on the property. On April 21,1986, the plaintiffs filed a change of zone application with the commission in order to obtain the necessary zone change of both parcels to R-5. The application was presented to the commission on May 13,1986, at which time Saldibar was the commission chairman and Lewis was the vice chairman.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Lewis characterized the plaintiffs\u2019 application as incomplete because it did not include a site plan application. Lewis advised the representative of the architectural firm who spoke in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 application that what his client had presented to the commission was not a site plan, and that the plaintiffs \u201cwere supposed to come in with a site plan.\u201d The director of planning, Michael Roark, clarified, however, that because the plaintiffs were requesting a zone change, it was not necessary that they submit a site plan. In response to Saldibar\u2019s insistence that he did not want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>to continue with the proceeding until the plaintiffs had come back with the \u201cproper documentation,\u201d Roark replied that \u201c[the plaintiffs] have the right to the fair process of the law and [a site plan is not required because] they\u2019re being heard here on a zone change.\u201d After some additional discussion between the commissioners and the plaintiffs\u2019 representative, this colloquy occurred again, with Saldibar seeking to halt the proceedings because of the lack of a site plan and Roark advising him that none was needed. After this second exchange, Saldibar appeared to understand that a site plan was not required for a zone change application, and ordered that the hearing continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Following several questions from other commissioners, Lewis referred to the plaintiffs\u2019 prior use of the property, stating that \u201c[t]his guy made plans for [the amusement center] instead of what we called for and a pool hall .... We gave this guy everything. Now he comes with this shit. He\u2019s a shrewdy.\u201d Saldibar responded that he would \u201clike to have this guy [c]ome back when he\u2019s ready,\u201d and Lewis moved to \u201c[d]eny with prejudice,\u201d prior to the plaintiffs having completed their presentation. Roark instructed the commissioners that they had to listen to the plaintiffs, to which Saldibar responded \u201calright.\u201d Lewis yielded, stating, \u201c[y]ou said we got to listen to him. We do, we listened to him. And that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The meeting proceeded, with several persons speaking against the proposal, and the plaintiffs\u2019 representative being given the opportunity to present a rebuttal. Subsequently, Saldibar asked whether anyone had any comments on the plaintiffs\u2019 zone change application, and Lewis responded in the affirmative and was given the opportunity to speak. Lewis recalled the history of the property at issue, stating that, after a fast food restaurant had gone out of business, \u201c[the plaintiffs] converted [the property] into a poolroom and that didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>do any good. Now they want to put condos and they want to put, make it an R-5.1 can\u2019t see it. . . . Number one, the fella didn\u2019t have the seal,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>he didn\u2019t have it right, a site plan </em>so at this time I\u2019d like to make a motion that we deny this [application] with prejudice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The remaining commissioners all seconded the motion to deny the application with prejudice, which Lewis made clear would mean that the plaintiffs \u201cdon\u2019t come back . . . [f]or a year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Following their successful appeal to the court, <em>Schimelman, </em>J., the plaintiffs requested a rehearing on their zone change application. On June 23, 1987, with Saidibar and Lewis still holding their respective roles on the commission as chairman and vice chairman, the commission held a public hearing to reconsider the application. After the plaintiffs\u2019 application was called, but prior to its presentation, Mayor Azelio M. Guerra addressed the commission to remind it of a certain moratorium that recently had been passed. The moratorium, which had been adopted on August 28,1986, to be effective September 15, 1986, prohibited, for a certain period of time, the granting of zone change requests that would result in changes to R-5, along with several other zones.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">After Guerra had finished speaking and the public hearing was about to resume, Lewis asked Saidibar: \u201cWhy are we hearing this?\u201d Saidibar questioned Lewis regarding which application he meant, and Lewis, referring to the plaintiffs\u2019 application, stated: \u201cThe first one, it was denied twice.\u201d The hearing commenced after Saidibar and Lewis were informed by the city\u2019s corporation counsel that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal had been sustained because the trial court; had found that during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the prior hearing, \u201ccertain procedural violations had occurred that may have created an unfair hearing for the applicant . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, Dennis Garvey, was the first to speak. In light of the decision \u201c[finding] that two of the commissioners who are sitting tonight had predetermined the outcome of the hearing and the reason for the reversal was because of their vote,\u201d Garvey requested that alternates be appointed for Lewis and Saldibar. Saldibar replied: \u201cYour request is considered and denied.\u201d After Lewis expressed his fear that the plaintiffs \u201ccould take [them] to court again and [that they would] lose,\u201d they sought the advice of the corporation counsel, who recommended that alternates be appointed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although the record indicates that Saldibar continued to participate in running the meeting, neither Lewis nor Saldibar voted on the plaintiffs\u2019 application.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">In considering the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss, the trial court in the present case reviewed the audio tapes of both the May 13,1986 and June 23,1987 proceedings. Referring to the point during the June 23 hearing at which Saldibar initially had denied the request to step down and be replaced by an alternate, the court stated: \u201cAt this point in the hearing the tapes indicate an attitude of animosity and disdain on the part of . . . Lewis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>and Saldibar for George Thomas. The court concludes that the conversations and comments revealed on these tapes, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, demonstrates that Lewis and Saldibar treated . . . George Thomas with animosity and disdain. Accordingly, <em>the court finds that the plaintiffs have demonstrated that </em>. . . <em>Lewis and Saldibar acted with malice in considering their application of June 23, 19872 </em>(Emphasis added.) We agree with this characterization of the evidence, at least insofar- as it concludes that the evidence presented <em>would permit an inference </em>of malice on the part of Lewis and Saldibar. Thus, although the trial court in its memorandum of decision at times framed its determination in terms of <em>its findings, </em>that is not the proper inquiry in ruling on a motion to dismiss under Practice Book \u00a7 15-8. On such a motion, the court is confined to determining whether the plaintiffs evidence, <em>if believed and if given the benefit of all favorable inferences, </em>makes out a prima facie case. See <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Bedford Realty Corp., </em>supra, 246 Conn. 608. The court, on such a motion, may not make findings of fact, either favorable or unfavorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The trial court ultimately rejected each of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. With regal'd to the individual commissioners, the court first concluded \u201cthat merely because the [plaintiffs submitted evidence of a number of zone change] applications [that] were before the board on a request for a zone change does not demonstrate that the various applicants were similarly situated for purposes of a claim of equal protection.\u201d The trial court subsequently rejected the evidence proffered by the plaintiffs because \u201c[n]one of the applications referred to by the plaintiffs involved a similar zone change request from a commercial/residential zone to a residential zone.\u201d Next, the court stated that \u201ceven if the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>assume [d], arguendo, that each application was similarly situated . . . the plaintiffs have failed to establish that the commission treated their application selectively. . . . [T]he plaintiffs\u2019 evidence does not demonstrate that the commission did not require a site plan from the other applicants during the time that the procedure was in place.\u201d The court thus determined that \u201cthe plaintiffs ha[d] not met their burden of demonstrating that they were either similarly situated to others or selectively treated.\u201d With regard to the city and the commission, the court concluded that \u201c[a] review of the evidence adduced at trial reveal [ed] that the plaintiffs ha[d] not demonstrated that they were denied a constitutional right by the municipal defendants,\u201d and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, stating \u201cthat when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs it fails to demonstrate the denial of equal protection . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We first consider the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence submitted by the plaintiffs regarding other zone change applications before the commission was insufficient to allow the inference that these applicants were similarly situated to the plaintiffs. In this connection, we note that, because \u201c \u2018selective enforcement is a murky [area] of equal protection law in which there are surprisingly few cases\u2019 <em>Zahra </em>v. <em>Southold, </em>supra, 48 F.3d 683; and because the cases from the Second Circuit do not provide much guidance on the nature of the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d requirement in an action involving an alleged equal protection violation based on selective treatment, we broaden our review to include relevant decisions from other circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In <em>Esmail </em>v. <em>Macrane, </em>53 F.3d 176 (7th Cir. 1995), the court considered a case involving facts similar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>those before us. The plaintiff, a liquor dealer, alleged equal protection violations against the mayor and city officials who allegedly held a \u201c \u2018deep-seated animosity\u2019 \u201d toward him, which had arisen from prior political dealings between the parties, and from the fact that the plaintiff successfully had appealed a prior revocation of his license. Id., 178. The plaintiff alleged that the mayor had initiated a \u201ccampaign of vengeance\u201d against him, that included, among other things, the denial of his liquor license applications \u201con the basis of trivial or trumped-up charges while maintain[ing] a policy and practice of routinely granting new liquor licenses as well as renewing existing licenses requested by persons who had engaged in the same or similar conduct. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Recognizing that the case before it was \u201can unusual kind of equal protection case,\u201d the Court of Appeals in <em>Esmail </em>characterized the plaintiffs complaint as alleging \u201can orchestrated campaign of official harassment directed against him out of sheer malice.\u201d Id., 178-79. The federal District Court had dismissed the action because the plaintiff had not alleged that other applicants had received grants or renewals at the <em>same </em>time as he, or that anyone who had committed the <em>same </em>violation as the plaintiff had not been sanctioned. The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the action, concluding that \u201cequal protection does not just mean treating identically situated persons identically. If a bad person is treated better than a good person, this is just as much an example of unequal treatment as when a bad person is treated better than an equally bad person or a good person worse than an equally good person.\u201d Id., 179. Applying this rationale to the facts before it, the court concluded that \u201c[i]f the liquor dealers enumerated in [the plaintiffs] complaint committed worse infractions than he was charged with but were let off with lighter or no sanctions, this was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>unequal treatment.\u201d Id. The court explained that if the plaintiff was able to show that this unequal treatment was \u201cthe result solely of a vindictive campaign by the mayor,\u201d that conduct would violate the equal protection clause. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">We are persuaded by this reasoning, and view it as useful in our determination of whether the plaintiffs were \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to other zoning applicants. \u201c[E]qual protection does not just mean treating <em>identically </em>situated persons identically.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Moreover, the requirement imposed upon \u201c[plaintiffs claiming an equal protection violation [is that they] identify and relate specific instances where persons situated similarly in all <em>relevant </em>aspects were treated differently .... <em>Dartmouth Review </em>v. <em>Dartmouth College, </em>889 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1989).\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rubinovitz </em>v. <em>Rogato, </em>60 F.3d 906, 910 (1st Cir. 1995).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">In a situation such as that presented by the facts of this case, which involves the alleged selective treatment by public officials who, under the statutes of this state and the regulations of the city, possess broad discretion in decisions relating to zone change applications; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>footnote 26 of this opinion; the factors that render applicants similarly situated for comparison purposes necessarily are based upon the procedural requirements imposed on those seeking to obtain zone changes. The appropriate group for comparison to the plaintiffs, therefore, includes all applicants who were before the commission requesting a zone change during the same general time period as the plaintiffs, and who thus, theoretically, were subject to the same rules and requirements. Furthermore, given the inherently unique characteristics associated with any parcel of land, and the numerous combination of zone changes that could be requested by an applicant, if we were to adopt the narrow focus undertaken by the trial court and advocated by the defendants, the officials and the processes associated with zone changes could be insulated significantly from the purview of the equal protection clause. We do not regard the equal protection clause as so narrow in scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We next consider the trial court\u2019s determination, emphasized by the defendants on appeal, that \u201ceven if the court assume[d], arguendo, that each application was similarly situated . . . the plaintiffs have failed to establish that the commission treated their application selectively. . . . [T]he plaintiffs\u2019 evidence does not demonstrate that the commission did not require a site plan from the other applicants during the time that the procedure was in place.\u201d According to the court, \u201c[a]t trial, Lewis and Saldibar testified that the commission\u2019s procedure was to require a site plan with all zone change applications. The commission discontinued this procedural requirement after the court, <em>Schimelman, </em>J., and the corporation counsel for [the city] informed them that a site plan was not required by the regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Initially, we reiterate that whether the evidence <em>demonstrated </em>that the commission actually required a site plan from other applicants during the requisite time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>period was not the issue before the trial court on the motion to dismiss, and it is not the issue presented to us. Rather, the issue is whether the evidence presented, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, <em>permitted the inference </em>that, during the general period of time when the plaintiffs submitted their application, a site plan was not required from those similarly situated to the plaintiffs, namely, zone change applicants generally. We conclude that the evidence supported this inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">First, there was evidence to support the inference that there had never been a site plan requirement, and that the plaintiffs \u2014 who were penalized in May, 1986, for not having a site plan \u2014 were treated selectively by the defendants. During oral argument before this court, Lewis and Saldibar conceded that there is not and has never been any requirement that an applicant must submit a site plan with an application for a zone change. This statement is consistent with that made by Roark to Lewis and Saldibar during the May proceedings, in which he advised them that it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to submit a site plan with their zone change application.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Moreover, the city\u2019s zoning regulations require \u201c[petitioners [for changes in zoning designations to] submit such documents to the Planning and Zoning Commission as is found necessary for reaching a fair and impartial decision, including maps, and prehminary plans, as well as a written description of scope and content of the proposed development. ...\u201d West Haven Zoning Resolution, art. 7, c. 2-1. During the trial, Saldibar affirmed that there is no mention of a site plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>in the regulations\u2019 listing of the documents that must accompany an application for a change of zone. In fact, the chapter entitled \u201cSite Plan Review and Approval,\u201d is not included in the chapter governing \u201cRequested Changes in Zoning Designations.\u201d See West Haven Zoning Resolution, art. 7, c. 4. This, too, was affirmed by Saldibar during the trial. Similarly, the application form for a change in zone designation does not mention a site plan, indicating only that submissions must include a filing fee, maps, \u201cpreliminary plans [and] a written description of [the] scope and content of the proposed development.\u201d There is no reference to a site plan. During the trial, Lewis confirmed that the zone change application form made no mention of a site plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The inference that there never had been a site plan requirement further was supported by evidence indicating that at least two zone change applications had been approved without site plans during 1986. The first application was considered and granted by the commission during its July 14, 1986 meeting. This application requested a zone change from C-2 and R3-2 to R-4, for property located at 996-998 Campbell Avenue. As previously noted, the plaintiffs\u2019 property also was zoned C-2 and R3-2. The attorney for Lewis and Saldibar expressly conceded that \u201cgoing from a C-2, R3-2 zone to either R-4 or R-5\u201d was a \u201csubstantially similar\u201d request. Although he further maintained that the zone change <em>applications </em>were dissimilar, based, in part, on the alleged differences in the physical areas surrounding both properties,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Saldibar contradicted this testimony by testifying that the mix of businesses surrounding the two properties \u201ccould be considered similar.\u201d Although we previously have concluded that the inference can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>be drawn that <em>any </em>zone change application before the commission during 1986 was similarly situated to the plaintiffs\u2019 application, we note that, when this testimony is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the inference could be drawn that these properties were, in fact, physically similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The second application, which was for property located at 321 Highland Street, was approved by the commission without a site plan on December 9, 1986. The minutes of that hearing indicate the following: \u201cQuestions were asked regarding how much area was involved, how many stories and what was the site plan. [The representative for the applicant] responded that there was over an acre involved, that the building would be two . . . stories and shrubs, trees and lawn would be planted.\u201d Roark responded that \u201ca site plan review would be required in the future,\u201d indicating his recognition that the applicant had addressed all of the questions posed except those regarding a site plan, and that this omission did not preclude the commission from considering the application. The minutes further indicate that it was \u201cLewis [who] presented a motion to adopt the zone change from R3-1 to C-5 which was seconded . . . .The motion was approved unanimously.\u201d At trial, Lewis could not recall having approved this application, and stated that he did not know whether Roark\u2019s comments regarding a site plan being required in the future meant that no site plan had been presented to the commission during the December 9,1986 hearing. Nonetheless, this evidence permits the inference that this zone change application was not accompanied by a site plan application when it was approved by the commission in December, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Second, there was evidence to support the inference that, even if the commission, as a matter of custom and practice, had imposed a site plan requirement despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the absence of such a requirement in the zoning regulations, such a custom and practice had ended in either August, 1986, or after the decision by Judge Schimelman was published in January, 1987, and that at least one other zone change application had been approved without a site plan prior to the effective date of the change. This evidence, therefore, further supported the inference that the plaintiffs were treated selectively by the defendants when they were penalized for not having a site plan in May, 1986. Saldibar testified that, although there had been a policy of requiring site plans with zone change applications, this requirement was abolished in either \u201cJuly or the beginning of August, [1986].\u201d As discussed previously, the plaintiffs offered evidence that the 996-998 Campbell Avenue application for a zone change had been granted without a site plan on July 14,1986. Thus, viewing Saldibar\u2019s testimony most favorably to the plaintiffs, the inference can be drawn that the abolition of the site plan requirement did not occur until August, 1986 \u2014 after the zone change request for the Campbell Avenue property had been granted without a site plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Furthermore, the trial court found that the commission had \u201cdiscontinued this procedural requirement after the court, <em>Schimelman, J., </em>and the corporation counsel for [the city] informed them that a site plan was not required by the regulations.\u201d Although the corporation counsel testified at trial that the change occurred before Judge Schimelman\u2019s decision was released, he could not testify as to when the change occurred. The transcript of the June 23, 1987 hearing, however, indicates that on January 15, 1987, the corporation counsel had sent a letter to Saldibar advising him that Judge Schimelman had sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal \u201cbased upon the confusion which has permeated most of the planning and zoning hearings . . . .\u2019\u2019He subsequently recommended an \u201cimmediate change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>. . . so as to clarify the procedures . . . During the June, 1987 hearing, however, Lewis and Saldibar indicated that they were not aware of the January decision and asked that Garvey read it to them. See footnote 19 of this opinion. Thus, viewing this evidence most favorably to the plaintiffs, the inference can be drawn that any site plan requirement was the result of an unofficial practice of the commissioners, rather than an express regulation, and consequently, the change in the site plan requirement occurred in either January or June, 1987, when the commissioners had <em>actual </em>notice of the trial court\u2019s decision. Under either scenario, it further can be inferred that the application for the change of zone for the Highland Street property that was approved without a site plan in December, 1986, had been approved before the customary practice had been changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">In summary, when all of the evidence on the alleged site plan requirement is viewed most favorably to the plaintiffs, the inference can be drawn that either there never was a site plan requirement, or that there was an implicit site plan requirement and that this requirement was abolished either: (1) during August, 1986; or (2) at some point after publication of the decision by Judge Schimelman on January 9,1987; or (3) on June 23,1987, the date that Saldibar and Lewis first claimed to have learned of Judge Schimelman\u2019s decision. Because the plaintiffs, who were penalized for not having a site plan in May, 1986, offered evidence that zone change applications were approved by the commission without site plans during both July and December, 1986, we conclude that the plaintiffs established a prima facie case that they were treated selectively and maliciously by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The defendants contend, however, that because neither Lewis nor Saldibar voted at the June 23, 1987 rehearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application, the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the application at that meeting cannot be attributed to their conduct and, therefore, no inference maybe drawn that the plaintiffs suffered selective treatment animated by Lewis\u2019 and Saldibar\u2019s malicious and bad faith intent to injure them. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We agree with the decisions of those courts that have recognized that when a government official acts as the moving force behind a deprivation of a plaintiffs constitutional rights, this is sufficient for liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>Malley </em>v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 344 n.7, 106 S. Ct. 1092, 89 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1986) (\u00a7 1983 is read against background of tort liability that makes one responsible for natural consequences of his actions); <em>Jeffries </em>v. <em>Harleston, </em>21 F.3d 1238, 1247 (2d Cir. 1994) (\u201c[a] plaintiff may establish causation under section 1983 if he shows that the defendants participated in, or were \u2018moving forces\u2019 behind, the deprivation\u201d), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 52 F.3d 9 (2d Cir. 1995); <em>Gutierrez-Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em>882 F.2d 553, 561 (1st Cir. 1989) (\u201c[t]he requisite causal connection [for liability under \u00a7 1983] can be established not only by some kind of direct personal participation in the deprivation, but also by setting in motion a series of acts by others which the actor knows or reasonably should know would cause others to inflict constitutional injury\u201d); see also <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Orange County Dept. of Probation, </em>115 F.3d 1068, 1071 (2d Cir. 1996) (\u201can actor [sued under \u00a7 1983] may be held liable for those consequences attributable to reasonably foreseeable intervening forces, including the acts of third parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Thus, the fact that Lewis and Saldibar did not vote on the June 23,1987 rehearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application is not fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 prima facie case. We conclude that the evidence previously discussed, regarding how Lewis and Saldibar', prominent members of the commission, acted toward the plaintiffs throughout the course of the zone change application review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>process, would support the inference that their conduct influenced the votes of the other commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The plaintiffs next claim that the trial court improperly dismissed their action against the city and the commission because the plaintiffs had established a prima facie case that Lewis and Saldibar, in their capacities as policy makers for the city, caused the plaintiffs to be deprived of their constitutional rights. We conclude that the evidence supports the inference that the actions of the commission, with regard to its consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 zone change application, constituted a municipal policy of the city, and that, therefore, the plaintiffs had established a prima facie case against the city and the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">In <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978), the United States Supreme Court overruled in part <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 81 S. Ct. 473, 5 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1961),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and held that \u201c[l]ocal governing bodies . . . can be sued directly under \u00a7 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where . . . the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers.\u201d \u201c[I]t is when execution of a government\u2019s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts injury that the government as an entity is responsible under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>In <em>Pembaur </em>v. Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 106 S. Ct. 1292, 89 L. Ed. 2d 452 (1986), the United States Supreme Court further elaborated on the scope of municipal liability under \u00a7 1983. In <em>Pembaur, </em>the court considered the \u201cofficial policy\u201d requirement discussed in <em>Monell, </em>and concluded that \u201cit is plain that municipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by municipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances.\u201d Id., 480. \u201cIf the decision to adopt [a] particular course of action is properly made by that government\u2019s authorized decisionmakers, it surely represents an act of official government \u2018policy\u2019 as that term is commonly understood.\u201d Id., 481. Further defining the limits of this definition, the court held that \u201cmunicipal liability under \u00a7 1983 attaches where \u2014 and only where \u2014 a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among various alternatives by the officials or officials responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in question.\u201d Id., 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Noting that the courts of appeals had not applied these principles consistently, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>St. Louis </em>v. <em>Praprotnik, </em>485 U.S. 112, 124, 108 S. Ct. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988), \u201cset out again to clarify the issue that we last addressed in <em>Pembaur.\u201d </em>The court stated: \u201cTwo Terms ago, in <em>Pembaur . . . </em>we undertook to define more precisely when a decision on a single occasion may be enough to establish an unconstitutional municipal policy. Although the Court was unable to settle on a general formulation, Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion articulated several guiding principles. First, a majority of the Court agreed that municipalities may be held liable under \u00a7 1983 only for acts for which the municipality itself is actually responsible, that is, acts which the municipality has officially sanctioned or ordered. . . . Second, only those municipal officials who have final policymaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>authority may by their actions subject the government to \u00a7 1983 liability. . . . Third, whether a particular official has final policymaking authority is a question of state law. . . . Fourth, the challenged action must have been taken pursuant to a policy adopted by the official or officials responsible under state law for making policy in that area of the city\u2019s business.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 123. During oral argument before this corut, the city and the commission conceded that the first three of these requirements were satisfied in the present case. The question, therefore, is whether there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the fourth requirement was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The United States Supreme Court recently clarified the proof necessary for a plaintiff to prevail in a \u00a7 1983 action when he or she is alleging a constitutional violation that consists of a single act by an authorized decision maker of the municipality. In <em>Board of County Commissioners </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 404, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1997), the court first affirmed that \u201cit is not enough for a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff merely to identify conduct properly attributable to the municipality. The plaintiff must also demonstrate that, through its deliberate conduct, the municipality was the \u2018moving force\u2019 behind the injury alleged.\u201d Significantly, the court held that \u201c[i]n any \u00a7 1983 suit, however, the plaintiff must establish the state of mind required to prove the underlying violation. Accordingly, proof that a municipality\u2019s legislative body or authorized decisionmaker has intentionally deprived a plaintiff of a federally protected right <em>necessarily establishes that the municipality acted culpably. </em>Similarly, the conclusion that the action taken or directed by the municipality or its authorized decisionmaker itself violates federal law will also determine that the municipal action was the <em>moving force </em>behind the injury of which the plaintiff com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>plains.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 405. Finally, the court confined the breadth of its decision by holding that \u201c[a] plaintiff must [also] demonstrate that a municipal decision reflects deliberate indifference to the risk that a violation of a <em>particular </em>constitutional or statutory right will follow the decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The defendants conceded, both in their brief and during oral argument before this court, that \u201cthe [commission] is capable, in some cases, of making municipal policy . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> They maintain, nonetheless, that the plaintiffs failed to establish their prima facie case of an equal protection violation because \u201ca single act does not necessarily become municipal policy . . . and [the plaintiffs] ha[d] not . . . proven [that] there were repeated acts of constitutional violations.\u201d Although the defendants are correct in their assertion that a single act does not <em>necessarily </em>become municipal policy, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>United States Supreme Court has decided that when an \u201cauthorized decisionmaker has intentionally deprived a plaintiff of a federally protected right [this] necessarily establishes that the municipality acted culpably. Similarly, the conclusion that the <em>action </em>taken or directed by the . . . authorized decisionmaker itself violates federal law will also determine that the municipal action was the moving force behind the injury of which the plaintiff complains.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Board of County Commissioners </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 520 U.S. 405. Thus, the defendants are incorrect in their argument that the plaintiffs\u2019 action necessarily must be dismissed because of their failure to prove repeated acts of constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Board of County </em>Commissioners,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and our determination that an inference can be drawn that Lewis and Saldibar selectively treated the plaintiffs in violation of their constitutional rights, we conclude that the plaintiffs submitted evidence sufficient to establish the inference that \u201cthe challenged action must have been taken pursuant to a policy adopted by the official or officials responsible under state law for making pol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>icy in that area of the city\u2019s business.\u201d <em>St. Louis </em>v. <em>Praprotnik, </em>supra, 485 U.S. 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-10\"> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\"> The named plaintiff, George Thomas, filed the application on behalf of all of the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\"> In 1980, when the plaintiffs acquired their interest in the property, it consisted of two separately zoned parcels, C-2 and R3-2.

The claim that the plaintiffs must establish an entitlement to a zoning change as a predicate to their equal protection challenge has not been briefed, nor has the claim that they are immune from suit under the doctrine of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai6\">Finally, we conclude that, in light of the procedural posture of this case, to the extent that any of the defendants\u2019 remaining alternate grounds for affirmance were raised properly and remain relevant and unaddressed following our disposition of this appeal, those claims will be resolved more properly in the context of a full trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\"> Although the cases cited in support of this standard each involved the alleged selective enforcement of a regulation or ordinance by the defendants against the plaintiffs, selective enforcement is merely a subcategoiy of selective treatment. The test laid out in <em>LeClair </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>supra, 627 F.2d 609-10, is equally applicable to the case at hand, in which the plaintiffs are alleging <em>both </em>that the defendants selectively: (1) <em>enforced </em>an alleged site plan requirement against them; and (2) <em>treated </em>the plaintiffs with an attitude of \u201cdisdain, animosity and palpable hostility\u201d that was not exhibited toward other applicants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> In 1980, the group of persons involved in this business venture were George Thomas, John Finnell and Pasquale Egidio. During 1984, prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the filing of any of the applications at issue in this appeal, Egidio left the business partnership and relinquished his interest in the property. Barbara Thomas had acquired title to a portion of George Thomas\u2019 interest prior to Egidio\u2019s departure in 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\"> A R3-2 district is a general residence district zoned for two-family houses. \u201cThese districts are designed to provide types of residential buildings that will permit a broad range of housing types with appropriate standards for each district on density, open space, and spacing of buildings. The various districts are mapped in relation to a desirable future residential density pattern, with emphasis on accessibility to transportation facilities and to various community facilities, and upon the character of existing facilities and open uses which serve the residents of these districts.\u201d West Haven Zoning Resolution, art. 2, c. 1-2.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\"> A C-2 district is a commercial local service district. Commercial local service districts \u201care designed to provide for a wide range of essential local services not involving regular local shopping. Since these establishments are less frequently visited by customers, they tend to break the continuity of prime retail frontage and therefore, hamper the development of convenient shopping. The permitted services create relatively few objectionable influences for nearby residential areas.\u201d West Haven Zoning Resolution, art. 3, c. 1-2.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\"> An accessory use is defined as \u201c[a] land use located on the same lot or on a contiguous lot under the same ownership in all respects as to title and fractional interest which is incidental and subordinate to that of the main building or use of the land.\u201d West Haven Zoning Resolution, art. 1, c. 3-2.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\"> As highlighted during oral argument before this court, it is not clear from Lewis\u2019 testimony whether it was the commission or the police that actually had granted the permit to the plaintiffs to allow them to operate a pool hall. During the trial, however, Lewis expressly stated, after having his memory refreshed with newspaper articles that had been entered into evidence, that he had been opposed to the plaintiffs\u2019 intentions to operate an amusement center on the property. Thus, viewing these inconsistencies in favor of the plaintiffs, the inference could be drawn that Lewis had disapproved of the plaintiffs\u2019 intentions for the property in 1980, and that this disapproval, which was strong enough to be reported by the local newspapers, negatively predisposed him toward the plaintiffs in 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\"> Earlier in the proceeding, when Lewis w\u00edis criticizing the plaintiffs\u2019 proposal for lacking a site plan, he stated: \u201cThis is not a site plan. A site plan has to have the seal of the architect or an engineer.\u201d Thus, Lewis apparently believed that a complete site plan application had to bear the requisite seal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> Before stepping down, both Lewis and Saldibar wanted to know what they had done wrong in the prior proceeding. Lewis stated that he wanted \u201cto know what the hell I did,\u201d to which Saldibar responded \u201cDon, Don, take it easy.\u201d They subsequently asked Garvey to read them Judge Schimelman\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">In its memorandum of decision in the present case, the trial court, who had listened to the audio tapes of both the May and June hearings, stated that \u201c[a]fter hearing the substance of the [Judge Schimelman\u2019s] decision the discussion continued in heated tones.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b416-10\"><em> As </em>discussed earlier in the text of this opinion, the plaintiffs\u2019 application again was denied unanimously. The plaintiffs again successfully appealed from this decision to the court, <em>Flanagan, J. </em>The plaintiffs did not, however, thereafter seek a rehearing from the commission, but instead brought the present action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> The trial court also found that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate \u201can unconstitutional taking.\u201d As we have indicated; see footnote 9 of this opinion; the plaintiffs do not pursue that claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\"> The plaintiffs in <em>Rubinovitz </em>v. <em>Rogato, </em>supra, 60 F.3d 909, had alleged, among other things, that the selective enforcement of certain state plumbing and gas codes had violated their equal protection rights. Concluding that, \u201c[a]s to code-enforcement . . . the record contains sufficient evidence of selective treatment to forestall summary judgment\u201d; id., 910; the court did not focus on the characteristics of the properties alleged by the plaintiffs to be similarly situated for comparison purposes, but, instead, was persuaded by the fact that the plaintiffs had offered an \u201caffidavit of [the] city plumbing inspector ... in which he states that (1) he had encountered other instances where there was plumbing but no permits and (2) he did not order the plumbing disconnected, as he had with the [plaintiffs].\u201d Id. Similarly, the focus in the present case should not be on whether the actual properties and the changes requested were identical, but, rather, on whether the applicants were similarly situated with regard to the process and rules to which they were subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\"> The conversation that occurred during the May, 1986 hearing between the representative who spoke for the plaintiffs and Roark, indicates that after clarifying that the plaintiffs were seeking a \u201czone change with a conceptual plan that\u2019s basically nonbinding,\u201d Roark was satisfied that a site plan was not required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\"> The attorney also distinguished the properties based on the fact that the site plan requirement purportedly had changed in July, 1986. The evidence regarding when, and if, the site plan requirement was abolished will be discussed in the text of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"> The court in <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 436 U.S. 663, overruled <em>Monroe </em>only \u201cinsofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under \u00a7 1983,\u201d and expressly upheld <em>Monroe </em>\u201cinsofar as it holds that the doctrine of respondeat superior is not a basis for rendering municipalities liable under \u00a7 1983 for the constitutional torts of their employees.\u201d Id., 663-64 n.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\"> Our statutes delegate great authority to local zoning commissions. General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe zoning commission of each city, town or borough is authorized to regulate, within the limits of such municipality, the height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures . . . the density of population and the location and use of buildings .... Such zoning commission may divide the municipality into districts of such number, shape and area as may be best suited to carry out the purposes of this chapter; and, within such districts, it may regulate the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration or use of buildings or structures and the use of land. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cSuch zoning commission shall provide for the manner in which regulations under section 8-2 and the boundaries of zoning districts shall be respectively established or changed. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The city\u2019s resolution on planning and zoning expressly provided that the \u201cCommission shall have all the powers and duties conferred and imposed by the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut on Planning and Zoning Commissions\u201d; West Haven Zoning Resolution, art. 7, c. 1-4; thereby delegating all of the available state statutory powers to the commission. Thus, there is no question that, at least for the purposes of establishing a prima facie case, the inference can be drawn that the commission acted as a policy maker for the city with regard to denying the plaintiffs\u2019 zone change application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in one of the few federal cases to have applied <em>Board of County Commissioners </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 520 U.S. 405, recently affirmed a jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant county. Explaining its decision, the Court of Appeals noted that the United States Supreme Court had decided that plaintiffs could satisfy their burden of establishing \u201c[a] constitutional injury [that] is caused by a municipal policy, custom or practice . . . with proof that the deprivation of the federally protected right was intentionally caused by the municipality\u2019s legislative body or authorized decision-maker.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hulbert </em>v. <em>Wilhelm, </em>120 F.3d 648, 655-56 (7th Cir. 1997). The Court of Appeals subsequently held that the jury\u2019s conclusion that the county was liable to the plaintiff for the county corporation\u2019s actions, which included a reprimand and the ultimate downgrading of the plaintiffs job level in retaliation for his exercising his freedom of speech, \u201cwas supported by the evidence and consistent with the law on municipal liability as recently explained by the Supreme Court.\u201d Id., 656.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
