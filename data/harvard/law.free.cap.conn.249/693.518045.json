J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK4\">The named plaintiffs in these two consolidated appeals, Robert A. Nagy and Hugh Barber, are assistant attorneys general of the state of Connecticut.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1995, the terms of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment were modified to increase gradually the length of their standard workday from seven to eight hours. The principal issue in these appeals is whether, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>of sick or vacation leave earned by the plaintiffs during the time the length of the standard workday was seven hours entitles them to utilize a full day of sick or vacation leave now that the standard workday is eight hours. We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The following facts and procedural history are uncontroverted. In early 1995, the state entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the state P-5 Administrative and Residual Employees Union (P-5 agreement). Pursuant to the P-5 agreement, the length of the union members\u2019 standard workday was increased from seven hours to eight hours.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to that change, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the union members\u2019 sick and vacation leave had been calculated at the rate of seven hours for each day of sick or vacation leave earned. To reflect the change in the length of the standard workday, the P-5 agreement provided that <em>future </em>accruals of sick and vacation leave time would be calculated at a rate of eight hours for each day of leave earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The plaintiffs are nonunionized employees in the classified service of the state and, consequently, the terms of their employment are not governed by the P-5 agreement. In June, 1995, however, the defendant commissioner of the department of administrative services (commissioner), invoking authority provided him by General Statutes \u00a7 5-200 (p),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> extended certain provisions of the P-5 agreement to the plaintiffs. Specifically, the commissioner notified the plaintiffs that, as of July 1, 1995: (1) their standard workday would be increased over four years from seven to eight hours; (2) they would receive a salary increase to reflect the longer workday; and (3) the value of future sick and vacation days would be calculated in accordance with the number of hours in the increased workday. The notification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>also stated that the plaintiffs would receive only seven hours credit toward sick and vacation leave for each day of leave earned prior to July 1, 1995.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Thereafter, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 5-202,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the plaintiffs appealed from the commissioner\u2019s order to the named defendant, the employees\u2019 review board (board),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> claiming that \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250, the statutory provisions that address their rights to sick and vacation leave, entitle them to a full day of leave for each day of sick and vacation leave previously earned, despite the increase in the length of the standard workday. The board denied the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, and the plaintiffs brought this administrative appeal<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from the board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>decision to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court overruled the board\u2019s decision, concluding, as advocated by the plaintiffs, that, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250, the plaintiffs had accrued their sick and vacation time in units of days and not hours, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to a full day of sick or vacation leave for each day previously earned, despite any increase in the standard workday. The defendants then appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Shortly thereafter, Nagy filed a motion in the trial court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a (b),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> seeking an award of costs, while the plaintiffs in the Barber appeal, also pursuant to \u00a7 4-184a (b), filed a motion seeking an award for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The court denied both motions. The plaintiffs then filed a joint appeal in the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court improperly had denied their motions for costs and attorney\u2019s fees. We consolidated the appeals and transferred them to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly determined that: (1) \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 entitle the plaintiffs to a full day of sick or vacation leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>for each day of sick or vacation leave earned prior to the increase in the length of the standard workday to eight hours; and (2) alternatively, the commissioner\u2019s order extending the benefits of the P-5 agreement to the plaintiffs did not supersede the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to sick and vacation time pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The defendants first claim that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 entitle the plaintiffs to a full day off for each day of sick and vacation leave previously earned, despite the increase in the length of the standard workday. In other words, the defendants maintain that \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 grant sick and vacation leave in units of <em>hours </em>rather than in units of <em>days. </em>To the contrary, the plaintiffs maintain that, although \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 <em>allow </em>the state to <em>calculate </em>sick and vacation leave in units of <em>hours, </em>those statutory provisions <em>grant </em>sick and vacation time in units of <em>days. </em>Consequently, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants\u2019 failure to increase the value of their previously earned sick and vacation days commensurate with the increased length of the standard workday impermissibly diminished the total number of days of sick and vacation leave that they had earned prior to the gradual increase in the length of the standard workday to eight hours.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>As a threshold matter, we determine the applicable standard of review. \u201cOrdinarily, this court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to carry out the statute\u2019s purposes. . . . [A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. . . . Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Furthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Baby Z., </em>247 Conn. 474, 493-94, 724 A.2d 1035 (1999). The board\u2019s determination that \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 do not require the defendants to increase the value of sick and vacation leave previously accrued by the plaintiffs to reflect the gradual increase of the standard workday has not been subject previously to judicial review, and is a pure question of law involving the interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions. Consequently, we afford the conclusion of the board no special deference. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">We begin our analysis by noting that interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 is a matter of statutory construction. In interpreting statutes we previously have stated that \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 635, 642, 729 A.2d 212 (1999); <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Dohmann, </em>247 Conn. 274, 286, 722 A.2d 1205 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">\u201c \u2018As with any issue of statutory interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the operative statutory provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 642; <em>In re Baby Z., </em>supra, 247 Conn. 498. Section 5-247 (a), the statute that addresses the granting and accrual of sick leave, provides in relevant part: \u201cEach appointing authority shall grant, on account of illness or injury, to each full-time employee in a permanent position in the state service who has furnished satisfactory proof of such illness or injury, such sick leave with pay as has accrued to his credit at the rate of one and one-quarter working <em>days </em>for each completed calendar month of continuous full-time service which <em>may </em>be computed on an hourly basis. Hourly computation of sick leave shall not diminish benefit entitlement. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, by its own terms, \u00a7 5-247 grants the plaintiffs one and one-quarter <em>days </em>of sick leave each month, and only <em>permits </em>the state to track the total number of days that an employee has earned in units of hours. The language of \u00a7 5-247, furthermore, indicates that the computation of sick leave in units of hours \u201cshall not\u201d reduce the days of leave that an employee is entitled to utilize. In other words, the language of \u00a7 5-247 strongly suggests that the reference to hourly computation of sick leave was intended to allow the calculation of an employee\u2019s accrued sick leave in units of hours for internal administrative purposes only, and not for the purpose of determining the days of sick leave an employee previously had earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Section 5-250 (a), the statutory provision that addresses the granting and accrual of vacation leave, similarly provides in part: \u201cEach appointing authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>shall grant to each full-time employee in a permanent position in the state service, who has worked at least one full calendar year, an annual vacation with pay of twenty-one consecutive <em>calendar days </em>or its equivalent. Each such employee who has completed twenty year s of service shall be entitled to <em>one day </em>for each additional year up to twenty-five years of service, and each such employee with twenty-five or more years of service shall be entitled to not more than <em>twenty days </em>.... Computation of such vacation leave may be made on an hourly basis. Hourly computation of vacation leave shall not diminish benefit entitlement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As with \u00a7 5-247, this statutory provision indicates that employees earn vacation leave in units of days, but that an employee\u2019s earned vacation leave may be calculated in units of hours. Again, \u00a7 5-250 specifically provides that the conversion of vacation days into an hourly figure may not operate to reduce the benefits to which the employee is entitled. Thus, the language of \u00a7 5-250 also strongly suggests that the hourly calculation of vacation leave has no independent significance, and that instead, it is merely a representation, in units of hours, of the total number of vacation days that an employee has earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Moreover, the legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 also indicates that the hourly computation of sick and vacation leave was not intended to govern the determination of the number of sick and vacation days an employee has earned. As initially enacted in 1967, \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 referred to sick and vacation leave <em>exclusively in terms of days. </em>Public Acts 1967, No. 657, \u00a7\u00a7 55 and 58. In 1979, however, Public Acts 1979, No. 79-621, amended \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 to allow for the calculation of sick and vacation leave in units of hours. In the discussion on the floor of the House of Representatives of House Bill No. 7678, the bill that eventually was enacted as Public Acts 1979, No. 79-621, Representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>John J. Tiffany II, and Representative Gardner E. Wright, Jr., engaged in a colloquy regarding the effect of permitting the hourly calculation of sick and vacation leave. Specifically Representative Tiffany remarked: \u201cI notice on page 19 and 20, we\u2019re making a number of changes from the converting [of] days to hours. . . . [W]ill the State or the State employees stand to gain or lose from this change? Will there be any reduction or additional privileges?\u201d 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 31, 1979 Sess., p. 11,009. In response to Representative Tiffany\u2019s question, Representative Wright, the sponsor of the bill, stated: \u201cThe purpose of doing that is because our new computer system calculates everything in hours and we are able to calculate employees\u2019 benefits, vacations in terms of hours instead of days in the new system. <em>And that\u2019s the only reason. </em>We have been assured and we have assured the State employees that this will not increase or decrease anybody\u2019s benefits. They will remain exactly as they are at present.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., pp. 11,009-10. Thus, Representative Wright\u2019s remarks manifest an intention to permit the hourly calculation of sick and vacation leave only as a matter of administrative convenience, and not as a change in the method of accruing sick and vacation days.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In light of the language and legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250, we conclude that the hourly calculation of sick and vacation leave authorized by those statutory provisions may not operate to reduce the total number of days of sick and vacation leave that an employee has earned. Consequently, \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 entitle the plaintiffs to the number of <em>days </em>of sick and vacation leave previously earned, despite an increase in the number of hours in their standard working day. Therefore, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250, an employee who earns one day of sick or vacation leave is entitled to utilize one day of sick or vacation leave regardless of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>lengthening of the standard workday. Simply put, a day is a day is a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The defendants next claim that even if \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 provide that an employee who earns one day of sick or vacation leave is entitled to utilize one day of sick or vacation leave regardless of any lengthening of the standard workday, the plaintiffs\u2019 sick and vacation leave still is not entitled to such treatment. In support of this claim, the defendants set forth the following three step argument: (1) with respect to the treatment of the plaintiffs\u2019 previously accrued sick and vacation days, the terms of the P-5 agreement conflict with and supersede \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250; (2) \u00a7 5-200 (p) grants the commissioner authority to extend to the plaintiffs rights and benefits based on those granted to employees covered by the P-5 agreement and provides that an order of the commissioner granting such rights and benefits shall prevail over any contrary provision of the General Statutes; and (3) consequently, to the extent that the commissioner\u2019s order conflicts with \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250, the commissioner\u2019s order controls. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">We begin by examining the first proposition in the defendants\u2019 argument, namely, that the provisions of the P-5 agreement conflict with and supersede \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 with respect to the treatment of previously accrued sick and vacation leave. In order for the P-5 agreement to conflict with those statutory sections in the manner suggested by the defendants, the P-5 agreement must provide, in effect, that the value of union members\u2019 previously accrued sick and vacation leave would <em>not </em>be adjusted commensurate with the increase in the length of the standard workday. The P-5 Administrative and Residual Employees Union, however, as amicus curiae in the present case, vigorously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>contends that the P-5 agreement contains no such provision. Moreover, in the proceedings before the board and at trial, no factual finding was made with respect to whether the P-5 agreement either expressly or implicitly addresses the treatment of union members\u2019 previously accrued sick and vacation leave. As such, the record before us does not permit a finding that the P-5 agreement, in fact, contains a provision that conflicts with \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Moreover, even if we were to assume, without deciding, that the P-5 agreement provides that the value of union members\u2019 previously accrued sick and vacation leave will not be adjusted to reflect the increased length of their standard workday, we still would be unable to conclude that such provision supersedes \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250. General Statutes \u00a7 5-278,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the statute that permits a collective bargaining term to supersede inconsistent statutes or regulations, explicitly provides that, in order for a provision of a collective bargaining agreement that conflicts with a statute or regulation to be effective, that provision must be submitted to the legislature for its approval. We previously have stated, moreover, that \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 5-278 (b) implicitly requires that, in order for the legislature to \u2018approve or reject\u2019 a collective bargaining agreement term in conflict with law, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>particular contract term must be stated <em>distinctly </em>and <em>correctly </em>by the employer in the transmittal of the contract to the legislature. If the notification required by \u00a7 5-278 (b) did not apprise the legislature of the conflicting sick [and vacation] leave term[s], then [those] termfsj, at variance with General Statutes [\u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250], would be ultra vires. Put another way, a term at variance with law, not approved by the legislature in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 5-278 (b), does not enjoy the preferential position provided for legislatively approved conflicting terms by \u00a7 5-278 (e), but is rendered a nullity. Neither party to the agreement is therefore entitled to enforce that term.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Federation of Technical College </em>Teachers, 179 Conn. 184, 197, 425 A.2d 1247 (1979). Just, as the record does not permit a conclusion that the P-5 agreement conflicts with \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250, with respect to the treatment of previously earned sick and vacation leave, the record also does not permit a conclusion that any such conflicting provisions in the P-5 agreement, if they in fact exist, were submitted to the legislature and approved. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the P-5 agreement supersedes \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 with respect to the treatment of previously accrued sick and vacation leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Because the record does not support the conclusion that the P-5 agreement contains a provision that conflicts with \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250, or that if such a conflict does exist, that it supersedes \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 5-278, we cannot assume that the treatment of previously accrued sick and vacation leave contained in the commissioner\u2019s order was based on the provisions of the P-5 agreement. Consequently, on the record before us, we cannot conclude that, pursuant \u00a7 5-200 (p), the commissioner\u2019s order superseded \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250 with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the treatment of previously accrued sick and vacation leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">We conclude, therefore, that, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs are entitled to the number of days of sick and vacation leave previously earned, despite an increase in the number of hours in their standard workday. Accordingly, the judgments of the trial court on the merits must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 JOINT APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">In their joint appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly denied their motions for attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a (b). Specifically, the plaintiffs maintain that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard in determining that they were not entitled to reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">\u201cThe decision to award attorney\u2019s fees for unjustified agency actions is within the discretion of the trial court. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a (b); <em>Labenski </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>41 Conn. App. 866, 871, 678 A.2d 496, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 910, 682 A.2d 1002 (1996). Thus, \u00a7 4-184a (b) provides that the \u2018court may, in its discretion,\u2019 award reasonable fees to the prevailing party if the court determines that the agency acted \u2018without any substantial justification.\u2019 . . . Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>224 Conn. 445, 467, 619 A.2d 453 (1993) (reversal warranted \u2018where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done\u2019).\u201d <em>Burinskas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>240 Conn. 141, 154-55, 691 A.2d 586 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">\u201cSection 4-184a (b) authorizes a court to grant attorney\u2019s fees if it determines that the action of the agency was undertaken without any substantial justification. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>We recently have concluded that substantial justification . . . connotes reasonableness or a reasonable basis in law or fact. <em>Burinskas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 156. Thus, we have construed \u00a7 4-184a (b) as requiring an action that is entirely unreasonable or without any reasonable basis in law or fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Profit Providers for the Aging </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>244 Conn. 378, 401, 709 A.2d 1116 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Our examination of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision reveals that, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, the trial court articulated and applied the correct legal standard for the determination of an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 4-184a (b). Moreover, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in determining that the defendants\u2019 actions in the present case were not \u201centirely unreasonable or without any reasonable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Burinskas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 156. Consequently, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for attorney\u2019s fees and costs is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-10\"> The other plaintiffs, Ronald Blanchette, Leo T.
