(Philbury),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from 111 separate judgments of strict foreclosure of municipal real estate tax liens rendered in favor of the plaintiff, the city of Danbury (city), after contested foreclosure actions tried to the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issues involved are whether: (1) Philbury should have been permitted in these foreclosure proceedings to contest the assessments underlying the liens being foreclosed; and (2) the trial court properly awarded fees and costs in each of the 111 cases. We affirm the judgment in all respects except for the award of sheriffs fees, which we reverse and remand for a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-10\">Certain facts and the procedural histoiy are undisputed. The properties involved constitute 111 individual lots of an undeveloped, or paper, subdivision. Although it is not clear from the record precisely how many lots there are in the subdivision, it is undisputed that: the properties involved in these cases do not constitute all of the lots; the properties do not constitute all of the acreage in the subdivision; and the foreclosure of the liens does not cover all of the acreage in the subdivision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>It further is undisputed that the properties are identified separately on the subdivision map, and have generated separate tax assessor\u2019s numbers, separate tax bills, and separate tax liens of varying amounts. It also is undisputed that: the subdivision originally was approved in 1974; despite the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 8-26c,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> its approval has been extended periodically over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>the past two decades; and the most recent extension, to August 31,1998, was granted pursuant to a request by Philbury to the city\u2019s planning and zoning commission.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">By a writ returnable in May, 1994, the city brought these 111 separate actions to foreclose on the 111 separate tax liens that it duly had filed against the properties for unpaid real estate taxes for the tax years 1985 through 1991. Dana Investment Corporation (Dana), the owner of the properties at that time, was the named defendant, along with Philbury, which also was named as a defendant because it held a mortgage on the properties that was subordinate to the city\u2019s tax liens.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because there were numerous lienholders against the properties, there were eighteen defendants named in the writ. Thereafter, Philbury foreclosed on the mortgage that it held and thereby acquired title to the properties. In June, 1995, the city withdrew the actions against Dana, and proceeded against Philbury as the owner of the properties. Thereafter, in July, 1996, the city amended the complaint to include foreclosure of tax liens for the tax years 1992 through 1994, so that the actions as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>ultimately tried were for foreclosure of tax liens representing unpaid taxes for the years 1985 through 1994. Philbury filed four special defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">In its first special defense, Philbury challenged the validity of the city\u2019s assessments of the properties \u201cfor the tax years in question\u201d on the grounds that the assessments were \u201cmanifestly excessive, could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of such property,\u201d and that the city, therefore, \u201cshould be equitably estopped from collecting all such outstanding taxes.\u201d In its second special defense, Philbury alleged that, \u201cby commencing 111 separate actions,\u201d the city had violated General Statutes \u00a7 52-248,* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cand comes to this proceeding with unclean hands . . . thereby incurring unnecessary and duplicative costs and fees including . . . filing fees, title search fees, appraiser fees, sheriff fees, lis pendens fees, hen charges and attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Philbury also alleged that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-257,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u00a7 422, now \u00a7 18-15,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201call such duplicative and unnecessary costs and fees should be disallowed.\u201d Philbury further alleged that the city \u201ccould have, and should have, commenced a single action rather than 111 duplicative matters.\u201d In its third special defense, Philbury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>alleged that the city had unclean hands because it had caused the sheriff to serve process in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 52-261,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cand in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>manner so as to maximize the fees associated with commencing [the] proceedings, thereby incurring unnecessary and duplicative costs and fees.\u201d In its fourth special defense, Philbury incorporated the allegations of the first three defenses, and alleged further that the city\u2019s conduct was immoral, unfair and deceptive, constituting a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The city moved to strike Philbury\u2019s special defenses, and the trial court granted the motion. Thereafter, in February, 1997, the cases were tried together as contested foreclosure cases. At the conclusion of the evidence on February 20, 1997, when Philbury sought to address the city\u2019s bill of costs, the court determined that the bill of costs would be passed on by the clerk as an initial matter, after which \u201cthere can be an appeal to the court.\u201d Philbury agreed to this procedure. Then, in each case, the court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure, and awarded the city in each case: (1) an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>attorney\u2019s fee of $1600, for a total of $177,600; (2) a title search fee of $100, for a total of $11,100; and (3) an appraiser\u2019s fee of $110, which consisted of $100 for the appraisal and $10 for the appraiser\u2019s testimony in court,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for a total of $12,210. The court set a law day for Philbury of June 2, 1997, having taken into account Philbury\u2019s evidence that it had a potential buyer for 80 to 85 of the 111 lots for a total of approximately $1.3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Thereafter, Philbury filed an objection to the city\u2019s bill of costs in each case and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 412, now \u00a7 18-5 (a),* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the parties appeared before the clerk for taxation of costs. The clerk taxed costs in each case based upon the city\u2019s bill of costs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Philbury sought review by the trial court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 18-5 (b), and upon review, the court overruled Philbury\u2019s objections and entered the following orders awarding in each case: (1) an entry fee of $150, which already had been paid by the city, for a total of $16,650; and (2) sheriff\u2019s fees of approximately $1500, for a total of approximately $170,000.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court purportedly calculated the sheriffs fees according to \u00a7 52-261; see footnote 9 of this opinion; as follows: \u201c3505 miles traveled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>at .21 cents per mile, per writ and per lis pendens for a total of $1472.10 ($736.05 for all writs and $736.05 for all lis pendens).\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as they pertain to the various claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Philbmy first claims that the trial court improperly struck its four special defenses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">In its first special defense, Philbury alleged that the assessments on the properties for the tax years in question were manifestly excessive and could have been arrived at only by disregarding the statutes governing valuation of real property for tax purposes and, therefore, that the city should have been equitably estopped from collecting the taxes. Philbury claims that the trial court improperly struck this defense because \u201cPhilbury was wholly incapable of utilizing the statutory remedies\u201d for challenging the assessments when they were made. Philbury argues that it was incapable of challenging the assessments earlier because: (1) it did not exist as a corporation during the relevant period;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>even if the interests of Philbury\u2019s predecessor in interest, namely, Wedgestone, were imputed to Philbury, Wedgestone was merely a mortgagee on the properties and a mortgagee may not avail itself of the statutory procedures for appealing tax assessments. These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">It is well settled that, if the owner of the properties at the times of the assessments in question had wanted to challenge the assessments, it would have been required to follow the appropriate statutory procedures, either by (1) timely appealing from the assessments to the city\u2019s board of assessment appeals pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-111 and 12-112,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and from there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>by timely appealing to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12~117a,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or (2) timely bringing a direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-119.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201c[A] taxpayer who has failed to utilize the available statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>remedies [may not] assert, in an action to collect a tax . . . that the tax has not been properly assessed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Faith Center, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 487, 491, 493 A.2d 883 (1985); <em>Farmington </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>26 Conn. App. 545, 549-50, 602 A.2d 1047 (1992), appeal dismissed, 224 Conn. 592, 619 A.2d 852 (1993). The rationale for this rule is the need on the part of the government for fiscal certainty. A municipality, like any governmental entity, needs to know with reasonable certainty what its tax base is for each fiscal year, so that it responsibly can prepare a budget for that year. See <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>200 Conn. 697, 710, 513 A.2d 77 (1986) (both General Statutes [Rev. to 1985] \u00a7\u00a7 12-118 and 12-119 \u201climit to a short period the time within which the property owner can seek relief under them, and the purpose of this is undoubtedly to prevent delays in the ultimate determination of the amounts, a municipality can collect as taxes\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>130 Conn. 699, 702,37 A.2d 237 (1944) (same). Public policy requires, therefore, that taxes that have not been challenged timely cannot \u201cbe the subject of perpetual litigation, at any time, to suit the convenience of the taxpayer. ... A taxpayer who has not sought redress in an appropriate manner is foreclosed from continuing litigation outside [those] statutes.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Assn. of America </em>v. <em>State, </em>209 Conn. 679, 692, 553 A.2d 1104 (1989).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The same rule and the same policy apply to Philbury, regardless of whether it was in existence at the time of the assessments and irrespective of the legal status of its predecessor in interest as mortgagee, rather than owner. As a subsequent title holder, Philbury acquired no greater rights to challenge the prior assessments than was possessed by its immediate assignor or by any prior assignee from the owner of the properties at the time of the assessments. Philbury has presented no case, and we have found none, that permits a subsequent owner to raise an untimely challenge to an assessment simply because it was not in existence or did not have the legal standing to mount such a challenge at the time of the original assessment. Moreover, the policy underlying the rule applies with equal force to Philbury. To permit such an untimely challenge would wholly undermine the need for fiscal certainty upon which the rule is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">In its second and third special defenses, Philbury sought to challenge, on the basis of the unclean hands doctrine, what it claimed were unnecessarily duplicative filing fees, attorney\u2019s fees, title search fees, sheriffs fees and lis pendens fees. Philbury argues that the trial court improperly struck these defenses because, in an equitable proceeding, costs are discretionary and must be awarded as part of the judgment or not at all. This argument is equally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">It is important to note the purely procedural nature of this question. The question is not whether Philbury was entitled to challenge the fees and costs involved by appropriate procedures and at appropriate times. The question is, rather, whether it was entitled to challenge the fees and costs by way of a special defense to the city\u2019s complaint for foreclosure of the liens. We conclude that it was not entitled to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\u201cThe purpose of a special defense is to plead facts that are consistent with the allegations of the complaint but demonstrate, nonetheless, that the plaintiff has no cause of action.\u201d <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Bassman, </em>221 Conn. 465, 472-73, 604 A.2d 814 (1992); see also Practice Book \u00a7 10-50 (\u201c[f]acts which are consistent with [the plaintiffs] statements [of fact] but show, notwithstanding, that the plaintiff has no cause of action, must be specially alleged\u201d). The city\u2019s cause of action in each case was for foreclosure of its tax liens. Practice Book \u00a7 10-70<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> sets forth what a plaintiff needs to allege in order to foreclose a municipal tax or assessment lien. The fees and costs form no part of those necessary allegations. Moreover, Philbury, by its allegations, did not purport to claim that the city could not foreclose on its liens by virtue of the multiple fees and costs that Philbury challenged; it sought only to bar the awarding of those fees and costs incident to any such foreclosures. In short, the fees and costs had nothing to do with whether the city had a good cause of action for foreclosure of its liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>We fail to see the relevance of Philbury\u2019s argument that costs in an equitable action are discretionary with the court. See Practice Book \u00a7 18-15 as set forth in footnote 8 of this opinion. It is elementary that, whether fees and costs are a matter of right or discretion, they ordinarily are awarded to the party that prevails in the case and, until there is a prevailing party, they do not arise. They play no role in determining whether a party has the right to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Philbury also relies on <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford Trust Co., </em>72 Conn. 86, 43 A. 555 (1899), for the proposition that \u201c \u2018in equitable actions, costs are discretionary, <em>and if they are not awarded as part of the judgment, they are not taxable at all.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) That case more properly is characterized as standing for the proposition that, in an equitable action, \u201c[t]he omission to tax costs either for or against [a party] may fairly be regarded as equivalent to a decision that no such costs ought to be taxed . . . .\u201d Id., 96. Thus, when the court in an equitable action ultimately taxes costs, they ought to be reflected in the judgment as finally constituted. That does not mean, however, that a challenge to such costs can constitute a special defense to the substantive equitable cause of action on which the plaintiff seeks to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">In its fourth special defense, Philbury alleged that the city had violated CUTPA by overassessing the properties and by bringing 111 foreclosure actions, rather than just one action, thus engendering needless costs and fees. Philbury claims that the trial court improperly struck this defense because CUTPA is a legally cognizable defense to a foreclosure action, and because \u201cthe statutory exemption under CUTPA for public entities is wholly inapplicable.\u201d We disagree and conclude that the trial court properly struck this special defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>First, this special defense merely incorporated the facts alleged in the first three special defenses. It did not allege any additional facts. As for the facts alleged in the first special defense, Philbury may not contest the underlying assessments in this case indirectly by way of a CUTPA special defense anymore than it could by attempting to do so directly, as it attempted to do in its unsuccessful first special defense. As for the facts alleged in the second and third special defenses, those facts concern only the costs and fees, and do not invalidate the city\u2019s underlying foreclosure causes of action. Those facts no more suffice to invalidate the city\u2019s foreclosure action on CUTPA grounds than they do on the grounds of unclean hands. Philbury gains nothing by attaching a CUTPA label to those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Second, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a) provides: \u201cNo person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d Section 42-110a (4) defines \u201c l[t]rade\u2019 and \u2018commerce\u2019 [as] the advertising, the sale or rent or lease, the offering for sale or rent or lease, or the distribution of any services and any property, tangible or intangible, real, personal or mixed, and any other article, commodity, or thing of value in this state.\u201d Even if we were to assume that, in collecting real estate taxes owed to it, the city was engaged in \u201ctrade\u201d or \u201ccommerce,\u201d we conclude that Philbury\u2019s special defense founders on General Statutes \u00a7 42-110c (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cNothing in this chapter shall apply to: (1) Transactions or actions otherwise permitted under law as administered by any regulatory board or officer acting under statutory authority of the state or of the United States . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">In <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>213 Conn. 354, 362, 567 A.2d 1212 (1990), we held that the actions of a municipal housing agency were exempt from CUTPA because the agency, a creature of statute, was acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>pursuant to and was regulated pervasively by statutes and regulations that \u201cset forth in great detail the municipal landlord\u2019s responsibilities and provide [d] carefully balanced procedural and substantive remedies . . . .\u201d In addition, using the history of the Federal Trade Commission Act as \u201cthe lodestar\u201d for interpreting CUTPA, \u201cwe were unable to discover any instance in which that act ha[d] been applied to any act or practice of a local public agency . . . .\u201d Id., 363-64. The same rationale applies to the city in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The process by which the city assesses real estate is authorized and regulated expressly by a pervasive statutory scheme. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-328, 12-40, 12-49, 12-52, 12-53, 12-53a, 12-55, 12-60, 12-62, 12-62h, 12-63b, 12-63c, 12-63d, 12-63e, 12-81, 12-81a, 12-81f, 12-89,12-102, 12-107c, 12-107d, 12-107e, 12-109, 12-117,12-120, 12-129n, 12-170, 12-170\u00cd, 12-170aa, 12-198, 12-199, 12-504b, 12-504\u00cd and 15-101bb. In addition, the procedures by which a taxpayer may challenge those assessments are set forth by a statutory scheme that carefully balances both the procedural and substantive remedies. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-53,12-53a, 12-60, 12-63c, 12-89, 12-103, 12-107c, 12-107d, 12-107e, 12-107\u00cd, 12-111, 12-129d, 12-170 and 12-170cc. Furthermore, the processes by which the city may collect unpaid taxes are set forth explicitly by statute. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-135, 12-142, 12-145, 12-146, 12-146b, 12-155, 12-161 and 12-166. Finally, Philbury has presented no case, and we are aware of none, in which CUTPA has been applied to a municipality that is acting pursuant to statute in order to collect unpaid taxes by foreclosing on previously unchallenged tax liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Philbury next claims that, irrespective of whether the fees and costs may be challenged by way of a special defense, it was improper for the trial court to award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>multiple entry fees, attorney\u2019s fees, appraisal fees and sheriffs fees in these cases. Specifically, Philbury argues that: (1) with respect to the entry fees and the sheriffs fees, neither the clerk nor the trial court had the authority to order those fees because the court had not awarded them at the time of the rendition of the judgments of strict foreclosure; (2) the city was required by the terms of \u00a7 52-248; see footnote 6 of this opinion; and Practice Book \u00a7 133, now \u00a7 10-21,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to bring one foreclosure action, rather than 111 such actions, resulting in unnecessarily duplicative and excessive fees; (3) the sheriffs fees should have been disallowed as \u201cpatently outrageous\u201d; and (4) the total of the costs and fees in these cases is so grossly excessive as to constitute an \u201cunconstitutional taxing\u201d of Philbury\u2019s property. Although we disagree with Philbury\u2019s first, second and fourth claims, we conclude that, with respect to the third claim, the trial court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>equitable discretion in awarding the amount of sheriffs fees that it did, and we remand the cases for a new hearing on these fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">We first consider Philbury\u2019s argument that the trial court and the clerk lacked authority to order the entry fees and the sheriffs fees because the court had not awarded them at the time of the rendition of the judgments of strict foreclosure. Philbury contends that, in an equitable action, costs are discretionary with the court \u201cand <em>if they are not awarded as part of the judgment, they are not taxable at all. </em>\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Thus, under Philbury\u2019s view, when the court rendered its judgment of strict foreclosure and entered awards of attorney\u2019s and appraiser\u2019s fees, the court\u2019s failure also to award entry fees and sheriffs fees barred both the clerk and the court from thereafter doing so. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">First, Philbury agreed to leave the imposition of costs for entry fees and sheriffs fees to the clerk, subject to subsequent review by the trial court if necessary. Second, the procedure that occurred in the present case is precisely the procedure contemplated by Practice Book \u00a7 18-5; see footnote 11 of this opinion; which specifically provides for review by the court of the clerk\u2019s taxation of such costs, if timely requested. Indeed, that procedure makes eminent sense, and is undoubtedly the procedure followed by most if not all of our trial judges in foreclosure cases. Unlike entry fees and sheriffs fees, which in the ordinary case involve only ministerial calculations by the clerk of the court, the award of attorney\u2019s fees, title search fees and appraiser\u2019s fees involve the exercise of judicial discretion regarding professional services, some of which are rendered in the presence of the court and some of which are rendered outside of the presence of the court. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ordinarily the court will enter an order of attorney\u2019s fees, title search fees and appraiser\u2019s fees when it renders its judgment of foreclosure, leaving the matter of other costs to the procedures provided by the rules of practice. Under this sensible framework, the court has ample opportunities to consider any appeals to its equitable discretion regarding such fees and costs, either at the time it makes such awards or subsequently, upon review of the clerk\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">We next consider Philbury\u2019s argument that the city was required by \u00a7 52-248 and Practice Book \u00a7 10-21 to bring all of these cases in one action, which necessarily would have resulted in reduced fees. We agree with the city and the trial court that the city was not so required.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Section 52-248 provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen two or more civil actions are pending in the same court at the same time for the recovery of the same demand . . . the court shall not allow any costs in any such action, unless it is of the opinion that the commencement of all of the actions was necessary to secure the demand.\u201d The trial court properly reasoned that these 111 cases were not \u201cfor the recovery of the same demand.\u201d As the trial court noted, each lot was a separate tax entity, with separate and varying tax bills and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>liens thereon, and varying values. They were not all contiguous to each other, and did not constitute the entire acreage in the subdivision. Moreover, Philbury and its predecessors in interest successfully had kept them as part of an approved subdivision, which was to its obvious economic advantage, rather than to permit them to revert to raw acreage. Furthermore, Philbury had a potential buyer for only 80 to 85 of the 111 lots, indicating that it could not have regarded the properties as constituting one indivisible parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In addition, General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7\u00a7 12-182 and 12-183<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> indicate that there are certain instances in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>which a municipality may combine multiple tax lien foreclosures in one civil action. Under those statutes, however, the tax collector must be of the opinion that the value of any of the separate properties does not exceed $20,000, and that its value is less than the total amount of the tax liens and other encumbrances thereon. As the city\u2019s counsel suggested at oral argument before this court, the city considered this option, but at the inception of the case could not in good faith certify to such values. In any event, Philbury has made no showing that these statutes were so clearly applicable such that it was somehow abusive for the city not to avail itself of them. Indeed, in view of Philbury\u2019s evidence that it had a potential purchaser for 80 to 85 of the lots for approximately $1.3 million, it is difficult to see how it could have argued that none of the lots exceeded $20,000 in value and that such value was less than the value of the tax lien thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">To the extent that Philbury\u2019s argument seeks to invoke the clean hands doctrine, the trial court was correct in declining to apply that doctrine so as to bar the city from collecting multiple fees and costs in the circumstances of this case. Philbury and its predecessors in interest had not made any tax payments on any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>of the 111 lots for ten years. Indeed, Philbury characterized its failure to pay the taxes, after gaining title to the properties in 1995, as a \u201cprudent business decision.\u201d As the trial court aptly noted, the clean hands doctrine should not be employed at the behest of a party that asserts it to avoid the consequences of its own wrongdoing. <em>Cohen </em>v. Cohen, 182 Conn. 193, 204, 438 A.2d 55 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Philbury\u2019s reliance on Practice Book \u00a7 10-21; see footnote 21 of this opinion; requires little discussion. Put most simply, that provision by its terms spells out when certain separate causes of action may be joined in one complaint. It does not purport to mandate when they must be so joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">We do not rule out the possibility that there may be egregious cases of multiple tax lien foreclosures in which, apart from the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 12-182 and 12-183, the trial court could exercise its equitable discretion to withhold certain fees and costs. As Philbury points out, and the city agrees, it has long been our law that \u201c[cjosts in equitable actions are in the discretion of the court . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Markham </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>119 Conn. 355, 367, 176 A. 880 (1935); General Statutes \u00a7 52-257 (e) (\u201c[t]he provisions of this section [governing costs in civil actions] shall not interfere with the discretion of the court in taxing costs in actions in which equitable relief is demanded\u201d); Practice Book \u00a7 18-15 (costs in equitable causes of action \u201cshall be discretionary\u201d). It is also our law, however, that \u201cordinarily [costs in equitable actions] are awarded upon the same basis as in actions at law.\u201d <em>Markham </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 367. The trial court in this case carefully considered the equities, and did not abuse its discretion in determining that those equities did not require the city to forego the ordinary costs because it brought these multiple actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>This analysis, then, brings us to General Statutes \u00a7 12-193,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> which specifically covers \u201c[c]ourt costs, reasonable appraiser\u2019s fees, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by a municipality\u201d in tax lien foreclosure cases. Despite the statute\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in its first clause and \u201cmay\u201d in its second clause, we conclude from its legislative history that it was intended to put municipalities on a par with private foreclosing parties regarding costs and fees, and therefore to incorporate into such cases the long-standing principle that costs and fees in equitable actions are discretionary with the court, but ordinarily are imposed as in actions at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Section 12-193 was enacted in two different parts, at two different times, and with two different purposes, both consistent with the general purpose to treat municipal tax lien cases like private foreclosure cases insofar as costs and fees are concerned. Prior to the 1975 amendment, General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-193 <em>prohibited </em>the taxation of costs and fees in municipal tax lien foreclosure cases.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In 1975, the legislature enacted No. 75-73 of the 1975 Public Acts, which amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 12-193, General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 12-193 provides: \u201cCourt costs, reasonable appraiser\u2019s fees, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by a municipality as a result of any such foreclosure and directly related thereto shall be taxed in any such proceeding against any person or persons having title to any property so foreclosed.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>purpose of Public Act 75-73 was to give municipalities the same rights to costs and fees as were afforded to private parties in foreclosure cases. See 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 3, 1975 Sess., p. 1347, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In 1988, General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 12-193 was amended by adding the second clause, namely, \u201cand may be collected by the municipality once a foreclosure action has been brought pursuant to section 12-181 or 12-182.\u201d Public Acts 1988, No. 88-153, \u00a7 1. The purpose of Public Act 88-153 also was to put municipalities on a par with private foreclosing parties, but in a different way. Prior to Public Act 88-153, it was not clear to municipalities whether, under the statute as amended by Public Act 75-73, a municipality could recover its costs and fees in a tax hen foreclosure case that did not proceed to final judgment. Thus, as often happened, if the delinquent taxpayer sought to pay his taxes in full after a tax lien foreclosure action had been commenced, the municipalities were not certain that they could require payment of the costs and fees as well, or whether in accepting the back taxes they were required to forego the expenses incurred in bringing the action. The purpose of Public Act 88-153 was to solve this problem for the municipalities, and to make clear that they could require the delinquent taxpayer to pay not only the back taxes, but the costs of the foreclosure action as well. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 5, 1988 Sess., pp. 1411-12, remarks of Susan Weisselberg, assistant corporation counsel for New Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Applying the principle, therefore, as did the trial court, that costs and fees in these separately filed cases are discretionary with the court, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the entry fees, attorney\u2019s fees, title search fees and appraiser\u2019s fees. The city was required to pay 111 entry fees for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>justifiably bringing 111 separate actions. The attorney\u2019s fees were based on the time spent by the city\u2019s attorneys in preparing and litigating the 111 contested cases, were amply documented and, indeed, were <em>less than </em>the amount incurred by Philbury for the fees charged by its attorneys for litigating the same cases. Similarly, the city\u2019s attorneys were required to search 111 separate titles. The appraiser\u2019s fees were based on the separate appraisals of 111 separate parcels and the appraiser\u2019s testimony regarding each parcel, for which the court awarded the reasonable sum of $100 for the appraisal and $10 for the testimony. Thus, except for the entry fees, these fees were no different than had the city brought one action, rather than 111 separate actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">We next consider the sheriffs fees in the total approximate amount of $170,000. See footnote 13 of this opinion. We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The following facts are undisputed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The sheriff served process in all of the cases at the same time. He served fourteen of the original eighteen defendants by making a single trip from Danbury to Hartford, and stopping at two law firms and the office of the secretary of the state. Nonetheless, he calculated his charges as if he had made separate trips in unrelated matters. The sheriff charged $11,000 for travel fees in serving process, and in excess of $3600 for travel expenses associated with filing the 111 lis pendens on the land records in Danbury. His mileage charges were calculated as if he had traveled in excess of 51,000 miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">In addition to \u00a7 12-193, which covers court costs in municipal tax lien foreclosure cases, sheriffs fees also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>are governed by \u00a7 52-261. See footnote 9 of this opinion. Irrespective of what \u00a7 52-261 would justify in an ordinary case of multiple service of process by a sheriff, the facts of this case are extraordinary. As we have indicated, ultimately in awarding costs in an equitable proceeding, such as a foreclosure of lien, the court must exercise its discretion. It was an abuse of that discretion to award the sheriffs fees in these cases as if the sheriff had traveled approximately twice the earth\u2019s circumference in serving process, and had made 111 separate trips in filing the various lis pendens. The court should have exercised further oversight, and reduced the total sheriffs fees to a reasonable amount, taking into account the actual amount of travel engaged in and the services performed, with a reasonable premium added based on the fact that the sheriff was responsible for properly serving 111 writs, rather than just one writ, and filing 111 lis pendens, rather than just one lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Philbury\u2019s final claim, namely, that the total fees and costs<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in these cases constitutes an unconstitutional taxing of Philbury\u2019s property, requires little discussion. Specifically, Philbury argues that the imposition of the total fees and costs in these cases \u201cdoes not involve an exercise of the taxing power, but constitutes, in substance and effect, the direct exertion of a different and forbidden power, as, for example, the confiscation of property.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Windham First Taxing District </em>v. Windham, 208 Conn. 543, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>557-58, 546 A.2d 226 (1988). We already have determined that the entiy fees, the attorney\u2019s fees, the title search fees and the appraisal fees were properly calculated and awarded. We also have determined that the sheriffs fees must be reduced drastically and recalculated. There is no merit to Philbury\u2019s constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The judgment is reversed with respect to the award of sheriffs fees and the case is remanded to the trial court for a new hearing on the amount of those fees and for the imposition of new law days.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C. J., and NORCOTT and KATZ, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b21-11\"> Philbury was the owner of the properties involved at the time of the judgment of foreclosure and the awarding of costs that are at issue in this appeal, and is the only appealing party.

I am baffled by the majority\u2019s decision in this case. There is no plausible legal reason why the plaintiff, the city of Danbury, asserted more than 100 separate actions to foreclose tax liens on paper subdivisions of the same parcel of land. By doing so, the plaintiff incurred 111 sets of attorney\u2019s fees, 111 court entiy fees, 111 sheriffs fees, 111 appraisal fees, and 111 title search fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of these 111 foreclosure actions, the plaintiff incurred fees and costs in the amount of $388,000, all in an effort to collect taxes of less than $400,000 from a single entity. Significantly, the majority does not attempt to make the absurd argument that all of these actions were necessary. Instead, the majority claims that \u201cthese 111 cases were not \u2018for the recoveiy of the same demand.\u2019 \u201d This is clearly false. Even if it were true, however, it would not somehow legitimize the plethora of separate actions. It is apparent that the plaintiff should have asserted only one foreclosure action, thereby incurring only one attorney\u2019s fee, one court entry fee, one sheriffs fee, one appraisal fee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>and one title search fee. By condoning the plaintiffs tactic of extracting 111 separate fees and costs from what should have been a single foreclosure action, the majority of this court demeans the legal profession and undermines the credibility of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">It is necessary to put these foreclosure actions in their proper perspective. \u201cForeclosure is peculiarly an equitable action, and the court may entertain such questions as are necessary to be determined in order that complete justice may be done.\u201d <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Lenczyk, </em>153 Conn. 457, 463, 217 A.2d 694 (1966). Accordingly, we must take as our lodestar the principle that, above all else, the fees and costs that we allow in the present case must be equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">I shall begin by briefly stating the material facts. The named defendant in this case, Dana Investment Corporation, owned the relevant property; the defendant Wedgestone Realty Investors Trust (Wedgestone) held a mortgage on that property. When Wedgestone went into bankruptcy, it assigned its mortgage to the defendant Philbury, Inc. (Philbury), a corporation created to hold and liquidate Wedgestone\u2019s assets for the benefit of its creditors. In sharp contrast to the plaintiffs 111 separate actions to foreclose tax hens, Philbury foreclosed the interests of eighteen lienholders in a single transaction \u2014 thereby incurring a single court entry fee, a single sheriffs fee, a single appraiser\u2019s fee, a single set of taxable court costs, and a single attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">As a threshold matter, it has been well established for more than 200 years that the trial court \u2014 and not the clerk \u2014 must tax costs as part of an equitable judgment. See, e.g., <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford Trust Co., </em>72 Conn. 86, 96, 43 A. 555 (1899) (\u201c[t]he omission to tax costs either for or against [a party] may fairly be regarded as equivalent to a decision that no such costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ought to be taxed, and can support no exception in his favor\u201d); <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>1 Kirby (Conn.) 231 (1787) (execution ought not issue against mortgagor for costs on bill for foreclosure, but should be taxed by court); <em>Cassidy </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>14 Conn. Sup. 39, 40 (1946) (\u201cunless awarded as part of the judgment costs cannot be taxed\u201d); W. Horton &amp; K. Knox, 1A Connecticut Practice Series: Practice Book Annotated (4th Ed. 1998) \u00a7 18-5, comments, p. 81 (\u201cif [costs in an equitable action] are not awarded as part of the judgment, they are not taxable at all\u201d); 20 C.J.S. 121, Costs \u00a7 143 (1990) (\u201c[i]n respect of costs which require judicial investigation and determination, the court can order taxation only at a time at which final judgment is rendered\u201d). Accordingly, the trial court incorrectly struck Philbury\u2019s second and third special defenses, which alleged that the costs associated with the assertion of 111 separate actions were inequitable and should not be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Turning to the merits of this case, the trial court abused its discretion by awarding fees and other costs of nearly $388,000 to collect taxes of less than $400,000 from a single entity. The lion\u2019s share of this staggering fee was incurred by instituting 111 separate actions when only one was necessary. The award is simply outrageous.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Even the majority concedes that the trial court \u201cabused its equitable discretion in awarding the amount of sheriffs fees that it did . . . .\u201d The sheriff charged in excess of $170,000 for \u2014 at best \u2014 thr ee weeks of work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This works out to something on the order of $8500 per day. I cannot imagine how anyone could possibly disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the fees awarded to the sheriff must be reversed. Nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the majority leaves in place the 111 attorney\u2019s fees and other costs associated with the assertion of 111 separate foreclosure actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">It is apparent to me that the logic by which the majority reverses the award of sheriffs fees applies with full force to the other costs that the plaintiff needlessly incurred. Aside from different docket numbers, the pleadings, motions, court appearances and briefs that the plaintiff used in every single one of the 111 actions were identical to one another.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even the title of each case was identical. In essence, the only difference between the sheriff whose wrist the majority slaps and the attorney whom the majority slaps on the back is the fact that the latter was required to engage in xerography \u2014 that is, a secretary employed by the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>attorney had to ran off 111 copies of the same documents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The majority also condones the taxation of other duplicative costs in this case, thus ignoring the fact that what it characterizes as 111 \u201cseparate tax entities]\u201d were in fact nothing more than paper subdivisions of a single parcel of land. The majority straggles to leave the impression that 111 separate title searches and 111 separate appraisals consumed 111 times more energy than a single title search and appraisal would have required. The majority is simply incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The plaintiff probably could not have been prevented from instituting 111 separate foreclosure actions on paper subdivisions of the same parcel of land. This does not, however, mean that the trial court was required to multiply the costs associated with foreclosing a single parcel of property by a factor of 111. In an equitable action such as a foreclosure, costs are in the discretion of the trial court. See, e.g., <em>Markham </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>119 Conn. 355, 367, 176 A. 880 (1935). \u201cWhile it is normally true that this court will refrain from interfering with a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion . . . this presupposes that the trial court did in fact exercise its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Karp, </em>243 Conn. 495, 504, 706 A.2d 1 (1998); see <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>v. <em>Lee, </em>229 Conn. 60, 73-74, 640 A.2d 553 (1994) (\u201c[i]n the discretionary realm, it is improper for the trial court to fail to exercise its discretion\u201d). \u201c[Discretion imports something more than leeway in decision-making. . . . It means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Karp, </em>supra, 504. It is apparent from the record in this case that the trial court failed to exercise its discretion in the interests of justice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In my view, decisions such as the one that the majority renders today further erode the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. The plaintiffs decision to bring 111 separate actions multiplied the proper cost of foreclosure by a factor of 111 and imposed a substantial and unnecessary burden on our courts \u2014 even though our dockets are already bursting at the seams \u2014 thus depriving other litigants of their right to speedy trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-9\"> The attorneys representing the plaintiff on appeal did not initiate these actions.

The court asked the plaintiffs attorney to assume that 720 hours were necessary to prosecute a single foreclosure.

The trial court apparently believed that it had no discretion to refrain from taxing Philbury for the costs associated with each of the 111 foreclosure actions, because each one was \u201cseparate and necessary ... to secure the demand requested.\u201d For the reasons discussed previously, this belief was erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
