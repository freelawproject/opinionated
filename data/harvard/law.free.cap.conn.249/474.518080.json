We answer the question in the affirmative and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The following facts were set forth by the Appellate Court and are relevant to the disposition of this appeal. \u201cMichele Lee, a union member, is a [correction] officer who was discharged for excessive unauthorized absences while stationed at the Northeastern Community Correctional Center at Storrs. Through the union, she grieved her discharge on the ground that her unauthorized absences from work were justified because they were due to depression caused by sexual harassment on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u201cFollowing a denial of the grievance at its earlier stages, the union filed for arbitration with the state board of mediation and arbitration, as required by its collective bargaining agreement. The relevant portion of the submission for arbitration was: \u2018Was the termination of Michele Lee for just cause? If not, what shall be the remedy, consistent with the terms of the NP-4 contract?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u201cThe hearing concluded on June 2, 1995, and briefs were filed on July 14, 1995. The arbitrator issued the following award on August 11, 1995: \u2018There was not just cause for the dismissal of the grievant. The grievant shall be reinstated to a position at Niantic [Correctional Center] or another facility agreeable to the grievant and to the union. Jurisdiction shall be retained [for] sixty days to resolve any issues related to the remedy.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u201cThe state filed an application with the trial court to vacate the award . . . [and] the court rendered judgment [in 1997] vacating the award because it found that the award failed to fix definitively the rights of the parties. The trial court further held that because the award was not final, definite and mutual, thirty days after the hearing concluded on July 14,1995, as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>by General Statutes \u00a7 52-416, the award could not be said to be timely on the date that the court rendered judgment. Accordingly, the court concluded that it lacked authority pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (b) to remand the case for rehearing.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 1565, </em>49 Conn. App. 33, 34-35, 713 A.2d 869 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The union appealed to the Appellate Court, which held that the trial court had properly vacated the award. Id., 37. The Appellate Court; also determined that \u201c[t]he trial court improperly concluded that it lacked the statutory authority to direct the case for rehearing.\u201d Id., 40-41. The Appellate Court remanded the case \u201cfor the trial court to exercise its discretion in determining whether the case should be remanded to the arbitrator for rehearing.\u201d Id., 41. The state sought to appeal to this court, and we granted certification to appeal limited to the issue set forth at the beginning of this opinion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">When the trial court granted the state\u2019s application to vacate the arbitration award in February, 1997, General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 52-418 (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided that, \u201c[i]f an award is vacated and the time within which the award is required to be rendered has not expired, the court or judge may direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.\u201d The Appellate Court determined that the time period had not expired and that \u00a7 52-418 (b) applied. The state sought certification to appeal the issue of whether the time within which the award must have been rendered had expired. We did not grant certification as to that issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We begin, therefore, by analyzing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the trial court\u2019s power to order a \u201crehearing by the arbitrators.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The state argues that, under the circumstances of this case, \u00a7 52-418 (b) requires a de novo hearing before a new arbitrator. In the absence of such a hearing, it argues, only a modification of the remedy portion of the award, rather than a rehearing, would result with the original arbitrator. Alternatively, the state argues that the question whether the original arbitrator or a new arbitrator conducts the rehearing should be left to the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The union responds that \u00a7 52-418 (b) mandates a rehearing by the original arbitrator when the time within which to render an award has not expired, and permits the trial court to define only the scope of the rehearing. The union argues that the statute mandates that the rehearing take place before \u201cthe arbitrators,\u201d and does not allow for a new arbitrator or a new panel of arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">To resolve this issue, we must construe the meaning of \u00a7 52-418 (b). \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alvarado </em>v. <em>Black, </em>248 Conn. 409, 414-15, 728 A.2d 500 (1999). \u201cWe have held that in ascertaining legislative intent, a statute is to be considered as a whole, with a view toward reconciling its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>separate parts in order to render an overall reasonable interpretation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Hartford Technical Institute, </em>Inc., 243 Conn. 454, 461, 704 A.2d 222 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The plain language of the statute does not mandate a rehearing before the original arbitrator when an award is vacated and the time within which to render an award has not expired. Section 52-418 (b) provides that \u201cthe court or judge may direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.\u201d In the context of this statute, the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d leads us to conclude that such a rehearing is within the discretion of the trial court. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>221 Conn. 128, 140, 602 A.2d 977 (1992); <em>A. Dubreuil &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lisbon, </em>215 Conn. 604, 611, 577 A.2d 709 (1990); <em>Fritz </em>v. <em>Madow, </em>179 Conn. 269, 272, 426 A.2d 268 (1979). A reading of the entire statute and its purpose also leads to the conclusion that, although it is within the discretion of the trial court to decide whether to submit the issues to the initial arbitrator, the court may also refer the matter to a new arbitrator. Indeed, many of the defects resulting in a vacated award require a hearing before a new arbitrator if the injured party is to obtain meaningful relief. Corruption, partiality or bias on the part of the original arbitrator would, by any common sense reading of the statute, require a hearing before a new arbitrator.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>over, the text of a recent amendment to \u00a7 52-418 (b); see Public Acts 1997, No. 97-134; which mandates a rehearing, notwithstanding the time within which the award is vacated, if any issue is in dispute,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> omits the language \u201crehearing by the arbitrators\u201d for such a rehearing, thus reinforcing our conclusion that a rehearing by the original arbitrator is discretionary in cases in which the time to render an award has not expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The state also argues that the legislative policy embodied in General Statutes \u00a7 51-183c, which prohibits a judge who tries or presides over a case in which a new trial is granted from retrying the case or presiding over the retrial, should apply to arbitration proceedings. The simple answer is that \u00a7 51-183c, by its plain terms, applies only to judges. No similar provision has been enacted to apply to arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Moreover, the legislature passed the 1997 amendment to \u00a7 52-418 (b) well after our decision in <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Bulaong, </em>218 Conn. 51, 588 A.2d 138 (1991), in which we recognized that a timely rehearing before the original arbitrator is permissible. In <em>Bulaong, </em>we stated that \u00a7 52-418 (b) \u201cgoverns the circumstances under which the court, upon vacating an award pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a), may order a rehearing by the <em>same </em>arbitrators. Section 52-418 (b) provides: \u2018If an award is vacated and the time within which the award is required to be rendered has not expired, the court or judge may direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.\u2019 . . . Presumably, that time has long since passed .... The court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>confined, therefore, to vacating the award pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a), and the plaintiff is left with the option of initiating a second arbitration proceeding. Of course, the parties may agree, with the concurrence of the initial arbitrators, to conduct the second proceeding before the initial arbitrators.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 64 n.11. The 1997 amendment, by not requiring the initiation of a second arbitration proceeding after the award time had elapsed, could be read to acknowledge the existence of our decision in <em>Bulaong. </em>The 1997 amendment left intact the language of \u00a7 52-418 (b) permitting a timely rehearing \u201cby the arbitrators.\u201d \u201cWhere this court interprets a statute and the legislature fails to take action to change that interpretation, it raises the presumption that the legislature has acquiesced in that interpretation. <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>203 Conn. 425, 439, 525 A.2d 91 (1987); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutoiy Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984 Rev.) \u00a7 45.10. . . . The legislature is presumed to be aware of the interpretation that courts have placed on existing legislation and of the implications that we will draw from its inaction. <em>Scheyd </em>v. <em>Bezrucik, </em>205 Conn. 495, 506, 535 A.2d 793 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>224 Conn. 231, 239 n.12, 618 A.2d 501 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We also reject the union\u2019s argument that a rehearing must always be held before the original arbitrator. We read <em>Bulaong </em>and <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 591 A.2d 101 (1991), as recognizing that \u00a7 52-418 (b) prohibits a rehearing before the initial or original arbitrator after the time to render an award has passed. In <em>Chmielewski, </em>we held that, because \u201cthe time within which the original award was required to [have been] rendered had long [since] expired . . . [a]bsent an agreement of the parties, the specific terms of \u00a7 52-418 (b) prohibited the court from remanding the case to the original panel of arbitrators, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>and any issues not decided by that panel will necessarily have to be decided by a new panel. See <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Bulaong, </em>[supra, 218 Conn. 64].\u201d <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 680. Neither <em>Bulaong </em>nor <em>Chmielewski </em>held that a rehearing before the original arbitrator, which might have been ordered if the time within which to render an award had not elapsed, was mandated by \u00a7 52-418 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We, therefore, conclude that the trial court may, in its discretion, determine whether, in this case, a rehearing shall be held before the original or a new arbitrator. There may be circumstances in which the trial court might recognize the potential for a conflict if the rehearing were to take place before the original arbitrator, even in cases in which no additional evidence may be required. The exercise of sound discretion by the trial court gives the party seeking to vacate the award meaningful and complete relief. Our resolution of this issue leaves the trial court with the power to effect fully the purposes of \u00a7 52-418.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> Hereinafter, except as otherwise provided, all references to \u00a7 52-418 (b) are to the 1997 revision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\"> The st ate\u2019s petition for certification presented two questions. First, \u201c[d]id the Appellate Court err in holding that the term \u2018reasonable time\u2019 for purposes of a timely state board of mediation and arbitration award, issued pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 31-98, includes the entire appeal process?\u201d Second, \u201c[d]id the Appellate Court err in holding that a rehearing following a vacatur of an arbitration award, pursuant to ... \u00a7 52-418 (b), does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>require a <em>de novo </em>arbitration proceeding before a new and independent arbitrator?\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 52-418 (a) provides: \u201cUpon the application of any party to an arbitration, the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides or, in a controversy concerning land, for the judicial district in which the land is situated or, when the court is not in session, any judge thereof, shall make an order vacating the award if it finds any of the following defects: (1) If the award has been procured by corruption, fraud or undue means; (2) if there has been evident partiality or corruption on the part of any arbitrator; (3) if the arbitrators have been guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other action by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b498-7\"> Since its amendment in 1997, \u00a7 52-418 (b) provides: \u201cIf an award is vacated and the time within which the award is required to be rendered has not expired, the court or judge may direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.
