The plaintiff claims that the relevant taxation scheme, as applied to it, violates the due process clause and commerce clause of the federal constitution. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">After paying the 1993 income taxes imposed on the trusts in question, the plaintiff requested refunds from the defendant, who denied the requests. The plaintiff appealed from the denials to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-730.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the trial court, the parties stipulated to the facts, submitted uncontroverted affidavits, and filed cross motions for summary judgment. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied the plaintiffs motion, and rendered judgment for the defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The facts are undisputed. The plaintiff, a banking corporation incorporated under the laws of New York, is the trustee of the four testamentary trusts, namely, the Parry Trust, the Dallett Trust, the Stewart Trust and the Worcester Trust, and of the single inter vivos trust, namely, the Adolfsson Trust. All of the trusts are resident trusts as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>(4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Each testamentary trust is \u201ca trust . . . consisting of property transferred by will of a decedent who at the time of his death was a resident of this state\u201d;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (4) (C); and the inter vivos trust is \u201ca trust . . . consisting of the property of . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>a person who was a resident of this state at the time the property was transferred to the trust if the trust was then irrevocable . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (4) (D) (i); see footnote 6 of this opinion. More specifically, the Parry Trust was established in 1968 under the will of Sidney L. Parry, a Connecticut domiciliary, and was probated in the Probate Court for the district of Westport. The Dallett Trust was established in 1975 under the will of John Dallett, a Connecticut domiciliary, and was probated in the Probate Court for the district of Westport. The Stewart Trust was established in 1974 under the will of Elvira R. Evens, a Connecticut domiciliary, and was probated in the Probate Court for the district of New Canaan. The Worcester Trust was established in 1936 under the will of James N. Worcester, a Connecticut domiciliary, and was probated in the Probate Court for the district of New Canaan. The Adolfsson Trust is an irrevocable inter vivos trust established in 1955 by Charles Anderson Dana, a Connecticut domiciliary.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">It is undisputed that the plaintiff, acting as trustee, did not maintain any presence and was not a domiciliary or a resident of Connecticut, and that no asset of any trust was located in Connecticut in 1993. No aspect of trust administration was conducted in Connecticut in 1993, and except for this proceeding and the probate proceedings delineated later in this opinion, the plaintiff, as trustee, has not been the subject of any judicial or administrative proceeding in any Connecticut forum. The assets of all of the trusts for 1993 consisted solely of cash and securities held in accounts of the plaintiff as trustee in New York. None of the trusts earned any income derived from or connected with the ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>or disposition of any interest in real or tangible personal property, or from a business, trade, profession or occupation carried on by the trust in Connecticut or elsewhere. None of the four testamentary trusts paid any income taxes to any other state for 1993. The stipulation is silent on this point regarding the inter vivos trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">None of the beneficiaries of the Parry Trust or the Dallett Trust was, or has been since its establishment, a resident or a domiciliary of Connecticut. The current income beneficiary of the Parry Trust is Elizabeth B. Parry. The trustee has the discretion to distribute principal to her, and up to 50 percent of the income to the testator\u2019s grandchildren. Upon the death of Elizabeth B. Parry, Elizabeth Parry Miller will become the beneficiary and, upon her death, the trust will terminate and the trust assets will be distributed to the testator\u2019s then living issue. The current income beneficiary of the Dallett Trust is John Dallett, Jr. The trustee has discretion to distribute the principal to him. Upon his death, the trust will terminate and the trust assets will be distributed to Cassandra Dallett. With respect to the Stewart Trust, since its establishment in 1974, Grace Evens Stewart, a Connecticut domiciliary, was the income and discretionary principal beneficiary until her death in 1995, when the trust was terminated and the trust property was distributed to her two children, one of whom was a Connecticut resident. With respect to the Worcester Trust, the current income beneficiary is, and was during 1993, James N. Worcester, Jr., a Connecticut domiciliary, and upon his death the trust property will be distributed either by virtue of his exercise of a general testamentary power of appointment or, in default of such an appointment, to his four children, one of whom is currently a Connecticut domiciliary. With respect to the Adolfsson Trust, the sole current income beneficiary is, and was in 1993, Sandra Leigh Dana, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Connecticut domiciliary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1993, she was thirty-nine years old. The trust will terminate upon her death or when she reaches the age of forty-eight, when the trust property will be distributed to her outright if she is then living or, if not, pursuant either to her testamentary power of appointment or to her then living descendants, who are currently her children living with her in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Under the terms of the Parry Trust, the plaintiff is excused from rendering periodic accounts to the Probate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-177<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>accordingly, the plaintiff has not rendered any such periodic accounts. Thus, the plaintiff has been involved in probate proceedings only with respect to the probating of the testator\u2019s will. Under the terms of the Stewart Trust, the plaintiff is excused from rendering periodic accounts to the Probate Court pursuant to \u00a7 45a-177; see footnote 9 of this opinion; and, accordingly, the plaintiff has not filed any such periodic accounts. At the termination of the trust in 1995, however, the plaintiff filed a first and final account for the period 1975 through 1995, which the Probate Court approved in February, 1996. With respect to the Dallett Trust, the plaintiff has filed six periodic accounts in the Probate Court for the periods 1976-79,1979-82, 1982-85, 1985-88,1988-91 and 1991-93, all of which the Probate Court approved. With respect to the Worcester Trust, the plaintiff has filed forty-one periodic accounts in the Probate Court, from 1937 through 1995, all of which the Probate Court approved. With respect to the Adolfsson Trust, the plaintiff has appeared in a Connecticut court only in connection with this tax appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Before considering the merits of the plaintiffs claims, it is useful to discuss the application of the relevant tax statutes to the resident testamentary trusts and the inter vivos trust in this case. For the 1993 tax year, General Statutes \u00a7 12-700 (a)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> imposed a tax on \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Connecticut taxable income\u201d of all residents of the state, including trusts and estates. Under General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (9),* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the \u201c \u2018Connecticut taxable income of a resident trust or estate\u2019 shall mean the taxable income of the fiduciary of such trust or estate as determined for purposes of the federal income tax,\u201d subject to certain adjustments not relevant here. Under \u00a7 12-701 (a) (4) (C), a resident testamentary trust is \u201ca trust, or a portion of a trust, consisting of property transferred by will of a decedent who at the time of his death was a resident of this state . . . .\u201d Thus, all of the testamentary trusts in this case were resident trusts, and all of their 1993 undistributed taxable income statutorily was taxable in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The statutory taxation scheme of an inter vivos trust, however, is somewhat different and more complicated. Under \u00a7 12-701 (a) (4) (D), a resident inter vivos trust is \u201ca trust, or a portion of a trust, consisting of the property of (i) a person who was a resident of this state at the time the property was transferred to the trust if the trust was then irrevocable . . . .\u2019\u2019An inter vivos trust\u2019s taxable income for federal income taxes is considered \u2014 again, subject to certain adjustments not relevant here \u2014 to be its \u201cConnecticut taxable income.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 12-701 (a) (9). This taxable income is modifiable, however, according to a formula that takes into account whether there is any resident non-contingent beneficiary of the trust.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under the formula set forth in \u00a7 12-701 (a) (4),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> if there are no nonresident noncontingent beneficiaries, there is no modification. If, however, there are nonresident noncontingent beneficiaries then, as the defendant explains: \u201c[T]he income simply would be prorated and assigned to this State based upon the ratio of Connecticut noncontingent beneficiaries to all noncontingent beneficiaries. Thus, unlike testamentary trusts, inter vivos trusts are taxed only on that portion of the undistributed income which corresponds to the number of in-state [noncontingent] beneficiaries.\u201d In the present case, therefore, the Adolfsson Trust is a resident inter vivos trust and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>because its only noncontingent beneficiary is a Connecticut domiciliary, all of its 1993 undistributed income was taxable in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">As is evident from this discussion, the taxability of the income of the resident testamentary trusts in this case is based on the fact that the testators were Connecticut domiciliaries at the time of their deaths. The taxability of the income of the inter vivos trust in this case is based on the fact that the settlor of the trust was a Connecticut domiciliary when the trust was established and the beneficiary is a Connecticut domiciliary. The plaintiff claims that this taxation scheme, as applied to it, violates the due process clause and the commerce clause of the federal constitution. We consider the plaintiffs contentions in turn. We conclude that none of them is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">DUE PROCESS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"A-B\">A</p>\n<p id=\"AV\">The Testamentary Trusts</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">With respect to the testamentary trusts, the plaintiff argues that, \u201c[f]or Connecticut\u2019s power to tax these trusts to be upheld, Connecticut must provide the trusts with contemporaneous benefits, protections and opportunities. Those in turn must be \u2018fiscally\u2019 relevant to the rights of the trustees to receive and enjoy income, and sufficient in scope to justify categorizing the trusts as <em>domiciliaries. </em>However, Connecticut did not provide the trusts with such contemporaneous benefits and protections because, for each trust, the trustees, the trust assets and administration were located outside of Connecticut\u2019s borders.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We are not persuaded by this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>We begin with the observation that our task of evaluating the constitutionality of a legislative scheme of taxation is somewhat circumscribed. \u201cA state is free to pursue its own fiscal policies, unembarrassed by the Constitution, if by the practical operation of a tax the state has exerted its power in relation to opportunities which it has given, to protection which it has afforded, to benefits which it has conferred by the fact of being an orderly, civilized society.\u201d <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>J. C. Penney Co., </em>311 U.S. 435, 444, 61 S. Ct. 246, 85 L. Ed. 267 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u201cAs a general principle, a State may not tax value earned outside its borders. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>303 U.S. 77, 80-81 [58 S. Ct. 436, 82 L. Ed. 673] (1938). The broad inquiry in a case such as this, therefore, is \u2018whether the taxing power exerted by the state bears a fiscal relation to protection, opportunities and benefits given by the state. The simple but controlling question is whether the state has given anything for which it can ask return.\u2019 <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>J. C. Penney Co., </em>[supra, 311 U.S. 444].\u201d <em>ASARCO, Inc. </em>v. <em>Idaho State Tax Commission, </em>458 U.S. 307, 315, 102 S. Ct. 3103, 73 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">This \u201cbroad inquiry\u201d has been refined further into a two part test. \u201cFor a State to tax income generated in interstate commerce, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes two requirements: [1] a \u2018minimal connection\u2019 between the interstate activities and the taxing State, and [2] a rational relationship between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise. <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Bair, </em>437 U.S. 267, [272-73, 98 S. Ct. 2340, 57 L. Ed. 2d 197] (1978); see <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>386 U.S. 753, 756 [87 S. Ct. 1389, 18 L. Ed. 2d 505] (1967), [rev\u2019d on other grounds, <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>504 U.S. 298, 306, 112 S. Ct. 1904, 119 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1997)]; <em>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. </em>v. <em>Missouri Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>390 U.S. 317, 325 [88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>S. Ct. 995, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1201] (1968).\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxes of Vermont, </em>445 U.S. 425, 436-37, 100 S. Ct. 1223, 63 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1980); see also <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>supra, 306 (\u201cThe Due Process Clause \u2018requires some definite link, some minimum connection between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax,\u2019 <em>Miller Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>347 U.S. 340, 344-45 [74 S. Ct. 535, 98 L. Ed. 2d 744] (1954), and that the \u2018income attributed to the State for tax purposes must be rationally related to \u201cvalues connected with the taxing state.\u201d \u2019 <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Bair, </em>[supra, 273].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Neither party has focused at all on the second part of this due process test, namely, that the income attributed to the state must be rationally related to values connected with the taxing state.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Both parties have focused, instead, on the first part of the due process test, namely, that there be some definite link or minimum connection between the state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax. We confine our discussion, therefore, to that aspect of the test as it applies to the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 301, the United States Supreme Court confronted a due process challenge to North Dakota\u2019s imposition of a statutory duty on an out-of-state mail order house to collect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>and pay a use tax on goods purchased for use within the state. The court began its analysis by repeating the familiar two part test: \u201cThe Due Process Clause requires some definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax, <em>Miller Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>[supra, 347 U.S. 344-45], and that the income attributed to the State for tax purposes must be rationally related to values connected with the taxing State, <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Bair, </em>[supra, 437 U.S. 273].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>supra, 306. The court noted, moreover, that \u201c[h]ere, we are concerned primarily with the first of these requirements.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The court then employed what it termed the \u201c[c]om-parable reasoning\u201d; id., 308; of the due process cases in the field of \u201cjudicial jurisdiction.\u201d Id., 307. In doing so, the court \u201cabandoned more formalistic tests that focused on a defendant\u2019s \u2018presence\u2019 within a State in favor of a more flexible inquiry into whether a defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum made it reasonable, in the context of our federal system of Government, to require it to defend the suit in that State.\u201d Id. Thus, the court in <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 308, overruled, \u201cas superseded by developments in the law of due process,\u201d the prior holdings in the area of sales and use taxes; see, e.g., <em>National Bellas Hess, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue, </em>supra, 386 U.S. 753; that \u201csome sort of physical presence\u201d of the seller in the taxing state is required in order for the state to impose such a duty on the seller. <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>supra, 306-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In place of a physical presence of the out-of-state mail order seller, the court borrowed, from the adjudicative jurisdictional cases, the concept that such jurisdiction was valid where a foreign corporation had \u201cpurposefully avail [ed] itself of an economic market in the forum . . . .\u201d Id., 307. Applying that concept, the court noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>that the seller had \u201cengaged in continuous and widespread solicitation of business within [the] State.\u201d Id., 308. This activity gave the seller \u201c \u2018fair warning that [its] activity [subjected it] to the [tax] jurisdiction of [the state].\u2019 \u201d Id.; see also id., 312 (\u201c[w]e have, therefore, often identified \u2018notice\u2019 or \u2018fair warning\u2019 as the analytic touchstone of due process nexus analysis\u201d). In this regard, the record indicated that the seller solicited business in North Dakota through catalogs and flyers, advertisements in national periodicals, and telephone calls. It made approximately $1 million in sales to approximately 3000 North Dakota customers, making all deliveries by mail or common carrier from out-of-state. Id., 302. In addition, the court noted with approval the state\u2019s assertion that it had provided the following benefits to the seller: it had created an economic climate that had fostered demand for the seller\u2019s products; it maintained a legal infrastructure that protected that market; and it disposed of twenty-four tons of catalogs and flyers mailed into the state by the seller every year. Id., 304. On this record, the court concluded that \u201cthere is no question that [the seller] has purposefully directed its activities at North Dakota residents, that the magnitude of those contacts is more than sufficient for due process purposes, and that the use tax is related to the benefits [the seller] receives from access to the State. We therefore agree with the North Dakota Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the Due Process Clause does not bar enforcement of that State\u2019s use tax against [the seller].\u201d Id., 308.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In light of this development in the law of due process and taxation, the question in the present case becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>whether the contacts between the testamentary trusts and Connecticut are sufficient constitutionally for Connecticut to treat the trusts as if they were domiciliaries of the state and, therefore, for Connecticut to tax the undistributed income of the trusts. We conclude that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">It is well established that a state may tax all of the income of one of its domiciliaries, irrespective of the source of that income, geographical or otherwise. <em>Oklahoma Tax Commission </em>v. <em>Chickasaw Nation, </em>515 U.S. 450, 462-63, 115 S. Ct. 2214, 132 L. Ed. 2d 400 (1995) (applying \u201cwell-established principle of interstate and international taxation \u2014 namely, that a jurisdiction, such as Oklahoma, may tax <em>all </em>of the income of its residents, even income earned outside the taxing jurisdiction\u201d [emphasis in original]). Indeed, the court noted that \u201c[t]his general principle] . . . ha[s] international acceptance. American Law Institute, Federal Income Tax Project: International Aspects of United States Income Taxation 4, 6 (1987) . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Oklahoma Tax Commission </em>v. <em>Chickasaw Nation, </em>supra, 463.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Traditionally, the due process justification for permitting a domiciliary to be taxed on his or her income, irrespective of its source, is based upon the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the domiciliary state, by virtue of its legal system, provides the social structure pursuant to which the domiciliary receives and enjoys that income. Taxation of a domiciliary \u201cis founded upon the protection afforded by the state to the recipient of the income in his person, in his right to receive the income and in his enjoyment of it when received. These are rights and privileges which attach to domicil within the state. To them and to the equitable distribution of the tax burden, the economic advantage realized by the receipt of income and represented by the power to control it, bears a direct relationship.\u201d New <em>York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, </em>300 U.S. 308, 313, 57 S. Ct. 466, 81 L. Ed. 666 (1937); id., 316 (state may tax domiciliary on rental income from real property located outside state, and on interest income from bonds located and secured by mortgages on property outside state); <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>286 U.S. 276, 281, 52 S. Ct. 556, 76 L. Ed. 1102 (1932) (state may tax domiciliary on income received from work performed outside state); see also <em>Cream of Wheat Co. </em>v. <em>Grand Forks, </em>253 U.S. 325, 328-29, 40 S. Ct. 558, 64 L. Ed. 931 (1920) (state may tax corporation incorporated in state on value of intangible personal property located outside state).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Furthermore, on much the same reasoning, as the plaintiff suggests, the \u201cUnited States Supreme Court itself has validated the proposition that the State where the trustee is located provides constitutionally significant protections, opportunities and benefits to the trust for tax purposes.\u201d See <em>Greenough v. Tax Assessors, </em>331 U.S. 486, 488, 67 S. Ct. 1400, 91 L. Ed. 1621 (1947) (Rhode Island municipality permitted to impose proportional ad valorem tax on out-of-state trust based solely on fact that one of two trustees resided in Rhode Island, even though trust property maintained in New York, trust beneficiary domiciled in New York, and Rhode Island trustee did not exercise trust powers in Rhode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Island). The court\u2019s reasoning was that the state was entitled to treat the resident trustee like one of its individual domiciliaries, in the sense of exacting from it a tax because of the benefits and protections that its legal system provided to it. Id., 496. \u201cA resident trustee of a foreign trust would be entitled to the same advantages from Rhode Island laws as would any natural person there resident.\u201d Id., 495. \u201cRhode Island has imposed this tax, it may be presumed, for the general advantages of living within the jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 499 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Thus, in the present case, as the plaintiff does not dispute, if the trustee was located in Connecticut, this state could tax the trust\u2019s undistributed income consistent with due process of law, even though, for example, the trustee in fact made all of its investment decisions, and kept the actual cash and securities of the trust in accounts in a New York office. The reason for this is that, by virtue of its legal system, Connecticut would be providing the legal benefits and protections that enabled the trustee to perform its functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Similarly, the plaintiff suggests that the state where the trust is administered constitutionally may tax the income of the trust \u201cbecause the State provides the locale for the bookkeeping, accounts and other instruments of trust income and investment.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Pabst </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Taxation, </em>19 Wis. 2d 313, 329, 120 N.W.2d 77 (1963) (sufficient nexus for taxation of income of trust where \u201cthe trust\u2019s business was transacted [in the taxing state] during the [taxing] period in question\u201d). Thus, in the present case, if the trustee, although located in New York, had a trust administration office in Connecticut where it kept the trusts\u2019 accounts and made their investment decisions, Connecticut could tax the trusts\u2019 undistributed income. Presumably the same rationale would justify the imposition of that tax in light of the legal benefits and protections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>provided by the state to the process of trust administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Admittedly, neither the trustee, its function of administering the trusts, nor the tangible evidence of the trusts\u2019 intangible assets \u2014 the \u201ccash\u201d and the actual security certificates<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u2014 is located in Connecticut. This state, however, by virtue of its legislative scheme, in effect has taken the practical position of treating the seats of the trusts \u2014 where they were established, and where their principal legal protections and benefits have been and are provided \u2014 as domiciliaries of the state. In passing on the constitutionality of a tax, \u201cwe are concerned only with its practical operation, not its definition or the precise form of descriptive words which may be applied to it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>J. C. Penney Co., </em>supra, 311 U.S. 444. The \u201cpractical operation of the statute . . . controls constitutionality, and not the form in which a State has cast a tax.\u201d <em>Greenough </em>v. <em>Tax Assessors, </em>supra, 331 U.S. 499-500 (Frankfurt,er, J., concurring). For purposes of due process of law, we see nothing less compelling about the benefits and opportunities provided by Connecticut to these trusts by its legal and judicial systems than those benefits provided by states in which either the trustee or the administration of a trust might be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has recognized the analogy between a domiciliary and the seat of a trust for purposes of taxation. \u201cFor the purpose of the taxation of those resident within her borders, Rhode Island has sovereign power unembarrassed by any restriction except those that emerge from the Constitution. Whether that power is exercised wisely or unwisely is the problem of each state. It may well be that sound fiscal policy would be promoted by a tax upon trust intangibles levied only by the state that is the seat of a testamentary trust.\u201d Id., 490. \u201cThere may be matters of trust administration which can be litigated only in the courts of the state that is the seat of the trust. For example, in the case of a testamentary trust, the appointment of trustees, settlement, termination and distribution under the provisions of the trust are to be carried out, normally, in the courts of [the] decedent\u2019s domicile.\u201d Id., 495. The court also has recognized that a trust is \u201c \u2018an abstraction,\u2019 \u201d that for purposes of taxation it \u201cis sometimes dealt with as though it had a separate existence,\u201d and that it may, for such purposes, be dealt with as an \u201centity\u201d consisting of \u201cseparate interests, the equitable interest in the res of the beneficiary and the legal interest of the trustee.\u201d Id., 493-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Thus, just as a state may tax all of the income of a domiciliary, irrespective of its source, because of the legal benefits and opportunities it provides that permit the beneficiary to receive and enjoy the income, so may Connecticut tax the income of these testamentary trusts because of the benefits and opportunities that it provides to them. All of the testamentary trusts were established under their respective wills because the laws of this state provide for such establishment. <em>Blodgett </em>v. <em>Bridgeport City Trust Co., </em>115 Conn. 127, 142, 161 A. 83 (1932). The validity of a testamentary trust is normally determined by the validity of the will, which in turn is ordinarily determined by the law of the testator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>domicile. R. Hendrickson &amp; N. Silverman, Changing the Situs of a Trust (1998) \u00a7 1A.02 [1], Thus, Connecticut\u2019s laws assure the continued existence of the trusts as mechanisms for the disposition of the testators\u2019 property according to the terms of the trusts as provided by the respective wills. In addition, the original trustees and their successors were approved by the respective Probate Courts in which the wills were probated.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">With respect to the Dallett Trust and the Worcester Trust specifically, from the inception of the trusts the Connecticut Probate Courts have been charged with extensive responsibilities for legal and administrative oversight. This oversight includes the specific powers and responsibilities: (1) to call the trustee to account for the trust estate; General Statutes \u00a7 45a-98;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (2) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>require a bond of the trustee under appropriate circumstances, even where the will excuses a bond; General Statutes \u00a7 45a-473;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (3) to fill a vacancy in the office of trustee if a trustee were to resign or decline to serve; General Statutes \u00a7 45a-474;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (4) to authorize the sale of real estate held by the trustee; General Statutes \u00a7 45a-164;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (5) to require the trustee to render periodic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>accounts, to hold hearings upon interim and final accounts, to pass on the propriety of such accounts, and to make such orders as are necessary to secure the due execution of the trustee\u2019s duties; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-178 and 45a-179;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (6) upon the allowance of interim and final accounts, to determine the rights of the trustee and the interested parties; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-175 through 45a-177;<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and (7) to make appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>priate orders regarding the distribution of the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>assets upon its termination. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 45a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>481 through 45a-483.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Moreover, the exercise of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>powers and responsibilities benefits both beneficiaries and trustees alike. It benefits the beneficiaries because: the probate courts serve as the repository of the documents that define the beneficiaries\u2019 rights and that detail how their financial interests are being managed; the probate courts give legal effect to those documents and oversee those rights and interests; and those courts remain open and available to ensure that the beneficiaries\u2019 rights are being protected. It benefits the trustee because it provides the legal cloak of approval that helps to shield the trustee from later claims of mismanagement or other misconduct. Thus, submission of accounts and any other matters of trust administration to, and approval by, the probate court gives the trustee the assurance that its administration of the trust will not be successfully challenged at a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">With respect to the Parry Trust and the Stewart Trust, the wills establishing those trusts excused the trustee from rendering periodic accounts. This privilege, however, was afforded by \u00a7 45a-177. Furthermore, the final and only account of the Stewart Trust was approved by the Probate Court, thus affording the beneficiaries the legal assurance that their rights had been protected adequately throughout the administration of the trust and that the trust assets had been distributed properly, and affording the trustee the legal assurance that its administration would not be challenged later. Similarly, when the Parry Trust terminates, the trustee will be required to file a final account, which upon approval will afford the beneficiaries and the trustee the same assurances. In addition, with respect to both trusts, if at any time any beneficiary wishes or wished to question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the administration of the trust by the trustee, the Probate Court would be open and available for that purpose. See 4 G. Wilhelm &amp; R. Folsom, Connecticut Estate Practice, Jurisdiction and Procedure (1983) \u00a7 54, p. 162 and \u00a7 59, p. 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">We conclude that this panoply of legal benefits and opportunities is comparable to those general legal benefits and opportunities that justify the imposition of taxes on the income of individual domiciliaries of the state. Just as the vitality of the trust as an economic entity is inextricably intertwined with the administration of the trust assets by a trustee located in New York, the viability of the trust as a legal entity is inextricably intertwined with the benefits and opportunities provided by the legal and judicial systems of Connecticut, and its legal viability is inextricably intertwined with its economic vitality. Neither its economic vitality nor its legal viability trumps the other for purposes of due process and taxation. These contacts with Connecticut are sufficiently \u201cfiscal\u201d in nature to satisfy the due process clause, and gave the testamentary trusts fair warning that they were subject to its tax jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">This conclusion is consistent with that of the only court that has considered this precise question since <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 298, was decided. In <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>689 A.2d 539, 540 (D.C. App. 1997), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe District of Columbia, consistent with the Due Process Clause, [may] tax the annual net income of a testamentary trust created by the will of an individual who died while domiciled in the District, when the trustee, trust assets, and trust beneficiaries are all presently located outside the District.\u201d We agree with that court\u2019s reasoning that \u201cthe relationship between the [state] and the testamentary trust of one of its residents is sufficiently close to justify the [state\u2019s] classification of the trust itself as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>resident for purposes of taxation. A testamentary trust of a [state] resident, which has been probated in the courts of the [state], has a relationship to the [state] distinct from the relationship, if any, between the [state] and the trustee or trust assets. The [state\u2019s] unquestioned power to resolve disputes over the trust and to order accountings to protect the trust corpus and beneficiaries from potential malfeasance by the trustee reflects the [state\u2019s] justifiable, though not necessarily exclusive, jurisdiction over the trust itself. One commentator has characterized this authority as follows: \u2018Under the \u201ctrust entity\u201d theory, a testamentary trust is established and remains at the testator\u2019s domicile, thereby giving the domiciliary court in rem jurisdiction independent and apart from the presence of the trustee, the trust assets or the trust beneficiaries.\u2019 [G. Bogert, Trusts (6th Ed. 1987) \u00a7 177, p. 686].\u201d <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>supra, 544; see also <em>First National Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Harney, </em>111 Vt. 281, 297, 16 A.2d 184 (1940) (due process of law does not preclude state from taxing income of testamentary trust of domiciliary of state). We disagree, moreover, with the cases decided prior to <em>Quill Corp. </em>that have reached a contrary conclusion. See <em>Augusta </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>91 Me. 605, 40 A. 666 (1898); <em>In re Swift </em>v. <em>Director of Revenue, </em>727 S.W.2d 880 (Mo. 1987); <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Taxation Division Director, </em>5 N.J. Tax 386 (1983); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>85 App. Div. 2d 821, 445 N.Y.S.2d 648 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">We also disagree with the plaintiffs contention that, because <em>Quill Corp. </em>involved the collection and payment of a sales tax and the present case involves an income tax, <em>Quill Corp. </em>is irrelevant to this case. First, in restating the second part of the two part test for measuring the limitations on taxation imposed by the due process clause, the court in <em>Quill Corp. </em>itself referred to the requirement \u201cthat the income attributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>to the State for tax purposes must be rationally related to values connected with the taxing State . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 306. Thus, the reference to \u201cincome\u201d in the context of a sales tax case suggests that the court, in borrowing the adjudicative jurisdictional due process analytic rubric, did not intend to confine that analytic model to sales taxes. Second, the reasoning of <em>Quill Corp. </em>does not suggest that the comparable reasoning that it employed \u2014 between due process for adjudicative purposes and due process for tax purposes \u2014 was confined only to the sales tax context. Although the application of the test may yield different results depending on the type of tax to which it is applied, we can perceive no reason why the fundamental due process test itself should vary depending on the type of tax involved. Indeed, Justice Scalia in his concurrence in <em>Quill Corp. </em>stated that, although he did not understand the court to have held that \u201cthe due process standards for adjudicative jurisdiction and those for legislative (or prescriptive) jurisdiction are necessarily identical\u201d; id., 319-20; \u201c[i]t is difficult to discern any principled basis for distinguishing between jurisdiction to regulate and jurisdiction to tax.\u201d Id., 319 (Scalia, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The plaintiff also argues that implicit in the due process test for taxation are the requirements \u201cthat the benefits provided by the State seeking to tax be contemporaneous with the imposition of the tax,\u201d and that there be a nexus between the benefits provided by the state and \u201cthe earning of the income which is the subject of the taxation.\u201d To the extent that the first of these implicit requirements, namely, contemporaneity, suggests that the benefits be more than historical, we agree. We think that it is implicit in the due process test that the benefits afforded by the state to a domiciliary, or its functional equivalent, justifying the taxation of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>income, must generally span the time period during which the income was earned, and not solely antedate that time period without any continuing effect. The panoply of benefits afforded in the present case, however, amply meets that test. To the extent, however, that the plaintiff suggests that the benefits afforded by the state be related directly to the earning of the income \u2014 in the sense of being specifically economic or fiscal benefits \u2014 we disagree with the plaintiff. The general legal and social benefits afforded to a domiciliary that justify a state\u2019s taxation of a domiciliary\u2019s income are no more specifically economic or fiscal than those afforded by the state to the testamentary trusts involved in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The same reasoning applies to the plaintiffs contention that a \u201cState that seeks to treat a taxpayer as a domiciliary for tax puiposes, and to impose an unapportioned income tax upon all of the taxpayer\u2019s income, as Connecticut does in this case, must show greater \u2018fiscally\u2019 relevant contacts than a State that seeks to tax only a discrete portion of the taxpayer\u2019s income.\u201d Having legitimately chosen to treat these testamentary trusts as if they were domiciliaries for tax purposes, and having established sufficient minimum contacts with them to do so consistent with due process of law, the state also was entitled to tax all of their income, wherever generated, like that of other domiciliaries. We see nothing either in precedent or policy that requires more contacts for a resident trust than for an individual domiciliary.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The Inter Vivos Trust</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The plaintiff claims that the taxability of the undistributed income of the inter vivos trust violates the due process clause because: (1) the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number><em>Virginia, </em>280 U.S. 83, 50 S. Ct. 59, 74 L. Ed. 180 (1929), is still good law and controls this issue; and (2) the residence of the beneficiary does not satisfy the due process requirement that the taxpayer\u2019s taxable activity purposefully be directed at the taxing state. Although this is a closer case than that with respect to the testamentary trusts, we conclude that the state\u2019s taxation scheme of the undistributed income of the inter vivos trust satisfies the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The same fundamental test applies to the inter vivos test that applied to the testamentary trusts: whether \u201cthe taxing power exerted by the state bears fiscal relation to protection, opportunities and benefits given by the state. The simple but controlling question is whether the state has given anything for which it can ask return.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>ASARCO, Inc. </em>v. <em>Idaho State Tax Commission, </em>supra, 458 U.S. 315. There must be some \u201cdefinite link, some minimum connection between\u201d the state and the income that it seeks to tax. <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In the present case, the critical link to the undistributed income sought to be taxed is the fact that the non-contingent beneficiary of the inter vivos trust during the tax year in question was a Connecticut domiciliary. The accumulated income eventually will be paid either outright to her when she reaches the age of forty-eight or, if she does not five that long, according to the exercise of her testamentary power of appointment or, in default of such exercise, to her then living descendants. Thus, during the tax year of 1993, as a Connecticut domiciliary she enjoyed all of the protections and benefits afforded to other domiciliaries. Her right to the eventual receipt and enjoyment of the accumulated income was, and so long as she is such a domiciliary will continue to be, protected by the laws of the state. We conclude that, just as a state may tax all of the present income of a domiciliary, irrespective of its place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>or origin or the nature of its source, a state may, on the basis of the same justification, tax the income of an inter vivos trust that is accumulated for the ultimate benefit of a noncontingent domiciliary and that is subject to her ultimate power of disposition. Although the connection is more attenuated than in the case of a testamentary trust, it is sufficient for purposes of due process of law. Furthermore, just as the state may tax the undistributed income of a trust based on the presence of the trustee in the state because it gives the trustee the protection and benefits of its laws; see <em>Greenough </em>v. <em>Tax Assessors, </em>supra, 331 U.S. 496; it may tax the same income based on the domicile of the sole noncontingent beneficiary because it gives her the same protections and benefits. In both instances, the state has given something for which it can ask return, and there is a definite and sufficient link between the contact with the state and the income sought to be taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">This conclusion is consistent with the decision of the California Supreme Court in a closely analogous case. In <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>61 Cal. 2d 186, 189-90, 390 P.2d 412, 37 Cal. Rptr. 636, appeal dismissed, 379 U.S. 133, 85 S. Ct. 278, 13 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1964), the court upheld, against a due process challenge, California\u2019s taxation of the undistributed income of an out-of-state testamentary trust based solely on the California residence of the beneficiary of the trust. We agree with the reasoning of the California Supreme Court that \u201c[t]he laws of the state of residence afford benefit and protection to the resident beneficiary . . . .\u201d Id., 195. \u201cThe tax imposed by California upon the beneficiary is constitutionally supported by a sufficient connection with, and protection afforded to, [the] plaintiff as such beneficiary. [The] [p]laintiff in the instant case has, in his role as beneficiary during the years of his residence in this state, enjoyed the protection accorded by California for his eventual receipt of these assets. California. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>grants the beneficiary the interim protection of its laws so that he may ultimately obtain the benefit of the accumulated income. . . . [The] [plaintiff\u2019s residence here confers the essential minimum connection . . . necessary for due process of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 196-97.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We are not persuaded that, as the plaintiff asserts, the holding of <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>supra, 280 U.S. 83, is still good law. In that case, a Virginia domiciliary had created an inter vivos trust of intangible personalty \u2014 stocks and bonds \u2014 of which a Maryland bank was trustee, and the stock and bond certificates were located in Maryland. The beneficiaries, however, were Virginia domiciliaries. Id., 89-90. The court held that the due process clause prohibited Virginia from imposing an ad valorem tax on the value of the intangibles the evidence of which was located in Maryland. Id., 93. The court reasoned that \u201cintangibles \u2014 stocks, [and] bonds \u2014 in the hands of the holder of the legal title with definite taxable situs at its residence, not subject to change by the equitable owner, may [not] be taxed at the latter\u2019s domicile in another State.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Central to the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>however, was the notion that the \u201cadoption of a contrary rule would involve possibilities of an extremely serious character by permitting double taxation, both unjust and oppressive.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. That notion is no longer viable. The risk of double taxation of intangibles has long been abandoned as a limitation on taxation under the due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>process clause. <em>Curry </em>v. <em>McCanless, </em>307 U.S. 357, 363, 59 S. Ct. 900, 83 L. Ed. 1339 (1939). Furthermore, the Supreme Court has affirmed that a domiciliary of a state who is a beneficiary of an out-of-state trust may be taxed on the trust income received by her, even though the other state also taxed the value of the trust property that generated the income, and in doing so the court specifically distinguished <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>See <em>Guaranty Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>305 U.S. 19, 22 and n.1, 59 S. Ct. 1, 83 L. Ed. 16 (1938). Indeed, in their treatise on state taxation, Professors Jerome Hellerstein and Walter Hellerstein stated: \u201cIt is unlikely that the Supreme Court would now hold, on the weakened authority of the <em>Safe Deposit &amp; Trust [Co.] </em>case and under the later Due Process Clause cases, that the Due Process Clause bars the State of a resident trust or estate from taxing a nonresident trustee on income accumulated by the trust from intangibles held by the trustee who resides outside the State and administers the trust there.\u201d 2 J. Hellerstein &amp; W. Hellerstein, State Taxation (1992) \u00b620.09 [2], p. 20-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We also are not persuaded by the plaintiffs contention that the absence of conduct constituting \u201cpurposeful direction\u201d at Connecticut is fatal to the state\u2019s power to tax the undistributed income of the inter vivos trust in the present case. It is true that, in <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 307, as the plaintiff argues, the Supreme Court held that the out-of-state mail order seller\u2019s purposeful conduct toward the North Dakota market was a sufficient due process surrogate for a physical presence in North Dakota, for puiposes of requiring the seller to collect and pay a sales tax. That does not mean, however, as the plaintiffs argument suggests, that such conduct is a sine qua non of due process tax analysis in all contexts. Purposeful conduct may sexve to satisfy the minimum contacts requirement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>So may, however, the presence in the state of a noncontingent beneficiary who receives the benefits and protections of the state\u2019s laws. <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>supra, 61 Cal. 2d 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">THE COMMERCE CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The plaintiff claims that the taxation scheme applied to the testamentary trusts and the inter vivos trust in the present case violates the commerce clause of the constitution because: (1) there is an undue risk of systematic, multiple taxation on the income of the trusts; and (2) Connecticut does not provide a tax credit for any taxes paid to any other state by the trusts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">We first consider, and reject, the defendant\u2019s argument that the commerce clause does not apply because the trusts are not engaged in interstate commerce. In this respect, the entities that are affected by the state taxing scheme are in-state banks and out-of-state banks that provide financial services to trusts as trustees. Although there is nothing in this record to indicate the degree of competition between the two groups, it is fair to assume, in this economy, that they may be actual or prospective competitors to provide such services to the Connecticut market for them. See <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>519 U.S. 278, 300, 117 S. Ct. 811, 136 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1997) (presence of actual or prospective competition between supposedly favored and disfavored entities in single market determines applicability of commerce clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">We next address whether, as the plaintiff contends, there is no credit available to resident trusts, like those in the present case, for income taxes paid to another taxing state, or whether, as the defendant suggests, a credit is available to these trusts. The question of the availability of a credit is significant because, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>extent that such a credit is available, the risk of multiple taxation is eliminated. We conclude that such a credit generally is available under the tax statutes and regulations, but that it only extends to taxes paid on income derived from real or tangible personal property, or from a business, trade, occupation or profession, and does not extend to taxes paid on income derived from intangible personalty, such as dividends, interest and capital gains from the sale of securities.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Therefore, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the property of all of these trusts consisted only of cash and securities in the tax year in question, no credit would have been available to them under the current tax scheme.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The so-called \u201cdormant commerce clause\u201d refers, not to the affirmative grant to Congress to \u201cregulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the Several States\u201d; U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; but to the clause\u2019s \u201cnegative sweep .... The Clause, in Justice Stone\u2019s phrasing, \u2018by its own force\u2019 prohibits certain state actions that interfere with interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 309. In <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274, 279, 97 S. Ct. 1076, 51 L. Ed. 2d 326 (1977), the United States Supreme Court developed a four part test for measuring state taxes against a dormant commerce clause challenge. \u201c[W]e will sustain a tax against a Commerce Clause challenge so long as the \u2018tax [1] is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, [2] is fairly apportioned, [3] does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and [4] is fairly related to the services provided by the State.\u2019 [Id.].\u201d <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>supra, 311. This test emphasizes \u201cthe importance of looking past the formal language of the tax statute [to] its practical effect . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The plaintiff does not focus on any one part of this test. Instead, it argues that \u201ca critical principle that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>animates [the <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>test]\u201d is that it \u201cis intended to preserve the long-standing prohibition against any State tax that subjects interstate commerce to a risk of systematic, multiple taxation.\u201d Specifically, with respect to the testamentary trusts, the plaintiff contends that testators will have an incentive to appoint only Connecticut trustees because appointing a trustee in another state \u201cnecessarily subjects the testamentary trust to the risk of a second income tax in that State.\u201d Thus, the plaintiff argues, this incentive \u201cunconstitutionally promotes in-state trustees by subjecting trusts administered by out-of-state trustees to a risk of multiple taxation.\u201d With respect to the inter vivos trust, the plaintiff contends that this risk is compounded because, in addition to the risk of an additional income tax in the state of residence of the trustee, \u201cthe presence of [other] such out-of-state [noncontingent] beneficiaries increases the risk of multiple taxation even further.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Although we agree that there are such incentives and risks, we conclude that they are too remote and speculative to constitute a dormant commerce clause violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The plaintiff concedes that not all risks of multiple taxation run afoul of the dormant commerce clause, because it is not the purpose of the clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from bearing their fair share of state tax burdens. <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>supra, 430 U.S. 279. The plaintiff contends, however, that the incentive for Connecticut testators and settlors to select Connecticut trustees over out-of-state trustees because of the risk of multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>taxation in cases in which out-of-state trustees are selected, discriminates against interstate commerce by putting that commerce \u201cinto an inferior position to local commerce.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In our view, this assertion rests on an assumption about how Connecticut testators of testamentary trusts and settlors of inter vivos trusts are likely to select their trustees that rests on little more than speculation. First, as we indicated previously, although any resident trust would not be entitled to a credit for income taxes paid to another state based on the trust\u2019s income derived from intangibles, it would be entitled to such a credit for such taxes derived from real estate or tangible personal property. Thus, it is only the trust income derived from intangibles, not all potential trust income, that does not qualify for such a credit. Second, the purported testator or settlor also would have to be unwilling to admit of any significant degree of probability that the other taxing state would not provide, in <em>its </em>taxing scheme, a credit for taxes paid to Connecticut by the trust. Third, a testator or settlor sophisticated enough to envision the risk of future multiple taxation by a state of a nonresident trustee also would likely be sophisticated enough to realize that, even if a local bank originally was named as trustee, there would be no guarantee that the bank\u2019s trust operation would remain local, given the history of mergers and acquisitions in the financial services industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Thus, the plaintiffs position rests on the assumption that, despite all of these uncertainties, a Connecticut testator or settlor would choose a Connecticut bank, over an out-of-state bank, as trustee solely because of the potential for future multiple taxation of some portion of the trust\u2019s future income. The choice of bank as trustee is likely to be animated by many imponderables, among them: the prior experience of the testator or settlor; the financial performance of the various banks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>in the pool of available choices; the current location of the likely beneficiaries; the current location of the various banks in the pool; and, of course, the tax implications, if any. We simply are not sufficiently persuaded of the underlying validity of the plaintiffs assumption about how such a multifaceted decision as the choice of a trustee is likely to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The observations of the United States Supreme Court, in a recent case involving the application of the dormant commerce clause, are appropriate to the present case. In attempting to assess the likely effects of the regulatory scheme at issue there, the court stated: \u201cThe degree to which these very general suggestions might prove right or wrong, however, is not really significant; the point is simply that all of them are nothing more than suggestions, pointedly couched in terms of assumption or supposition. This is necessarily so, simply because the Court is institutionally unsuited to gather the facts upon which economic predictions can be made, and professionally untrained to make them. . . .

Rev. 1203, 1211 (1986) (noting that \u2018[e]ven expert economists\u2019 may have difficulty determining \u2018whether the overall economic benefits and burdens of a regulation favor local inhabitants against outsiders\u2019). We are consequently ill qualified to develop Commerce Clause doctrine dependent on any such predictive judgments, and it behooves us to be . . . reticent about projecting the effect of applying the Commerce Clause here . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>supra, 519 U.S. 308-309. Similarly, in the present case, we should be reticent about making predictions about the economic effects of the marginal incentives afforded by the state\u2019s taxing scheme of resident trusts. We conclude, therefore, that the incentives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>and risks have not been sufficiently established so as to result in a dormant commerce clause violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

Thus, as the plaintiff maintains, so-called \u201csource income,\u201d whether in-state or out-of-state, ordinarily does not include interest and dividend income, or capital gains from the sale of securities. Therefore, the trusts involved in the present case, although not in fact taxable on their income by any other jurisdiction, would not have been entitled to a credit for such tax if they had been so taxed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b228-9\"> It is also true, however, that, to the extent that any trust invested in real or tangible personal property, or in a trade, business or profession, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>located in this state, 1he taxes paid to another state on the income generated thereby would be available for a tax credit in Connecticut.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\"> We note, however, in this regard, that the presence in other states of noncontingent beneficiaries does not increase the amount of the taxes imposed by Connecticut, which are calculated only proportionally to the number of Connecticut noncontingent beneficiaries.

I would hold that Connecticut\u2019s attempt to tax the entire income, all of which was produced outside the state of Connecticut, violates both due process and the negative implications of the commerce clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u201cThe Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the [United States] Constitution . . . prevent States that impose an income-based tax on nonresidents from tax[ing] value earned outside [the taxing State\u2019s] borders.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barclays Bank PLC </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board of California, </em>512 U.S. 298, 303, 114 S.

Ct. 1904, 119 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1992). In establishing the minimum connection between Connecticut and these trusts, the majority focuses on the fact that the settlors of the trusts resided in Connecticut at the time the trusts were created, and that Connecticut offers some benefits and opportunities to the trusts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>The majority relies on the fact that the probate courts of this state \u201cserve as the repository of the documents that define the beneficiaries\u2019 rights . . . give legal effect to those documents and oversee [the beneficiaries\u2019] lights and interests . . . remain open and available to ensure that the beneficiaries\u2019 rights are being protected . . . [and are open for the] submission of accounts and any other matters of trust administration [which] gives the trustee the assurance that its administration of the trust will not be successfully challenged at a later time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The majority, in sum, justifies a tax on the entire income of the trusts based on the fact that the Connecticut probate courts are open for accounting and trust administration. Our constitution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires Connecticut courts to be open to all persons, including residents of other states or countries. The fact that the courts are open and available to nonresidents hardly would justify a Connecticut income tax on <em>all </em>of the income of New Yorkers or Canadians, simply because they may have a case within the subject matter jurisdiction of Connecticut courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">While the trusts were indeed created in Connecticut under Connecticut law, all of the income has been realized in the state of New York. Therefore, none of the benefits cited by the majority is fiscally relevant, and Connecticut has done nothing in the years since the creation of the trusts to foster the economic environment in which the trust income has been produced. See <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>J. C. Penney Co., </em>311 U.S. 435, 444, 61 S. Ct. 246, 85 L. Ed. 267 (1940) (taxing power exerted by state must bear \u201cfiscal relation to protection, opportunities and benefits given by the state\u201d). As the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>of Appeals of Michigan has stated: \u201cWe analogize the present case to a hypothetical statute authorizing that any person bom in Michigan to resident parents is deemed a resident and taxable as such, no matter where they reside or earn their income. We believe this would be clearly outside the state\u2019s power to impose taxes.\u201d <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Dept. of Treasury, </em>185 Mich. App. 406, 411, 462 N.W.2d 762 (1990). Following the majority of courts that have considered this issue, I would hold that Connecticut\u2019s attempt to tax the entire income of these tmsts violates the fourteenth amendment due process clause of the United States constitution. See, e.g., id.; <em>In re Swift, </em>727 S.W.2d 880, 882 (Mo. 1987); <em>Pennoyer v. Taxation Division Director, 5 N.J. </em>Tax 386, 399 (1983); <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>15 N.Y.2d 579, 581, 203 N.E.2d 490, 255 N.Y.S.2d 96 (1964); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>State Tax Commission, </em>85 App. Div. 2d 821, 821-22, 445 N.Y.S.2d 648 (1981); see also <em>Augusta </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>91 Me. 605, 611, 40 A. 666 (1898). The majority claims that, in light of <em>Quill Corp. </em>v. <em>North Dakota, </em>supra, 504 U.S. 298, these earlier state decisions are no longer good law. <em>Quill Corp., </em>however, concerned a North Dakota use tax on mail order purchases stored, used or consumed within North Dakota, and did not address the issue of taxing tmst income based upon the settlor\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that imposing Connecticut\u2019s state income tax upon the tmsts does not violate the commerce clause. The majority dismisses as speculative the plaintiffs argument that the risk of multiple taxation of the tmst income violates the commerce clause and its implicit prohibition against discrimination favoring intrastate commerce. The United States Supreme Court has clearly indicated that the risk, and not only the actuality, of multiple state taxation suffices to establish such a constitutional violation. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>488 U.S. 252, 261-62, 109 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>S. Ct. 582, 102 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1989); see also B. Bittker, Regulation of Interstate and Foreign Commerce (1999) \u00a7 8.07, p. 8-23; 1 J. Hellerstein &amp; W. Hellerstein, State Taxation (3d Ed. 1998) \u00b614.08 [1] [a], p. 4-39. To avoid the risk of multiple taxation, taxes that affect interstate commerce must be apportioned fairly between the states with potential jurisdiction to tax. <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>supra, 260-61 (\u201cthe central purpose behind the apportionment requirement is to ensure that each State taxes only its fair share of an interstate transaction\u201d); B. Bittker, supra, \u00a7 8.08, p. 8-26 (apportionment of taxed enterprise\u2019s global value among states claiming jurisdiction to tax is \u201ca criterion of the constitutionality of state taxes\u201d). In <em>Container Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>463 U.S. 159, 103 S. Ct. 2933, 77 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1983), Justice Brennan, writing for the majority, stated: \u201cThe first, and . . . obvious, component of fairness in an apportionment formula is what might be called internal consistency \u2014 that is, the formula must be such that, if applied by every jurisdiction, it would result in no more than all of the unitary business\u2019 income being taxed. The second and more difficult requirement is what might be called external consistency \u2014 the factor or factors used in the apportionment formula must actually reflect a reasonable sense of how income is generated.\u201d Id., 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The majority approves of imposing Connecticut\u2019s state income tax on the entire trust income even though New York or some other state might also tax that income. Connecticut\u2019s income tax is not apportioned at all and there is a risk of double taxation of the trust income. I believe that the lack of any apportionment of the tax liability between states with potential jurisdiction to tax these trusts is fatal to the Connecticut taxing scheme. Furthermore, the Connecticut scheme fails to provide the trusts with any credit for taxes paid to any other state. See, e.g., <em>Barringer </em>v. <em>Griffes, </em>1 F.3d 1331, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>1336 (2d Cir. 1993) (noting importance of credits in saving tax schemes from unconstitutionality). Without any provisions for apportionment or tax credits, the Connecticut income tax on these trusts lacks internal and external consistency and violates the negative implications of the commerce clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\"> The constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 10, provides: \u201cAll courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done to him in his person, property or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
