The two dispositive issues on appeal are: (1) whether this court has jurisdiction over this appeal; and, if it does, (2) whether these documents, which consist of written communications between the plaintiff and its attorneys regarding settlements of more than 200,000 underlying actions in which parties sought damages for personal injuries caused by asbestos exposure, are protected from discovery by the attorney-client privilege. We conclude that this court has jurisdiction over this appeal. We further conclude that the relevant documents are protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. During the last two and one-half decades, more than 200,000 claimants have sued the plaintiff in tort for its alleged intentional and/or negligent participation in a conspiracy to conceal the dangers of asbestos from the public (hereinafter asbestos tort actions). More specifically, the claimants in the asbestos tort actions generally have alleged that the conspiracy evolved from the asbestos industry\u2019s funding of researchers who were likely to find that asbestos was not harmful, and the industry\u2019s withdrawal or refusal to fund those researchers who were likely to report the harm caused by asbestos. According to the claimants, Anthony Lanza, a research scientist who was the medical director of the plaintiffs health department during the late 1920s to the late 1940s, was at least peripherally involved in organizations funded by the asbestos industry that disclaimed any harmful effects of asbestos. The claimants in the asbestos tort actions alleged that the plaintiff, as a result of Lanza\u2019s participation in the conspiracy, owed them a duty to disclose generally the harmful effects of asbestos and it failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In addition to these 200,000 cases, new asbestos tort actions are being brought against the plaintiff at the rate of approximately 20,000 per year. To date, the plaintiff has taken only two such asbestos tort actions to verdict. The plaintiff settled or is in the process of settling almost all of these claims for a nominal value of approximately $2000 per claim, but because of the vast number of asbestos tort actions that have been and continue to be filed, it is estimated that costs of settling these claims could be as much as one billion dollars. During the years for which the plaintiff is claiming second level excess insurance coverage by the defendants, it also had primary, umbrella and first level excess general liability coverage from The Travelers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Insurance Company and The Travelers Indemnity Company (collectively, Travelers). Travelers, who has settled its earlier coverage dispute with the plaintiff, is now participating in the defense of the asbestos tort actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">As the aggregate cost of the settlements became increasingly enormous, the plaintiff began to look to the defendants, its second level excess liability insurers, for coverage of the asbestos tort actions. The defendants, however, failed to participate in the defense of these claims by either denying coverage or reserving their rights to deny it in the future.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff brought this action against the defendants seeking: (1) a declaratory judgment that the defendants must defend and indemnify the plaintiff in the asbestos tort actions; and (2) damages for breach of contract. The present case not only raises complex issues relating to coverage and the reasonableness of the settlements reached by the plaintiff with respect to the asbestos tort actions, but also other intricate issues as well.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">As a part of a joint effort to manage the large volume of discovery documents in this complex litigation, the plaintiff prepared and produced a log covering the documents requested by the defendants that it claimed were privileged (privilege log). This two page categorical privilege log lists fifteen categories of documents and covers more than 100 boxes of documents that relate to the defense and settlement of the asbestos tort actions. The plaintiff specifically claims that these documents are protected by the attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Thereafter, the defendants moved to compel production of the withheld documents, claiming that the plaintiff had incorrectly asserted that they were privileged. The trial court granted the motion to compel, subject to a protective order that prohibits disclosure to others, with respect to seven of the fifteen categories of documents that involve information that the plaintiff furnished to its attorneys, as well as advice given by its attorneys to the plaintiff regarding the settlements of the asbestos tort actions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Subsequently, the plaintiff reargued the motion, and the trial court, on September 2, 1998, reaffirmed its original ruling as set forth in a written memorandum of decision dated October 13, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">On September 16,1998, the plaintiff applied for certification to appeal, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a (a), which provides generally that interlocutory orders and decisions of the trial court may be appealed to this court upon certification by the chief justice when the appeal \u201cinvolves a matter of substantial public interest and . . . delay may work a substantial injustice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While the \u00a7 52-265a application was still pending, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 (final judgment appeal),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> claiming that the trial court incorrectly ordered the plaintiff to produce documents listed on the privilege log. On September 23, 1998, this court simultaneously denied without prejudice the plaintiffs application for certification to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> citing <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Conn. 282, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997), and transferred to this court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), the plaintiffs final judgment appeal brought to the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court discovery order is an appealable final judgment, pursuant to \u00a7 52-263, as set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). In the alternative, the plaintiff asserts that its appeal should be allowed pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendants, however, maintain that the present action is not appealable under either statute. We agree with the defendants that the discovery order in the present case is not a final judgment and is, therefore, not appealable under \u00a7 52-263. We agree with the plaintiff, however, that the present appeal should be certified pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a, as set forth in part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Beyond the issue of jurisdiction, the plaintiff argues on the merits that the trial court improperly ordered disclosure in violation of the attorney-client privilege. The defendants claim that the documents are discoverable because: (1) the \u201cat issue\u201d exception to the attorney-client privilege applies; (2) the cooperation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>clauses in the insurance policies between the plaintiff and the defendants precluded the plaintiff from having a reasonable expectation of confidentiality regarding the documents when the plaintiff settled the asbestos tort actions and, therefore, the attorney-client privilege never attached; (3) the \u201ccommon interest\u201d exception to the attorney-client privilege applies; and/or (4) the plaintiffs disclosure of certain categories of documents listed on the privilege log to Travelers waived the plaintiffs right not to disclose them to the defendants, who are also its insurers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiff that the attorney-client privilege insulates these documents from disclosure, as we discuss in part II of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We first must address the issue of this court\u2019s jurisdiction over the present case. It is well established that the subject matter jurisdiction of the Appellate Court and of this court is governed by \u00a7 52-263, which provides that an aggrieved party \u201cmay appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the final judgment of the court . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the general rule is that appellate jurisdiction is limited to final judgments of the trial court. <em>Presidential Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>240 Conn. 623, 627, 692 A.2d 794 (1997). \u201cThe principles that govern appellate jurisdiction are well established. [T]he subject matter jurisdiction of the Appellate Court and of this court is governed by statute. ... It is . . . axiomatic that, except insofar as the legislature has specifically provided for an interlocutory appeal or other form of interlocutory appellate review; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-278/ (prejudgment remedies); General Statutes \u00a7 54-63g (petition for review of bail); General Statutes \u00a7 51-164x (court closure orders); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 340, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992); appellate jurisdiction is limited to final judgments of the trial court. General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Presidential Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>supra, 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We previously have determined that certain interlocutory orders have the attributes of a final judgment and consequently are appealable under \u00a7 52-263. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 31, we explicated two situations in which aparty can appeal an otherwise interlocutory order: \u201c(1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d The plaintiff claims that its appeal meets the second prong of the <em>Curcio </em>test for finality because, if the privileged information in question were disclosed, even under a protective order, the plaintiff\u2019s right to confidentiality in the asbestos tort actions would be immediately and permanently compromised. Although we recognize that the plaintiffs confidentiality in the relevant documents could be compromised in foreign jurisdictions because Connecticut\u2019s protective order does not extend beyond its borders, this is true for any discovery order with a protective order. Moreover, further proceedings can affect the rights of the parties in the present case because the plaintiff, if aggrieved by the trial court\u2019s final decision, could appeal this discovery order after the final disposition of this case as it would any other nonfinal interlocutory order. Consequently, we hold that this court has no jurisdiction over the present appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-263.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Our conclusion is supported by our decision in <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>202 Conn. 252, 520 A.2d 605 (1987). In <em>Melia, </em>which also involved an appeal from a trial court order to produce files protected by the attorney-client privilege within an insurance coverage dispute, we found that the appellants failed to meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>second prong of <em>Curdo. </em>Id., 259. We explained in <em>Melia </em>that \u201c[o]ur concern for the efficient operation of the judicial system, which is the practical consideration behind the policy against piecemeal litigation inherent in the final judgment rule, has induced us to dismiss appeals where statutorily created rights of privacy, no less significant than the right of confidentiality for attorney-client communications, have been at stake.\u201d Id., 258. We also have held in numerous other cases that there is generally no right to an interlocutory appeal from an order issued upon a discoveiy motion. See, e.g., <em>Presidential Capital Corp. </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 633; <em>State v. Grotton, </em>180 Conn. 290, 296, 429 A.2d 871 (1980); <em>Chrysler Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Fairfield Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 223, 228, 429 A.2d 478 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Nevertheless, we allowed an appeal from a discovery order in <em>Lougee </em>v. <em>Grinnell, </em>216 Conn. 483, 487, 582 A.2d 456 (1990). <em>In Lougee, </em>we distinguished our holding from <em>Melia </em>and concluded that the trial court\u2019s denial of the nonparty witness\u2019 motion to quash a subpoena to appear at a deposition in Connecticut regarding a lawsuit in Texas satisfied <em>Curdo\u2019s </em>first prong and, therefore, constituted a final judgment that merited an immediate appeal. Id. Unlike <em>Melia </em>and the present case, in <em>Lougee </em>the outcome of the Connecticut proceeding could not result in a later judgment from which the petitioner could then appeal, because \u201cthe sole judicial proceeding instituted in Connecticut concerned the propriety of [the] deposition subpoena . ...\u201d Id. Accordingly, we find that, unlike <em>Lougee, </em>this appeal does not fall within Curdo\u2019s test.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Thus, it must now be determined whether this appeal should be allowed pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a. Although the plaintiffs \u00a7 52-265a application was denied originally, it was denied without prejudice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 241 Conn. 282, the chief justice varied from the usual \u00a7 52-265a certification procedure and treated the appellant\u2019s General Statutes \u00a7 31-30 lb appeal as a late petition pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a because of the particular circumstances of the case. Similarly, in the present case, the merits of the plaintiffs original \u00a7 52-265a application must now be considered. In doing so, it must be determined whether the issues raised by the discovery order \u201c[involve] a matter of substantial public interest and in which delay may work a substantial injustice . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a (a). We conclude that these prerequisites have been met and accordingly this appeal is authorized pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">This determination is based upon the following. The disclosure ordered by the trial court directly involves the attorney-client privilege, the importance of which we have recently reaffirmed. <em>Shew </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>245 Conn. 149, 162-63, 714 A.2d 664 (1998) (attorney-client privilege invoked when confidential communication between client and attorney is inextricably linked to giving of legal advice). Connecticut has a long-standing, strong public policy of protecting attorney-client communications. See, e.g., <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>112 Conn. 521, 523, 152 A. 882 (1931) (quoting common-law rule embodied in 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence [2d Ed. 1923] \u00a7 2292). This privilege was designed, in large part, to encourage full disclosure by a client to his or her attorney so as to facilitate effective legal representation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cascone, </em>195 Conn. 183, 188, 487 A.2d 186 (1985). It is important not to weaken the privilege with various exceptions because, as the United States Supreme Court has explained, even the threat of disclosure would have a detrimental effect on attorneys\u2019 ability to advocate for their clients while preserving their ethical duty of confidentiality. <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>329 U.S. 495, 511, 67 S. Ct. 385, 91 L. Ed. 451 (1947) (where threat of disclosure, \u201c[inefficiency, unfairness, and sharp practices would inevitably develop in the giving of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial . . . [causing] the interests of the clients and the cause of justice [to] be poorly served\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In order to understand the significance of this appeal, one must also place it within the context of the thousands of ongoing asbestos tort actions that have been commenced in at least thirty other jurisdictions throughout the country. If the appeal were dismissed and the relevant documents were disclosed in the present case, the claimants in asbestos tort actions brought in foreign jurisdictions would be likely to seek discovery orders forcing the plaintiff to disclose the documents it had disclosed to the defendants in the present coverage dispute. The court\u2019s protective order over the privileged documents governs only cases within Connecticut. Consequently, it is possible that a foreign court could indeed require the plaintiff to disclose the documents, based on their disclosure in the present case. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>522 U.S. 222, 118 S. Ct. 657, 139 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1998) (full faith and credit given to Michigan decision did not bar testimony in Missouri, even though Michigan court enjoined such testimony). Although the plaintiff could try to invoke the attorney-client privilege in ongoing or future asbestos tort actions, that defense would, at the very least, be undermined as a result of the disclosure of the documents to its adversaries in the present case, despite the fact that it was disclosed pursuant to a protective order. Thus, before the propriety of the discovery order in the present case could be the subject of an appeal, these privileged documents detailing, among other things, the plaintiffs legal strategy regarding the asbestos tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>actions could be ordered to be disclosed in cases pending in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Furthermore, the plaintiff would be prejudiced regarding its handling of ongoing and future asbestos tort actions because it would be forced to communicate with its attorneys in that context knowing that their communications might not be kept confidential if later requested by the defendants. Disclosure would also prejudice the plaintiff in the present case because the documents include opinions and mental impressions of the plaintiffs attorneys regarding issues that are being litigated in both the present case and the asbestos tort actions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The plaintiff further maintains that by allowing this appeal and establishing rules for trial courts to follow in insurance coverage disputes, this court will serve a substantial public interest. We agree. There is a division among the trial courts with respect to that type of disclosure in an insurance coverage case,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> hence our decision will both resolve this conflict and preserve the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiffs appeal concerns a matter of substantial public interest in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>delay may work an injustice. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 241 Conn. 301. We, therefore, allow this appeal, pursuant to \u00a7 52-265a. Furthermore, all temporal deadlines in \u00a7 52-265a are waived. See id. Finally, in view of the record and the briefs filed in the present \u00a7 52-263 appeal, they will also constitute the record and the briefs for the \u00a7 52-265a appeal. Therefore, it will not be necessary for the trial court to comply with \u00a7 52-265a (c).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We next reach the substantive issue of whether the trial court properly ordered the disclosure of the documents. With respect to the appropriate standard of review, Practice Book \u00a7 13-14 (a) provides in relevant part that a trial court \u201cmay, on motion [to compel production], make such order as the ends of justice require.\u201d Consequently, \u201cthe granting or denial of a discovery request rests in the sound discretion of the court\u201d; <em>Standard Tallow Corp. </em>v. <em>Jowdy, </em>190 Conn. 48, 57, 459 A.2d 503 (1983); and can be reversed only if such an order constitutes an abuse of that discretion. The ultimate issue in our review is, therefore, whether the trial court reasonably could have concluded as it did. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>244 Conn. 158, 175, 708 A.2d 949 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">In order to determine whether the trial court properly ordered disclosure, we must for the first time set forth the contours of the \u201cat issue\u201d exception to the attorney-client privilege in Connecticut. We then must decide whether the trial court properly determined that the at issue exception to the attorney-client privilege applies to the present case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>put the relevant documents at issue so as to mandate their production pursuant to the at issue exception to the attorney-client privilege. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In Connecticut, the attorney-client privilege protects both the confidential giving of professional advice by an attorney acting in the capacity of a legal advisor to those who can act on it, as well as the giving of information to the lawyer to enable counsel to give sound and informed advice. <em>Shew </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 157, citing <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 390, 101 S. Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed. 2d 584 (1981). It is undisputed that the privilege was created \u201cto encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observation of law and administration of justice.\u201d <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 389. Exceptions to the attorney-client privilege should be made only when the reason for disclosure outweighs the potential chilling of essential communications. \u201cIt is obvious that professional assistance would be of little or no avail to the client, unless his legal adviser were put in possession of all the facts relating to the subject matter of inquiry or htigation, which, in the indulgence of the fullest confidence, the client could communicate. And it is equally obvious that there would be an end to all confidence between the client and [the] attorney, if the latter was at liberty or compellable to disclose the facts of which he had thus obtained possession . . . .\u201d <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>28 Conn. 172, 174 (1859).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Because of the important public policy considerations that necessitated the creation of the attorney-client privilege, the \u201cat issue,\u201d or implied waiver, exception is invoked only when the contents of the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>advice is integral to the outcome of the legal claims of the action.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Remington Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>142 F.R.D. 408, 412-15 (D. Del. 1992) (applying Connecticut law). Such is the case when a party specifically pleads reliance on an attorney\u2019s advice as an element of a claim or defense, voluntarily testifies regarding portions of the attorney-client communication, or specifically places at issue, in some other manner, the attorney-client relationship.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In those instances the party has waived the right to confidentiality by placing the content of the attorney\u2019s advice directly at issue because the issue cannot be determined without an examination of that advice. \u201cIf the information is actually required for a truthful resolution of the issue on which the party has raised . . . the party must either waive the attorney-client privilege as to that information or it should be prevented from using the privileged information to establish the elements of the case.\u201d <em>Remington Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 415; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hydrite Chemical Co., </em>220 Wis. 2d 51, 71, 582 N.W.2d 411 (App.), cert. denied, 220 Wis. 2d 364, 585 N.W.2d 156 (1998) (adopting three part at issue test set forth in <em>Pittston Co. </em>v. <em>Allianz Ins. Co., </em>143 F.R.D. 66, 71 [D.N.J. 1992], which requires [1] demonstration of legitimate need for privileged documents, [2] showing of relevance and materiality, and [3] proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>by party seeking documents that information contained within cannot be secured elsewhere).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Merely because the communications are relevant does not place them at issue. <em>Remington Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 142 F.R.D. 415 (finding no waiver regarding documents that relate to underlying actions and are protected by attorney-client privilege, because merely relevant in coverage action); see <em>Rockwell International Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>26 Cal. App. 4th 1255, 1268, 32 Cal. Rptr. 2d 153 (1994) (finding at issue doctrine not invoked because coverage action turns on underlying facts, not insured\u2019s rebanee on advice of counsel as defense). If admitting that one relied on legal advice in making a legal decision put the communications relating to the advice at issue, such advice would be at issue whenever the legal decision was btigated. If that were true, the at issue doctrine would severely erode the attomey-chent privilege and undermine the public pobey considerations upon which it is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff has not pleaded rebanee on any information or advice contained in the privileged documents. Although the plaintiffs compliance with the requirement in its pobey to make reasonable settlements is at issue, that fact does not place the privileged documents at issue. Compliance with contract terms is generaby an element in ab contractual actions, yet rebanee upon legal advice within the process of adhering to contract terms does not automatically place the actual legal advice at issue. See <em>Rockwell International Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 26 Cal. App. 4th 1268. Therefore, even though certain of the plaintiffs senior officials may have stated in depositions that advice of counsel was a significant motivating factor in the officials\u2019 decisions to settle the asbestos tort actions, the privileged documents are not at issue because the plaintiff is not relying on the privileged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>communications to prove that those settlements were reasonable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Where, as in the present case, an insured alleges that an insurer improperly has failed to defend and provide coverage for underlying claims that the insured has settled the insured has the burden of proving that the claims were within the policy\u2019s coverage <em>and </em>that the settlements were reasonable. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Goodwin, Loomis &amp; Britton, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 144, 160, 681 A.2d 293 (1996), citing <em>Alderman </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Group, </em>169 Conn. 603, 611, 363 A.2d 1102 (1975) (in order to be covered by insurer, settlement made by insured must have been reasonable and made in good faith). The reasonableness of the settlement, in turn, should be examined under an objective standard.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Reasonableness is determined according to factors such as, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>not limited to, \u201cwhether there is a significant prospect of an adverse judgment, whether settlement is generally advisable, [whether] the action is taken in good faith, and [whether it is] not excessive in amount . . . .\u201d J. Stempel, Law of Insurance Contract Disputes (2d Ed. 1999) \u00a7 9.02[b], pp. 9-50 through 9-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">It would be quite different if the plaintiff sought to prove reasonableness based upon the advice of counsel. In that instance, counsel\u2019s advice would be at issue\u2014 but that is not the situation in the present case. Accordingly, although the reasonableness of the settlements is directly at issue, the exact communications between the plaintiff and its attorneys regarding the decision to settle, which would aid only in a subjective determination, are not at issue. In sum, the defendants in the present case can assess whether the settlements of the asbestos tort actions were reasonable by examining the facts of the asbestos tort actions \u2014 the same material that the plaintiff had available to it when making its decision \u2014 and by consulting experts, just as the plaintiff had the opportunity to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The trial court in the present case seems to have misconstrued the at issue exception by focusing on the defendants\u2019 need for the documents.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> When privileged communications are not at issue, the opposing party cannot destroy the attorney-client privilege by merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>claiming a need for the documents.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It would be \u201cinconsistent with the nature and purpose of the [attorney-client] privilege\u201d to make an exception to the privilege based only on the unavailability of information from other sources. <em>Admiral Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States District Court for the District of Arizona, </em>881 F.2d 1486, 1494 and n.7 (9th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Our understanding of the at issue doctrine is also supported by the fact that disclosure in the present case would have the undesirable effect of weakening significantly that privilege. Not only would compelling disclosure of the privileged documents risk disclosure in foreign jurisdictions, it would probably chill communications between policyholders and counsel for the asbestos tort actions out of fear of disclosure in future coverage litigation. It could also chill attorney-client communications on a wider scale because disclosure would call into question whether this court might find other exceptions to the privilege in different contexts. \u201cThe effect [of weakening the protection] on the legal profession would be demoralizing. And the interests of the clients and the cause of justice would be poorly served.\u201d <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 329 U.S. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We also must determine whether the trial court properly ordered the disclosure based on the cooperation clauses in the policies between the plaintiff and the defendants. We hold that the cooperation clauses do not justify disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The trial court decision, without any analysis except a statement that it was relying on <em>Carrier Corp. </em>v. <em>Home </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Ins. Co., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. 353283 (June 12, 1992) (7 C.S.C.R. 823),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> determined that the cooperation clauses in the insurance contracts merited disclosure in the present case.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The language of the cooperation clauses, however, does not support such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">An example of the language typical of the cooperation clauses in the present case is as follows: \u201cAssistance and Co-operation. The [Insurance] Company shall not be called upon to assume charge of the settlement or defense of any claim made or suit brought or proceeding instituted against the Insured but the Company shall have the right and shall be given the opportunity <em>to associate with the Insured or the Insured\u2019s underlying insurers, or both, in the defense and control of any claim, suit or proceeding . . . where the claim or suit involves or appears reasonably likely to involve the Company, in which event the Insured and the Company shall co-operate in all things in the defense of such claim, suit or proceeding.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Home Ins. Co. Policy No. HEC 1 19 99 93. The cooperation clauses, according to the terms of the policies, are invoked only when the insurer exercises its right \u201cto associate with the insured ... in the defense and control [a] claim . . . .\u201d Id. Therefore, at most, disclosure pursuant to the cooperation clauses possibly could be required only if and when the insurance company participates \u201cin the defense\u201d of underlying cases.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>present case, the cooperation clauses cannot justify disclosure because the defendants have failed to fulfill this predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Furthermore, the defendant insurers not only have failed to associate with the plaintiff in the defense of the asbestos tort actions, they have denied coverage or reserved their rights. \u201c[E]ither the policy provides coverage, in which case the denial of coverage breaches the insurance contract and relieves [the policyholder] of the duty to cooperate, or there is no duty to cooperate because the damage is not [within the scope of the policy].\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Remington Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 142 F.R.D. 417 (applying Connecticut law). A leading treatise that supports such a reading explains that \u201c \u2018upon the insurer\u2019s anticipatory breach of its duty to indemnify the insured, the insured is freed from its obligations under the cooperation clause to the extent necessary to reasonably protect itself against the breach.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting 8 J. Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (Sup. 1991) \u00a7 4786.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The defendants, however, maintain that the privilege never attached to the documents because, at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>of their making, the plaintiff could not have had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality due to its contractual obligation to assist the defendants in defending such claims and an implicit duty of good faith and fair dealing. Once again, the language of the clauses refutes such a contractual reading. The plaintiff reasonably could have expected confidentiality at least until the defendants agreed to \u201cassociate ... in the defense and control\u201d of the claim.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The defendants have never participated in the defense of those claims even though they could have determined coverage based on then-assessment of the facts of the asbestos tort actions. It is just this type of maneuvering \u2014 refusing to defend an underlying claim, then second-guessing its settlement in an effort to deny coverage \u2014 that the disclosure of the relevant documents would encourage and that the amici curiae<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> argue against. Finally, we have heard no persuasive argument that the implicit duty of good faith and fair dealing within each insurance contract should be so expansive as to encompass the disclosure of otherwise privileged documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">We now consider whether the two alternative grounds for affirmance offered by the defendants merit disclosure of the relevant documents. We conclude that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">First, the defendants assert that, although the trial court did not rely on the \u201ccommon interest\u201d exception to the attorney-client privilege in its discovery order, this court can affirm its decision on this ground. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>decline to do so. The parties\u2019 common interest in the asbestos tort actions, according to the defendants, made it unreasonable for the plaintiff to expect to maintain confidentiality regarding the defendants.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We need not elaborate on the contours of the \u201ccommon interest\u201d doctrine<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> in Connecticut in order to determine conclusively that it does not extend to the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">It is true that an insured and an insurer would have a common interest in defeating or minimizing claims against the insured if the insurer were to agree to cover the insured\u2019s claims. Yet, as the amici curiae argue in their brief, we have long held that <em>even </em>when an insurer retains an attorney in order to defend a suit against an insured, the attorney\u2019s only allegiance is to the client, the insured. <em>Novella </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>163 Conn. 552, 573, 316 A.2d 394 (1972); see also <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Karp, </em>239 Conn. 802, 810, 687 A.2d 539 (1997) (\u201ceven when an attorney is compensated or expects to be compensated by a liability insurer, [his or] her duty of loyalty and representation nonetheless remains exclusively with the insured\u201d), after remand, 243 Conn. 495, 706 A.2d 1 (1998). Such a rule recognizes that the insured\u2019s and the insurer\u2019s interests are not all common. See R. Jerry, Understanding Insurance Law (2d Ed. 1996) \u00a7 114, pp. 779-819 (extensive discussion of conflicts of interest between insureds and insurers). Furthermore, in a case such as the present one, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>insured retained its own attorneys and acted independently of its insurers in settling the underlying cases, the insured and the insurer have even less commonality of interests. In either scenario, they do not share common interests in the characterization of the claims or in the settlement of such claims.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Remington Arms Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 142 F.R.D. 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Moreover, an insured\u2019s and an insurer\u2019s interests immediately become conflicted as soon as the insurer declines to cover the claims. Thus, many courts have rejected the theory proposed by the defendants.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In the present case, where the claims involve allegations of intentional torts that the insurance contracts do not cover and the defendants had not yet agreed to defend the claims, it was reasonable for the plaintiff to have expected confidentiality when handling those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Finally, the defendants\u2019 assertion that because the plaintiff gave Travelers access to certain privileged documents that are at issue in the present case,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> it has waived its privilege vis-a-vis the defendant excess liabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ity insurers, is without merit. The defendants have offered this theory as a second alternative ground for affirming the trial court\u2019s discovery order. The defendants, however, have cited no authority upon which to base such a claim. Moreover, any such disclosures made to Travelers pursuant to defending the asbestos tort actions only waived privileges as to Travelers, who now has an obligation to keep those disclosures confidential.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The order of the trial court is reversed with respect to the discovery order pertaining to the seven document categories more specifically set forth in footnote 5 of this opinion and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-8\"> The following are the defendant insurers in the present case: Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, Allianz Insurance Company, Allianz Underwriters Insurance Company, American Centennial Insurance Company, Arkwright Boston Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company, Century Indemnity Company, City Insurance Company, Commercial Union Insurance Company, CCI Insurance Company, Forum Insurance Company, Continental Insurance Company, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, Greenwich Insurance Company, Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, Highlands Insurance Company, The Home Insurance Company, Insurance Company of North America, International Insurance Company, National Union Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, New England Insurance Company, New England Reinsurance Company, Pacific Employers Insurance Company and Royal Indemnity Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\"> The parties disagree as t,o whether the defendants have denied coverage or reserved their rights to deny it in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\"> These issues include the allocation of coverage under the policies of the defendants where coverage extended over varying and limited times during a thirty year period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\"> The plaintiff also raises claims that the documents are protected by the work product doctrine, an issue we do not reach.

Co., </em>supra, 7 C.S.C.R. 827, held that the existence of the cooperation clause made it unreasonable for the insured to expect confidentiality in its attorney-client communications and work product documents, and, consequently, that no privilege existed as to the insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b76-7\"> We note that if the documents were never privileged because of the cooperation clauses in the relevant insurance policies, the at issue exception to the attorney-client privilege would have no privilege from which to create an exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\"> If, however, the defendants had retained counsel for and in defense of the plaintiff in the asbestos tort actions, the defendants\u2019 argument still would run counter to our well settled law. As we point out in part II C of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>opinion, even when an insurer retains an attorney for the defense of claims against an insured, the attorney\u2019s allegiance is to his or her client, the insured, not to the insurer. <em>Novella </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>163 Conn. 552, 573, 316 A.2d 394 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\"> See also <em>Bituminous Casualty Corp. </em>v. <em>Tonka Corp., </em>140 F.R.D. 381, 386 (D.
