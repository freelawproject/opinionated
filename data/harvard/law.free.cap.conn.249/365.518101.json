On May 18, 1988, the plaintiff suffered a compensable back injury while employed by the named defendant, Northeast Utilities (employer). The plaintiff had suffered a spinal cord injury prior to his 1988 injury. Because the fund had accepted that the spinal cord injury materially and substantially had exacerbated the plaintiff\u2019s 1988 injury, the claim for the 1988 injury was transferred to the fund. On May 24, 1995,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a commissioner found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>plaintiff had been and continued to be totally disabled since May 18, 1988, and accordingly issued a finding and an award by which he ordered the fund to pay the plaintiff temporary total disability benefits starting from the 1988 date of injury. The employer and the fund were parties to these proceedings. On July 21, 1995, fifty-nine days after the May 24, 1995 award of benefits, the fund mailed the plaintiff a check in the amount of $21,336.32. That amount represented the plaintiffs temporary total disability benefits through July 22,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Because the fund had made its payment more than ten days from the date of the award of benefits, the plaintiff sought to have a penalty imposed on the fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-303. Following a hearing, another commissioner found that $20,703.52 of the $21,336.32 payment was late under \u00a7 31-303, and assessed a late payment penalty of 20 percent against that amount. Accordingly, the fund was ordered to pay $4140.70 to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 31-303. The board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s order, and the fund then appealed the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The fund claims that the board\u2019s upholding of the imposition of the penalty was improper because: (1) \u00a7 31-303 imposes a deadline on the fund where payments are due under a \u201cfully executed agreement,\u201d but imposes no deadlines on the fund where payments are to be made under an award; (2) \u00a7 31-303 assesses penalties for late payments against employers but not against the fund; and (3) \u00a7 31-303 imposes penalties only on untimely periodic payments but not on untimely lump sum payments. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The issues in this appeal require that we interpret \u00a7 31-303. Accordingly, we begin by setting out the applicable standard of review. \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 31-278 sets forth the powers and duties of commissioners. Pursuant to that section, commissioners \u2018shall have all powers necessary to enable [them] to perform the duties imposed upon [them] by the provisions of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act)],\u2019 and each commissioner is directed to \u2018hear all claims and questions arising under [the act] ....\u2019\u201d <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>243 Conn. 438, 444-45, 705 A.2d 1012 (1997). Generally, \u201c[o]ur review of an agency\u2019s decision on questions of law is limited by the traditional deference that we have accorded to that agency\u2019s inteipretation of the acts it is charged with enforcing.\u201d <em>Police Dept. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>225 Conn. 297, 300, 622 A.2d 1005 (1993). We do not, however, accord <em>special deference </em>to the agency\u2019s decision when that decision involves \u201ca question of law [that] has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Duni </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>239 Conn. 19, 25, 682 A.2d 99 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u201cIn interpreting statutes, we are guided by \u2018well established tenets of statutory construction. [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Furthermore, [w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . and that [statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>consistent body of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u201cWe have previously recognized that our construction of the [act] should make every part operative and harmonious with every other part insofar as is possible .... <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 104, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). In applying these principles, we are mindful that the legislature is presumed to have intended a just and rational result. <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 187, 592 A.2d 912 (1991).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 391, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993). With these principles in mind, we address the issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The fund first claims that, under \u00a7 31-303, it is obligated to make payments within ten business days only from the date of the receipt of a fully executed agreement. Accordingly, because the payment in this case was due under an award, the fund argues that the board improperly concluded that the fund\u2019s payment to the plaintiff was untimely. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u201cIt is an axiom of statutory construction that legislative intent is to be determined by an analysis of the language actually used in the legislation. <em>Caltabiano </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 662, 666, 560 A.2d 975 (1989).\u201d <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 391. We, therefore, begin our analysis of this issue with the language of \u00a7 31-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Section 31-303 provides that \u201c[p]ayments agreed to under a voluntary agreement shall commence on or before the tenth day from the date of agreement. Payments due under an award shall commence on or before the tenth day from the date of such award. <em>Payments due from the Second Injury Fund shall be payable on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>or before the tenth business day after receipt of a fully executed agreement. </em>Any employer who fails to pay within the prescribed time limitations of this section shall pay a penalty for each late payment, in the amount of twenty per cent of such payment, in addition to any other interest or penalty imposed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The fund contends that because the statute places an express time limitation only on payments due from the fund for fully executed agreements, there is no time limitation on payments due from the fund pursuant to awards. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We first note that the practical result of the fund\u2019s interpretation would be a statutory regime where payments due under a fully executed agreement would be due within a certain period of time, but payments due under an award would be subject to no time restraints. There appears to be no practical difference, however, between payments that have become due under a fully executed agreement and those due under an award. \u201cThe unreasonableness of the result produced by one among alternative possible interpretations of a statute is reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another which would produce a reasonable result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, 180 </em>Conn. 557, 563, 429 A.2d 960 (1980). We, therefore, reject the fund\u2019s suggestion that it may be liable for a penalty only for untimely payments due under a fully executed agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The better approach to analyzing \u00a7 31-303 is to focus on the practical implication of its application where payments have become due under an award to determine whether, in the context of imposing time limitations, there are any relevant differences between payments due from the fund under an award and those due under a fully executed agreement, such that the fund necessarily would have to be immune from time limitations under \u00a7 31-303. It is important to note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the first three sentences of \u00a7 31-303 are concerned with setting time limitations. Under \u00a7 31-303, the time period for payments due under a fully executed agreement begins to run from the date of the receipt of the agreement, whereas payments due under an award must be received ten days from the date the award is granted. Both formulas include a reference point from which the time period is calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The reference point from which the time period for payments under a fully executed agreement is calculated is the date of the receipt of that agreement by the fund. Common sense would lead one to conclude that the receipt date has been set as the reference date because it is on that date that the fund has definite notice of its obligations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the other hand, \u00a7 31-303 provides only that \u201c[p]ayments due under an award shall commence on or before the tenth day from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>date of such award,\u201d and does not set a different reference date for calculation of a due date for payments due from the fund. Indeed, where payments are due under an award, that statute does not distinguish between situations involving payments due from an employer, its insurer or the fund. This lack of specificity in the statute is, however, of no moment because, in practice, the fund will receive notice of its obligation when an award is granted, just as an employer will. Hence, the fund and the employers are not in different positions and, therefore, need not be treated differently under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 31-355 (a), the commissioner must \u201cgive notice to the Treasurer of all hearing of matters which may involve payment from the Second Injury Fund, and may make an award directing the Treasurer to make payment from the fund.\u201d Therefore, where its interests are concerned, the fund is notified to attend. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 31-354-12.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, where an award is concerned, the fund receives notice of its obligations on the date the award is granted. It follows that because the fund receives notice and may attend hearings where its interests are implicated, the fund is in no different a position than an employer that has become obligated to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to an award. Hence, there would have been no apparent reason for the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>lature to make a distinction between an employer and the fund where an award is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The fund has argued that because \u00a7 31-303 provides that \u201c[p]ayments due from the Second Injury Fund shall be payable on or before the tenth business day after receipt of a fully executed agreement,\u201d but also provides that \u201c[pjayments agreed to under a voluntary agreement shall commence on or before the tenth day from the date of the agreement,\u201d the legislature intended to impose a time limitation on the fund only where payments are due pursuant to a fully executed agreement. According to the fund, if the statute is read any other way, the part of the statute that specifically refers to the fund will be rendered superfluous. The fund\u2019s argument is misdirected because it does not address the actual issue before this court in this appeal. The fund\u2019s argument essentially presents a different question of law that need not be resolved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In the present case, a penalty was imposed because the fund\u2019s payment due under an award was untimely under \u00a7 31-303. The actual issue before this court is, therefore, whether the fund is obligated to meet the time limitations set out in \u00a7 31-303 for payments due pursuant to an award. Any analysis conducted to determine the statutory application of the time limitation imposed upon payments due from the fund pursuant to a voluntary agreement, and the relationship of such application to time limitations imposed on payments due from fully executed agreements, will be purely academic, and will not resolve the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Nevertheless, without actually construing the precise meaning of the phrases, \u201cvoluntary agreement\u201d and \u201cfully executed agreement,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we note that the fund, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>well as employers, may enter into such agreements, which statutorily are labeled as voluntary agreements. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-353 (applicable to agreements between fund and employee); General Statutes \u00a7 31-296 (applicable to agreements between employer and employee). Pursuant to those statutes, both the fund and employers may agree to settle a claim, and that agreement becomes effective upon approval of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The fund also may become obligated to provide compensation to the injured employee upon a transfer pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-349.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The transfer may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>be accomplished through submission of an approved voluntary agreement between the employer and the employee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 (b). Where there is a voluntary agreement between the fund and an injured employee, the fund becomes notified of its obligation when the commissioner approves the agreement between the two parties. On the other hand, the fund may have no knowledge of an approved voluntary agreement between the employer and the injured employee until it has received the agreement, perhaps when there is an attempt to transfer liability pursuant to \u00a7 31-349 (b). The apparent reason for the inclusion of a formula that calculates a time limitation from the date on which a fully executed agreement is received by the fund is to account for the latter circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">We also note that the foregoing construction of the first and the third sentences of \u00a7 31-303 is consistent with the analytic framework that we previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>employed in the resolution of the issue. That framework, in general terms, is based on the proposition that time limitations, as set forth in \u00a7 31-303, are calculated from a reference point. The reference points chosen by the legislature in this statute appear to have been set from the date on which the fund has notice of its obligation to make payments to an injured employee. We, therefore, are not persuaded that because \u00a7 31-303 does not specifically obligate the fund to make payments within a specified time where payments are due under an award, the legislature intended to immunize the fund from a time limitation under such circumstances. Accordingly, we conclude that \u00a7 31-303 imposes a time limitation upon the fund, as well as upon employers, for making payments pursuant to an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The fund next claims that it was improper for the board to impose a penalty on the fund due to its untimely payment under \u00a7 31-303, because the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 applies only to employers, and not to the fund. We disagree. Because the fund essentially stands in the shoes of the employer for purposes of payment of compensation benefits to the injured employee, we conclude that the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 is equally applicable to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 provides that \u201c[a]ny employer who fails to pay within the prescribed time limitations of this section shall pay a penalty for each late payment, in the amount of twenty per cent of such payment, in addition to any other interest or penalty imposed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d \u201cAn obvious purpose of [a] penalty provision [in a workers\u2019 compensation system] is to induce prompt payment of legitimate claims and to protect claimants against unnecessary and unjustifiable delays.\u201d <em>Brantley </em>v. <em>A D H Building Contractors, Inc., </em>215 So. 2d 297, 298 (Fla. 1968); see also <em>Masi </em>v. <em>A. Gasbarro &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>103 R.I. 136, 139, 235 A.2d 341 (1967) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>penalty provision of workers\u2019 compensation system \u201cwas enacted to insure the prompt regular payment of weekly compensation benefits due an employee\u201d). The legislative history of the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 supports this concept.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Making certain that an injured employee will have prompt access to workers\u2019 compensation benefits is also a fundamental aspect of Connecticut\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u201cConnecticut first adopted a statutory scheme of workers\u2019 compensation in 1913. The purpose of the [act] . . . General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.; is to provide compensation for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, regardless of fault. <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 279, 240 A.2d 886 (1968). Under the statute, the employee surrenders his right to bring a common law action against the employer, thereby limiting the employer\u2019s liability to the statutory amount. ... In return, the employee is compensated for his or her losses without having to prove liability. . . . In a word, these statutes compromise an employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for <em>relatively quick </em>and certain compensation.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 381, 698 A.2d 859 (1997). \u201cThe intention of the framers of the act was to establish <em>a speedy, </em>effective and inexpensive method for determining claims for compensation. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>St. Paul\u2019s Universalist Church, </em>109 Conn. 737, 147 A. 671 [1929], To carry out that objective, [for instance] the provisions of the act allow a period of ten days in which to appeal the compensation commissioner\u2019s award. General Statutes \u00a7 31-301.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Chieppo </em>v. <em>Robert E. McMichael, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 646, 653, 363 A.2d 1085 (1975). The workers\u2019 compensation system is also designed to minimize the adverse effects that administrative delays could have on the financial status of an injured employee. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (f).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An injured employee who may not be able to earn a living due to temporary or permanent disabilities caused by his injuries faces grim economic hardships that will be aggravated if there is delay in the availability of compensation. Hence, promptness in providing compensation is a key factor in alleviating the severity of an injured employee\u2019s financial predicament.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Where compensation of an injured employee is concerned, the fund and the employer perform similar functions in many respects. \u201cBy following the prescribed procedures, the employer may limit his liability to pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ments due in the first 104 weeks of the employee\u2019s second disability, after which the [fund] assumes responsibility for compensation and medical treatment.\u201d <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>H. O. Penn Machinery </em>Co., 166 Conn. 352, 358, 349 A.2d 847 (1974); see also <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 635, 651, 729 A.2d 212 (1999). This demonstrates two coexisting functions of the fund: to provide adequate compensation to injured employees, while relieving employers from the undue hardship of providing compensation for subsequent injuries to an injured employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The similarity between the roles that an employer and the fund occupy under Connecticut\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system is not, however, limited to their roles as providers of compensation. For example, pursuant to \u00a7 31-353,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the fund may enter into a voluntary agreement with an injured employee in order to settle the employee\u2019s claim. This section is similar to \u00a7 31-296,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> pursuant to which an employer may enter into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>voluntary agreement with the injured employee. Moreover, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-352,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the fund has the same statutory right as an employer, or an employee; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-293;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to seek redress from any party whose actions have caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation benefits to be paid to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>injured employee. These examples illustrate that, where the employers and the fund are functionally similar, they are treated similarly under our workers\u2019 compensation system. This proposition is in harmony with our prior conclusion that the fund\u2019s obligation to provide timely compensation pursuant to an award is no different from an employer\u2019s obligation to do the same. We often have interpreted workers\u2019 compensation laws liberally in order to effectuate their underlying policies where those policies favor an injured employee. See <em>Muldoon </em>v. <em>Homestead Insulation Co., </em>231 Conn. 469, 483, 650 A.2d 1240 (1994). In the present case, the general policies advanced by our workers\u2019 compensation system and the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 are aligned to achieve an important goal: to provide the injured employee with prompt access to compensation. We agree with the board\u2019s observation that \u201c[tjhere is no apparent reason why the legislature would espouse a policy which provides that claimants paid by the [fjund have less of a right to timely payments than those claimants paid by an employer or insurer.\u201d From an injured employee\u2019s point of view, delay in making payments by the fund is as harmful as is delay by an employer. We conclude, therefore, that the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 is applicable to the second injury fund as well as employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The fund argues, however, that the legislative history surrounding the workers\u2019 compensation reform legislation; see Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228; demonstrates that the legislature intended to immunize the fund from penalties because the \u201coverall tenor of the 1993 legislation, of which the \u00a7 31-303 penalty provision was a part, was to <em>reduce </em>workers\u2019 compensation costs and <em>reduce </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the financial burdens of the fund.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The fund elaborates that because it pays benefits out of a statewide assessment that it imposes upon the employers in this state, the imposition of a penalty indirectly increases the costs to the employers in this state, thus undermining the legislature\u2019s intent to reduce workers\u2019 compensation costs. While the fund is correct in its observation that the legislature, in 1993, took steps to reduce the costs of workers\u2019 compensation benefits in Connecticut; see generally Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee, Workers\u2019 Compensation: Impact of the 1991 and 1993 Reforms (1995); there is no indication that it intended to achieve that result by allowing the fund to delay payments of benefits when those benefits have become due.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Finally, the fund claims that even if the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 may be applied to late payments made by the fund, such a penalty may be assessed only against untimely periodic payments, and not against an untimely lump sum payment. The fund argues, therefore, that no penalty should have been assessed against its untimely payment in this case. The fund\u2019s argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The fund bases its argument on the express language of the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303, which provides that \u201c[a]ny employer who fails to pay within the prescribed time limitations of this section shall pay a penalty for <em>each late payment </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is important to note that there is a difference between a lump sum payment and simply a sum of money. A lump sum payment is defined as a \u201csingle payment in contrast to installments; e.g. single premium payment for life insurance; a single lump sum divorce settlement; or single worker\u2019s compensation payment in lieu of future monthly installment payments.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). The fund mischaracterizes its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>payment as a lump sum payment because the payment made to the plaintiff appears to have been a sum of periodic payments<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that had become due. The fund concedes that \u00a7 31-303 is applicable to untimely periodic payments. Accordingly, we need not reach the issue of whether the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 is applicable to lump sum payments in order to conclude that the penalty was assessed properly in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-303 provides: \u201cPayments agreed to under a voluntary agreement shall commence on or bei'ore the tenth day from the date of agreement.

Payments due from the Second Injury Fund shall be payable on or before the tenth business day after receipt of a fully executed agreement. Any employer who fails to pay within the prescribed time limitations of this section shall pay a penalty for each late payment, in the amount of twenty per cent of such payment, in addition to any other interest or penalty imposed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\"> The fund appealed the decision of the board to the Appellate Court. We transferred that appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\"> The fund became liable to the plaintiff by accepting the transfer of an acknowledgment of the plaintiffs physical condition pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 31-325. We note for clarity that in 1995, \u201c[cjoncluding that the second injury fund had outlived its usefulness,\u201d the legislature adopted No. 95-277 of 1995 Public Acts (P.A. 95-277) by which it comprehensively revised the fund\u2019s statutory obligations in order to reduce the fund\u2019s financial liabilities. <em>Cece </em>v. <em>Felix Industries, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 457, 463-64, 728 A.2d 505 (1999); see footnote 8 of this opinion; see also Public Acts 1996, No. 96-242. As a result, General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 31-325 was repealed by \u00a7 18 of P.A. 95-277, and thus has not been in force as of that act\u2019s effective date of June 29, 1995. See P.A. 95-277, \u00a7 19. Public Act 95-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>277, however, did not amend \u00a7 31-303. We further note that the penalty provisions of \u00a7 31-303, therefore, remain viable. The fund has not argued that the legislature, by adopting P.A. 95-277, intended to exempt the fund from possible penalties imposed by \u00a7 31-303 for the obligations that the fund incurred prior to the effective date of that act as part of its design to reduce the fund\u2019s financial liabilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> In a different context, we have analyzed the importance of effectuating a timely notice upon the fund. Upon effectuation of a proper transfer pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 (b), the fund becomes obligated to make payments of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the injured employee. But see footnote 8 of this opinion (fund hable only for claims properly transferred on or before July 1,1999). A proper transfer may be effectuated by fulfilling certain statutory requirements. Among others, the employer must submit \u201ccopies of all findings, awards and approved voluntary agreements\u201d to the fund \u201cno later than three calendar years after the date of injury or no later than ninety days after completion of payments for the first one hundred and four weeks of disability . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 (b). \u201cThe object of the ninety-day statutory notice is to enable the fund to be apprised promptly of such a claim being made, to obtain a copy of the agreement or award and to have immediate access to all medical reports. Such information is essential to enable the fund to assess promptly its alleged liability and to establish immediately its financial reserves. A further objective is to give the fund a reasonable period of time within which to investigate the claim and to prepare to meet it.\u201d <em>Plesz </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>174 Conn. 181, 188, 384 A.2d 363 (1978). Similarly, the object of allowing the fund ten business days from the date of the receipt of a fully executed agreement before it may become liable for penalties for late payments appears to be to provide a reasonable period of time for the fund to make payments to the claimant, or perhaps take other appropriate actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\"> Section 31-354-12 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides: \u2018'Payment of compensation shall be paid from the Fund provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201c(a) A formal hearing is held and the Second Injury Fund, the Attorney General\u2019s Office, and Workers\u2019 Compensation Department, were noticed to attend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">\u201c(b) A finding and award is granted against the employer after notice to the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">\u201c(c) Ten days have passed from the date of notice of the award to the employer and the claimant has not received payment and the employer has not instituted an appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">\u201c(d) The claimant requests and is granted a supplemental order of payment against the Fund.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\"> We have held that the modifier \u201cfully executed\u201d indicates the legislature\u2019s intent to distinguish between an agreement and an agreement that bears such formalities as a signature and the commissioner\u2019s approval. <em>Dos Santos </em>v. <em>F.

The employer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the second injury, or its insurer, shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation and all medical expenses provided by this chapter for the first one hundred four weeks of disability. Failure on the part of the employer or an insurer to comply does not relieve the employer or insurer of its obligation to continue furnishing compensation under the provisions of this chapter. The custodian of the fund shall, by certified mail, notify a self-insured employer or an insurer, as applicable, of the rejection of the claim within ninety days after receiving the completed notification. Any claim which is not rejected pursuant to this section shall be deemed accepted, unless the custodian notifies the self-insured employer or the insurer within the ninety-day period that up to an additional ninety days is necessary to determine if the claim for transfer will be accepted. If the claim is accepted for transfer, the custodian shall file with the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the district in which the claim was filed, a form indicating that the claim has been transferred to the Second Iqjury Fund and the date that such claim was transferred and shall refund fifteen hundred dollars of the notification fee to the self-insured employer or the insurer, as applicable.

No further action by the commissioner shall be required to transfer said claim. If the custodian rejects the claim of the employer or its insurer, the question shall be submitted by certified mail within thirty days of the receipt of the notice of rejection by the employer or its insurer to the commissioner having jurisdiction, and the employer or insurer shall continue furnishing compensation until the outcome is finally decided. Claims not submitted to the commissioner within said time period shall be deemed withdrawn with prejudice. If the employer or insurer prevails, or if the custodian accepts the claim all payments made beyond the one-hundred-four-week period shall be reimbursed to the employer or insurer by the Second Injury Fund.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b394-14\"> As a general matter, the liability of the fund has been greatly curtailed.

There is a 20 [percent] penalty for insurance companies or employers who make late payments of doctor bills or benefits for wage replacement after they have been ordered to be made by the workers\u2019 comp[ensation] commission or after they were part of a voluntary agreement by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u201cIn other words, there are many informal and formal hearings at the workers\u2019 compfensation] commission where insurance company lawyers or lawyers promise to make a payment within a few days, or who are ordered to make that payment. If they don\u2019t make the payment . . . there are no effective penalties on the books today.

If the employee, the employer or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund brings an action against such person, he shall immediately notify the others, in writing, by personal presentation or by registered or certified mail, of the action and of the name of the court to which the writ is returnable, and the others may join as parties plaintiff in the action within thirty days after such notification, and, if the others fail to join as parties plaintiff, their right of action against such person shall abate. In any case in which an employee brings an action against a party other than an employer who failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of section 31-284, in accordance with the provisions of this section, and the employer is a party defendant in the action, the employer may join as a party plaintiff in the action. The bringing of any action against an employer shall not constitute notice to the employer within the meaning of this section. If the employer and the employee join as parties plaintiff in the action and any damages are recovered, the damages shall be so apportioned that the claim of the employer, as defined in this section, shall take precedence over that of the injured employee in the proceeds of the recovery, after the deduction of reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred by the employee in effecting the recovery. The rendition of a judgment in favor of the employee or the employer against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the party shall not terminate the employer\u2019s obligation to make further compensation which the commissioner thereafter deems payable to the injured employee. If the damages, after deducting the employee\u2019s expenses as provided in this subsection, are more than sufficient to reimburse the employer, damages shall be assessed in his favor in a sum sufficient to reimburse him for his claim, and the excess shall be assessed in favor of the injured employee. No compromise with the person by either the employer or the employee shall be binding upon or affect the rights of the other, unless assented to by him. For the purposes of this section, the claim of the employer shall consist of (1) the amount of any compensation which he has paid on account of the injury which is the subject of the suit and (2) an amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which he has by award become obligated to pay on account of the injury. The word \u2018compensation\u2019, as used in this section, shall be construed to include incapacity payments to an injured employee, payments to the dependents of a deceased employee, sums paid out for surgical, medical and hospital services to an injured employee, the burial fee provided by subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-306, payments made under the provisions of sections 31-312 and 31-313, and payments made under the provisions of section 31-284b in the case of an action brought under this section by the employer or an action brought under this section by the employee in which the employee has alleged and been awarded such payments as damages. Each employee who brings an action against a party in accordance with the provisions of this subsection shall include in his complaint (A) the amount of any compensation paid by the employer or the Second Injury Fund on account of the injury which is the subject of the suit and (B) the amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which the employer or the Second Ipjury Fund has, by award, become obligated to pay on account of the irqury. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, when any ir\\jury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter has been sustained under circumstances creating in aperson other than an employer who has complied with the requirements of subsection (b) of section 31-284, a legal liability to pay damages for the injury and the injured employee has received compensation for the injury from such employer, its workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier or the Second Injury Fund pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the employer, insurance carrier or Second Injury Fund shall have a lien upon any judgment received by the employee against the party or any settlement received by the employee from the party, provided the employer, insurance carrier or Second Injury Fund shall give written notice of the lien to the party prior to such judgment or settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"ADBz\">\u201c(b) When an injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter is determined to be the result of a motor vehicle accident or other accident or circumstance in which a third person other than the employer was negligent and the claim is subrogated by the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>or its workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, the insurance carrier shall provide a rate adjustment to the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation policy to reflect the recovery of any compensation paid by the insurance carrier prior to subrogation. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b403-13\"> Our review of the record indicates that this claim was not raised before the board. Consequently, there are no specific facts regarding the exact nature of the payment in the record. In his brief, the plaintiff points out that the amount he received \u201cwas in fact representative of a stream of payments which had become due to\u201d him. The fund concedes this point. We also note that in imposing the penalty, the commissioner found that the $21,336.32, which was mailed to the plaintiff, only covered payments through July 22,1995. Moreover, the penalty was imposed on $20,703.52 of the total amount, which indicates that the commissioner determined untimeliness based on when each payment was due.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
