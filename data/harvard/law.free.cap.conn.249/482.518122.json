First, we must determine whether the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue tolled the statutory appeal period for summary process actions, under General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 47a-35,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> until the trial court\u2019s denial of that motion. We conclude that it did. Second, we must determine whether the defendants\u2019 failure to post a surety bond within five days of the entry of judgment, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-35a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provided a proper basis for dismissal of the defendants\u2019 appeal. We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the defendants were not required to post a bond. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court dismissing the defendants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On April 22, 1997, the plaintiff, Rosemary Young, instituted a summary process action, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23a,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seeking to evict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the defendants, Douglas Young and Maureen Young.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff asserted nonpayment of monthly rent for the premises located at 28 Lighthouse Point in Fairfield and claimed immediate possession of the premises on the ground that the defendants\u2019 right or privilege to occupy had terminated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court found that the defendants\u2019 prior right or privilege of possession had terminated and, on April 17, 1998, rendered a judgment of possession in favor of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">On April 20, 1998, three days after the trial court\u2019s judgment of possession, the defendants filed a motion to reargue pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-11.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>basis of their motion, the defendants claimed that the trial court\u2019s findings directly contravened the recent Appellate Court case of <em>Kallas </em>v. <em>Harnen, </em>48 Conn. App. 253, 709 A.2d 586, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 935, 717 A.2d 232 (1998).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">On May 4,1998, the trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue. At that time, the court also indicated that it would later determine the reasonable rental value of the premises and require the defendants to make payments to the court in accordance with that determination. The court rescheduled the case for two weeks hence in order to give the plaintiff an. opportunity to obtain an appraisal of the property and an estimate of its fair rental value.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">On May 7, 1998, twenty days after the trial court\u2019s judgment of possession and three days after the trial court\u2019s decision regarding the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the defendants appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s judgment of possession.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that, because the defendants had failed to appeal within five days of the April 17, 1998 judgment of possession, as mandated by \u00a7 47a-35,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Appellate Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The plaintiff further argued that the defendants had failed to post a surety bond as required by \u00a7 47a-35a.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The Appellate Court granted the plaintiffs motion to dismiss without opinion. We granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification limited to the following issues: (1) \u201cWhether the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-11 tolled the appeal period until the denial of that motion?\u201d and (2) \u201cWhether, under the circumstances surrounding this case, the defendants\u2019 failure to post a bond within five days of the entry of judgment formed a proper basis for the dismissal of the defendants\u2019 appeal?\u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>247 Conn. 913, 719 A.2d 906 (1998). We conclude that the defendants\u2019 appeal was timely and that the defendants were not required, under the circumstances of this case, to post a bond. We, therefore, reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment dismissing the defendants\u2019 appeal, and remand the case to that court with direction to proceed with the defendants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Before considering the merits of this appeal, we recognize the purposes of summary process proceedings and accompanying procedures.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cSummary process is a special statutory procedure designed to provide an expeditious remedy.\u201d <em>Mayron\u2019s Bake Shops, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>Arrow Stores, Inc., </em>149 Conn. 149, 154, 176 A.2d 574 (1961). It \u201cenable[s] landlords to obtain possession of leased premises without suffering the delay, loss and expense to which, under the common-law actions, they might be subjected by tenants wrongfully holding over their terms.\u201d <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Burhans, </em>79 Conn. 306, 308, 64 A. 739 (1906); see <em>Ossen </em>v. <em>Wanat, </em>217 Conn. 313, 317, 585 A.2d 685, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 816, 112 S. Ct. 69, 116 L. Ed. 2d 43 (1991); <em>Prevedini </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corp., </em>164 Conn. 287, 292, 320 A.2d 797 (1973); <em>Feneck v. Nowakowski, </em>146 Conn. 434, 436, 151 A.2d 891 (1959); <em>Jo-Mark Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>Pantanella, </em>139 Conn. 598, 600, 96 A.2d 217 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Summary process statutes \u201csecure a prompt hearing and final determination.\u201d <em>Todd </em>v. <em>LaMar, </em>6 Conn Cir. Ct. 528, 529, 277 A.2d 724 (1971); <em>Henry Knox Sherrill Corp. </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>33 Conn. Sup. 522, 358 A.2d 159 (1976). Therefore, the statutes relating to summary process must be narrowly construed and strictly followed. See <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>235 Conn. 650, 658, 668 A.2d 1309 (1995); <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>225 Conn. 600, 605, 625 A.2d 816 (1993); <em>Jo-Mark Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>Pantanella, </em>supra, 139 Conn. 600-601; <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Bacus, </em>133 Conn. 95, 97, 48 A.2d 237 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u201cAppeals in summary proceedings are governed by the statutes specifically relating thereto rather than statutes relating to appeals generally.\u201d <em>Connecticut Betterment Corp. </em>v. <em>Ponton, </em>5 Conn. Cir. Ct. 265, 267, 250 A.2d 340 (1968). Thus, parties must comply with the five day appeal period pursuant to \u00a7 47a-35, rather than with the general twenty day appeal period provided in Practice Book \u00a7 63-1 (a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The requirement that appeals in summary process actions comply with \u00a7 47a-35 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>jurisdictional. See <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 657. Therefore, \u201ccompliance with its mandate is a necessary prerequisite to an appellate court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">With these overarching principles in mind, we turn to the first certified issue in this appeal, that is, whether the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-11 tolled the statutory appeal period for summary process actions under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-35 until the trial court\u2019s denial of that motion. We conclude that Practice Book \u00a7 11-11 tolled the statutory appeal period.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">To address this issue, we must interpret \u00a7 47a-35. In doing so, we are guided by well established principles of statutory construction. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Double A Transportation, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 21, 25, 727 A.2d 204 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We begin our analysis with the words of the statute itself. General Statutes \u00a7 47a-35 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Execution shall be stayed for five days from the date judgment has been rendered .... (b) No appeal shall be taken except within such five-day period. . . .\u201d According to \u00a7 47a-35, therefore, the defendants were required to appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment of possession within five days of the April 17, 1998 bench decision. <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 657. \u201cThe word within is of controlling importance. It means not longer in time than . . . not later than.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lamberti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>131 Conn. 396, 398, 40 A.2d 190 (1944). Accordingly, the defendants were required to appeal the judgment of possession \u201cno later than\u201d April 23, 1998.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Although the defendants did not file an appeal by April 23,1998, they did file a motion to reargue on April 20, 1998, three days after the judgment of possession.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendants contend that their motion to reargue tolled the appeal period until the trial court\u2019s disposition of that motion on May 14, 1998. The plaintiff argues that the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue did not suspend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the five day appeal period provided in \u00a7 47a-35. Once again, we turn to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Although the five day appeal period is mandatory, the statute does not address the effect of motions, such as a motion to reargue, on the five day appeal period. Additionally, the statute makes no reference to actions or motions that may \u201ctoll\u201d or stop the appeal period from running. Thus, nothing on the face of the statute precludes the tolling of the appeal period, after it commences on the date of judgment, until the trial court\u2019s decision on the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We turn next to the legislative history of \u00a7 47a-35 for guidance. Although the history is silent as to whether a motion to reargue tolls the five day appeal period, the general purpose of expedient summary process proceedings is evident. The original version of \u00a7 47a-35, enacted in 1852,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> required defendants in summary process cases to obtain a writ of error and bill of exceptions within twenty-four hours after judgment was rendered.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although the legislature later extended the deadline for appeals or writs of error to the current five day period, the time frame remains short, evincing an intention to provide a quick remedy for landlords.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The defendants argue, nevertheless, that the proposed tolling effect of a motion to reargue would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>unduly interfere with or contravene the legislative purpose of providing expedient summary process proceedings. Indeed, we acknowledge that the legislature has provided other mechanisms by which a tenant may permissibly frustrate a landlord\u2019s right to expedient summary process. For example, \u00a7 47a-35 (b) provides for a stay of execution of a trial court\u2019s judgment during the pendency of any appeal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Under this provision, assuming a timely appeal is filed, a trial court\u2019s judgment of possession could be stayed indefinitely until the Appellate Court renders a decision on the appeal. Additionally, General Statutes \u00a7 47a-37<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> provides the procedures for an application for a stay of execution, allowing the judgment to be stayed until a decision is rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>on the application. Finally, General Statutes \u00a7 47a-39<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> also permits trial courts to grant a stay of execution when tenants are unable to obtain alternate housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">As a result of these provisions, a trial court\u2019s remedy often will not go into effect until all appealable issues are resolved. As the defendants point out, tolling the appeal period, which effectively would provide parties with the additional time within which to appeal, likely will result in no greater, and indeed often less, delay than the legislatively approved delays resulting from stays of execution. Therefore, we agree with the defendants that, despite the interest in providing expedient summary process proceedings, there is nothing in the statutory scheme governing summary process actions that authoritatively precludes this court from deciding that a motion to reargue tolls the appeal period until a decision on that motion has been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The defendants also argue that tolling the appeal period until the motion to reargue has been decided promotes the interests of judicial economy. The defendants\u2019 motion to reargue, if granted, could have rendered the trial court\u2019s judgment of possession ineffective.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Under the plaintiffs theory, the defendants would have been required to file <em>bo th </em>an appeal of the underlying judgment of possession <em>and </em>a motion to reargue. The plaintiff would require both actions despite the possibility that a decision granting the motion to reargue may have altered the underlying judgment and thus eliminated the defendants\u2019 need to appeal. To require these duplicative actions squanders judicial and party resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 63-1 (b) prevents this waste of resources and promotes judicial economy by providing that a new appeal period commences upon a court\u2019s decision regarding a motion that could render a judgment ineffective. Section 63-1 (b), captioned \u201cEffect of motions filed prior to taking of appeal,\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201cIf within the appeal period, including any extension thereof, the appellant files a motion for waiver of fees, costs and security pursuant to Section 63-6 or 63-7 <em>or any party files any motion, which, if granted, would render the judgment or decision appealed from ineffective, a new appeal period shall commence upon the issuance of notice of the decision on the last such outstanding motion. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, parties may wait until the court renders decisions on all outstanding motions that would render the underlying judgment ineffective before filing an appeal from the underlying judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The defendants urge the court to recognize the principles of judicial economy inherent in \u00a7 63-1 and advance those ends by not forcing the court and the parties to expend resources on an appeal that may become moot upon the trial court\u2019s decision on the motion to reargue. We are persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Section 63-1 does not enlarge or modify the statutory appeal period, but, rather, gives guidance in determining when the appeal period shall commence, and in the case of any motion, which, if granted, would allow the court to render a new judgment, when the new appeal period shall commence.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Similarly, Practice Book \u00a7 11-11 embodies the directions regarding motions that delay the appeal period, and incorporates by reference those motions filed pursuant to \u00a7 63-1 that are properly made from judgments considered final for purposes of appeal. These provisions reflect the courts\u2019 authority \u201cto prescribe rules to regulate their proceedings and facilitate the administration of justice as they deem necessary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>187 Conn. 292, 297, 445 A.2d 901 (1982), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Clemente, </em>166 Conn. 501, 514, 353 A.2d 723 (1974); see also <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>194 Conn. 312, 324, 481 A.2d 31 (1984) (finding that rules of practice supplement requirements of marriage dissolution statutes and stating that \u201c[t]he [Practice Book] rule does not alter the statute but rather implements it... . [W]e see no conflict between the rule and the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Rather than read these Practice Book provisions and General Statutes \u00a7 47a-35 to be in conflict, and thereby engender separation of powers concerns; see <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 323-24; we recognize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>inherent powers of the court to open judgments and, consequently, to determine <em>when </em>the appeal period properly may commence. Moreover, this is not the only time in connection with summary process proceedings that the rules of practice are consulted when the controlling statute is silent. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 47a-35 (a) simply provides that \u201c[ejxecution shall be stayed for five days from the date judgment has been <em>rendered </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute does not, however, define the term \u201crendered.\u201d Consequently, we look to the rules of practice to determine whether, for example, a decision is considered rendered on the date of mailing or the date the parties receive the decision. See Practice Book \u00a7 63-1 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Applying Practice Book \u00a7 63-1 to the present case, the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue suspended the five day appeal period in \u00a7 47a-35 until the May 4,1998 denial of that motion. Accordingly, in light of the foregoing, we conclude that the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-11 tolled the five day appeal period in \u00a7 47a-35 until the trial court\u2019s May 4, 1998 denial of that motion. Therefore, the defendants\u2019 May 7, 1998 appeal of the underlying judgment was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The second issue we must address is whether the defendants\u2019 failure to post a surety bond within five days of the judgment of possession formed a proper basis for the dismissal of their appeal. We conclude that, according to the plain language of the statute, the defendants were not required to post a bond. Thus, the Appellate Court improperly dismissed the defendants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Initially, we recognize that \u201cthe purpose of the bond requirement is to protect the landlord in receiving rent for occupancy of the premises.\u201d <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Carden, </em>30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Conn. Sup. 507, 511, 294 A.2d 640 (1972). \u201cFailure to comply with the bond requirement makes the appeal voidable upon attack.\u201d Id., 512. Therefore, \u201cthe failure to provide such a bond furnishes a sufficient ground for dismissal of the appeal.\u201d <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>30 Conn. Sup. 527, 534, 298 A.2d 244 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Resolution of this issue also requires an interpretation of \u00a7 47a-35a. Our interpretation is again guided by the aforementioned principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">We note first that the plain language of the statute supports our conclusion that the defendants, under the circumstances of this case, were not required to post a bond. The statute provides an exception to the bond requirement <em>\u201cwhere no lease had existed, </em>for the reasonable value for such use and occupancy that may so accrue; provided the court shall <em>upon motion by the defendant </em>and after hearing thereon order the defendant to deposit with the court payments for the reasonable fair rental value of the use and occupancy of the premises during the pendency of such appeal . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47a-35a (a). Therefore, when no lease exists, defendant tenants may, upon their motion, make payments to the court for the \u201creasonable fair rental value\u201d of the property in place of a bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">There is no claim that any legislative history or decisions of an appellate tribunal requires a different interpretation. Accordingly, we conclude that the statutory exception to the bond requirement applies to the present case. No lease existed between the parties. Therefore, upon motion, the statute permitted the defendants to make payments for the fair rental value of the property to the court in place of a bond. The record indicates that the defendants made such a motion, and the court ordered the defendants to pay a fair rental value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>$1700 per month for the premises.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The defendants have complied fully with this order and, therefore, have met the requirements of \u00a7 47a-35a (a). Thus, we conclude that the lack of a bond was not a proper basis for dismissal of the defendants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In summary, we conclude that the filing of the defendants\u2019 motion to reargue pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-11 tolled the appeal period in General Statutes \u00a7 47a-35. Additionally, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the defendants were not required to post a surety bond pursuant to \u00a7 47a-35a.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to consider the defendants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-35 provides: \u201cStay of execution.

If an appeal is taken within such period, execution shall be stayed until the final determination of the cause, unless it appears to the judge who tried the case that the appeal was taken solely for the purpose of delay or unless the defendant fails to give bond, as provided in section 47a-35a. If execution has not been stayed, as provided in this subsection, execution may then issue, except as otherwise provided in sections 47a-36 to 47a-41, inclusive.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-35a provides in relevant part: \u201cBond on appeal.

The record indicates, however, that the defendants appealed from the underlying judgment of possession and not from the denial of the their motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>reargue. Because we conclude that the motion to reargue tolled the period during which the defendants had to appeal the judgment of possession, their assertion is not fatal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b505-10\"> See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b505-11\"> See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b505-12\"> The summary process statutes are contained in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47a-23 through 47a-42a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 63-1 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept where a different time is provided by statute, a party shall have twenty days from the commencement of the appeal period as set forth in this subsection to file an appeal . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\"> Although we have concluded that the five day limitation on summary process appeals is jurisdictional, we have never before decided whether a motion to reargue tolls the appeal period for summary process actions. In <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 656, we held that \u201cthe legislature intended to make the five day time limitation set forth in \u00a7 47a-35 a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal from a housing court ruling in a summary process eviction proceeding.\u201d We found the defendant\u2019s appeal untimely because the defendant had not filed an appeal until nineteen days after the expiration of the appeal period. Id., 655. Although the defendant in <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>had filed amotion for an extension of time, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4040 (now \u00a7 66-1), within the five day appeal period; id., 654; a motion for extension of time is not designated in \u00a7 63-1, currently at issue. Therefore, we reject the plaintiffs contention that a decision by this court that a motion to reargue, pursuant to \u00a7 63-1, tolls the five day period violates the reasoning of <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> April 23, 1998, is <em>six </em>calendar days from the date of judgment. Section 47a-35 (a) excludes, however, Sundays and legal holidays from the five day calculation. Here, the trial court rendered judgment on Friday, April 17, 1998. Therefore, the intervening Sunday was excluded from the appeal period calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> Therefore, because the defendants filed the motion to reargue within five days of the judgment, the only issue before the court is whether that motion tolled the five day appeal period.
