Sweetman, Jr., the superintendent and chief executive officer of the board (collectively, the plaintiffs).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In broad strokes, the plaintiffs used public funds to print and distribute a pamphlet discussing an upcoming referendum on the budget that the board had proposed (pamphlet). The defendant, the state elections enforcement commission (commission), determined that this pamphlet improperly advocated an affirmative vote on the referendum in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 9-369b.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Accordingly, the commission directed the plaintiffs to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>(1) \u201cstrictly comply\u201d with \u00a7 9-369b and (2) reimburse the district for $2573.68, the cost of printing and mailing the pamphlet. In addition, the commission imposed a civil penalty of $1000 on Sweetman. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals from these orders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We decline the plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to disturb this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The commission found the following facts. \u201cBy letter dated June 8, 1996 ... [a] complainant requested that the [commission] investigate [the pamphlet, which was] mailed to households in Regional School District No. 17 [district] at public expense by the [board] in April [of] 1996 concerning an upcoming referendum . . . .\u201d The complainant alleged a violation of \u00a7 9-369b (a), which prohibits the \u201cexpenditure of state or municipal funds ... to influence . . . vote[s] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The district \u201cis solely comprised of the towns of Had-dam and Killingworth. . . . [A]t all times relevant to this [appeal], the [board] was comprised of the following ten members: Helen Reeve, Jeannetta U. Coley, Robert H. Lentz, Robert J. Bilafer, Edward A. Vynalek, Anne E. Wolak, Rebecca L. Bergeron, Michael F. Dagostino, Robert S. Daves and James E. Sheppard. . . . [T]he town of Haddam has six members and the town of Killingworth has four members on [the] board, in accordance with each town\u2019s percentage of population in the total district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u201c[A]ll members of the board are members of the budget subcommittee.\u201d This subcommittee \u201cmet on February 29, 1996, with . . . Reeve, Lentz, Coley, Sheppard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Wolak and Sweetman present, and discussed the . . . [pamphlet], . . . [T]he budget subcommittee of the board met again on April 4, 1996, with . . . Reeve, Lentz, Coley, Bergeron, Daves, and Vynalek present, and discussed the [pamphlet].\u201d \u201c[A]t its April 9, 1996 meeting, the [board] voted to adopt the legal call for the district[\u2019s] annual meeting on May 6, 1996, and to set the voting hours for a referendum on the budget for May 7, 1996. . . . [T]he budget subcommittee of the board met on April 16,1996, with . . . Reeve, Lentz, Bilafer and Sweetman present, [and] discussed, finalized and approved the [pamphlet] for distribution to households in the district. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u201c[T]he format of the [pamphlet was] based upon that of previous flyers, including an introductory letter authored by . . . Lentz as budget chairman. The introductory letter went through several drafts, and in response to [the] suggestion that it was too strong, a specific exhortation to vote for the budget was removed from the first draft. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u201c[B]y letter dated April 18, 1996 . . . Sweetman sent the completed budget [pamphlet] to . . . Reeve, chair of the board, disavowed any responsibility for the [pamphlet] and indicated that it would be sent to the printer no later than April 19, 1996 unless she instructed him otherwise. . . . Neither the [board] nor [Sweetman] had the [pamphlet] reviewed by an attorney prior to its mailing. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u201c[P]rior to the referendum vote on May 7, 1996, the approximately 4800 households within the district received the twelve page [pamphlet], which included charts, graphs, a question and answer section, and statements such as: \u2018We need to set aside monies for such basic capital improvements as roof and oil tank replacement and black top resurfacing. ... It is imperative to maintain our facilities. . . . Please think for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>minute of your own budget over the last few years. Have you or your friends had an increase in income to keep pace with inflation? If not, how did you or they cope? What did you cut or adjust? . . . [W]e on the board are faced with the same realities. . . . We look forward to a high turnout at the polls. We need voter participation to validate our educational priorities and directions. . . . [T]he budget [pamphlet] cost $1950 to print and $623.68 to mail, and such printing and distribution was at the expense of the school district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Based upon its independent review of the pamphlet, the commission concluded that, \u201ctaken as a whole, [the pamphlet] advocates an affirmative referendum vote. It was issued days before the referendum was held and repeatedly refers to the referendum, the difficulty the district experienced with a zero percent budget increase the previous year and the need for repairs and maintenance of school facilities. It further states that \u2018in recommending this budget, the [board] is attempting to strengthen the District\u2019s present level of education\u2019 and encourages voter turnout to \u2018validate <em>our </em>educational priorities.\u2019. . . [T]aken as a whole, the [pamphlet] has the effect of influencing a person to vote in favor of the referendum.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The commission further concluded that the board \u201capproved the [pamphlet] for printing and distribution, and that [Sweetman] is administratively and professionally responsible for sending the [pamphlet] to households within the district.\u201d Accordingly, the commission found that the \u201cboard, its individual members, and [Sweetman] violated [\u00a7 9-369b] by authorizing the expenditure of municipal funds to prepare, reproduce, and distribute the [pamphlet].\u201d The commission characterized this violation as \u201ca serious offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">With respect to Sweetman\u2019s responsibility for distributing the pamphlet, the commission explained that he had previously \u201ctaken decisive action to stop the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>from committing what he felt would be a violation of the General Statutes (the freedom of information laws) by locking them out of a designated meeting place.\u201d Moreover, the commission emphasized that Sweetman was \u201cunder prior order of the commission to ensure the district\u2019s compliance with [\u00a7 9-369b], pursuant to two prior cases . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">With respect to the board\u2019s responsibility for distributing the pamphlet, the commission explained that \u201cseven of the ten present board members were board members at the time the Commission approved [a] consent agreement and order with . . . Sweetman [consent order].<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> . . . The board members were: Helen Reeve, James E. Sheppard, Robert J. Bilafer, Robert S. Daves, Edward A. Vynalek, Anne E. Wolak and Michael F. Dagostino. . . . [I]n October [of] 1995, board members were informed of the consent [order] by the then chairman in a board meeting, and by press release distributed to board members. A copy of the consent agreement and order itself was distributed to the four board officers, which at the time included . . . Bilafer and Sheppard. . . . Board members\u2019 testimony to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>contrary that they were unaware of the [consent order] is improbable, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u201cIt is found that . . . Sweetman and the seven board members identified . . . above, have not demonstrated good faith in attempting to comply with the provisions of [\u00a7 9-369b].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Based upon the foregoing findings and conclusions, the commission issued the following order: \u201c1. The [plaintiffs] shall henceforth strictly comply with the prohibition in [\u00a7 9-369b] and shall ensure that no expenditure of municipal funds shall be made to influence any person to vote for approval or disapproval of a referendum question.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\u201c2. The [plaintiffs] shall henceforth not distribute any information concerning a referendum vote without the approving opinion of counsel that such distribution is not in violation of [\u00a7 9-369b].</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\u201c3. . . . Robert H. Lentz, Jeannetta U. Coley and Rebecca L. Bergeron are reprimanded for the above-cited violation of [\u00a7 9-369b].</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\u201c4. . . . Sweetman and the . . . board members who served on the board at the time the consent agreement and order were adopted . . . shall reimburse the district for the cost of the printing and distribution of the [pamphlet], $2573.68, to be allocated equally among such eight individual [plaintiffs]. Helen Reeve, James E. Sheppard, Robert J. Bilafer, Robert S. Daves, Edward A. Vynalek, Anne E. Wolak, Michael F. Dagostino, and Charles F. Sweetman, Jr., shall each remit the amount of three hundred and twenty-one dollars and seventy-one cents ($321.71) to the district within thirty days of the adoption of the final decision in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">\u201c5. [Sweetman] shall remit an additional civil penalty in the amount of one thousand dollars ($1000.00) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the commission within thirty days of the adoption of the final decision in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Sweetman and the board brought separate administrative appeals from this order. The trial court dismissed these appeals, except as to Dagostino.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Sweetman appealed to the Appellate Court, as did the board and all of its individual members except Reeve. We transferred the consolidated appeals to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">SECTION 9-369b APPLIES TO REGIONAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">As a threshold matter, the plaintiffs argue that they could not possibly have violated \u00a7 9-369b, because the statute does not apply to regional school districts. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u201cThe standard of review of an agency decision is well established. \u2018Ordinarily, this court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to carry out the statute\u2019s purposes. . . . [A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. . . . Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Furthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference. . . . [I]t is for the courts, and not administrative agencies, to expound and apply governing principles of law. . . . <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Texas-Ohio Power, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 635, 642-43, 708 A.2d 202 (1998).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Profit Providers for the Aging </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>244 Conn. 378, 389, 709 A.2d 1116 (1998). Because our courts have not yet had occasion to construe the language of \u00a7 9-369b, our standard of review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the requirements imposed by \u00a7 9-369b do not apply to regional boards of education; the commission disagreed. In resolving this dispute over the proper construction of the statute, \u201cour fundamental objective ... is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature; <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 91-92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); we will not undertake an examination of [\u00a7 9-369b] with blinders on regarding what the legislature intended [it] to mean. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). Accordingly, our analysis of [\u00a7 9-369b] is not limited solely to the words of the statute. Instead, we must also look ... to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>supra, 409; <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>supra, 92. . . . <em>Derwin </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>234 Conn. 411, 420, 661 A.2d 1025 (1995) . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>236 Conn. 845, 850-51, 675 A.2d 835 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u201cIn interpreting a statute, \u2018common sense must be used. . . .\u2019 <em>Norwich Land Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>170 Conn. 1, 4, 363 A.2d 1386 (1975).\u201d <em>Buckley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>v. <em>Warden, </em>181 Conn. 286, 290, 435 A.2d 348 (1980); accord <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>239 Conn. 124, 141, 680 A.2d 1329 (1996); <em>Trumbull </em>v. <em>State, </em>206 Conn. 65, 80, 537 A.2d 431 (1988) (\u201c[c]ommon sense ... is a highly significant guide to statutory interpretation\u201d). \u201cThe law favors rational and sensible statutory construction. . . . The unreasonableness of the result obtained by the acceptance of one possible alternative interpretation of an act is a reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another which would provide a result that is reasonable. . . . When two constructions are possible, courts will adopt the one which makes the [statute] effective and workable, and not one which leads to difficult and possibly bizarre results. . . . <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>194 Conn. 139, 151-52, 480 A.2d 519 (1984). We consider the statute as a whole with a view toward reconciling its parts in order to obtain a sensible and rational overall interpretation. <em>Fruin </em>v. <em>Colonnade One at Old Greenwich Ltd. Partnership, </em>237 Conn. 123, 130, 676 A.2d 369 (1996). We have long followed the guideline that [t]he intent of the lawmakers is the soul of the statute, and the search for this intent we have held to be the guiding star of the court. It must prevail over the literal sense and the precise letter of the language of the statute. . . . When one construction leads to public mischief which another construction will avoid, the latter is to be favored unless the terms of the statute absolutely forbid [it], . . . <em>Bridgeman </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>104 Conn. 1, 8, 132 A. 25 (1926).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>237 Conn. 501, 514-15, 680 A.2d 956 (1996); accord <em>State Board of Labor Relations </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>244 Conn. 487, 495, 709 A.2d 1129 (1998) (\u201cStatutes are to be construed in a manner that will not thwart [their] intended purpose or lead to absurd results. . . . The law favors a rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>statutory construction and we presume that the legislature intended a sensible result.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>243 Conn. 772, 782, 709 A.2d 510 (1998) (\u201c[i]f a statute can be construed in several ways, we will adopt the construction that is most reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">We begin with the language of \u00a7 9-369b.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> One portion of the statute\u2019s caption provides that \u201c[e]xpenditure of state and municipal funds to influence vote[s] [is] prohibited.\u201d Section 9-369b (a) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ny municipality may, by vote of its legislative body, authorize the preparation and printing of concise <em>explanatory </em>texts of local proposals or questions approved for submission to the electors of a municipality at a referendum. Thereafter, each such explanatory text shall be prepared by the municipal clerk, subject to the approval of the municipal attorney, and shall specify the intent and purpose of each such proposal or question. Such text <em>shall not advocate </em>either the approval or disapproval of the proposal or question. . . . Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, <em>no expenditure of state or municipal funds shall be made to influence any person </em>to vote for approval or disapproval of any such proposal or question. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Section 9-369b (b) authorizes the commission to \u201cimpose a civil penalty on <em>any person </em>who violates subsection (a) of this section by authorizing an expenditure of state or municipal funds for a purpose which is prohibited by subsection (a). . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Finally, \u00a7 9-369b (c) creates a carefully circumscribed mechanism by which a municipality may use public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>funds for advocacy. In essence, public officials may prepare and distribute concise pro/con summaries pertaining to local proposals or questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The plaintiffs argue that this language does not include regional boards of education. More specifically, they contend that, because a regional board of education is not a \u201cmunicipality,\u201d \u00a7 9-369b does not apply to them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This contention disregards several aspects of the statute\u2019s broad language. First, it disregards a portion of the statute\u2019s caption: \u201cExpenditure of state and municipal funds to influence vote[s] prohibited.\u201d It similarly disregards the last line of subsection (a), which provides that \u201cno expenditure of state or municipal funds shall be made to influence any person . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 9-369b (a). As a matter of basic syntax, the use of the passive voice in these two prohibitions does not limit the statute to any particular entity, let alone to municipalities. This syntactical inference finds concrete support in subsection (b), which authorizes the commission to \u201cimpose a civil penalty on <em>any person </em>who violates subsection (a) of this section by authorizing an expenditure of state or municipal funds for a purpose which is prohibited by subsection (a).\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 9-369b (b). The statute thus focuses on the individual who expends public funds, not the governmental entity with which that individual is affiliated. Accordingly, the plaintiffs cannot evade liability on the ground that the district is not a \u201cmunicipality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Although the statute is not limited to municipalities, it is not without internal limitations. The commission is only authorized to impose penalties on persons who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>violate \u00a7 9-369b by (1) using municipal funds to disseminate information that pertains to (2) a local proposal or question approved for submission to the electors of a municipality at a referendum. The plaintiffs maintain that they did not expend municipal funds, and that the referendum was not a local proposal or question. We are not persuaded on either count.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The plaintiffs argue that, \u201c[o]nce funds are received by the regional school district \u2014 from whatever source \u2014 they become the funds of the regional school district. They are no longer municipal funds.\u201d The plaintiffs have supplied no reason in law or logic in support of this notion of fiscal transubstantiation, and we are unable to discern any. By definition, regional school districts are composed of two or more municipalities. They are funded by municipal tax dollars.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is clear that \u00a7 9-369b focuses upon the fact that the relevant funds are municipal, irrespective of the nature of the entity that is responsible for expending those municipal funds. Accordingly, we conclude that the money that the district received and the plaintiffs expended consisted of municipal funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The plaintiffs also contend that \u201c\u00a7 9-369b applies exclusively to proposals or questions submitted to \u2018electors of <em>a </em>municipality,\u2019 \u201d as opposed to electors of multiple municipalities. (Emphasis in original.) This contention is also without merit. The proposal was submitted to the voters of each municipality; each voter was an \u201celecto[r] of a municipality.\u201d It is of no moment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>that these electors happened to occupy two different municipalities, or that these two municipalities constitute a regional school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In addition, the plaintiffs argue that \u201c[t]he proposed district budget ... is not a <em>local </em>proposal or question [contemplated by \u00a7 9-369b], but a <em>regional </em>proposal or question; it affects residents in more than one municipality.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) This distinction between local and regional proposals finds no support in the text of either \u00a7 9-369b or any other statute that the plaintiffs have called to our attention. For purposes of \u00a7 9-369b, the antonym of \u201clocal\u201d is not \u201cregional.\u201d Rather, the relevant antonym is \u201cstate.\u201d See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 10-220 (b) (distinguishing \u201ceducational goals for . . . local or regional school districts]\u201d from \u201cstate-wide goals\u201d). In other words, the proposal was \u201clocal\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 9-869b \u2014 as opposed to statewide \u2014 because it involved the voters of only two municipalities. The fact that the proposal could also be characterized as \u201cregional\u201d neither prevents the proposal from being local nor exempts the plaintiffs from complying with the requirements set forth in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Like the text of \u00a7 9-369b, the legislative history surrounding its enactment contains no support for the plaintiffs\u2019 theory that they are exempt from the requirements of the statute. The title of the legislation is revealing: \u201cAn Act Concerning Enforcement of the Prohibition Against the Use of Public Funds to Advocate a Position on a Referendum Question.\u201d 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 15, 1989 Sess., p. 4938. Significantly, this title does <em>not </em>contain the limitation upon which the plaintiffs rely so heavily: it embraces all <em>public </em>funds, and is not limited to the funds of one municipality. In the course of his remarks on the floor of the House of Representatives, Representative William A. Kiner \u2014 the proponent of the act\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>made countless references to \u201ctaxpayer money.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, Representative Mae S. Schmidle explained that \u00a7 9-369b forbids an \u201cextraordinary expenditure of public funds to resolve an. issue that all the taxpayers have a stake in . . . .\u201d Id., pp. 4957-58. Nowhere did any legislator either state or imply that \u201cmunicipal funds\u201d exclude tax revenue expended by a regional school district. Rather, the legislature\u2019s concern was that \u201cthe government will not take sides on a particular side of the issue and spend [taxpayer] money\u201d to do so. Id., p. 4957, remarks of Representative Schmidle.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The exemption that the plaintiffs seek would undermine this clear policy statement. It makes no sense to permit officers of regional boards of election to expend taxpayer money to advocate a result in an upcoming referendum. No other public official possesses this power, and there is no rational basis for bestowing it upon members of regional boards of education. Our common sense tells us that the legislature could not have intended to enact a law that applied to \u201cany person\u201d except for multidistrict boards. Accordingly, we agree with the commission that \u201cthe public policy embodied in [\u00a7 9-369b], prohibiting the use of public funds to advocate a position on a referendum question, would be entirely thwarted by the [plaintiffs\u2019] suggested interpretation, and would lead to a bizarre result by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>permitting regional school district boards of education ... to engage in an activity which other boards of education and municipal officials are prohibited from engaging in.\u201d Because we presume that the legislature acted rationally and sensibly, we are unwilling to endorse the plaintiffs\u2019 construction of \u00a7 9-369b. The legislature intended to prohibit expenditure of taxpayer money to influence local referenda; we decline the plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to frustrate this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The plaintiffs themselves concede that, \u201cphilosophically,\u201d it makes no sense to exclude regional boards of education from the scope of \u00a7 9-369b. The plaintiffs nevertheless posit two reasons why the legislature theoretically might have chosen to distinguish between regional and local school districts. Neither reason is persuasive. First, the plaintiffs cite the \u201cfiscal autonomy of regional school districts.\u201d Section 9-369b, however, clearly regulates the conduct of fiscally autonomous entities, provided they expend municipal funds. Second, the plaintiffs assert that \u201csignificant statutory differences between votes on regional school district budgets and municipal budgets\u201d justify differential treatment under \u00a7 9-369b. The plaintiffs do not, however, support this assertion by indicating any differences that are material for puiposes of \u00a7 9-369b, and we are unable to discern any.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The plaintiffs have expressed their fear that \u201c\u00a7 9-369b has a chilling effect on the . . . speech of public officials. . . .\u2019\u2019This is simply not true. The statute does not prohibit public officials from speaking; it merely prohibits them from using the public fisc to purchase a soap box. The statute itself provides two mechanisms by which public officials may make their views known: (1) the statute authorizes concise pro/con statements; and (2) the statute contains an exemption for press releases \u201cprepared for any news medium\u201d or distributed with public funds to those members of the public who request it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There is, of course, nothing in the statute to prevent public officials from either (1) using their own personal funds to advocate or (2) establishing political committees to pay for advertising and/or distributing communications. As Representative Kiner, the proponent of the act, put it on the floor of the House, an \u201cofficial has the right to advocate to his heart\u2019s content, so long as he does not use taxpayer dollars to do so . . . .\u201d 32 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 4939.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Finally, the interrelationship among \u00a7 9-369b and other legislation lends further support to our conclusion that the statute applies to public funds expended by regional boards of education. Most significantly, General Statutes \u00a7 10-47 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[r]egional boards of education shall have all of the powers <em>and duties </em>conferred upon boards of education by the general statutes . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Pursuant to \u00a7 9-369b, one of these duties is to refrain from using municipal funds to influence the outcome of a referendum. At oral argument before this court, the plaintiffs conceded that local boards of education have this duty. It follows that regional boards of education have the identical duty.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">THE COMMISSION\u2019S STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION IS NOT A REGULATION</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The plaintiffs contend that the commission relied upon an illegal regulation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">On August 7, 1991, the commission released a decision adjudicating a complaint concerning, inter aha, an allegation that a mailing prepared and disseminated at municipal expense contained improper advocacy pertaining to an upcoming budget referendum. Complaint of Huguet Pameijer, File No. 91-154 (Pameijer decision). Interpreting the plain meaning of \u00a7 9-369b, the commission explained in its memorandum of decision that advocacy consists of \u201cwords explicitly urging voters to vote in a particular manner on the referendum.\u201d In evaluating a given text, the commission stated that it \u201creviewfs] the entire communication and carefully consider^] the style, tenor and timing of the communication to determine whether it advocates a position on a pending referendum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Shortly thereafter \u2014 and in response to \u201ca considerable number of inquiries from local officials and citizens\u201d \u2014 Jeffrey B. Garfield, the executive director of the commission, distributed a memo to all of the state\u2019s superintendents of schools (Garfield memo). This memo recites the standard articulated in the Pameijer decision: \u201cA communication advocates a position on a referendum when in part, or taken as a whole, it urges the listener or reader to vote in a particular manner. The style, tenor and timing of a communication are factors which are considered by the commission when reviewing alleged improprieties [under] section 9-369b.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The plaintiffs claim that the commission\u2019s resolution of the present appeal is fatally infected by its reliance upon the Garfield memo. The commission does not deny that the Garfield memo did not comply with the procedures associated with promulgating <em>a, </em>valid regulation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Instead, the commission maintains that the sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>mary of the Pameijer decision contained in the Garfield memo is not a regulation at all, and that reliance upon it was therefore permissible. We agree with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u201cThe criteria that determine whether administrative action is a \u2018regulation\u2019 are neither linguistic nor formalistic. . . . The test is, rather, whether \u2018a rule has a substantial impact on the rights and obligations of parties who may appear before the agency in the future.\u2019 <em>Salmon Brook Convalescent, Home, Inc. </em>[v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>177 Conn. 356, 362, 417 A.2d 358 (1979)].\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>183 Conn. 313, 325-26, 439 A.2d 349 (1981). \u201cThis does not mean . . . that every administrative decision which may have precedential significance beyond the facts and party before it becomes ipso facto a regulation.\u201d <em>Eagle Hill Corp. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>2 Conn. App. 68, 76, 477 A.2d 660 (1984). Instead, \u201cadministrative agencies must necessarily interpret statutes which are made for their guidance,\u201d and they may do so without reference to regulations. <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>173 Conn. 352, 356, 377 A.2d 1099 (1977). \u201cTo rule otherwise would be to ignore the subtle and intricate interaction of law and fact. It is inherent in our judicial system of dispute resolution that the interpretation of statutes, like the development of the common law, grows out of the filtering of a set of facts through the law, as seen by the administrator or judge. The result of this application is a hybrid, composed in part of fact, in part of law, which by its existence contributes to the interpretation of a statute.\u201d Id., 356-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>In the present appeal, the commission construed the plain meaning of \u00a7 9-369b in the Pameijer decision, and elected to inform the state\u2019s superintendents of this statutory construction in the Garfield memo. The Garfield memo thus did not have a \u201csubstantial impact\u201d on parties who would appear before the commission in the future, because it did nothing more than recite the understanding of \u00a7 9-369b articulated in the Pameijer decision. The only function that the memo served was to put superintendents on notice of the commission\u2019s published interpretation of \u00a7 9-369b.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the commission used its statutory construction of \u00a7 9-369b as \u201can interpretive rule that [it] intended to apply in all cases before it . . . .\u201d This argument is an accurate statement of the commission\u2019s proper administrative function; accordingly, it does not avail the plaintiffs. The commission would have acted improperly if it had either (1) arbitrarily declared that a particular communication violated \u00a7 9-369b, without explaining what the terms of the statute mean or (2) failed to consistently apply the same construction of the statute in all cases before it. The regime proposed by the plaintiffs would preclude administrative agencies from relying upon past precedent, unless they had somehow promulgated each and every precedent as a regulation. This regime bears no resemblance to our system of justice, wherein each issue is resolved by reference to how similar issues have been resolved in the past.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>As in <em>Eagle Hill Corp., </em>the commission in the Pameijer decision \u201cwas doing its duty.

In the present appeal, the commission relied upon this statutory construction; the commission did not promulgate a regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">SECTION 9-369b IS CONSTITUTIONAL</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 9-369b is unconstitutionally vague, both on its face and as applied.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by either argument. In our view, the instruction contained in the statutory mandate \u2014 do not use public funds to \u201cadvocate either the approval or disapproval of [a] proposal or question\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 9-369b (a); \u2014 is sufficiently clear to pass constitutional muster. Even if an individual of ordinary intelligence were unable to comprehend the meaning of this language, the executive director of the commission has \u201curg[ed]\u201d people to call his office \u201cif [they] have any questions as to the enforcement of [the] law.\u201d Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>one could always seek the approving opinion of counsel before distributing materials that a court might interpret as \u201cadvocacy.\u201d Accordingly, there is little reason to fear that anyone might violate \u00a7 9-369b unwittingly. In the interest of setting forth a scrupulous account of our reasoning, we address each of the plaintiffs\u2019 vagueness arguments at greater length below.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Section 9-369b Is Not Vague on Its Face</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">It is well settled that, \u201c[i]n the absence of weighty countervailing circumstances, it is improvident for the court to invalidate a statute on its face. <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>226 Conn. 773, 778, 629 A.2d 357 (1993); <em>Lehrer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>214 Conn. 232, 235, 571 A.2d 691 (1990); <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. of the United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>203 Conn. 63, 75, 523 A.2d 485 (1987). . . . A judicial holding that a legislative Act is unconstitutional is one of very grave concern. We ought not, and will not, declare a statute to be unconstitutional unless our judgment is formed in the light of this rule of our law: It is our duty to approach the question with caution, examine it with infinite care, make every presumption and intendment in its favor, and sustain the Act unless its invalidity is, in our judgment, beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Zach, </em>[198 Conn. 168, 177-78, 502 A.2d 896 (1985)]; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>[198 Conn. 92, 105, 503 A.2d 136 (1985)].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg.

A statute that is impermissibly vague in all its applications is vague, \u2018not in the sense that it requires a person to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all. . . . Such a provision simply has <em>no </em>core.\u2019 . . . <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 578, 94 S. Ct. 1242, 39 L.

This burden is augmented by our strong presumption, noted above, in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality.

Significantly, the plaintiffs themselves have supplied an application with respect to which the statute is not vague; they concede that the commission may punish \u201cexpress advocacy\u201d without running afoul of the constitution. Under <em>Benjamin, </em>this concession is fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 facial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Section 9-369b Is Not Vague as Applied</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Having determined that \u00a7 9-369b sets forth a \u201ccomprehensible normative standard,\u201d we turn to the more nuanced question of whether that standard is fatally vague as the commission applied it to the plaintiffs. We answer this latter question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>As a threshold matter, it is necessary to discuss the applicable standard of review. \u201cA statute is not void for vagueness unless it clearly and unequivocally is unconstitutional, making every presumption in favor of its validity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State Management Assn. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>204 Conn. 746, 758, 529 A.2d 1276 (1987).

When viewed through the lens of this standard of review, it is apparent that the application of \u00a7 9-369b to the plaintiffs did not violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">As we have stated, the plaintiffs bear the heavy burden of \u201cdemonstratfing] beyond a reasonable doubt that [they] had inadequate notice of what was prohibited or that [they were] the victim[s] of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 591. The plaintiffs can make neither of the requisite showings. With respect to the notice prong of this test, the plain language of \u00a7 9-369b clearly informed the plaintiffs of what was prohibited.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There is nothing novel or arcane about the concept that no one may use public funds to (1) \u201cadvocate either the approval or disapproval\u201d of a referendum or (2) \u201cinfluence any person to vote for approval or disapproval\u201d of a referendum. We do not hold the drafters of our statutes to the unattainable standard of \u201cmathematical\u201d perfection. <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 110. It is sufficient that the language contained in \u00a7 9-369b \u201cafford[s] a person of ordinary intelligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>a reasonable opportunity\u201d to know what conduct is prohibited. <em>Bishop </em>v. Kelly, 206 Conn. 608, 614, 539 A.2d 108 (1988). A reasonable person reading the text of \u00a7 9-369b would expect the commission to consider the wording of the entire communication in context, from the perspective of an ordinary reader.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>232 Conn. 345, 356, 655 A.2d 737 (1995) (\u201cthe term \u2018unreasonable\u2019 denotes objectivity based on the circumstances\u201d). This is precisely the standard that the commission has consistently applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Turning to the second prong of the <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>test, the plaintiffs were not the \u201cvictimjs] of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 591. While it is true that the application of the statute to any particular case is irreducibly fact-specific, the same can be said of every statute, and does not suggest a constitutional infirmity. The commission has consistently applied the following standard: \u201ccommunications which urge a particular result, either by express wording of advocacy or when considered as a whole, [and which] would make the <em>ordinary reasonable person </em>believe that a particular result is urged . . . constitute advocacy. ... In determining whether a communication constitutes advocacy, the Commission reviews the entire communication and considers its style, tenor and timing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the plaintiffs claim that this construction of \u00a7 9-369b is hopelessly arbitrary, in fact it contains classic objective language: officials may not use public funds to distribute communications that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>an \u201cordinary reasonable person\u201d would construe as urging a particular result.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Moreover, the plaintiffs have supplied no reason to believe that the commission discriminated against them, and our independent review of the record has not disclosed any basis for such a belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that the plaintiffs reasonably should have understood that their conduct was prohibited by \u00a7 9-369b. Accordingly, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague as it was applied to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">THE PAMPHLET CONTAINS ADVOCACY</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The plaintiffs\u2019 next claim is that the pamphlet \u201cdid not advocate approval or disapproval\u201d of the referendum. The commission concluded that \u201cthe material in the [pamphlet], taken as a whole, advocates an affirmative referendum vote. . . . [T]aken as a whole, [it had] the effect of influencing a person to vote in favor of the referendum.\u201d We agree with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">The cover page of the pamphlet is divided into two halves, each of which is slightly larger than a sheet of typing paper. The top half proclaims in large, block capital letters that the pamphlet represents \u201cAN EDUCATION BUDGET OF SIGNIFICANCE: \u2018MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR OUR CHILDREN.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>in original.) Below this is the following logo, which appears to feature two stick figures walking toward a field in which hot air balloons sail through the sky.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The following slogan appears directly beneath this logo, in large bold print: \u201c \u2018Oh, the places they\u2019ll go and the tools they\u2019ll need!\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The lower half of the front page contains an introductory message from Lentz, the budget chairman (introductory message). This message provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201c[T]he Budget Committee has worked for many hours developing this proposal. . . . The Committee listened carefully to the advice and views expressed at the various meetings, and considered them seriously in its final deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u201c[Sweetman] pared . . . down [the requests made by the district school principals] and shaped them to incorporate his views of educational priorities and plans for the coming years. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u201cThe Budget Committee examined [Sweetman\u2019s] proposal, keeping in mind that \u2018education is our business, and our products are the future generations of citizenry.\u2019 Mindful of this mission . . . we scrutinized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>sums and items, and recommended ... an adjusted budget ....</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u201cThis Board understands the need to control spending. We understand the different concerns of the different constituencies of each town. We understand the repeatedly expressed concerns for accountability and we are taking steps to demonstrate our accountability .... But we also understand that we must provide a solid educational program and safe environment. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u201cIn recommending this budget, the [board] is attempting to strengthen the District\u2019s present level of education .... We need to set aside monies .... It is imperative to maintain our facilities. New people question the need for solid education of our youth. Many will agree that learning takes place best in the proper environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\u201cPlease think for a minute of your own budget over the last few years. Have you or your friends had an increase in income to keep pace with the rate of inflation? If not, how did you or they cope? What did you cut or adjust? Perhaps this is not an apt comparison, but we on the Board were and are faced with the same realities. At the same time, we believe that all children have the right to reach their full potential, and that it is our obligation, to the best of our ability to provide them with the means to a solid education. ... If we eliminate what some consider frills in our schools, we no longer provide the varieties of education and discipline the District\u2019s community has come to expect for its children.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">\u201cAn 8.19% [increase over the current budget] may seem steep, but let us remember what it represents: 2.9% is locked into contractual agreements; 2.7-4% reflects inflation over the last few years. Thus, only about 1.3-2.5% represents an actual increase, which is to finance our improved educational program, our maintenance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and repair plan, and some sums for future capital expenses. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u201cWe look forward to a high turnout at the polls. We need voter participation to validate our educational priorities and directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>\u201cThe mission of [the district] is to equip all students with knowledge, competencies, and orientations needed for future success and to empower all students to become confident lifelong learners, creative problem solvers, and caring citizens who can meet the challenges and responsibilities of a changing global com</em>munity.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Stripping aside the flesh of diction, the skeletal structure of this introductory message is as follows: the budget is the result of a great deal of work; the budget reflects what the community wants; the board made every effort to limit spending; the proposed expenditures are necessary; and an affirmative vote is necessary to enable students to succeed in school and in life. The board thus informed voters that they should vote for the budget, and attempted to persuade them to do so. It is apparent that the rhetoric employed by the board\u2014 \u201c \u2018our products are the future generations of citizenry\u2019 \u201d; \u201cwe must provide a solid educational program and safe environment\u201d; \u201clearning takes place best in the proper environment\u201d; \u201call children have the right to reach their full potential\u201d; \u201cit is our obligation ... to provide [children] with the means to a solid education\u201d; \u201c[w]e need voter participation to validate our educational priorities and directions\u201d; \u201c[our] mission . . . is to . . . empower all students to . . . meet the challenges and responsibilities of a changing global community\u201d \u2014 was calibrated to convince parents and members of the community of the negative consequences that would follow if the budget were voted down.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The remainder of the pamphlet sounds the same note as the introductory message. The first page lists the members of the board and, underneath their names, contains the following pledge, in large, block capital letters: <em>\u201cDEDICATED TO QUALITY EDUCATION IN HADD AM AND KILLING WORTH.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) The remainder of the pamphlet is divided into a number of discrete subsections. In a section entitled \u201cWhat are we doing for our students?,\u201d the board explains that the budget will enable the district to \u201c[maintain] educationally sound class sizes and our strong academic programs\u201d and \u201cenhanc[e] our successful extracurricular activities . . . .\u201d Elsewhere, the board states that the district \u201cis the biggest business in Haddam or Killingworth except for Connecticut Yankee.\u201d In our view, this text \u2014 like the text of the introductory message \u2014 contains advocacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">As we have demonstrated, both the structure and the rhetoric of the pamphlet conveyed the message that\u2014 to borrow the words used by the board \u2014 the budget is necessary to \u201c *mak[e] a difference for our children,\u2019 \u201d considering \u201c \u2018the places they\u2019ll go and the tools they\u2019ll need.\u2019 \u201d At oral argument, the plaintiffs conceded that the pamphlet expresses the following sentiment: \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard on [this budget], we\u2019ve been working at it for several months. Here it is, we hope it\u2019ll get your support.\u201d We agree with the commission that this sentiment \u201cwould make the ordinary reasonable person believe that a particular result is urged . . . .\u2019\u2019For these reasons, we conclude that the pamphlet contains advocacy in violation of \u00a7 9-369b.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE COMMISSION\u2019S FACTUAL FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims attack certain facts found by the commission. Our standard of review is well settled. We shall delineate it here, and invoke it as necessary throughout the remainder of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u201cJudicial review of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>216 Conn. 627, 639, 583 A.2d 906 (1990); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>176 Conn. 533, 538, 409 A.2d 1013 (1979). <em>Adriani </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>220 Conn. 307, 314-15, 596 A.2d 426 (1991) .... This so-called substantial evidence rule is similar to the sufficiency of the evidence standard applied injudicial review of jury verdicts, and evidence is sufficient to sustain an agency finding if it affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . [I]t imposes an <em>important limitation </em>on the power of the courts to overturn a decision of an administrative agency . . . and [provides] a more restrictive standard of review than standards embodying review of weight of the evidence or clearly erroneous action. . . . The United States Supreme Court, in defining substantial evidence in the directed verdict formulation, has said that it is something less than the weight of the evidence, and [that] the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>substantial evidence. . . . <em>Newtown </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>234 Conn. 312, 319-20, 661 A.2d 589 (1995); <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>226 Conn. 579, 588, 628 A.2d 1286 (1993).\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dufraine </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>236 Conn. 250, 259-60, 673 A.2d 101 (1996); accord <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 541, 525 A.2d 940 (1987); <em>Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>191 Conn. 384, 409, 465 A.2d 308 (1983); <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, 713-14, 372 A.2d 110 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S.

Credibility determinations such as this are within the province of the commission, which had the unique opportunity to observe Sweetman in person, as he testified. See <em>Feinson </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 425; <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Police Commission, </em>supra, 174 Conn. 426; <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Norwich Fire Fighters, </em>supra, 173 Conn. 214; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 708; <em>Balch Pontiac-Buick, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 563; <em>Hotchkiss Grove Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>supra, 161 Conn. 56. Because we have nothing before us but a cold record, credibility determinations axe not within oux bailiwick. Sweetman nevertheless contends that the commission\u2019s determination that he authorized the pamphlet does not find substantial support in the record, and that the commission therefore abused its broad discretion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Sweetman is the chief executive officer of the board. In this capacity, he possesses \u201cexecutive authority over the school system and the responsibility for its supervision.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 10-157 (a). He attended two of the three meetings of the budget subcommittee at which the pamphlet was discussed, including the meeting at which it was finalized and approved. The pam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>phlet\u2019s return address indicates that Sweetman\u2019s office distributed the pamphlet. Moreover, Sweetman\u2019s name is prominently listed on the very first page of the pamphlet, set apart from the names of the other members of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Significantly, Sweetman was bound by the previous consent order with the commission to ensure the district\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 9-369b.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As discussed previously, this consent order was executed to resolve disputes surrounding a referendum conducted less than one year before the referendum on the budget involved in the present appeal, and required the board to \u201c[obtain] the approving opinion of counsel\u201d before \u201cdistribut[ing] any information concerning a referendum vote.\u201d The plaintiffs do not dispute that Sweetman failed to obtain the requisite opinion of counsel before sending the pamphlet into the homes of voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">This was not the only extant order governing Sweetman\u2019s conduct. Several years before the referendum in the present appeal, the commission issued the following order: \u201c[Sweetman] shall henceforth ensure that equipment or supplies of the school district not be used to prepare or reproduce any printed communication which advocates a position on a referendum, except as specifically authorized by [\u00a7 9-369b].\u201d The plaintiffs do not dispute that the pamphlet was prepared and reproduced using the district\u2019s equipment and supplies.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Perhaps most importantly, Sweetman testified before the commission that he would not have \u201callowed what I would have considered [to be] advocacy to have been in [the pamphlet].\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In his own words, Sweetman thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>conceded that he exercised authority over the pamphlet. This concession comports with the commission\u2019s statement that Sweetman had in the past \u201ctaken decisive action to stop the board from committing what he felt would be a violation of the General Statutes . . . by locking them out of a designated meeting place.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> On the basis of all of this evidence, we agree with the trial court that the commission did not abuse its broad discretion by finding that Sweetman \u201cauthoriz[ed] the expenditure of municipal funds to prepare, reproduce and distribute the [pamphlet].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The Plaintiffs Did Not Demonstrate Good Faith</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that the commission abused its broad discretion by finding that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with \u00a7 9-369b. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">In reaching the relevant finding, the commission relied heavily upon the consent order that Sweetman executed the year before the board sent the pamphlet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>into the homes of voters.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> More specifically, the commission explained that the plaintiffs \u201cwere board members at the time the Commission approved the consent agreement and order with . . . Sweetman . . . . [More than one year before they prepared and distributed the pamphlet, the plaintiffs] were informed of the consent agreement ... by the then chairman in a board meeting, and by press release distributed to board members. A copy of the consent agreement and order itself was distributed to the four board officers, which at the time included [two of the plaintiffs]. . . . [The plaintiffs\u2019] testimony to the contrary that they were unaware of the [consent order] is improbable, at best.\u201d Based upon these findings of fact, the commission determined that the plaintiffs \u201chave not demonstrated good faith\u201d and ordered them to reimburse the district for the cost of the pamphlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">By its terms, the consent order requires the board to obtain \u201cthe approving opinion of counsel\u201d before \u201cdistribut[ing] any information concerning a referendum vote . . . .\u201d Before the commission, the plaintiffs claimed that they were not aware of this order. The commission expressly rejected this factual claim, characterizing it as \u201cimprobable, at best.\u201d We reiterate that credibility determinations such as this are within the province of the commission, which had the unique opportunity to observe the plaintiffs in person, as they testified. See <em>Feinson </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 425; <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Police Commission, </em>supra, 174 Conn. 426; <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Norwich Fire Fighters, </em>supra, 173 Conn. 214; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>supra, 171 Conn. 708; <em>Balch Pontiac-Buick, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 563; <em>Hotchkiss Grove Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>supra, 161 Conn. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The plaintiffs cannot carry the heavy burden of demonstrating that the commission abused its broad discretion. The commission explained that all of the plaintiffs were members of the budget subcommittee, and that all of them were members of the board at the time that Sweetman entered into the consent agreement. Moreover, the commission expressly found that the chairman of the board informed the plaintiffs of the consent order. This evidence affords an ample basis from which the commission reasonably could have determined that the plaintiffs were aware of the consent order.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The commission thus reasonably concluded that the plaintiffs knew that, pursuant to the consent order, they were not permitted to \u201cdistribute <em>any information </em>concerning a referendum vote without the approving opinion of counsel that such distribution is not in violation of [\u00a7 9-369b].\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs do not dispute that the pamphlet contains information concerning a referendum vote.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Nor do the plaintiffs dispute that they failed to obtain the requisite opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>of counsel. It follows a fortiori that the commission reasonably could have determined that the plaintiffs \u201chave not demonstrated good faith in attempting to comply with the provisions of [\u00a7 9-369b].\u201d Accordingly, we are unwilling to disturb the judgment of the trial court dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\"> In addition to the board and Sweetman, the plaintiffs in these consolidated actions are: Helen Reeve, Jeannetta V.

First, this distinction does not affect the fact that the statute prohibits \u201cany person\u201d from authorizing a prohibited expenditure of state or municipal funds. Moreover, the plaintiffs do not deny that each constituent municipality could independently fulfil the requirements set forth in the statute. At oral argument, the plaintiffs warned that different communities might distribute different information.

Nothing about this regulation, however, precludes the commission from construing substantive statutory terms.

The plain language of \u00a7 9-369b makes it clear that the statute neither prohibits criminal conduct nor imposes a criminal sanction. We are similarly unpersuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that \u00a7 9-369b \u201cwarrants a relatively strict test for vagueness as applied\u201d because it \u201chas a tendency to stigmatize.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) There is stigma attached to every civil penalty; this is not sufficient to support the invocation of strict scrutiny. For purposes of vagueness analysis, the relevant inquiry is whether stigma attaches <em>to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>the underlying offense. </em>See, e.g., <em>Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>supra, 455 U.S. 499 (referring to stigma associated with drug trafficking).

I guess maybe to answer your question, when I was subpoenaed to bring information here of any memos that I sent, any directives that I sent to people about any of this, any orders, there were none, none, none, none. My only order in this whole case was to tell [the board\u2019s director of finance operations] not to mail [the pamphlet] until we had heard contrary one way or another from the board chair. I feel that I\u2019ve not been in that part of it, was not in control of that part, of it. . . . I\u2019m . . . used as an advisor for information.
