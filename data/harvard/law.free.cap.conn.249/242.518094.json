We conclude that the dispositional phase of the defendant\u2019s probation revocation hearing was flawed because the defendant was not permitted personally to address the court at that phase of the hearing. Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court in part and direct that court to remand the case to another trial court for a new dispositional hearing at which the defendant will have the right of allocution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The relevant facts are undisputed. After a trial to the court, the defendant was adjudicated a youthful offender<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by having committed the crime of sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On January 30, 1996, the court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of three years, execution suspended, and three years probation. Among other things, the conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation required him to return to school full-time, attend school every day except in the event of an excused absence for illness, arrive at school on time and pass all of his courses to the extent that he was capable of doing so. At the time of sentencing, the trial court was aware that, during the previous school year, the defendant had been absent from school sixty days and tardy fifty-nine days. The defendant also had been suspended five times for his truancy, and once for fighting. Finally, the trial court also was aware that the defendant twice had been adjudicated a juvenile delinquent, that he had failed to complete successfully an alternative incarceration program and that he used illicit drugs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">On April 1,1996, the defendant\u2019s school apprised the defendant\u2019s probation officer that, during the month of March, 1996, the defendant twice had been absent from school without a bona fide excuse, had been tardy twelve times,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> had been suspended once for leaving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>school grounds without authorization and, due to lack of effort, was failing to achieve credit for academic courses. On the basis of this report, the defendant\u2019s probation officer applied for and received a warrant, charging the defendant with violating the conditions of his probation. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-32.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On May 9, 1996, the defendant was arrested pursuant to the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">A probation revocation hearing was conducted on October 17, 1996. Immediately prior to the evidentiary portion of that hearing, counsel for the defendant sought a continuance of the hearing so that a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant, which had been initiated several days earlier, could be completed. The trial court, <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> noting that the hearing already had been scheduled and postponed eleven times, denied the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>dant\u2019s request. The state then presented the testimony of the defendant\u2019s probation officer establishing that the defendant had been fully apprised of the conditions of his probation, and that he had understood them. The state also adduced evidence showing that, during the month of March, 1996, the defendant twice had been absent from school without justification, had been tardy twelve times and had been suspended once.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The defendant, who testified in his own behalf, did not contest the state\u2019s evidence. Rather, he emphasized that, although he frequently had been tardy, he had been absent from school only two days during the relevant time period. He also testified that he had been ill-with the flu on those two days, and that he merely had failed to report his illness until his return to school. Finally, the defendant testified that his suspension was due to the fact that, on one occasion, he had unwittingly violated a school policy by leaving school grounds to buy a soda while school was still in session.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">At the conclusion of the testimony, the state argued that the defendant\u2019s repeated tardiness constituted a violation of the conditions of his probation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defense counsel maintained that, because the defendant had a problem with oversleeping, his tardiness was not wilful and, consequently, the defendant\u2019s conduct did not warrant a finding of a violation. The court, noting that the defendant already had been given \u201cevery opportunity\u201d to change his behavior, concluded that the defendant wilfully violated the conditions of his probation. The court then revoked the order of probation and sentenced the defendant to the previously suspended three year term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Defense counsel immediately objected to the trial court\u2019s imposition of sentence on the ground that she had not been afforded the opportunity to be heard at the dispositional phase of the hearing. With the permission of the trial court, defense counsel then argued that a continuance of the dispositional phase of the hearing was necessaiy so that the defendant\u2019s psychiatric evaluation could be completed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After defense counsel had completed her argument, the court rendered judgment revoking the defendant\u2019s probation and sentencing him to serve the three year term of incarceration that previously had been suspended. Before the defendant had been removed from the courtroom, however, he made several requests personally to address the court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court rejected the defendant\u2019s requests, stating that the hearing had been concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, which, in a per curiam opinion, summarily affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mourning, </em>47 Conn. App. 916, 703 A.2d 1194 (1997). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification, limited to the following issue: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the trial court abuse its discretion by revoking the defendant\u2019s probation of a conviction as a youthful offender and by sentencing the defendant to imprisonment?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mourning, </em>244 Conn. 924, 714 A.2d 11 (1998). We conclude that the trial court properly found the defendant in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>of the conditions of his probation. We also conclude, however, that the defendant is entitled to a new dispositional hearing because the court improperly failed to afford him the opportunity personally to address the court at the dispositional phase of the probation revocation hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The defendant first contends that the trial court improperly found a violation of the conditions of probation. In particular, the defendant claims that: (1) the trial court unduly limited his right to present evidence by rejecting his request for a continuance at the dispositional phase of the probation revocation hearing until completion of the psychiatric evaluation; and (2) the defendant\u2019s tardiness was not wilful and, moreover, his overall attendance record had improved markedly since his adjudication as a youthful offender. These claims, which require little discussion, are meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s contention that he was entitled to a continuance of the hearing so that the psychiatric evaluation could be completed,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>defendant has made no showing \u2014 indeed, he has made no claim \u2014 that he suffered from any psychiatric or other mental condition that might have affected his ability to be at school on time. Because the defendant\u2019s repeated tardiness provided a sufficient basis for the court\u2019s finding that he had violated the conditions of his probation, the defendant has failed to demonstrate how the psychiatric evaluation possibly could have had any bearing on the court\u2019s finding of a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">With regard to the defendant\u2019s second claim, the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the state had demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that the defendant wilfully violated the condition of his probation requiring him to be punctual in his school attendance. The evidence indicated that the defendant was late for school more than 50 percent of the time class was in session during the month of March, 1996. The evidence adduced at the hearing also established that the defendant understood that, as a condition of his probation, he was not to be tardy. There is nothing in the record to indicate, however, that he had taken reasonable steps to avoid being tardy, such as using an alarm clock.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, therefore, it cannot reasonably be maintained that the evidence was insufficient to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant\u2019s repeated tardiness constituted a wilful violation of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The defendant further contends that, in light of his improved overall attendance record, the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>determination that he had violated a condition of his probation by being tardy was unfair and unjustified. The defendant, however, ignores the fact that his probation was conditioned expressly on the requirement that he arrive at school on time, not just that he attend school.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the defendant\u2019s repeated tardiness \u2014 he was late for school more often than not in March, 1996 \u2014 cannot be characterized either as an improvement or as an inconsequential or trivial breach of the probation order.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because the record fully supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant wilfully failed to comply with the condition of his probation requiring him to be punctual, the defendant\u2019s claim must fail.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The defendant next claims that he is entitled to a new dispositional hearing. Specifically, he contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying him a continuance at the dispositional phase of the hearing so that the defendant\u2019s psychiatric evaluation could be completed. We need not address that argument in light of our determination that the defendant is entitled to a new dispositional hearing because he was denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>opportunity personally to address the court at the original hearing.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>243 Conn. 339, 354, 703 A.2d 109 (1997), we held that what is now Practice Book \u00a7 43-10 (3),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which affords criminal defendants the right personally to address the court at the time of sentencing, also applies to the dispositional phase of a probation revocation hearing. In <em>Strickland, </em>as in this case, the defendant had sought the opportunity to address the court immediately after the court had revoked his probation and imposed sentence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>supra, 342-43. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request to speak and, on appeal, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the defendant had no right of allocution at the dispositional phase of the hearing. Id., 343. Upon granting the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal in <em>Strickland, </em>we reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court on the ground that our mies of practice provide a defendant with the right personally to address the court at the dispositional phase of a probation revocation hearing. Id., 354. This case is factually and legally indistinguishable from Strickland,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, in accordance with our holding in <em>Strickland, </em>we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the defendant is entitled to a new dispositional hearing at which he will be afforded the opportunity personally to address the court.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed to the extent that it affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant violated the conditions of his probation; the judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed to the extent that it affirmed the trial court\u2019s revocation of the defendant\u2019s probation and order sentencing him to serve his previously suspended three year prison sentence, and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to remand the case to a new trial court to conduct another dispositional hearing at which the defendant is to be afforded the right of allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and KATZ, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\"> On January 25, 1999, five days after oral argument in this appeal, we granted the defendant a new dispositional hearing. Because the defendant already had served over 800 days of his three year sentence as of that date, we immediately issued a per curiam decision reversing the judgment of the Appellate Court and remanding the case to that court with direction to: (1) reverse the judgment of the trial court in part; and (2) remand the case to the trial court for a new dispositional hearing. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mourning, </em>247 Conn. 634, 635, 723 A.2d 316 (1999). We also indicated that this opinion, which more fully explains our reasons for reversing the judgment of the Appellate Court, would be released subsequently.

Finally, before the sheriff removed the defendant from the courtroom, the defendant once again stated: \u201cYour Honor, can I please talk to you, please? Talk to me, please? I want to talk to you \u2014 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\"> As we have stated, \u201ca probation revocation hearing has two distinct components. . . . The trial court must first conduct an adversarial evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant has in fact violated a condition of probation. ... If the . . . court determines that the evidence has established a violation of a condition of probation, then it proceeds to the second component of probation revocation, the determination of whether the defendant\u2019s probationary status should be revoked. On the basis of its consideration of \u2018the whole record,\u2019 the trial court \u2018may continue or revoke the sentence of probation or conditional discharge or modify or enlarge the conditions, and, if such sentence is revoked, require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 53-32 (b). In malting this second determination, the trial court is vested with broad discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 167, 540 A.2d 679 (1988) (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 289-90, 641 A.2d 370 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b266-12\"> The psychiatric evaluation was not completed by October 17, 1996, the date of the probation revocation hearing, even though the defendant had been arrested for allegedly violating the conditions of his probation on May 9, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\"><em> </em>The state has the burden of establishing a violation of the conditions of probation by a fair preponderance of the evidence. <em>State </em>v.

Unfortunately, however, my colleagxies are unwilling to address the real injustice that lies at the heart of this case. Instead, they have decided this appeal on a technicality. This disposition will once again fuel the perception among members of the African-American community that our system of criminal justice is stacked against them. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>248 Conn. 207, 269-74, 726 A.2d 531 (1999) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting) (observing, inter alia, that \u201cconventional wisdom among African-Americans and other minorities is that they are not treated fairly throughout our judicial system because of their race\u201d); Connecticut Judicial Branch, Statewide Public Trust and Confidence Study (October, 1998) p. 17 (finding that 45.5 percent of Connecticut residents polled believe that \u201cConnecticut courts discriminate against minorities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The trial court revoked Marlik\u2019s probation for no reason other than this: he had a habit of sleeping late and, as a consequence, was often tardy for school.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As her son was led away to prison, Marlik\u2019s mother speculated that the trial court\u2019s sentence was racially motivated. Although there is absolutely no evidence in the record to support such a conclusion, it is clear- that Marlik\u2019s mother believed it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, it is all too easy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>to imagine that other members of the African-American community, upon learning of the circumstances surrounding Marlik\u2019s incarceration, would reach a similar conclusion. Marlik\u2019s mother also repeatedly emphasized that the court\u2019s ruling was \u201cunfair.\u201d With this I agree. To rephrase this agreement in the language of legal discourse, I believe that the trial court abused its discretion by revoking Marlik\u2019s probation and imposing the sentence that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Before turning to the merits of this case, it is necessary to address the fact that the majority decides this case on the technicality that Marlik was deprived of his right of allocution. This issue was never argued by Marlik; was never considered \u2014 let alone decided \u2014 by the Appellate Court; and has nothing to do with the issue that we certified.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See footnote 21 of the majority opinion. Perhaps most importantly, this issue has absolutely nothing to do with the outcome in this case. While I agree that the trial court committed a serious error by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>depriving Marlik of his right of allocution, the transcript strongly suggests that there was nothing Marlik possibly could have said that would have changed the order of the trial court. See the excerpts from the colloquy between Marlik and the court that occurred at the end of the violation of probation hearing, which is set forth later in this dissent. Significantly, this is not a case in which the trial court simply forgot to ask Marlik whether he wished to be heard. In this case, Marlik repeatedly implored the court to listen to him. Again and again, the trial court refused these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">I now turn to the issue that this case is actually about. In order to fully understand the abuse of discretion in this case (and the grave accusation that Marlik\u2019s mother leveled against the trial court), I find it necessary to discuss the facts underlying Marlik\u2019s initial conviction as a youthful offender.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At approximately 5:30 on the morning of June 7,1995, an African-American man allegedly groped a 200 pound white woman while she sat on the front steps of her house and smoked a cigarette. Several hours later, a police officer drove the complainant around the area of the assault in an effort to find the assailant. During this drive, the complainant was inattentive, as she had had only four hours of sleep the night before. The officer pointed to Marlik, who was walking toward his school bus, and asked the complainant if he was the assailant. She responded in the affirmative. At a bench trial before the same judge who ultimately revoked Marlik\u2019s probation, the complainant once again identified Marlik as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The assault occurred during the darkness of 5:30 in the morning, and the complainant had not been wearing her glasses. Nevertheless, the complainant provided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>police with a detailed description other assailant before she identified Marlik on the morning of the assault. According to this description, the assailant bears little resemblance to Marlik, except that they are both African-American. The complainant told the police that the assailant had a medium black skin tone, big round eyes, and a medium build. None of these details describes Marlik, who has very dark skin, almond-shaped eyes, and a slender build. In addition, Marlik\u2019s clothing was completely different from the clothing worn by the assailant. Moreover, Marlik was sixteen years old at the time of his arrest, and the complainant stated that her assailant was between eighteen and twenty years old. The complainant\u2019s in-court identification was not corroborated by any other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Marlik presented a defense of mistaken identity. More specifically, he testified that he had overslept on the morning of the alleged assault. As we know, Marlik had a habit of oversleeping. Marlik testified that he was in bed, fast asleep, at 5:30 on the morning of the assault. His uncle corroborated this account. William Curtis, the director of a Danbury youth center, testified that Marlik is not an aggressive person and has no history of committing sexual assault or any similar offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Marlik\u2019s case was both simple and compelling: (1) it was dark at the time of the assault; (2) the complainant was not wearing her glasses at the time of the assault; (3) Marlik was asleep at the time of the assault; and (4) the initial description of the assailant did not describe Marlik. Despite these evidentiary difficulties, the trial court found Marlik guilty of sexual assault in the third degree. In order to rationalize this judgment, the trial court relied upon an inculpatory fact that had no evidentiary foundation: it announced that the complainant saw the assailant\u2019s face when he used a match to light a cigarette. Although the complainant testified that the assailant smoked a cigarette, there was not a shred of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>evidence before the trial court that tended to suggest that the complainant ever got a good look at his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The following colloquy took place at the sentencing:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u201c[Marlik\u2019s Mother]: . . . [The assailant] was not my son. The whole description of the person is not my son, but there is nothing I could do about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\u201cThe Court: . . .

What\u2019s to be lost by it? Take him off the street where he can\u2019t get into \u2014 do any more harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\">\u201c[Marlik\u2019s Attorney]: [Probation will] force him to follow the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u201cThe Court: It\u2019s going to postpone the inevitable, that\u2019s all it\u2019s going to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\"><em>* </em>* =!\u25a0\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u201cI don\u2019t care.

He\u2019s getting an opportunity now. If he throws it away, it\u2019s his fault, not ours.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">\u201cNobody makes [Marlik] do anything except what he wants to do when he wants to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">\u201c[Marlik\u2019s Mother]: Believe me, I try. I do try. I\u2019m not easy on him. I try.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">\u201cThe Court: Well, it hasn\u2019t been too successful, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">The trial court sentenced Marlik to a prison term of three years as a youthful offender, suspended the sentence, and placed him on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">Before being placed on probation, Marlik had been absent from school sixty times, tardy fifty-nine times, and suspended six times. While on probation, Marlik followed a sharp upward trajectory of improvement. He was absent only twice; each time, he was in bed with the flu. He was suspended only once, for leaving school grounds during recess to buy a can of soda from a nearby store.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>1 recognize that Marlik was often tardy. He was tardy because he habitually overslept.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>After he had been on probation for five months, Marlik was arrested on a warrant that was issued because he had violated the terms of his probation by being late to school. During his probation, Marlik had become substantially more diligent about his studies. It is apparent to me that probation \u2014 as opposed to incarceration \u2014 promoted the best interests of Marlik, the best interests of society, and the interests of justice. Recognizing this fact, Shaun Ratchford, the director of a program for students needing academic assistance in which Marlik was enrolled, offered his \u201cstrong recommendation that violation of Marlik\u2019s probation <em>[should] not result in incarceration </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The complainant from the underlying offense joined in this recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Although Marlik was arrested for violating the terms of his probation on May 9,1996, a special public defender was not appointed to represent him until September 12, 1996<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>. Apparently, the trial court continued the case multiple times during the intervening four months. Just six days after she was finally appointed, Marlik\u2019s attorney sought to retain a psychologist \u2014 at the state\u2019s expense\u2014 to evaluate Marlik.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Marlik\u2019s attorney intended to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the results in his defense at the hearing on the violation of his probation. Marlik met with the psychologist for the first time on October 8,1996, foraninety minute appointment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additional appointments were scheduled for October 21 and October 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The same trial judge who had convicted and sentenced Marlik conducted a probation violation hearing on October 17,1996 \u2014 a few days before Marlik\u2019s second scheduled appointment and just more than one week before his third and final scheduled appointment. Marlik\u2019s attorney sought a continuance because the psychologist had not yet completed her evaluation. The trial court\u2019s sole response to this request was to ask \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d and \u2014 upon being told that there was not \u2014 informed the sheriff that \u201c[Marlik is] remanded to custody . . . .\u201d For all intents and purposes, the trial court ignored the public defender\u2019s request for a continuance. In so doing, the trial court clearly acted upon its sense that \u201cthe probation system [has] become ajoke\u201d and that \u201c[w]e\u2019re continuing cases . . . until they go out of style.\u201d While it is true that four months elapsed between the time when Marlik was arrested for violating his probation, it is apparent that this delay was not Marlik\u2019s fault.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> More to the point, whether or not there is any merit to the trial court\u2019s obvious frustration, the court should not have sought catharsis by depriving a sixteen year old of his liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In my view, the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to consider the psychologist\u2019s report before (1) finding that Marlik had violated his probation and (2) sentencing him to spend three years of his life behind bars. The majority counters that Marlik \u201chas failed to demonstrate how the psychiatric evaluation possibly could have had any bearing on the court\u2019s finding of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>violation.\u201d This assertion is silly. If the psychologist\u2019s report had demonstrated that Marlik\u2019s tardiness was attributable to psychological difficulties that were beyond his control, then of course this evidence would have been relevant to the issue of wilfulness.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Equally important, the psychologist could have testified as to (1) whether incarceration held any promise of contributing to Marlik\u2019s rehabilitation and (2) whether Marlik represented a threat to any members of the community. Accordingly, even if the trial court had found a wilful violation after considering the psychological evaluation, the psychologist\u2019s testimony might have enabled the court to realize that sentencing a sixteen year old to spend three months in jail for each of the twelve times that he was late for class was so grotesquely disproportionate as to constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The following colloquy took place at the end of the trial court\u2019s hearing on Marlik\u2019s violation of the terms of his probation:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u201cThe Court: . . . The court is tired of people who abuse the violation of probation \u2014 the probation system [has] become a joke. We\u2019re continuing cases on here until they go out of style ....</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u201c[Marlik is] ordered committed to the custody of the commissioner] of correction ....</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u201c[Marlik\u2019s Attorney]: Your Honor, I\u2019d like to be heard on sentencing.

[T]he school recommends that he not be incarcerated, but [rather] placed in a residential placement. ... I think that ought to be considered by the court and that we have time to complete the [psychological] evaluation and find an appropriate residential placement for [Marlik].</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u201cThe Court: Is there anything else? Is there anything else?</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u201c[Marlik\u2019s Attorney]: No, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\u201cThe Court: He\u2019s remanded to custody, Sheriff. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">\u201c[Marlik]: Your Honor, I\u2019m trying.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">\u201cThe Court: He\u2019s remanded to custody, that\u2019s the end of it.

Unfortunately, I have no power to undo that.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because it is all that I can do, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by revoking Marlik\u2019s probation, thus sentencing a sixteen year old to spend three months in prison for each of the twelve times that he overslept.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-10\"> By the time we entered our order of release, Marlik had been incarcerated for more than 800 days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\"> Although the interim per curiam opinion, which I joined, focused on the \"dispositional phase of the probation revocation proceeding\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mourning, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 635; I now conclude for the reasons set forth in this dissent that Marlik is entitled to a new hearing on whether he wilfully violated his probation. See footnote 10 of this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\"> In its original opinion released on June 8,1999, the majority conceded that \"[t]he state relied <em>solely </em>on [Maxlik\u2019s] tardiness to support its claim that [he] had violated the conditions of his probation.\" (Emphasis added.) The clairvoyant majority, in an amendment to its original published opinion, now claims that \u201cthe state also relied on [Marlik\u2019s] [two] unexcused absences and suspension from school\u201d (based on Marlik\u2019s purchase of a soda off school grounds), notwithstanding the failure of the state to advance those claims in its argument before the trial court. See foot note 8 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\"> The majority states that \u201c[t]his case is not about discrimination, and no such allegation ever has been raised by [Marlik] or defense counsel . . . This statement simply misses the point. It is technically true that Marlik did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>not allege that he was the victim of discrimination; because he was denied his right of allocution, he had no opportunity to do so. It is also technically true that defense counsel did not advance this argument. The whole truth, however, is that Marlik\u2019s mother articulated with unambiguous clarity her opinion that the trial court imposed a draconian sentence upon her child because he was African-American. Far from feeling any desire to \u201c[inject] the specter of racial discrimination into this case,\u201d I simply feel it is my obligation to report the statements that Marlik\u2019s mother made. On the record and in open court, Marlik\u2019s mother expressed her belief that the trial court was swayed by two invidious facts: (1) Marlik is African-American; and (2) the alleged victim of the underlying offense is white. Under the circumstances of this case, we simply cannot ignore this belief, which echoes those held by nearly one half of the respondents to the recent Statewide Public Trust and Confidence Study, supra. In my view, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to make any effort to dispel the appearance of injustice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b272-11\"> We granted certification limited to the following issue: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the trial court abuse its discretion by revoking [Marlik\u2019s] probation of a conviction as a youthful offender and by sentencing [him] to imprisonment?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mourning, </em>244 Conn. 924, 714 A.2d 11 (1998). It is apparent that this question has nothing to do with depriving Marlik of his right of allocution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\"> Based upon the record before us, there is a substantial doubt in my mind that Marlik committed the underlying offense. Nevertheless, I realize that this concern lies outside 1he scope of the question that is before the court. See footnote 5 of this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b276-16\"> There is no evidence in the record suggesting that Marlik knew that his errand constituted an infraction of school rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\"> Although an undated appearance form was filed by an attorney from the public defender\u2019s office on behalf of Marlik, that attorney did not represent him because of a conflict of interest. The conflict was based on the fact that the public defender\u2019s office previously had represented Marlik\u2019s accuser who herself had a prior criminal case that had resulted in a conviction. A special public defender was not appointed as trial counsel until September 12, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"> Trial counsel for Marlik pointed out before the Appellate Court: \u201cThe next day [after appointment of trial counsel for Marlik on September 12, 1996] I had contacted the doctor to find out the cost and whether an evaluation could be done. On [September 18] I put in the request for funds, which was granted on October 1. And between October 1 and October 17,1 managed to get at least one appointment in with the doctor. So I did indicate to the [trial] judge at the beginning,\u2018this is what I\u2019ve done. . . . And we just haven\u2019t had time to get it finished because we had to go through the public defender\u2019s office and get the funds.\u2019 And that was why I was requesting a continuance so that I could have that evidence to present. And the [trial] judge did not permit that. He precluded me from presenting evidence that would support our proposition that [Marlik] was still receiving the . . . benefits of probation and that probation should be continued.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b278-10\"> The evaluation was delayed until early October because it took a considerable amount of time to obtain approval for the funds used to retain the psychologist. See footnote 12 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b278-11\"> As discussed previously, Marlik\u2019s attorney sought to retain a psychologist just six days after she was appointed. See footnote 9 of this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\"> The trial court was required to make an inquiry \u201cinto the reasons for the failure to obey the conditions of probation and an assessment ... as to whether those reasons fall into the category of willful disobedience of the court\u2019s sentence .... See <em>Bearden </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>461 U.S. 660, 103 S. Ct. 2064, 76 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1983).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooley, </em>3 Conn.

Clearly, the trial court believed at one point that such an evaluation might have some bearing upon its deliberations. Having made such a determination, I believe that the trial court abused its discretion by revoking Marlik\u2019s probation just days before the state-sponsored evaluation was scheduled to have been completed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b281-23\"> In my view, the state has an obligation to make appropriate professional services available to Marlik, in an effort to (1) address the trauma caused by his incarceration and (2) compensate for any education that he may have missed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
