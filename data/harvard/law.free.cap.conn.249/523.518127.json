In broad strokes, the jury awarded damages on two grounds: (1) the defendant employer breached an implied contract not to terminate the plaintiff employee except for just cause; and (2) the former defamed the latter. We decline to set aside either aspect of this verdict, but nevertheless conclude that a remittitur is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The plaintiff, Brian Gaudio, had worked in various capacities for the defendant, Griffin Health Services Corporation (hereinafter defendant or hospital), since 1985. Alter two years of part-time work in the laundry department and one year of part-time work in the patient transport division, the plaintiff was employed as a full-time weekend security officer in 1988. There was a significant amount of evidence concerning the nature of the promises extended to the plaintiff by the defendant, which we discuss at length below. For present purposes, it suffices to note that, at trial, the plaintiff relied heavily upon the content of the defendant\u2019s Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual (manual), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>which was given to him when he commenced his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">On May 8, 1990, the plaintiff and his partner Brian Healey were called to the emergency room to guard a patient in the psychiatric holding area; the patient had psychological problems and was in an alcohol-induced stupor. Several hours later, the patient woke up; he was still extremely intoxicated. In the plaintiffs words: \u201cThe patient became very verbally abusive, hostile, aggressive, started [destroying] hospital property, [made] hand gestures, us[ed] profanity, [and became] like a firecracker that was being lit off. He exploded.\u201d Upon learning that he was being admitted to the hospital, the patient said, \u201cNo fucking way am I staying here tonight,\u201d and told the plaintiff that, \u201c[i]f it comes down to me or you, it\u2019s going to be you.\u201d Moreover, the patient struck his fist into his palm, paced back and forth, punched the door and the walls, and ripped the telephone off the wall. In order to subdue the patient, the physician in charge, Joseph Dell\u2019Aria, ordered a \u201cCode 7\u201d \u2014 a request for all male personnel to assist in restraining the patient. A number of male staff members responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Although there was conflicting testimony concerning what happened next, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The patient charged the plaintiff and Healey in an effort to escape from the room. The plaintiff and Healey prevented the escape by wrestling the patient to the ground. The plaintiff and two others then lifted the patient onto a stretcher. During this time, the patient kicked, punched, bit, and spat at the plaintiff and his coworkers. Once he had been placed on a stretcher, the patient \u201cbang[ed] his head against the guard rails . . . [and] whack[ed] his head from side to side . . . attempting to rock the stretcher and flip [it over].\u201d The plaintiff climbed onto the stretcher in order to stabilize it. The patient continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>to punch, bite and spit at the plaintiff, saying, \u201cFuck you, you big motherfucker. I got AIDS and you\u2019re going to die with AIDS.\u201d The plaintiff testified that he employed a proper restraint technique that comported with hospital policy. The plaintiff explained that he did this in order \u201cto prevent [the patient] from further biting and spitting at [him] and [causing] further injury to himself from banging [his head against] the guard rails of the stretcher . . . .\u201d The patient was successfully restrained in short order. While restrained, the patient threatened to sue the hospital. The plaintiff required medical attention on two separate occasions for the injuries that he suffered as a result of his participation in the restraint of the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">At a meeting convened at 9 o\u2019clock the following morning \u2014 less than twelve hours after the incident\u2014 the hospital management decided to terminate the plaintiff, even though he had never before been subject to discipline for any misconduct (meeting). This decision was based upon a report presented by William Powanda, the vice president of the hospital. Powanda admitted that he did not speak with any of the witnesses. Instead, his presentation was based almost entirely upon a memo prepared by Raymond Gurdak, the hospital\u2019s security supervisor (Gurdak memo). Gurdak, in turn, merely summarized the statements of several purported witnesses, some of whom had allegedly accused the plaintiff of striking the patient.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff questions the adequacy of the Gurdak memo, a concern that we address more fully in part I D of this opinion. Powanda also had access to a form that Gurdak had asked the plaintiff to complete on the evening of the incident (incident report). In this incident report, the plaintiff stated that the patient was \u201cvery violent and combative,\u201d that the patient was \u201ctotally out of control,\u201d and that, \u201cto protect [himself] and the people around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>[him, the plaintiff] had to use reasonable force by knocking the patient down.\u201d The plaintiff further explained in the incident report that, in order to prevent the patient from biting, scratching and spitting at staff members, he \u201chad to use reasonable force by holding his face down.\u201d The plaintiff neither stated nor implied that he struck the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The following people did <em>not </em>attend the meeting, because they were not invited to do so: the plaintiff; Dell\u2019Aria, the physician in charge on the night of the incident (listed as a witness on the incident report); Healey, the plaintiffs partner (also listed as a witness on the incident report); and Janice Yankowski, the hospital\u2019s director of human resources. The patient was never contacted for his version of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">According to Powanda, the defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t want to make the patient issue bigger than it was with the patient . . . .\u2019\u2019At the meeting held the morning after the incident, the hospital\u2019s management addressed the fear that the patient would assert a lawsuit against the defendant. For this reason, the defendant\u2019s risk manager was present, even though she ordinarily did not attend such meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The day after the meeting, Gurdak delivered a letter of termination to the plaintiff, which included the following sentence: \u201c[You] displayed bad judgment and did not follow established procedures regarding restraint of a patient.\u201d At least three of the plaintiffs supervisors read the letter: Powanda (the vice president) drafted it; Yankowski (the director of human resources) signed it; and Gurdak delivered it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When he delivered the letter, Gurdak told the plaintiff that he was being termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>nated \u201cdue to the fact that the hospital is in fear of a lawsuit from the patient.\u201d A copy of the letter was placed in the plaintiff\u2019s personnel file.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The plaintiff testified that he was emotionally devastated in the wake of his discharge, and that he had a difficult time making financial ends meet. As a result of his depression, a romantic relationship terminated and the plaintiff lost a substantial amount of weight. Although he eventually secured a job as a university security officer, the plaintiff testified that he felt \u201clike a person with bad credit . . . [and] that [he] would never have an opportunity to seek a decent job . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In response to written interrogatories, the jury made the following findings: (1) the defendant was bound by an implied contract; (2) the terms of this contract prohibited termination without just cause; and (3) the defendant did not possess just cause to terminate the plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The jury also found that the defendant (1) breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) defamed the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the jury rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>verdicts in favor of the plaintiff,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> awarding him $100,000 in economic damages and $100,000 in noneconomic damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court thereafter denied the defendant\u2019s motions to set aside the verdict, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for remittitur. The court thereupon rendered judgment for the plaintiff in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. We affirm the judgment except as to the award of economic damages, with respect to which we order a remittitur in the amount of $39,089.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The defendant claims that the trial court incorrectly submitted the following issues to the jury: (1) whether an implied contract bound the defendant to continue to employ the plaintiff unless there were just cause for his termination; and (2) if so, whether the defendant breached that contract. The defendant further claims that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s affirmative answers to these two questions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">As a threshold matter, the defendant argues that\u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 it was not bound by an implied contract. Accordingly, the defendant claims that the court improperly submitted this issue to the jury. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u201c[A]ll employer-employee relationships not governed by express contracts involve some type of implied \u2018contract\u2019 of employment. \u2018There cannot be any serious dispute that there is a bargain of some kind; otherwise, the employee would not be working.\u2019 1 H. Perritt, Employee Dismissal Law and Practice (3d Ed. 1992) \u00a7 4.32, p. 326.\u201d <em>Torosyan </em>v. <em>Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 1, 13, 662 A.2d 89 (1995). It is firmly established that \u201cstatements in an employer\u2019s personnel manual may . . . under appropriate circumstances . . . give rise to an express or implied contract between employer and employee. <em>Magnan </em>v. <em>Anaconda Industries, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 558, 564, 479 A.2d 781 (1984); see generally <em>Dolak </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>145 Conn. 497, 503, 144 A.2d 312 (1958) (statements in written retirement plan gave rise to employer-employee contract); <em>Tilbert </em>v. <em>Eagle Lock Co., </em>116 Conn. 357, 361-63, 165 A. 205 (1933) (assurances in employee benefit plan constituted enforceable promise to pay benefits in accordance with plan).\u201d <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>202 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>190, 198-99, 520 A.2d 208 (1987), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>225 Conn. 782, 786, 626 A.2d 719 (1993); see note, \u201cProtecting At Will Employees Against Wrongful Discharge: The Duty to Terminate Only in Good Faith,\u201d 93 Harv. L. Rev. 1816, 1820-21 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">In this case, the manual does not contain express contract language that definitively states either that employees are at-will or that they may be terminated only for just cause. \u201cIn the absence of [such] language . . . the determination of what the parties intended to encompass in their contractual commitments is a question of the intention of the parties, and an inference of fact. <em>Bead Chain Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Saxton Products, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 266, 274-75, 439 A.2d 314 (1981).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 202 Conn. 199. Because it is an inference of fact, determining the intent of the parties is within the province of the jury: it is \u201c \u2018the raison d\u2019etre of the jury system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coelho </em>v. <em>Posi-Seal International, Inc., </em>208 Conn. 106, 113, 544 A.2d 170 (1988); accord <em>Torosyan </em>v. <em>Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 234 Conn. 15; <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 199; <em>Toussaint </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich. 579, 613, 292 N.W.2d 880 (1980); <em>Pine River State Bank </em>v. <em>Mettille, </em>333 N.W.2d 622, 628 (Minn. 1983); <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>McGraw-Hill, Inc., </em>57 N.Y.2d 458, 465-66, 443 N.E.2d 441, 457 N.Y.S.2d 193 (1982). Accordingly, the trial court correctly submitted to the jury the task of determining the contours of the parties\u2019 intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The defendant further maintains that there was insufficient evidence to support various aspects of the verdict that the jury rendered and, accordingly, challenges the trial court\u2019s decision not to set aside these aspects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>of the verdict. The standard of review that governs such claims is well settled, and extremely rigorous. We shall delineate it here, and invoke it as necessary throughout our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">We are disinclined to disturb jury verdicts, and we accord great deference to the vantage of the trial judge, who possesses a unique opportunity to evaluate the credibility of witnesses. <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Price, </em>145 Conn. 560, 564, 145 A.2d 127 (1958). \u201cThe concurrence of the judgments of the [trial] judge and the jury . . . is a powerful argument\u201d for upholding the verdict. Id.; accord <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Golenbock, </em>238 Conn. 183, 207-208, 680 A.2d 1243 (1996); <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 597, 610, 662 A.2d 753 (1995); <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Griffin Hospital, </em>207 Conn. 125, 130, 540 A.2d 666 (1988). Furthermore, it is not the function of this court to \u201csit as the seventh juror when we review the sufficiency of the evidence . . . rather, we must determine, <em>in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, </em>whether the totality of the evidence, including reasonable inferences therefrom, supports the jury\u2019s verdict . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Purzycki </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>244 Conn. 101, 112-13, 708 A.2d 937 (1998). In making this determination, \u201c[t]he evidence must be given the most favorable construction in support of the verdict of which it is reasonably capable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fink </em>v. <em>Golenbock, </em>supra, 208. In other words, \u201c[i]f the jury <em>could </em>reasonably have reached its conclusion, the verdict must stand,\u201d even if this court disagrees with it. (Emphasis added.) <em>Donner v. Kearse, </em>234 Conn. 660, 681-82, 662 A.2d 1269 (1995); see <em>Trzcinski </em>v. <em>Richey, </em>190 Conn. 285, 298, 460 A.2d 1269 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Two further fundamental points bear emphasis. First, the plaintiff in a civil matter is not required to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>his case beyond a reasonable doubt; a mere preponderance of the evidence is sufficient.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, the well established standards compelling great deference to the historical function of the jury find their roots in the constitutional right to a trial by jury. <em>Purzycki </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 112-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the jury reasonably could not have found an implied contract cannot withstand scrutiny through the lens of this standard of review. We have stated with unambiguous clarity that \u201cemployers can protect themselves against employee contract claims based on statements made in personnel manuals\u201d by following either (or both) of two simple procedures: (1) \u201ceschewing language that could reasonably be construed as a basis for a contractual promise\u201d; and/or (2) \u201cincluding appropriate disclaimers of the intention to contract . . . .\u201d <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 202 Conn. 199 n.5.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant concedes that the manual given to the plaintiff when he began working for the defendant contains no disclaimers. The question, then, is whether the jury reasonably could have concluded that the manual eschews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>language that evinces an intention to contract. We answer this question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The manual contains language from which the jury reasonably could have inferred the presence of an implied contract not to terminate the plaintiff except for just cause. The manual provides that the defendant will \u201cprotect the privileges, interests, and benefits of its employees\u201d and treat them \u201creasonably,\u201d \u201cequitably,\u201d and \u201cuniformly.\u201d In four separate statements, the defendant promises that it will be \u201cfair\u201d in its dealings with employees. In three separate statements, the defendant pledges that it will treat all employees \u201cconsistently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The manual gives shape to these promises by stating that a discharge may be justified only by \u201c[Repeated violations or incidents involving serious misconduct . . . .\u201d In a policy entitled \u201cGrievance Procedure,\u201d the defendant requires \u201cdocumentation to support the management's] action . . . [including proof] that all the facts related to the event were reviewed.\u201d A nonexhaustive list of \u201cfactors that should be considered in determining the action to be taken\u201d includes: \u201cseriousness, frequency and nature of the violation; length of service; work histoiy; and customary disciplinary practices.\u201d Exceptions to these or any other policies must be obtained pursuant to the following four stage process: (1) a request for an exception must be \u201csubmitted to the Administrative Representative and the Personnel Director for review and analysis\u201d; (2) these officials must \u201cpresent their evaluation and recommendation on the Exception to the Administrative Cabinet\u201d; (3) the cabinet must \u201creview and make a recommendation to the Administrator\u201d; and (4) \u201c[a]ll Exceptions to [the] Policy require the approval and signature of the Administrator.\u201d It is undisputed that this procedure was not followed in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>From nothing more than the language of the manual, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant intended to bind itself to a contract, pursuant to which it could not terminate employees absent just cause. In sharp contrast to the premise that lies at the core of at-will employment \u2014 that an employer possesses an unfettered right to terminate an employee at any time, for any reason or no reason \u2014 the defendant in this case promised to hold itself to more rigorous standards. See <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>243 Conn. 66, 79, 89, 700 A.2d 655 (1997). More specifically, the defendant promised, inter alia, not to terminate employees unless they had either committed \u201c[r]epeated violations\u201d or engaged in \u201cserious misconduct.\u201d The jury reasonably could have concluded that this is the very definition of just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Furthermore, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the testimony of other employees of the hospital confirmed this interpretation of the manual. The director of human resources, Yankowski, testified that employees were entitled to rely on the fact that the defendant would comply with the policies contained in the manual, and that \u2014 pursuant to the manual\u2014 employees could <em>not </em>be terminated \u201cfor no reason\u201d; instead, the defendant \u201cwould endeavor to find a reason [for the termination] and to be fair in that reasoning.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Similar testimony was given by two other agents of the hospital. The hospital\u2019s security supervisor testified that employees of the security department could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>be terminated absent cause, and that this protection stems from the manual. The vice president of the hospital emphasized that, pursuant to the manual, an employee could not be terminated unless he had repeatedly violated hospital policies or engaged in serious misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In addition, the jury reasonably could have credited the plaintiffs testimony that \u201cI was promised [that] as long as I was doing my job and . . . continued to do a good job, I would be there for as long as I wished . . . .\u201d The jury further could have credited his testimony that personnel in the human resources department made this promise to the plaintiff in 1985, and that both patient transport and security personnel reiterated this promise when the plaintiff began working for those units of the hospital. It is of no moment that the plaintiff could not recall the names of the individuals who made these promises. As we recently stated in <em>Torosyan </em>v. <em>Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 234 Conn. 12, \u201c[b]ecause the plaintiff testified as to . . . alleged oral statements concerning his future job security and the [trier] found that testimony credible, there was sufficient evidence for the [trier] to find that the statements were in fact made . . . [even if] the defendant\u2019s witnesses [had expressly] denied having made the statements . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Based upon the text of the manual and the testimony of both the plaintiff and several agents of the hospital, the jury reasonably could have concluded: (1) that an implied contract existed; and (2) that the terms of this contract precluded the defendant from terminating employees absent just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The defendant argues in the alternative that, even if an implied contract did exist, the jury could not reasonably have concluded that the defendant committed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>breach. The defendant also argues that the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury with respect to the plaintiffs breach of contract claim. We disagree on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">It is well settled that \u201ccourts should not lightly intervene to impair the exercise of managerial discretion . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Faulkner v. United Technologies Corp., </em>240 Conn. 576, 589, 693 A.2d 293 (1997); see <em>D\u2019Ulisse-Cupo </em>v. <em>Board of Directors of Notre Dame High School, </em>202 Conn. 206, 216, 520 A.2d 217 (1987). Although \u201c \u2018just cause\u2019 substantially limits [managerial] discretion,\u201d this simply means that employers are \u201cforbid[den] ... to act arbitrarily or capriciously.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 475, 427 A.2d 385 (1980). In other words, an employer who wishes to terminate an employee for cause must do nothing more rigorous than \u201cproffer a proper reason for dismissal.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In the present appeal, the trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cThe [defendant] must <em>provide a reason for the dismissal </em>of an employee and cannot <em>arbitrarily or capriciously </em>terminate an employee. . . . [A]n employer rightfully has managerial discretion in making such decisions and the right to make independent, good faith judgments. In making your decision, <em>you cannot interfere with the legitimate exercise of managerial discretion. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) In response to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>interrogatory based upon this instruction, the jury determined that the defendant \u201cterminate[d] the plaintiffs employment without just cause and <em>outside the area of legitimate managerial </em>discretion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As the emphasized language makes clear, both the charge and the interrogatory comport with our well settled law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court correctly instructed the jury on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In light of the court\u2019s instruction, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant did not possess just cause to terminate the plaintiff. In the report that he wrote on the night of the incident, the plaintiff twice characterized the force that he was required to employ in order to restrain the patient as \u201creasonable.\u201d Accordingly, this report could not have supplied the basis of his termination.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The only other relevant document that Powanda relied upon in his report to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>hospital management was the Gurdak memo, the sufficiency of which the jury had substantial reason to question.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the one and one-half page memo, Gurdak purported to paraphrase brief comments by eight alleged witnesses to the incident. One of these \u201cwitnesses,\u201d Roy Garogalo, a Derby police officer, testified that he never spoke with Gurdak about the plaintiffs conduct. According to Robert Steffero, the first person to respond to the request for assistance,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> five of the remaining seven \u201cwitnesses\u201d listed in the Gurdak memo had not been present in the room during the incident.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Neither of the remaining two witnesses \u2014 Chris Edwards or Dell\u2019Aria \u2014 asserted that the plaintiff struck the patient.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, these latter two witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>described the patient as \u201cextremely violent,\u201d \u201caggressive,\u201d \u201cagitated,\u201d and \u201cabusive.\u201d Edwards blamed Dell\u2019Aria for \u201cletfting] this get out of hand . . . .\u201d Furthermore, Dell\u2019Aria contradicted Gurdak\u2019s testimony that he conducted formal interviews with witnesses in a separate room. Instead, Dell\u2019Aria testified that Gurdak intercepted him in the hallway as he was on his way to take a shower and casually asked him what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In addition, the defendant had a policy in its manual that provides as follows: \u201cdischarge actions may be imposed only with the prior discussion and approval of the Personnel Director . ...\u201d As previously discussed, exceptions to this or any other policy may be obtained only through recourse to an intentionally cumbersome bypass procedure. In the present case, Yankowski did not attend the meeting at which the plaintiffs fate was determined. Accordingly, the defendant neither \u201cdiscussed\u201d the discharge with her nor sought her \u201cprior . . . approval.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nor did the defendant secure an exception to the policy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Further, there was ample evidence from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant (1) did not reasonably believe that the plaintiff had assaulted a patient and (2) was in fact motivated by its desire to avoid legal liability.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> First, the patient threatened to sue the defendant. Second, during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>meeting, the hospital management addressed the fear that the patient would assert a lawsuit against the defendant. Third, the defendant\u2019s risk manager was present at the meeting, even though she ordinarily does not attend such meetings. Fourth, Gurdak informed the plaintiff that he was being terminated \u201cdue to the fact that the hospital is in fear of a lawsuit from the patient.\u201d Fifth, Powanda testified that the procedures followed in this matter were \u201cunusual,\u201d and that he could not \u201crecall ever having a meeting based on an incident that soon after the incident.\u201d Sixth, a number of witnesses were not interviewed. Seventh, a number of individuals who should have attended the meeting were not invited to do so. Eighth, the plaintiff was not permitted to respond to the serious accusations leveled against him. Finally, the management of the hospital conducted absolutely no investigation, apart from considering Powanda\u2019s report. The jury reasonably could have concluded that this report was exceedingly flimsy, and that it contained nothing more reliable than hearsay piled upon hearsay: Powanda merely presented Gurdak\u2019s cursory and unreliable memo, which in turn purported to paraphrase the statements of six \u201cwitnesses\u201d who were not in the room during the incident and two others who did not accuse the plaintiff of any impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Based upon all of the evidence, the juiy reasonably could have concluded that the defendant terminated the plaintiff without just cause. Accordingly, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant breached its implied contract with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">In its letter of termination, the defendant accused the plaintiff of \u201cdisplay[ing] bad judgment and [violating] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>established procedures regarding restraint of apatient.\u201d The defendant does not dispute that these statements are per se defamatory, in that they \u201c[charge] improper conduct or lack of skill or integrity in one\u2019s profession or business and [are] of such a nature that [they are] calculated to cause injury to one in his profession or business.\u201d <em>Proto </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corp., </em>136 Conn. 557, 566, 72 A.2d 820 (1950). Nor does the defendant dispute that these statements were published.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>defendant\u2019s sole defense consists of the observation that it possessed a qualified privilege and the argument that the jury could not reasonably have concluded that the defendant abused this privilege. The defendant\u2019s threshold observation is correct. \u201c[Communications between managers regarding the review of an employee\u2019s job performance and the preparation of documents regarding an employee\u2019s termination are protected by a <em>qualified </em>privilege.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Torosyan </em>v. <em>Boehringer Ingelheim, Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 234 Conn. 29. The defendant\u2019s argument that it did not abuse this privilege, however, is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Although a qualified privilege insulates many defamatory statements and shields many defendants from liability, the privilege does not protect a defendant who makes statements that are both defamatory and malicious. See, e.g., id.; <em>Bleich </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>196 Conn. 498, 504, 493 A.2d 236 (1985); 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 600 (1977). For the reasons previously discussed, the jury reasonably could have determined that the defendant acted with malice by publishing the letter. More specifically, the jury \u201creasonably could have inferred from the evidence that the defendant\u2019s agents published a false statement in order to effectuate the plaintiffs discharge, even though they doubted the statement\u2019s veracity.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See <em>Woodcock </em>v. <em>Journal Publishing Co., </em>230 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Conn. 525, 527, 646 A.2d 92 (1994) (in suit by public figure against media defendant, finding of actual malice permissible when there is \u2018sufficient evidence to permit the [inference] that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication\u2019).\u201d <em>Torosyan </em>v. <em>Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 234 Conn. 30; see <em>Bleich </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>supra, 504 (\u201cmalice is not restricted to hatred, spite or ill will against a plaintiff, but includes any improper or unjustifiable motive\u201d).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that \u201cthe statements made by the defendant in the letter terminating the plaintiffs employment [were] made maliciously or for an improper or unjustifiable motive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in several of its evidentiary rulings.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">It is well settled that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 497, 590 A.2d 901 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 659, 491 A.2d 345 (1985).

This figure represents the sum of $38,632 (the plaintiffs net lost wages) and $22,279 (interest to the date of judgment). The jury, however, awarded the plaintiff $100,000 in economic damages. The defendant argues that the plaintiff is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>entitled to $39,089 \u2014 the difference between the award of economic damages and $60,911. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The plaintiff has not identified anything in the record from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that he incurred nearly $40,000 in economic damages above and beyond back pay and the interest accrued thereon. In its memorandum denying the defendant\u2019s posttrial motions, the trial court failed to identify any evidence in support of this aspect of the award, and our independent review of the record has not disclosed any. All that we have before us are the speculative and vague hypotheses that the plaintiff has advanced before this court in order to account for the $40,000 windfall that he has received. Even when they are viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, these hypotheses are not sufficient to support the disputed portion of the verdict.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> For this reason, we find that this aspect of the verdict does not reflect the requisite quantum of \u201creasonable certainty,\u201d notwithstanding the deference that we owe to the work of both the jury and the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the verdict rendered by the jury and endorsed by the trial court, except with respect to the portion of the economic damages discussed in this opinion.

As our emphasis makes clear, Yankowski said nothing about tire defendant\u2019s duty to its employees: she did not testify that the defendant could terminate an employee without cause.

Accordingly, at the time that the plaintiff completed the incident report, there were no accusations to which he could respond.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b559-5\"> Powanda also had access to the patient\u2019s medical report, which indicated new injuries (including a tiny laceration on his lip and a slightly loose tooth) in the wake of the incident. These injuries are hardly surprising in light of the testimony that the patient thrashed about, punched the walls, and repeatedly slammed his head against the guard rails of the stretcher.

In the present appeal, at least three of the plaintiffs supervisors read the letter: Powanda drafted it, Yankowsld signed it, and Gurdak delivered it. Furthermore, the letter was placed in the plaintiffs personnel file. These facts justify the court\u2019s instruction, in its interrogatories to the jury, that the requirement of publication is satisfied \u201cwhere a defamatory statement is communicated among the [employee\u2019s] supervisors and is included in his personnel file . . . [and that] the evidence showed that there was such communication and [that] the defamatory letter was put in the plaintiffs personnel file.\u201d The defendant did not take exception to this interrogatory; nor did the defendant taire exception to the portion of the court\u2019s jury instruction containing similar language. From this silence we infer that the defendant was satisfied that the instruction and the attendant interrogatory were adequate to protect its interests. <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Casazza, </em>204 Conn. 336, 346 n.3, 528 A.2d 774 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1006, 108 S. Ct. 699, 98 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The defendant has not challenged either this instruction or this interrogatory on appeal. Instead, the defendant has limited its discussion of publication to the argument that \u201cthe element of publication could not have been satisfied <em>pursuant to the doctrine of compelled self-publication.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) See, e.g., J. Acevedo, \u201cThe Emerging Cause of Action for Compelled Self-Publication Defamation in the Employment Context: Should Connecticut Follow Suit?,\u201d 72 Conn. B.J. 297 (1998) (discussing doctrine, pursuant to which \u201can employee who is discharged and given allegedly defamatory reasons for the termination is afforded a cause of action sounding in defamation, if foreseeable that he would be forced to repeat the defamatory statement to third parties [like potential employers] during the course of subsequent job interviews\u201d). Accordingly, the defendant tacitly concedes that the plaintiff has satisfied the element of publication <em>pursuant to the doctrine of intracorporate communication. </em>Because the element of publication has been satisfied in the present appeal through the doctrine of intra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>corporate communication, we decline to reach the issue of whether the element of publication could also have been satisfied by recourse to the emerging doctrine of compulsory self-publication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\"> The defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant possessed a qualified privilege necessarily established \u201cthat the [defendant] acted in good faith in making its statement,\u201d because one of the elements of a qualified privilege is that the statement must be made in good faith. This misstates our law. In <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>11 Conn. App. 584, 594 n.8, 529 A.2d 199 (1987) \u2014 the only case that the defendant has cited in support of this proposition \u2014 the Appellate Court explained our law as follows: \u201cA conditional or qualified privilege may be <em>abused or lost </em>if the defendant published or broadcast the defamatory remarks with malice, improper motive, or bad faith. <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Morning News Co., </em>67 Conn. 504, 513, 34 A. 865 (1896).\u201d (Emphasis added.) As <em>Miles </em>makes clear, the presence of a qualified privilege does not preclude a subsequent finding that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>did not act in good faith. Instead, under our law, there are two consecutive inquiries: (1) does the defendant possess a qualified privilege? and (2) if so, is the defendant liable \u2014 notwithstanding its qualified privilege \u2014 because it did not act with the requisite level of good faith?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\"> The defendant claims that the court incorrectly permitted the jury to determine whether it had abused its qualified privilege, for the following reason: \u201c[tjhe sufficiency of [the] defendant\u2019s investigation conducted prior to making the allegedly defamatory statement is relevant only to the issue of whether <em>the statement was privileged, </em>not the issue of whether that privilege was <em>abused, </em>i.e., whether the statement was made with actual malice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We are not persuaded. An employer may manifest malice in a variety of ways. In the present case, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the malice of the defendant inhered in the fact that it was so concerned about avoiding legal liability that it terminated an innocent employee on the basis of nothing more than a cursory and unreliable memo. For this reason, the defendant is simply incorrect to assert that the inadequacy of this \u201cinvestigation\u201d does not supply evidence of malice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\"> Only one of the defendant\u2019s evidentiary complaints merits discussion in the body of our opinion. We address the defendant\u2019s two remaining evidentiary claims in footnote 29 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\"> The defendant asserted the following arguments in support of its evidentiary challenge: \u201c[The] [p]laintiff opened the door to the admissibility of this evidence through rebuttal testimony and on cross-examination when he testified about what influenced his state of mind on the evening of the incident. . . . [The] plaintiff also testified that, on the evening of the inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>dent, he was not in complete control of his faculties because he was tired and on medication. . . . Further, he stated the termination of his employment caused him anxiety, he could no longer engage in bodybuilding competitions, and he lost weight after his discharge. . . . The plaintiff testified he recently underwent surgery to drain fluids from his enlarged chest.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> In his motion to preclude the defendant\u2019s expert, the plaintiff explained that the following prejudice would arise if the defendant were permitted to introduce its untimely evidence: \u201c(a) The plaintiff will be required to conduct further discovery, which discovery may include a deposition of the expert in order to properly prepare for the cross-examination of [the] defendant\u2019s expert; and (b) [t]he plaintiff may be required to hire and disclose his own expert . . . .\u201d The plaintiff further argued that the defendant\u2019s \u201cdisclosure of its expert at this late stage will unduly interfere with the orderly progress of trial in that in order for [the] plaintiff to adequately prepare, a continuance will be required so that [the] plaintiff may conduct further discovery and determine whether [the] plaintiff will require his own expert. As this matter has been pending [for five years], [the] plaintiff does not want to seek a continuance unless compelled to do so by the court\u2019s refusal to preclude the testimony of [the] defendant\u2019s expert.\u201d Finally, the plaintiff emphasized that the defendant\u2019s \u201clate disclosure of its expert suggests a bad faith delay on the part of the defendant in that [the] expert . . . is an employee of the defendant. As such, the defendant, a health care provider, could easily have disclosed its expert much earlier in these proceedings. [The] [p]laintiff submits that [the] defendant\u2019s attempt at disclosure of its expert at this late date is an attempt at placing the plaintiff in a disadvantageous position immediately prior to trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b567-5\"> The defendant also challenges the correctness of two other evidentiary rulings; neither complaint merits much attention. First, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the plaintiffs \u201cunduly prejudicial\u201d testimony that a police officer stated that the patient had \u201ca tendency in aggressiveness towards law enforcement officers, where he likes to fight with the polic[e,] and . . . [that he is] very aggressive towards cops and security.\u201d Even if the court was incorrect to permit this testimony into evidence, the mistake was harmless. The court expressly instructed the jury that this testimony \u201cis not being offered for the truth [of the patient\u2019s predisposition]. . . . Again, if s not being offered for the truth and can not be used by you to determine what, in fact, the conduct of the patient was or [the plaintiffs] conduct was during this incident.\u201d Perhaps more importantly, the jury reasonably could have concluded from a great deal of other testimony that the patient was extremely aggressive. In light of this fact, we are unable to detect the \u201cunduly prejudicial\u201d impact of the prescient testimony of a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Second, the defendant claims that the jury\u2019s determination of whether the defendant was bound by an implied contract was tainted by the court\u2019s decision to admit evidence of the defendant\u2019s past disciplinary practices. This argument ignores the court's express instruction to the jurors that they could <em>not </em>\u201cconclude that a contract existed in this case because ... at times prior to the plaintiffs termination the hospital chose to use the disciplinary procedure set forth in the [manual] with regards to other employees. That is, if the language of the manual cannot be read as an agreement by the hospital to bind itself ... in the way it disciplined employees . . . then its [past] decisions] to use disciplinary procedures [set forth] in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>manual would be actions taken solely at its discretion, not binding the hospital to use such procedures or limiting] its right to terminate as to any other employees including [the plaintiff].\u201d Significantly, the plaintiff refers to this instruction in his brief, and the defendant has not replied. We infer from this silence that the defendant was unable to come up with even a plausible rejoinder, let alone a persuasive one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\"> The court instructed the jury as follows on the issue of noneconomic damages: \u201c[NJoneconomic damages . . . means compensation for nonmonetary or nonpecuniary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">\u201cAs to the defamation claim, the plaintiff is entitled to recover for damage to his reputation.

This would include any anxiety, humiliation or wounded feelings that you find established by the evidence relating to the defamation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b568-13\"> See footnote 6 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\"> See footnote 30 of this opinion for the court\u2019s instruction to the jury on the issue of noneconomic damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\"> The court instructed the jury as follows on the issue of economic damages: \u201cEconomic damages means compensation for pecuniary or monetary loss. If you conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff has established any one of his claims for breach of contract [or] breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages equal to the wages he has lost due to the termination, including any bonuses due and compensation for loss of benefits for the term of his employment, less amounts he has earned or could have reasonably earned by due diligence in securing suitable employment of a similar type and with similar compensation. In other words, the plaintiff can recover the wages he would have earned had he not been terminated, minus any wages he earned or could have earned elsewhere and the burden of proof of the latter is upon the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">\u201cAs to the defamation claim, the plaintiff claims he had great difficulty in securing employment upon his termination, after these statements were made. The plaintiff has a right to recover for any loss of wages that were a direct and natural consequence of any defamatory statements made by the defendant.

In light of the factual record in the present case, I agree with the majority that the jury\u2019s finding regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the existence of an implied contract not to terminate the employment of the plaintiff, Brian Gaudio, without just cause and in accordance with the provisions of the policies and procedures manual (manual) of the defendant employer, Griffin Health Services Corporation, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The defendant, however, challenges the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant breached that implied employment contract on four grounds. Specifically, the defendant claims that: (1) as a matter of law, the manual did not obligate it to provide the plaintiff with three step progressive discipline; (2) the trial court improperly permitted the jury to review de novo the defendant\u2019s determination that the plaintiff had assaulted a patient; (3) there was not sufficient evidence to submit to the jury the count alleging breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (4) as a matter of law, the defendant\u2019s statements to the plaintiff were privileged and, therefore, do not constitute a basis for a finding that the defendant defamed the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">I begin with the defendant\u2019s claim regarding three step progressive discipline. The provisions concerning discipline set forth in the manual provide in relevant part: \u201cWhen it becomes necessary to impose a formal disciplinary action regarding employees who fail to observe hospital rules, regulations or policies, the steps outlined in this policy shall serve as a <em>guideline </em>for disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">\u201cIt must be recognized that each situation is different and requires individual evaluation. Among the factors that should be considered in determining the action to be taken are <em>seriousness, </em>frequency and <em>nature of the violation, </em>length of service, work history and customary disciplinary practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>\u201cThe policy outlines the progressive steps of the normal disciplinary process. <em>It must be emphasized, however, that discipline may begin at any step in the procedure depending on the seriousness of the offense. . . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">\u201cFollowing are the steps of the disciplinary process:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\u201cStep I \u2014 DOCUMENTED VERBAL WARNING . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">\u201cStep II \u2014 FORMAL WRITTEN WARNING . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">\u201cStep III \u2014 SUSPENSION OR DISCHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">\u201cRepeated violations or <em>incidents involving serious misconduct . . . may justify suspension without pay or discharge. . . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">\u201cSuspension or discharge actions may be imposed only with the prior discussion and approval of the Personnel Director and the Administrative staff member responsible for the department.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">\u201cThe only condition that would permit suspension of an employee without prior approval is where an action or violation of such severity takes place that the immediate removal of the employee from the hospital premises is indicated. In such situations, the suspension period shall be used for investigation and gathering of facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>that would result in a decision as to the Disciplinary Action to be taken. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In its instruction to the jury the court stated in relevant part: \u201cThe plaintiff claims the defendant hospital breached the contract of employment because ... he did not receive the progressive disciplinary procedure set forth in the contract. . . . The plaintiff . . . claims the personnel manual dealing with employee discipline formed a contract obligating the hospital to follow a three step disciplinary procedure before terminating the plaintiffs employment. . . . [I]f you conclude there was a contract and the contract provided for progressive discipline, then <em>you must decide whether ... all three steps had to be followed.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) In its answers to the special interrogatories, the jury found that the implied employment contract entitled the plaintiff to progressive discipline and that the defendant had terminated the plaintiffs employment without providing him with the progressive discipline to which he was contractually entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In my view, no reasonable juror could conclude, on the basis of the disciplinary provisions set forth in the manual \u2014 provisions that explicitly state that <em>\u201cdiscipline may begin at any step of the procedure depending on the seriousness of the offense\" </em>\u2014 that the defendant promised not to discharge an employee for serious misconduct such as a patient assault without first providing that employee with three step progressive disciplinary measures. Consequently, I believe that the trial court\u2019s submission of this issue to the jury was improper and that the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant had breached the implied employment contract by not providing the plaintiff with three step progressive discipline is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly permitted the jury to review de novo the defendant\u2019s determination that the plaintiff had assaulted a patient. In its instruction to the jury, the court, over the objection of the defendant, stated: \u201cFirst, as to just cause . . . [y]ou must decide here whether the hospital had just cause to terminate the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\u201cNow I am not going to review <em>the conflicting evidentiary claims here as to what actually happened in the emergency room on the night in question </em>and the manner in which [Raymond] Gurdak conducted his investigation and whether he did so properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\u201cThe question becomes how do you apply the just cause concept here?. . . You must examine the investigation procedure . . . and information utilized by the hospital ... in the meeting called by [William C.] Powanda where it was decided to terminate the plaintiff, to determine whether the employer acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">\u201cThe employer must provide a reason for the dismissal . . . and cannot arbitrarily or capriciously terminate an employee. These considerations are the basis on which you determine whether there was just cause for termination of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">\u201cNevertheless ... an employer rightfully has managerial discretion in making such decisions and the right to make independent, good faith judgments. In making your decision, you cannot interfere with the legitimate exercise of managerial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">\u201cBut again, the words \u2018good faith\u2019 and \u2018lack of arbitrary\u2019 and \u2018capricious\u2019 action are important. Recognizing the right to make good faith determinations about personnel and the need to give management discretion in these areas so that the courts and/or juries don\u2019t start <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>micro managing companies, <em>you still must decide whether on the facts of this case </em>the manner in which the investigation was conducted and the decision to terminate that was made was so arbitrary, capricious or lacking in good faith so as to warrant you in concluding that the termination was not made for just cause.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury indicated that, in deciding whether the defendant had had just cause to terminate the plaintiffs employment, the jury properly could weigh evidence that indicated that the plaintiff did not assault the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In interpreting the parameters of an employer\u2019s implied contractual obligation not to terminate employment without just cause, however, I do not think that an implied agreement to relinquish completely its fact-finding discretion reasonably can be imputed to an employer unless there is specific language indicative of such intent in the employee handbook. In my view, the proper standard for determining the existence of just cause is not whether the employer correctly concluded that the employee had engaged in misconduct; rather, it is whether the employer had a good faith and reasonable belief, based upon substantial evidence, that the employee had done so. See <em>Cotran </em>v. <em>Rollins Hudig Hall International, Inc., </em>17 Cal. 4th 93, 948 P.2d 412, 414, 69 Cal. Rptr. 2d 900 (1998) (proper inquiry not whether discharged employee committed act that led to discharge, but reasonable belief of employer); <em>Southwest Gas Corp. </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>111 Nev. 1064, 1078, 901 P.2d 693 (1995) (same); <em>Kestenbaum </em>v. <em>Pennzoil Co., </em>108 N.M. 20, 27, 766 P.2d 280 (1988) (same); <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Western Graphics Corp., </em>293 Or. 96, 100-101, 643 P.2d 1276 (1982) (same); <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Sisters of Providence in Washington, Inc., </em>112 Wash. 2d 127, 139, 769 P.2d 298 (1989) (same). Thus, I would conclude that the trial court\u2019s instruction allowing a de novo review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>existence of just cause at least entitles the defendant to a new trial on the breach of implied contract count.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Furthermore, the reason the defendant proffered for its decision to terminate the plaintiffs employment was that it believed that the plaintiff, a body builder, had assaulted a patient in the emergency room, a belief that, if justified, obviously constitutes just cause for discharge. In my view, no reasonable juror could conclude, on the basis of the information provided to the defendant on the night of the incident by members of the hospital staff, and in light of the patient\u2019s medical record \u2014 a record that indicates that the patient sustained lacerations of his face and loosening of his teeth during the incident in the emergency room and, therefore, supports a conclusion that the patient was struck in the face \u2014 that the defendant lacked reasonable grounds to believe that the plaintiff had assaulted the patient by striking him in the face. Specifically, various hospital personnel who had witnessed the incident stated to Gurdak that \u201cI saw [the defendant] holding down a patient to the [stretcher]. The patient was fighting and swearing, and spit at the guard. The security guard struck the patient in the face, the patient spit (blood) back at him and the guard struck him again. The patient stated [to the doctor], \u2018doctor please don\u2019t go they\u2019re trying to kill me\u2019 that \u201c[t]he patient was extremely violent, I saw the guard hit the patient and the patient spit blood back at him. The guard pushed the patient\u2019s face to the side to try to control him\u201d; that \u201cI saw [the plaintiff] on top of a patient hitting him\u201d; that \u201c [the plaintiff] put a sheet over [the patient\u2019s] mouth because he was spitting blood, then he jumped on him and hit him in the face\u201d; and that \u201c[the plaintiff] then got on top of the patient and tried to restrain him, the patient got hit with a blow to the head, during the scuffle.\u201d The plaintiff was given an opportunity to respond to these accusations by filing an incident report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>detailing his version of the events that had transpired in the emergency room. The plaintiffs report, which acknowledged that the plaintiff had knocked the patient down, did little to allay the defendant\u2019s reasonable belief that the plaintiff had struck the patient. In my view, the defendant, who knew the people who provided the statements and, therefore, possessed information regarding their credibility that would not be available to a jury, was entitled to credit these statements and disbelieve the plaintiffs version of events. Further, I believe that the information provided to the defendant by witnesses to the incident, as a matter of law, provided the defendant with just cause to terminate the plaintiffs employment. It strikes me that if the defendant had ignored that substantial evidence that the plaintiff had assaulted a patient and instead had retained the plaintiff and permitted other patients to come into contact with him, and if there then had been another similar incident involving the plaintiff, the defendant would have been severely criticized and likely would have been held hable, possibly for punitive damages, for its failure to ensure the safety of the patients it serves. Thus, in my view, the defendant is entitled to a directed judgment on the breach of implied contract count.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The defendant next claims that there was not sufficient evidence to submit to the jury the count alleging breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Here, too, I agree. \u201cThe two principles that govern [this] claim are undisputed. \u2018Every contract carries an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requiring that neither party do anything that will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.\u2019 <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>224 Conn. 231, 238, 618 A.2d 501 (1992). \u2018Bad faith means more than mere negligence; <em>it involves a dishonest purpose.\u2019 </em>Id., 237.\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>added.) <em>Gupta </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>239 Conn. 574, 598, 687 A.2d 111 (1996). The plaintiff did not offer any evidence capable of supporting the conclusion that the defendant acted dishonestly when it terminated the plaintiffs employment. The presence of the defendant\u2019s risk manager at the meeting at which the decision was made to terminate the plaintiffs employment, a prudent and proper exercise of business judgment, and evidence that the defendant was concerned that the patient would bring a lawsuit against the hospital as a result of the incident in the emergency room, are incapable of supporting a conclusion that the defendant acted with \u201cfurtive design or ill will\u201d when, on the basis of the information provided to it by hospital personnel in the emergency room on the night of the incident, it terminated the plaintiffs employment. See <em>Buckman </em>v. <em>People Express, Inc., </em>205 Conn. 166, 171, 530 A.2d 596 (1987). In fact, the defendant\u2019s termination of the plaintiffs employment as a result of the incident in the emergency room could only serve to expose the defendant to, rather than shield it from, liability for the plaintiff s actions. In my view, the defendant is entitled to a directed judgment on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly submitted to the jury the question of whether the defendant\u2019s statements to the plaintiff were privileged and, therefore, could not constitute a basis for a finding that the defendant had defamed the plaintiff. See <em>Torosyan </em>v. <em>Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>supra, 234 Conn. 27. Because I believe that the defendant is entitled to a directed judgment on the counts alleging breach of an implied contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, I also believe that, as a matter of law, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>defendant\u2019s statements concerning the plaintiff \u2014 statements that were based upon a reasonable belief, supported by substantial evidence, that the plaintiff had assaulted a patient \u2014 were privileged. See id., 29; see also <em>Petyan </em>v. Ellis, 200 Conn. 243, 247-48, 510 A.2d 1337 (1986) (employer\u2019s statements in unemployment compensation form regarding reasons for employee\u2019s discharge are absolutely privileged). Consequently, in my view, the defendant also is entitled to a directed judgment on the defamation count. I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-12\"> The plaintiff argued at trial that the defendant had breached the implied contract of employment in two additional ways: (1) by discharging him without prior discussion with, and approval by, Janice Yankowski, the defendant\u2019s director of human resources; and (2) by failing to complete a form. The jury interrogatories, however, did not address those alleged procedural breaches. Furthermore, as a matter of law, neither the alleged failure to obtain Yankowski\u2019s approval nor the alleged failure to complete a form is capable of supporting the jury\u2019s award of damages in the present case. Finally, the record reveals that Yankowski was aware of the plaintiffs discharge and was in fact the person who signed the letter informing the plaintiff that his employment had been terminated. Thus, the record does not permit a finding that the defendant discharged the plaintiff without Yankowski\u2019s knowledge and approval.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
