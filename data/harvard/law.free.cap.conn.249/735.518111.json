App. 114, 718 A.2d 36 (1998); the defendant successfully sought certification on two of the issues decided by that court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Aponte, 247 Conn. 926, 719 A.2d 1169 (1998). We conclude that the actions of the prosecutor in giving the victim a Barney<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> doll prior to her testifying, along with the trial court\u2019s limitations on the defendant\u2019s ability to expose to the jury the impact that such conduct may have had on her testimony, harmfully deprived the defendant of due process<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in connection with one of the assault convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The Appellate Court set forth the following procedural history and relevant facts. \u201cThe defendant and Carmen Lopez Casado were both charged with two counts of assault in the first degree and two counts of risk of injury to a child involving the defendant\u2019s three year old daughter [victim]. The cases were consolidated for trial and, after the jury was selected, the state moved for and the trial court granted severance of the two cases. The state elected to proceed against the defendant first. The defendant moved for dismissal of the jury based on the questioning of prospective jurors concerning their opinions on the defendant\u2019s sexual orientation. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>\u201cThe trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request to conduct a hearing into the competency of the [victim]. It also denied a motion for mistrial that was based on the prosecution\u2019s giving the victim a doll prior to her testifying. The trial court also denied the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the victim\u2019s testimony as being incomprehensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">\u201cThe jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant is the mother of the victim, who was bom on April 7, 1990. At the time the victim was one and one-half years old, the defendant requested that her friend Ermys Lugo raise her. In February, 1994, Lugo turned the [victim] over to the defendant pursuant to a court order. The child was physically sound at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">\u201cOn March 30, 1994, the defendant arrived at the home of her mother, Irma Ramos, with [the victim], whose eyes were black and swollen. The defendant explained that the [victim] had stmck the inside of the car. The defendant left the [victim] with Ramos after being assured that the latter would not notify the police. Ramos noticed marks on the victim\u2019s back, front and legs when giving her a bath. Ramos secreted the child with a neighbor to hide her from the defendant. The neighbor called the Bridgeport police on March 31,1994. The [victim] was taken by ambulance to Bridgeport Hospital where she remained for a few days. She told Ramos that both the defendant and Lopez Casado had hurt her.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">\u201cOfficer David Osika of the Bridgeport police department responded to the neighbor\u2019s call and inquired about who had injured the victim. The victim indicated that her mother, the defendant, had done it. Detective Michael Whittaker of the Bridgeport police youth bureau also responded to the neighbor\u2019s home and asked the victim how she was injured. The victim said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>\u2018la pata,\u2019 Spanish slang for lesbian. Whittaker interviewed the defendant, who implicated Lopez Casado as having harmed the victim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He took another statement from the victim that both the defendant and Lopez Casado had hit her using a belt and that Lopez Casado inflicted abrasions to her knees and burned her finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\u201cThe emergency room physicians discovered, in addition to the eye injury, that there were numerous marks on the victim\u2019s arms, thighs, knees, lower legs, chest, abdomen, back, ear and behind the ear. Nada Abdel A\u2019al, an emergency room pediatric resident, examined the victim and diagnosed a pancreatic injury, which proved not to be life threatening. She determined that the eye injuiy was serious and that the victim could not open her left eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">\u201cRichard Garvey, a general surgeon, testified that laboratory test results indicated possible internal bleeding consistent with an injury to the pancreas, making death a possibility. His overall diagnosis was \u2018battered child syndrome.\u2019 This diagnosis was confirmed by Alison Driggers, a pediatrician, who also determined that the pancreatic injury created a risk of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s only witness was Carmen Lopez, Lopez Casado\u2019s mother, who testified that on March 30, 1994, the victim was on the middle rear seat of her car as Lopez exited from her driveway. A truck caused her to apply the brakes suddenly causing the victim to fall forward between the front bucket seats.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Aponte, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 117-18. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Prior to the victim being called as a witness, both parties and the court agreed that in order to make her more comfortable, Ramos would be seated next to the victim throughout her testimony. Additionally, unaware of its origin at that time, the defendant had no objection to \u201cthe purple item\u201d (Barney) that the victim appeared to be holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">A few weeks prior to trial, the state\u2019s attorney had consulted with the defendant and Lopez Casado about making a gift of a stuffed animal to the victim from the court and all parties. Both the defendant and Lopez Casado indicated the impropriety of such action and assumed the matter was concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">During cross-examination, the defendant elicited testimony that prior to the victim testifying, the state\u2019s attorney had given the victim a Barney doll, which she had clutched throughout her direct examination. The defendant then attempted to determine whether the state had given her the doll prior to showing her the photographs of her injuries. Specifically, the defendant asked the victim whether she had had Barney with her when she viewed the photographs. When the victim failed to respond, the defendant questioned her about whether the state\u2019s attorney had given her a ride on the rolling chair in which she was seated. When the state objected, the court excused the jury and the following colloquy occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">\u201c[John Forbes, Assistant Public Defender]: If your Honor please, the question of what [Joseph J. Harry, assistant state\u2019s attorney] has done with a witness is certainly relevant to show bias, prejudice, motive, any of a number of factors authorized by our court. I\u2019m going to move, I think, at some point to strike all of the [victim\u2019s] testimony. It\u2019s like bribery. Why didn\u2019t he let me give her an animal.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Why didn\u2019t you?</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">\u201cMr. Forbes: Because I think that\u2019s improper, Your Honor. I think it\u2019s unethical, and I think it may have consequences, and I\u2019m going to look into it. But, I just think that conduct is reprehensible on a [victim] who, by statute, is allowed to testify, who I still am going to move at the end that the testimony be stricken because it\u2019s not making any sense at all. But to then cajole and give gifts to this [victim] is outrageous. I can put on witnesses who saw Mr. Harry roll [the victim] down\u2014 up an down the hallway like it was an amusement park in the same chair that she\u2019s sitting on.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">\u201cAnd I think the jury\u2019s entitled to hear that with regard to what this [victim] is saying, the fresh age of the [victim], the absorption of [her] mind to be receptive to any suggestion or question or response that would please someone who gives her gifts. I just think it\u2019s outrageous. And I claim the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">\u201cThe Court: What relevance does it have, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">\u201cMr. Forbes: Again, it goes to a motive or bias or prejudice for testifying. She thinks the prosecutor is the greatest thing since cream cheese. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">\u201cMr. Harry: Your Honor, I think what he stated is contemptible. I would ask for sanctions. He makes blanket statements, doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. The court had ordered \u2014 asked, not ordered, but asked that I make the [victim] more comfortable. Regardless of whether the court had done so or not, the research I have done, the seminars I have been to, I have the youngest victim so far in Connecticut that I know of testifying on the stand, Your Honor. I have to make her more comfortable. Those pictures show she went through all kinds of hell and I [have] got to make sure that she is comfortable.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>\u201cI told the court and I told Mr. Forbes, the one thing she was afraid of coming into this court is you, Your Honor, taking her away from . . . Miss Ramos there. That\u2019s the one thing. I got her in here. She\u2019s testified. She hasn\u2019t testified to anything inconsistent to what Miss Lugo or Miss Ramos had testified. Your Honor, if he wants to bring charges that I tried to influence a witness, let him do so and let him do so on paper so I can answer that.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">\u201cRight now, Your Honor, he\u2019s asked questions that are very ambiguous, yes, she did have Barney when I showed her the pictures in court on Friday. She cannot distinguish the times like you, I, and Mr. Forbes. He\u2019s asking these ambiguous questions trying to either cause a mistrial or to have her testimony stricken from the record. He has shown nothing, absolutely nothing to show that [the victim] was influenced by what I did. I made her more comfortable where she walks into this courtroom, she sees me and she knows she\u2019s going home with Miss Ramos and that I will not take her away from Miss Ramos, that she feels more comfortable. That\u2019s the sole thing that I would do for any witness, a sexual assault witness, any witness, I would make more comfortable in this court. And if he thinks that giving a Barney to a five year old is bribery, let him bring me up on charges, Your Honor, or hold me in contempt or sanctions that I tried to influence this trial. Other than that, I want either his allegations on paper or that the judge, or Your Honor, tell him to keep his mouth shut in regard to these frivolous allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Mr. Forbes, anything else from you, sir? . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">\u201cMr. Forbes: Since Mr. Harry had brought it up, approximately three to four weeks ago, he had talked about possibly getting a stuffed animal for the witness. And the conversation came up and that he was going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>to indicate that it was from himself, the court, myself and [Timothy Aspinwall, special public defender]. And I can produce Mr. Aspinwall or the court can put him on as an officer of the court to testify. We laughed at it and said that\u2019s silly, he can\u2019t do that. Not only does he not attempt to do that, he then himself makes a gift. And I just think that\u2019s\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">\u201cMr. Harry: Well\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">\u201cMr. Forbes: It\u2019s grounds for a mistrial, Your Honor, and I would so move, respectfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">\u201cMr. Harry: Your Honor, that in and of itself shows Mr. Forbes that I attempted to make sure there was no type of impropriety by showing that it wasn\u2019t from one individual, it was from everybody to make her feel more comfortable. Your Honor, I didn\u2019t bring in toys because I didn\u2019t want to assume \u2014 giving her a toy and then having to take it away from her. And I did not buy that, it was bought with state funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Forbes ... I will allow you, however, because I believe it would be appropriate to get a response since it\u2019s already \u2014 the question [has] already been posed. I think the ladies and gentlemen of the jury want to know, but I\u2019m very satisfied that the conduct of the state\u2019s attorney in making the [victim] comfortable was strictly for that purpose. I don\u2019t believe under any circumstances that a three and one-half year old child is going to be influenced by \u2014 bv conduct of riding her around in a chair, bringing her into the court, and giving her a toy. So that, I will allow the question. As far as relevancy goes, Mr. Harry, I will overrule it, and I direct you, Mr. Forbes, to examine this witness concerning the injuries once you\u2019ve elicited a response on the business of riding her around on that chair in this court. Do you understand?</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">\u201cMr. Forbes: The Court is\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Directing you to examine her with regards to the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">\u201cMr. Forbes: I have some inquiries still regarding her ability to testify, Your Honor, and the court is prohibiting me from asking those questions?</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">\u201cThe Court: I will \u2014 if you want to ask her about her ability to testify, I\u2019ll allow that, but not as it relates to the state\u2019s attorney riding her around here in the courtroom on that chair. You\u2019ll get your answer and then we\u2019ll move along. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">\u201cMr. Forbes: Just so \u2014 that\u2019s all the court\u2019s asking me not to do, is to not refer to the chair again after that answer?</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">\u201cThe Court: Yes. Or any other questioning that\u2019s going to suggest any improper conduct by the state\u2019s attorney with this [victim] in a form of a bribery as I think you put it in your argument to the court. All right. Anything else?</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">\u201cMr. Forbes: The court\u2019s denying my motion for mistrial based on his conduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">\u201cThe Court: Yes. I am.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">\u201cMr. Forbes: May I have an exception, please?</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Sheriff, if you please.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">Thereafter, in the presence of the jury, the defendant asked that the last question, which pertained to whether the state\u2019s attorney had given the victim a ride in the rolling chair, be read back and that the victim be directed to answer it. The record reflects that she answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">The defendant acknowledges that it would have been proper to allow the victim to bring a doll from home to hold as a comfort object during her testimony. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Palabay, </em>9 Haw. App. 414, 417, 844 P.2d 1 (1992). \u201cMany children derive comfort from a favorite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>toy or stuffed animal. A child witness should be permitted to bring their particular favorite object with them. These comforting objects are more than mere toys. They symbolically represent a little bit of a mother\u2019s ability to soothe the child when frightened or nervous. Their presence helps children calm themselves when parents are not immediately on hand.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted). J. Myers, K. Saywitz &amp; G. Goodman, \u201cPsychological Research on Children as Witnesses: Practical Implications for Forensic Interviews and Courtroom Testimony,\u201d 28 Pac. L.J. 3, 71 (1996). Therefore, had the victim simply brought a favorite object from home, there would have been no basis for objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The defendant\u2019s complaint at trial and on appeal is that giving the Barney doll to the victim prior to her testifying constitutes prejudicial misconduct that jeopardized the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. She further claims that the trial court\u2019s failure to appreciate the ramifications of such conduct as it might impact the victim\u2019s suggestibility, as evidenced by its restrictions on her ability to cross-examine the victim, necessitates that she be given a new trial. We agree with the defendant that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s misconduct, compounded by the trial court\u2019s response, violated her due process rights. We further conclude, however, that in light of the totality of evidence in the case, this impropriety was harmful only in connection with the assault charge relating to the pancreatic injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">\u201cIt is well recognized that the state\u2019s attorney is not only an officer of the court, like every attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the State, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. In discharging his most important duties, he deserves and receives in peculiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>degree the support of the court and the respect of the citizens of the county. By reason of his office, he usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty are at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment. If the accused be guilty, he should none the less be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>244 Conn. 547, 577, 710 A.2d 1348 (1998) <em>(Katz, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">In analyzing the defendant\u2019s claim, the issue is whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct \u201c \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darden </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S. Ct. 2464, 91 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1986), quoting <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 643, 94 S. Ct. 1868, 40 L. Ed. 2d 431 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>176 Conn. 367, 372, 407 A.2d 1001 (1978). We do not, however, focus alone on the conduct of the prosecutor. \u201c \u2018The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 163, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983); see <em>Darden </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>supra, 180-81; <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>200 Conn. 642, 654, 513 A.2d 58 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">\u201cIn determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, this court, in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). Among those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>factors we include the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument; <em>State </em>v. Falcone, 191 Conn. 12, 23, 463 A.2d 558 (1983); the severity of the misconduct; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>663 F.2d 1173, 1181 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 989, 102 S. Ct. 2269, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1284 (1982); the frequency of the misconduct; <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 563, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985); the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case; <em>Hawthorne </em>v. <em>United States, </em>476 A.2d 164, 172 (D.C. App. 1984); the strength of the curative measures adopted; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>supra, 1181; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 F.2d 656, 657 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 654; and the strength of the state\u2019s case. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>supra, 1181; <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 564; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>194 Conn. 483, 492, 481 A.2d 741 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">We view the present case against this legal background. The state argues that the state\u2019s attorney had not engaged in any misconduct. Its contention is premised essentially on its assertion that the state\u2019s attorney did not have an improper motive in giving the victim the doll, but, rather, was simply trying to make the victim feel more comfortable. According to the state, because the trial court, which was in the best position to evaluate the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s credibility, accepted his representation and concluded that there had been no impropriety, this court should agree with the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Although the state\u2019s attorney had been admonished by the defendant and Lopez Casado that he should not give the victim a gift, the trial court was within its discretion in finding that the state\u2019s attorney had not been improperly motivated. The problem with the state\u2019s reliance on this character assessment, however, is that \u201cthe touchstone of due process analysis in cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>of alleged prosecutorial misconduct [remains] the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>186 Conn. 476, 488, 442 A.2d 1320 (1982). Indeed, it is \u201cwell established that serious prosecutorial misconduct, regardless of the prosecutor\u2019s intentions, may so pollute a criminal prosecution as to require a new trial, even without regard to prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>168 Conn. 230, 251, 362 A.2d 925, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 851, 96 S.

Because \u201c[y]oung children are sensitive to the status and power of their interviewers and as a result are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>especially likely to comply with the implicit and explicit agenda of such interviewers . . .

Brack, Jeopardy in the Courtroom: A Scientific Analysis of Children\u2019s Testimony, American Psychological Association (1996) p. 152. A critical finding of psychological research is that young children, particularly preschool age children, appear to be more suggestible as a basic psychological characteristic than older children and adults. See S. Ceci, D. Ross &amp; M. Toglia, \u201cAge Differences in Suggestibility: Narrowing the Uncertainties,\u201d in Childrens\u2019 Eyewitness Memory (1987) p. 82; J. Myers, K. Saywitz &amp; G. Goodman, supra, 28 Pac. L.J. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Many of the questions in the present case were leading or at least assumed a factual foundation,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and although the use of such questions with children, when appropriate, does not necessarily render the responses untrustworthy; J. Meyers, Child Witness Law and Practice (1987) \u00a7 4.6, pp. 129-34; the specificity inherent in such questions can often have greater potential for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>suggestivity. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Michaels, </em>136 N.J. 299, 311-12, 642 A.2d 1372 (1994) (factors that influence child\u2019s suggestibility include whether questions asked are leading or nonleading and whether interviewer is trusted authority figure); J. Myers, K. Saywitz &amp; G. Goodman, supra, 28 Pac. L.J. 16 (questions that are suggestive or leading depend on context in which questions asked).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Whether the prior conduct by the state\u2019s attorney exacerbated the dangers inherent in such questioning of the victim remains unknown. Although the defendant attempted to highlight the significance of the improper conduct to the trial court, and to expose that conduct to the jury, the court, although properly motivated, failed to appreciate the ramifications of the act as it might have impacted the victim\u2019s suggestibility. By precluding the examination of the victim\u2019s treatment by the state\u2019s attorney, the trial court improperly prohibited inquiry into a legitimate area of cross-examination. \u201cPartiality, or any acts, relationships or motives reasonably likely to produce it, may be proved to impeach credibility.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Oehman, </em>212 Conn. 325, 331, 562 A.2d 493 (1989). Although the defendant elicited a nonverbal response to the one permitted question regarding whether the state\u2019s attorney had given the victim a ride in the chair, the defendant was precluded from any further questioning as to when he had given her the doll, specifically whether it was prior to her being shown the photographs of her injuries. More importantly, the defendant was unable to explore the impact of such treatment on the victim\u2019s testimony. To prohibit exploration of such treatment unduly restricted the defendant\u2019s right to cross-examination. While the victim\u2019s prior exchange with the state\u2019s attorney might not have been particularly illuminating of motive or bias, the weight to be accorded such evidence was a matter for the jury. Id., 331-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the state engaged in improper conduct and that, rather than taking measures to ameliorate the damage, the trial court compounded the problem by preventing the defendant from exploring the victim\u2019s previous contact with the prosecution, thereby failing to allow the defendant a sufficient cross-examination of the victim to satisfy the requirements of the constitution. The totality of these improprieties would, however, require a new trial only if it were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The correct inquiry for identifying harmless constitutional error is to ask whether, \u201cassuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Whether such error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>224 Conn. 325, 333, 618 A.2d 32 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Upon application of these standards, we are persuaded, from a review of the entire record, that the trial court\u2019s limitation of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to the assault resulting in injury to the victim\u2019s eye and as to the two risk of injury charges. The impropriety was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, however, as to the assault charge relating to the pancreatic injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Although the victim was, without a doubt, a key witness for the prosecution as to which of the two women \u2014 the defendant or Lopez Casado \u2014 had caused the specific injuries, several other witnesses provided sufficient details in support of all but the assault charge causing the pancreatic injury. Ana D. Maldonado, James Baraja, Whittaker and Osika all testified that the victim had told them that the defendant had hit her. Specifically, Maldonado, the social worker who interviewed the victim at the hospital, related that the victim had told her that the defendant had hit her with a belt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Baraja, the police officer who conducted a field interview of the victim when she was first taken to the hospital, testified that when he asked the victim what had happened to her eye, she responded that the defendant had hit her with a belt. Baraja also testified that when he asked the victim about the mark on her middle finger, she told him that the defendant \u201chad done it with fire.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When Whittaker questioned the victim about the injury to her eye, she responded that \u201cNissa and Mima hit me in the eye.\u201d When asked how it happened, she stated that \u201cMima hit me with a belt and Nissa hit me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>too.\u201d Finally, we note that the defendant had admitted to Whittaker that she had hit the victim in the eye. See footnote 6 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Therefore, there was ample evidence, independent of the victim\u2019s testimony, to support the defendant\u2019s convictions of the assault on her eye and the risk of injury charge that involved the burning. Finally, the other risk of injury count alleged generally that the defendant had committed certain acts likely to impair the victim\u2019s health. In its instructions to the jury, the trial court did not specify to what injury or specific acts that count related. Certainly, the eye injury, for which there was substantial evidence, properly could have been the basis of that count.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The only charge for which there was not an abundance of independent evidence, however, was the assault to the victim\u2019s pancreas. Although the victim had told a number of people that the defendant had injured her generally, those assaults were not specifically linked to the pancreatic injury. According to the medical testimony, the marks on the right upper part of the victim\u2019s abdomen were consistent with that injury. Only the victim\u2019s trial testimony, however, in which she examined the photograph depicting those marks and identified the defendant as the person to have caused them, clearly implicated the defendant in that particular injury. As a consequence, applying the factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 333, we cannot conclude that, without the victim\u2019s trial testimony, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>defendant would have been convicted of that assault. Consequently, the impropriety was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">In her appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly had permitted the victim to testify although her testimony, according to the defendant, was incomprehensible.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim, the Appellate Court reasoned: \u201cChild abuse is one of the most difficult crimes to detect and prosecute, in large part because there are often no witnesses except the victim. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 566, 560 A.2d 426 (1989). General Statutes \u00a7 54-86h provides in relevant part: No witness shall be automatically adjudged incompetent to testify because of age and any child who is a victim of assault . . . shall be competent to testify without prior qualification. The weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witness shall be for the determination of the trier of fact. . . . Certainly if a child assault victim could only babble or could present no useful evidence, its testimony could hardly be deemed relevant or probative. . . . Many witnesses, not only children, have difficulty in remembering events, understanding questions, and expressing themselves clearly, disabilities that often raise problems for the cross-examiner. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, [564-65], . . . Inconsistencies in testimony and witness credibility are matters that are within the exclusive purview of the jury to resolve at trial. <em>State v. Smith, </em>46 Conn. App. 600, 608, 700 A.2d 91, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 935, 702 A.2d 642 (1997).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aponte, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 123-24. We agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>the Appellate Court that the trial court properly left the issue of the victim\u2019s credibility to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 559-60, the court addressed the defendant\u2019s claim that \u00a7 54-86h violated his rights of due process and of confrontation. In rejecting his assertions, this court recognized the modem trend toward the treatment of competency as simply one aspect of the credibility of a witness. Id., 563. We further acknowledged the then current child development research indicating that \u201c \u2018even very young children can be credible eyewitnesses, particularly when combined with the other findings that children are as capable as adults of answering direct objective questions and are no more easily swayed into incorrect answers by leading questions.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting B. Marin, D. Holmes, M. Guth &amp; P. Korvac, \u201cThe Potential of Children as Eyewitnesses: A Comparison of Children and Adults in Eyewitness Tasks,\u201d 3 Law &amp; Hum. Behav. 295, 304 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Thereafter, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinberg, </em>215 Conn. 231, 242, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990), this court stated that \u201c[i]n determining the competency of a proposed witness the trial court should consider the capacity of the witness to receive correct sense impressions, to comprehend the facts to be developed, to recollect and narrate facts intelligently, and to appreciate the moral duty to tell the truth.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The court then looked to the federal courts for guidance in how to measure the \u201ccapacity\u201d required for a determination of competency. Relying on rale 601 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, we concluded that a trial court \u201cmaintains the obligation to ensure that a witness\u2019 testimony meets the minimum standard of credibility necessary to permit a reasonable person to put any credence in that testimony. ... In making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>this determination the court will still be deciding competency. It would, however ... be more accurate to say that the court will decide . . . minimum credibility. This requirement of minimum credibility is just one aspect of the requirement of minimum probative force \u2014 i.e., relevancy. Regardless of terminology, the trial judge may exclude all or a part of the witness\u2019 testimony on the ground that no one could reasonably believe the witness could have observed, remembered, communicated or told the truth with respect to the event in question.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 243. Finally, we concluded that rule 601, as applied by the federal courts, establishes a reasoned approach to determining the admissibility of a witness\u2019 testimony and adopted the rule that \u201cwhere the competency of a witness is challenged, the threshold question to be answered by the court is whether the testimony of that witness is minimally credible. If the testimony of a witness passes the test of minimum credibility, and is otherwise relevant, the testimony is admissible and the weight to be accorded it, in light of the witness\u2019 incapacity, is a question for the trier of fact. . . . [T]he competency of a witness is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court and its ruling will be disturbed only in a clear case of abuse or of some error in law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 243-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">With this rule as our framework, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the victim competent to testify at trial. On appeal, the defendant focuses essentially on the lack of a narrative by the victim. Her attack on the linguistic nature of the testimony can be distilled, in essence, to a complaint that the victim responded to a series of leading questions. The fact that the victim\u2019s answers were in the affirmative or in the negative does not negate her ability to relate or communicate. The jury heard both the question and the answer, and therefore was able to determine, in light of the form of the question, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>question suggested the answer or, instead, whether the answer was given independent of any possible suggestion inherent in the question. The defendant also points out that the victim often failed to provide verbal responses to questions by both parties, choosing instead to nod her head, which nonverbal responses were recorded over the defendant\u2019s objections. She argues that, by failing to respond verbally, the victim did not demonstrate sufficient comprehension. We disagree that the trial court was required to conclude that the victim had not satisfied the legal standard for minimal credibility. The fact that the victim often did not respond like an adult did not transform her testimony into \u201cbabble or [demonstrate that she] could present no useful evidence . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In addition, the defendant points to what she deems three \u201cfailed responses\u201d to questions because they did not supply the information requested. Specifically, the victim did not know what to call the courtroom; she repeated that she was a girl and that the prosecutor was a boy in response to a question about the need for her to tell the truth; and finally, she stated that the defendant and Lopez Casado were mother and daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The state responds that the fact that the four year old victim was unfamiliar with what to call her surroundings does not indicate her lack of comprehension, but, rather, more probably, indicates her lack of familiarity with her surroundings. Additionally, the fact that she misidentified the relationship between the defendant and Lopez Casado, with whom the victim had had contact for only one month while in their care, was neither surprising nor particularly relevant. Furthermore, as the state notes, immediately preceding the question about the need to tell the truth, the state had asked the victim a series of questions that pertained to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>her ability to know the difference between boys and girls. This four year old\u2019s inability to immediately \u201cshift gears\u201d does not demonstrate a lack of comprehension such that her testimony should have been disallowed. Finally, as the state points out, when the state repeated the question about whether the victim knew to tell the truth, she responded by nodding in the affirmative. That response, coupled with her testimony moments earlier that she would tell the truth \u201cwith God\u2019s help,\u201d reflected sufficient comprehension of the need to be truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The trial court, relying on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 563-65, and its own observations of the victim, concluded that she possessed sufficient ability to observe, recollect, relate and be truthful, leaving it to the jury to assess any issues relating to the victim\u2019s credibility. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the trial court acted properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The judgment of conviction of one count of assault in the first degree and two counts of risk of injury is affirmed; the judgment of conviction of the second count of assault in the first degree is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to remand the case to the trial court for a new trial on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C. J., and NORCOTT, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.. . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">While changes have been made to \u00a7 53a-59 (a) since 1994, the time of the underlying crimes in the present case, subdivision (1) has remained unchanged.

Ed. 2d 913 (1988), following the defendant\u2019s conviction of improper sexual contact at his second trial, the defendant claimed that the trial court should have granted him a new trial because the state\u2019s investigator had given the child complainant a doll <em>after </em>she had testified in his first trial, but before the trial court in that case had granted a mistrial. In <em>Pryor, </em>however, at the second trial, the defendant never called the complainant or her mother to testify regarding the gift, nor did he present any evidence that the gift had influenced her testimony. Consequently, despite the conduct, in the absence of harm, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. Id., 632-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">In another context, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>419 So. 2d 899, 904 (La. 1982), the court, concluding that the defendant\u2019s due process rights had been violated as a result of gift giving by the deputy bailiffs to the jurors, reversed a conviction concluding that \u201c[s]uch gift giving has no place in the conduct of a serious criminal case such as this and quite likely did constitute a subtle influence, pro state, the full extent of which is impossible to ascertain.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\"> Relevance may be established in one of three ways. First, the proffering party can make an offer of proof. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 63, 644 A.2d 887 (1994). Second, as in this case, the record can itself be adequate to establish the relevance of the proffered testimony. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>224 Conn. 325, 332, 618 A.2d 32 (1992). Finally, the proffering party can establish a proper foundation for the testimony by stating a \u201cgood faith basis\u201d that there is an adequate factual basis for his or her inquiry. 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (4th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 49, p. 187. \u201cA cross-examiner may inquire into the motivation of a witness if he or she has a good faith belief that a factual predicate for the question exists.\u201d <em>State v. Barnes, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 747.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b769-7\"> On direct examination, the victim first testified verbally that Lopez Casado, whom she called \u201cMima,\u201d hurt her eye and stomach. Only in response to continued prompting by the state, however, having first given no verbal response at all, did the victim indicate that the defendant also had hit her there. With regard to the bum mark on her left knuckle, the victim again stated first that it was \u201cMima\u201d and then ideni ified the defendant, whom she called \u201cNissa,\u201d as the responsible person. Only when questioned as to who caused the upper back injury and the mark on her ear, did the victim respond \u201cNissa.\u201d Later, on redirect examination, all of the state\u2019s questions were of a compound variety, for example: \u201c[D]id both Nissa and Mima hit you?\u201d; \u201cDid Nissa and Mima hit you in the eye?\u201d; \u201cDid Nissa and Mima both hit you with a belt,?\u201d; Did Nissa and Mima ... hit you on the back with a belt?\"; \u201cDid Nissa and Mima hit you in the stomach?\u201d The victim responded by nodding affirmatively. In response to the defendant\u2019s questions on recross-examination, however, as to whether \u201cMima\u201d had hit her on the back with a belt, the victim responded affirmatively. She responded likewise when questioned by the defendant as to whether she had told Whittaker that \u201cMima\u201d had hit her on the back with a belt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\"> Effectively, there was no limitation placed on this testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 565, 638 A.2d 578 (1994) (\u201cStatements concerning the cause of the injury or the identity of the person who caused the injury usually are not relevant to treatment and, therefore, are not admissible under the medical diagnosis and treatment exception to the hearsay rule. . . . However, [i]n cases of sexual abuse in the home, hearsay statements made in the course of medical treatment which reveal the identity of the abuser, are reasonably pertinent to treatment and are admissible. ... If the sexual abuser is a member of the child victim\u2019s immediate household, it is reasonable for a physician to ascertain the identity of the abuser to prevent recurrences and to facilitate the treatment of psychological and physical injuries.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\"> In its recitation of the facts, the Appellate Court related that, in her statement, the victim had reported to Whittaker that Lopez Casado had burned her. <em>State </em>v. <em>Aponte, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 117-18. At trial, however, Baraja testified that on one occasion, the victim had told him that both women had burned her, and on another occasion, she blamed only the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\"> Indeed, in response to the defendant\u2019s claim in her appeal to the Appellate Court that she could not properly have been convicted of both risk of injury counts, the state\u2019s position was that the first of those counts is based on the eye injury, which occurred on March 30, 1994, the day before the victim\u2019s admission to the hospital; and that the second count of risk of injury is based on the injury to the victim\u2019s pancreas, which was of recent origin, and on beatings that were at least two weeks old and cigarette bums that were at least one week old. <em>State, </em>v. <em>Aponte, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 132.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\"> The defendant also argued to the Appellate Court, as well as to this court, that the nonverbal nature of the victim\u2019s testimony deprived the defendant of her right to meaningful cross-examination in violation of the state and federal confrontation clauses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b778-9\">PALMER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aca\">concurring. I agree with the result and much of the reasoning of the majority opinion. I write separately, however, because I disagree with the majority\u2019s characterization of the impropriety in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">Although the majority acknowledges the trial court\u2019s finding that the prosecutor\u2019s actions were not inspired by any improper motive, it nevertheless emphasizes the \u201cobvious\u201d nature of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>characterizing the prosecutor\u2019s actions as obvious misconduct, I believe the majority unjustifiably maligns both the trial court and the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Not eveiy benefit or courtesy bestowed upon a witness by the state constitutes misconduct. Indeed, prosecutors routinely bargain with persons charged with crimes to obtain their testimony. The state is entitled to facilitate the testimony of a witness so long as the prosecutor does not seek to influence the witness\u2019 testimony, and discloses any benefit provided to the witness so that the defendant may explore the witness\u2019 interest and possible bias on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">In this case, the trial court had asked the prosecutor to make the child more comfortable. The prosecutor sought to do so by giving her a doll that she brought with her to court. The trial court expressly found that the prosecutor, who never sought to conceal his actions, was attempting to put the victim at ease, rather than seeking to influence her testimony, when he gave her the doll. Moreover, the defendant, on cross-examination, elicited testimony from the victim that the prosecutor had given her the doll after inquiring whether she \u201clik[ed] Barney.\u201d Thus, the jurors, who witnessed the victim holding the doll throughout her trial testimony, were well aware of the fact that she had received the doll from the prosecutor. Finally, the trial court, who had the opportunity to observe the victim closely while presiding over her direct examination, also expressed his emphatic belief that the prosecutor, by \u201cbringing [the victim] into the court and giving her a toy,\u201d could not have influenced her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Nevertheless, with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight not available to the trial court or the prosecutor, I am constrained to conclude, for the following reasons, that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct, although not improperly motivated, tainted the proceedings. First, the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>extremely young age and obvious vulnerability gave rise to a real risk that, as a result of her receipt of the doll, she would view the prosecutor in a favorable light and, consequently, seek to please him with her answers. Second, it may be presumed that the victim was especially susceptible to such influence, albeit unintended, in view of the frightful treatment that she had received at home. Finally, given the victim\u2019s tender age and emotional fragility, her ability to respond to questions was extremely limited, and, as a result, meaningful cross-examination into her possible bias in favor of the prosecutor was virtually impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">For the reasons set forth by the majority, however, I also agree that the conduct was harmful only with respect to the second count of the defendant\u2019s assault convictions. I, therefore, conclude that the defendant\u2019s other three convictions must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b780-8\">MCDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AhI\">concurring. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s conviction on the second count of assault in the first degree must be reversed. I do not subscribe, however, to that part of the majority opinion finding prejudicial misconduct by the state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">It is important and sensible that, when young witnesses \u2014 here only four years old \u2014 testify in cases of abuse such as this one, the courts make special accommodations for their tender age. The stresses that young children undergo when testifying in cases of abuse are well documented. \u201cPsychiatrists have identified components of the legal proceedings that are capable of putting a child victim under prolonged mental stress and endangering his emotional equilibrium: repeated interrogations and cross-examination; facing the accused again; the official atmosphere in court; the acquittal of the accused for want of corroborating evidence to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>child\u2019s trustworthy testimony; and the conviction of a molester who is the child\u2019s parent or relative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) K. Maye &amp; S. Meiring, \u201cThe Child Witness in Abuse Prosecutions,\u201d 56 Okla. B.J. 2946, 2946 (1985); see also L. Brannon, \u201cThe Trauma of Testifying in Court for Child Victims of Sexual Assault v. The Accused\u2019s Right to Confrontation,\u201d 18 L. &amp; Psychol. Rev. 439, 442 (1994) (child witnesses undergo fear and trauma when testifying in presence of accused). Child witnesses must be made to feel comfortable in the unfamiliar and intimidating surroundings of a courtroom. \u201cIn cases such as this, where it is necessary to receive testimony from young children, the court must strike a balance between the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and the witness\u2019s need for an environment in which he or she will not be intimidated into silence or to tears.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cliff, </em>116 Idaho 921, 925, 782 P.2d 44 (App. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Our statutes acknowledge the need to accommodate child witnesses in the courtroom. General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g (b) provides that, when a child testifies in a child abuse case, a court may prohibit persons from entering and leaving the courtroom, require attorneys to remain seated, permit the use of anatomically correct dolls to elicit testimony, and permit an adult with whom the child is familiar to sit in close proximity to the child during testimony. The statute also forbids intimidating questioning or objections. These special accommodations are permitted in order to put the child at ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Courts have recognized that a doll or stuffed animal may have a soothing effect on a child witness. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cliff, </em>supra, 116 Idaho 925 (upholding trial court\u2019s decision to allow child to bring doll to stand); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gutkaiss, </em>206 App. Div. 2d 628, 631, 614 N.Y.S.2d 599 (1994) (defendant not prejudiced by child holding teddy bear while testifying); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquez, </em>124 N.M. 409, 413, 951 P.2d 1070 (App. 1997), cert. denied, 124 N.M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>311, 950 P.2d 284 (1998) (same); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palabay, </em>9 Haw. App. 414, 420-24, 844 P.2d 1 (1992), cert. denied, 74 Haw. 652, 849 P.2d 81 (1993) (if necessary, child may hold teddy bear while testifying). Professional studies have documented that children derive comfort from familiar stuffed animals and should be allowed to hold them while testifying. See, e.g., J. Myers, K. Saywitz &amp; G. Goodman, \u201cPsychological Research on Children as Witnesses: Practical Implications for Forensic Interviews and Courtroom Testimony,\u201d 28 Pac. L.J. 3, 71 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">When the child initially took the stand at trial, she was accompanied by the victim\u2019s advocate of the office of the state\u2019s attorney, who had a bag of toys. Defense counsel complained that the victim\u2019s advocate \u201clookfed] like Santa Claus there.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defense counsel objected to the bag of toys being placed at the child\u2019s feet, but did not object to the Barney doll the witness was holding. The trial court refused defense counsel\u2019s request to remove the bag of toys, stating that it was \u201cnot going to disturb the . . . arrangements . . . that have been made to allow a minor child of these tender years to testify in a court of law. I\u2019ll exercise my discretion and allow it. I do not see any harm to anyone, the defendant. . . the state or anyone else. And I certainly don\u2019t see how it will affect the witness\u2019 testimony other than, perhaps, to aid her ... to be calm and to have something to hold onto that she\u2019s more accustomed to rather than a large courtroom such as this.\u201d The next day of trial, defense counsel asked the child who had given her the Barney doll that she again was holding as she testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Before trial, the trial court had invited suggestions from counsel regarding the procedures to be used during the child\u2019s testimony and ruled that persons could not leave and enter the courtroom during the child\u2019s testimony, and that counsel must remain seated during questioning and use language and mannerisms that are not intimidating to the child. The parties agreed that, in order to comfort the child, her grandmother would be seated next to her throughout her testimony. However, when the state\u2019s attorney suggested, three or four weeks before trial, that both parties jointly provide the child with a doll, defense counsel rejected the proposal. The state\u2019s attorney, after being rebuffed by defense counsel, presented a doll to the child that she could take with her into the courtroom whenever she was going to testify, and it was obvious that, when the child had taken the stand, the state was supplying her with a variety of toys. I hardly think this calls for a finding of prosecutorial misconduct by the state\u2019s attorney. As the trial court recognized, \u201cthe conduct of the state\u2019s attorney in making the child comfortable was strictly for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">As Justice Palmer points out in his concurring opinion, attorneys often, and properly, call witnesses that are given consideration for their testimony: expert witnesses, informers, accomplices and coconspirators, among others. The well established rule is that the effect of such consideration on the testimony of any individual witness may be assessed by the trier. See, e.g., 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence (4th Ed. 1970) \u00a7 940, p. 775 (partiality of witness is relevant to weight of testimony). This rule mitigates against the conclusion that the act of giving a child a doll to hold in court requires a new trial. Under Connecticut\u2019s new witness protection law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>where the child may owe her very life to the state\u2019s protection, a similar argument may be made. We should not establish a different rule for a young child, a difficult, witness and the victim of frightful treatment. Unfortunately, the rule the majority adopts today especially and negatively affects the prosecution of child abuse cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">As to the possibility that the child may have been influenced by the conduct of the state\u2019s attorney, I agree that this issue should be the subject of cross-examination before the jury. See, e.g., <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316-17, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974) (one function of cross-examination is to expose witness\u2019 bias or motivation for testifying). The trial court unduly restricted the defendant\u2019s cross-examination on this matter and I agree that that restriction warrants a reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction for the assault that resulted in the child\u2019s internal pancreatic injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Accordingly, I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\"> Also known as St. Nicholas, Santa Claus carries a bundle of toys as gifts to children. See generally C. Moore, The Night Before Christmas (Holiday House 1980 Ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\"> Public Acts 1999, No. 99-240, \u00a7 6, provides that, in the prosecution of a serious felony offense, any \u201cwitness at risk of harm\u201d may receive protective services, including armed protection, escort, marked or unmarked surveillance, temporary physical relocation and basic living expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
