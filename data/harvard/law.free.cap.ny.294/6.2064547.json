The finding of the trial court, undisturbed by the Appellate Division, is that the claimant was aware that the extra work thus required was \u201c not part of the work called for by the contract \u201d with the State. Under those circumstances, the first item of the claim for the sum of $641 should not have been allowed, since that which was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>was clearly beyond the limits of the contract and <em>\u201c </em>the contractor may [might] not even under protest do it and subsequently recover damages. \u201d <em>(Borough Const.
