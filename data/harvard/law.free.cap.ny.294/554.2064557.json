Wilkinson, Corporation Counsel (Morris Shapiro </em>of counsel), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azh\">Since the medical boards determined that Mack had a non-service-incurred permanent disability, he should have been retired. <em>(Matter of Thomasson </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>263 App. Div. 334; <em>Matter of Eichler </em>v. <em>McElligott, </em>283 N.

The suspension of Mack by the fire chief was without legal basis. <em>(Matter of Clancy </em>v. <em>Halleran, </em>263 N. Y. 258; <em>Matter of Schwab </em>v. <em>McElligott, </em>282 N.

The patent misconduct of the medical boards and the deception practiced on petitioner\u2019s representative at the special medical board, warranted the vacation of the medical determinations. <em>(Matter of Newbrand </em>v. <em>City of Yonkers, </em>285 N.

Upon that finding a new examination should be ordered before a special medical board, in accordance with the provisions of section B19-4.0, subdivision d, of the Administrative Code of the City of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The order of the Appellate Division should be modified to the extent of reinstating the determinations of June 25, 1943, and October 1, 1943, made by the Medical Boards appointed by the Fire Commissioner, and directing the appellant Fire Commissioner to order a re-examination of petitioner-respondent Mack before a special medical board, and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs to petitioner-respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Lehman, Ch.
