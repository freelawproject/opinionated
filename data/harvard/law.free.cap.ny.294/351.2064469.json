Bryant </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, </em>213 App. Div. 414, 241 N. Y. 405; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Home Life Publications, Inc., </em>237 App. Div. 200; <em>Wulfsohn </em>v. <em>Russian Republic, </em>234 N.

If the article is capable of a meaning which is defamatory or one which is innocent, it is a question for the jury whether it was uttered and understood in its libelous rather than its harmless significance. <em>(Demos </em>v. <em>N. Y. E. J. Publishing Co., </em>210 N. Y. 13; <em>Breen </em>v. <em>New York Herald Co., </em>55 Misc. 567; <em>Cassidy </em>v. <em>Gannett Co., Inc., </em>173 Misc. 634; <em>Turrill </em>v. <em>Dolloway, </em>17 Wend. 426.) III. The charge is much more than that plaintiff was an officer of a department or agency of a foreign government. <em>(Washington Times Co. </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>55 App. D. C. 32.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-5\"><em>Charles Henry </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahh\">I. The publication is not libelous in that it merely charges plaintiff with holding a public office which, so far as appears from the complaint, she had a right to hold. <em>(Crashley </em>v. <em>Press Publishing Co., </em>179 N. Y. 27; <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>176 Misc. 685; <em>Hallock </em>v. <em>Miller, 2 </em>Barb. 630.) II. Special damage must be alleged when a defamatory meaning depends- on facts extraneous to the publication itself. <em>(O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Press Publishing Co., </em>214 N.

P. U. (gaypayu) which was organized in its stead and to take its place, afterwards known as O. G. P. U. (ogpu) (the \u2018 0 \u2019 signifying unified after the 1923 formation of the U. S. S. R.).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The complaint also contains allegations, in substance, that by reason of the publication of the subject article the plaintiff has been brought into public scorn and disgrace and there has been falsely created a suspicion and belief that the plaintiff, in her private and professional life, has participated in and committed vile, scandalous and shameful acts of misconduct, and that by reason of such publication she has been damaged in the sum of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Concededly, the plaintiff has alleged no special damage. This, however, is not fatal as it is well established that a complaint in a libel action is sufficient if the false publication complained of is libelous per se. <em>(Sydney </em>v. <em>Maefadden Newspaper Pub. Corp., </em>242 N. Y. 208; <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Press Publishing Co., </em>214 N. Y. 352.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The test applicable to the sufficiency of the complaint narrows down then to the single proposition of whether the publication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>complained of is libelous per se. The defendant, in support of its contention that the publication is not libelous per se, argues that, although the \u201c Cheka \u201d was everything the complaint alleged, it was, nevertheless, a legally constituted instrumentality of the Russian Government and, as such, presumably performed its functions in a lawful manner through its duly authorized officers and agents; that the statement that plaintiff was an officer of the \u201c Cheka \u201d, which so far as appears from the complaint she had a right to be, is not tantamount to charging her with the commission of a crime or other misconduct; and that, under such circumstances, there can be no libel regardless of how good her reputation was or how false the publication, particularly as there is no allegation that she was not a Russian citizen. This line of reasoning seems to be predicated on the general proposition that an article is not libelous per se if the act complained of is not illegal in the country where committed. <em>(Crashley </em>v. <em>Press Publishing Co., </em>179 N. Y. 27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The article in question goes much further than merely charging appellant with having been an officer or agent of a foreign government. She is charged with association with Mussolini in a hangout for Russian revolutionaries, headed by her, as well as later becoming secretary to the dread \u201c Cheka \u201d. In Restatement of the Law of Torts, section 563, subdivision d, it is stated: \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>In determining the meaning of a communication, words, whether written or spoken, are to be construed together with their context. Words which standing alone may reasonably be understood as defamatory may be so explained or qualified by their context as to make such an interpretation unreasonable. So too, words which alone are innocent may in their context clearly be capable of a defamatory meaning and may be so understood. The context of a defamatory imputation includes all parts of the communication which are ordinarily heard or read with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The allegations of the complaint describing the organization, functions and practices of the \u201c Cheka \u201d are essential to an understanding of the significance of the language of the subject publication and do not, in our opinion, constitute extrinsic facts of such a character as to necessitate allegations of special damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Given a fair reading, we feel that the article in question, taken in its entirety, fairly raises a question as to whether the plaintiff was held up to public contempt and disgrace; and, if so found, such an article is libelous per se without alleging special damages. <em>(Hays </em>v. <em>American Defense Society, </em>252 N. Y. 266; <em>Kimmerle </em>v. <em>New York Evening Journal, Inc., </em>262 N. Y. 99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In <em>Katapodis </em>v. <em>Brooklyn Spectator, Inc. </em>(287 N. Y. 17, 20), in which a newspaper article describing the poverty of the plaintiff was held libelous per se, L\u00f3ughban, J. said: \u201c The reason is that in libel the matter is defamatory not only if it brings a p\u00e1rty into hatred, ridicule or contempt by asserting some moral discredit upon his part, but also if it tends to make him be shunned or avoided, although it imputes no moral turpitude to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Whether the false publication in the instant case, in and of itself, is sufficient to bring the plaintiff into disrepute and subject her to the hatred and contempt of her friends and associates is a matter within the province of the jury, and we are unwilling to say, as a matter of law, that the language used is not libelous per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the order of the Special Term affirmed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Lehman, Ch. J., Loughran, Lewis, Conway, Desmond and Thacher, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
