Ruth B.

Weis </em>and <em>Seymour J. Wilner </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWD\">I. That it was the testamentary intent to create a trust measured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>at least three lives is obvious both from the particularly expressed provisions and from a consideration of the will in its entirety. Testator\u2019s intent must prevail over all other canons of construction. <em>(Matter of Clark, </em>280 N. <em>Y. </em>155; <em>Matter of Roth, </em>291 N. Y. 1; <em>Matter of Durant, </em>231 N. Y. 41; <em>Matter of Winburn, </em>265 N. Y. 366; <em>Herzog </em>v. <em>Title Gurantee &amp; Trust Co., </em>177 N. Y. 86; <em>Central Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Egleston, </em>185 N. Y. 23: <em>Matter of Watson, </em>262 N. Y. 284.) II. In any event there must be a -reversal of that part of the decree which directs preservation of the residence for the widow\u2019s life without limitation to the duration of the trust. Decedent\u2019s residence is part of the residuary estate and- therefore is in the corpus of the trust. The decree provides: <em>\u201c </em>that as long as the respondent Lillie Bruckheimer occupies the decedent\u2019s residence at Torrence Place, Scarsdale, Westchester County, New York, or during her lifetime the expenses incurred in preserving the said home, such as mortgage interest, taxes, repairs, insurance and other fixed charges, shall be paid out of the principal of th\u00e9 trust.\u201d III. Even if it be held that testator created a valid trust it was error to direct that maintenance charges of the residence should be paid out of principal. <em>(Matter of Albertson et al., </em>113 N. Y. 434; <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>219 N. Y. 459; <em>Matter of Satterwhite, </em>262 N. Y. 339; <em>Matter of Ely, </em>249 App. Div. 8, 274 N. Y. 501.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b74-5\"><em>Bradford Butler </em>and <em>Morris Metz </em>for Morris Metz, as executor and trustee of Marcus Bruckheimer, deceased, respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APr\">I. Testator erected a trust expressly measured by the lives of two of his grandchildren with a provision for prior termination in certain specified contingencies. <em>(Bailey </em>v. <em>Bailey et al., </em>97 N. Y. 460; <em>Crooke et al., </em>v. <em>County of Kings, </em>97 N. Y. 421; <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Reddington et al., </em>24 N.

Cotting, </em>131 N. Y. 48.) II. The directions of subdivision <em>\u201c </em>A \u201d of paragraph <em>\" </em>Fifth \u2019 \u2019 of the will are not reasonably capable of interpretation as adding a third measuring life to the duration of the trust. III. The second sentences of subdivisions \u201c B 9 \u201d and \u201c C 8 \u201d of paragraph <em>\u201c </em>Fifth \u201d of the will cannot be interpreted as varying the express directions respecting the period of duration of the trust. <em>(Hatch </em>v. <em>Bassett, </em>52 N. Y. 359; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Conboy, </em>73 N. Y. 230; <em>Locke et al., </em>v. <em>F. L. &amp; T. Co. et al., </em>140 N.

The determination of the Surrogate and the majority of the Appellate Division concerning the duties of the fiduciaries respecting the family residence was correct. <em>(Matter of Burton, </em>143 Misc. 440; <em>Matter of Albertson et al., </em>113 N. Y. 434; <em>Matter of Ely, </em>249 App. Div. 8, 274 N. Y. 501; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>184 N. Y. 62; <em>Fleischman </em>v. <em>Furgueson, </em>223 N.

The testator\u2019s directions to the trustees to apply the income of the estate to the support of the testator\u2019s wife \u201c during her lifetime \u201d and to preserve his home for the use of his wife \u201c as long as she lives \u201d and the testator\u2019s failure to make any express provisions for the contingency that his wife might survive her two grandchildren may indicate that the testator did not regard that contingency as substantial, but do not indicate that the testator intended to extend the duration of the trust beyond the limits unequivocally fixed by the testator. By necessary implication the testator\u2019s directions to the trustees are limited to the period of the trust created by the testator and the provisions of the decree construing such directions must also be so read.
