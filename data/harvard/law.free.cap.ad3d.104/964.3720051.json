In accordance with the plea agreement, he was sentenced as a second felony offender to 2 to 4 years in prison to run consecutively to the sentence imposed on a prior conviction. Defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">Appellate counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment of representing defendant upon the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Based upon our review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief, we agree. Therefore, the judgment is affirmed and counsel\u2019s request for leave to withdraw is granted <em>(see People v Cruwys, </em>113 AD2d 979, 980 [1985], <em>lv denied </em>67 NY2d 650 [1986]; <em>see generally People v Stokes, </em>95 NY2d 633 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Peters, PJ., Rose, Stein and Garry, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, and application to be relieved of assignment granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
