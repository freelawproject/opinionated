Thereupon the plaintiff appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-18\">Without entering upon a discussion of the pertinent facts, we may say the affidavits satisfy us the case was one where there was a considerable range of discretion as to whether a court should decide the question of injunction on preliminary or final hearing. In the exercise of that discretion, the court followed the latter course. Without, as we have said here, discussing the facts and expressing no conclusion there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>on, we may say they disclose no such situation as made the refusal of the injunction at this stage of the case error, instead of a reasonable exercise of the court\u2019s discretionary powers in declining present injunctive relief and allowing the case to go to final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
