Second. \u201cPeptomint\u201d is so different in appearance and sound that there -yould be no infringement, even if \u201cSpearmint\u201d were a proper trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> Respecting unfair competition, an inspection of the packages, discloses some marked dissimilarities. On the' display side of the one \u201cWrigley\u2019s Spearmint Pepsin Gum\u201d are the prominent words; on the other, \u201cE. P. E- Peptomint Gum.\u201d \u201cSpearmint,\u201d specially emphasized, is printed on the shaft of a spear, lying horizontally along the middle of the label. \u201cPeptomint,\u201d specially emphasized, is printed on a straight-line banner, running obliquely from lower left to upper right, and laid upon a circle in the middle of the label. These differences, when the labels are placed side by side, are very striking. But there are also striking similarities. Both packages severally contain 5 sticks of gum, done up in pink wrappers, which protrude at each end some distance beyond the label wrappers. Both labels are done on white paper with red and green printers\u2019 inks. Spear shaft and head are green, and thereon \u201cSpearmint\u201d shows in large white letters. Larsoh Company\u2019s banner is green, and thereon \u201cPeptomint\u201d shows in large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>white letters. \u201cWrigley\u2019s\u201d above the spear and \u201cPepsin Gum\u201d below are printed in red. Larson\u2019s circle is red. In segments above and below the banner \u201cL. P. L.\u201d and \"Gum\u201d appear in white on the red background. Both labels bear sprigs of rriint in green.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">If the case were to be disposed of by the foregoing comparison, the finding might w,ell be that the similarities so overbear the differences that the casual purchaser might be misled by the common color and printing scheme; and such was the view of the learned District Judge iin granting a pendente lite injunction on the sworn bill and exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">But at the final hearing other facts appeared, which may be briefly summarized as follows: In gum making before Wrigley\u2019s time it was common practice to form sticks of the size and shape now used by Wrigley and Larson; to wrap the sticks in pink paper; to.put 5 sticks in a package; to put 20 packages in a box; to tie each package of 5 pink sticks with a counterband of white paper; to use red and green printers\u2019 inks on the white counterband; to display the maker\u2019s name and \u201cGum\u201d or \u201cPepsin Gum\u201d in red letters; and, if the flavor was of the mint order, to print, the name denoting flavor in white on a green design or in green on a white design. And on the package of this general style Wrigley was not the first to apply \u201cSpearmint\u201d as a display word of special emphasis. That had been done by Pulver years before Wrigley came on the scene. So there was nothing that Wrigley did not take from others, except his own name and the spear as the design on which to spread the word \u201cSpearmint.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Wrigley, of course, knew these facts, and also the inside story of his suit against Pulver. According to the final decree in that case, Wrigley, not Pulver, was the originator of the \u201cSpearmint\u201d package. But the decree was not entered until Wrigley owned both sides of the lawsuit. He gave Pulver $100,000 in cash and $150,000 in notes running <em>one </em>to five years. If Pulver should fail to keep still, there might be trouble in collecting the notes remaining unpaid. It was Larson\u2019s persistent digging that unearthed this hidden story.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Wrigley\u2019s oppression of his opponent and his attempt to deceive the court were ample grounds for refusing him relief in equity; and in the strict law, when Wrigley is limited, as he must be, to his own name and the spear'design for displaying \u201cSpearmint,\u201d Larson is not liable for using his own initials and the oblique banner across the circle for displaying \u201cPeptomint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> In No. 2498, the record came here first; but it presents a later controversy. Larson, while under the pendente lite injunction against his \u201cPeptomint\u201d package, brought out his \u201cWintermint\u201d brand. Wrigley sued him as an infringer of \u201cWrigley\u2019s Doublemint\u201d package. Oil-final hearing Wrigley\u2019s bill was dismissed for want of equity, and Wrigley has acquiesced.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Wrigley\u2019s bill described the packages and averred that confusion had arisen and was bound to continue. This was fortified by the opinion testimony of Wrigley and another officer of his company. Larson, in his answer and counterclaim, fully accepted Wrigley\u2019s position as to similarity and confusion, denied that \u201cWrigley\u2019s Doublemint\u201d was the elder, and averred that Wrigley had deliberately brought out \u2018,\u2018Double-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>mint\u201d to -undermine Larson\u2019s established and growing trade in \u201cWintermint.\u201d The evidence proves with certainty that \u201cWintermint\u201d was seven months older than \u201cDoublemint.\u201d A reasonably clear inference from facts in the record is that Wrigley was acquainted with the \u201cWintermint\u201d package before adopting his \u201cDoublemint\u201d package.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">But, in support of the counterclaim, no proof was made of actual confusion. Counsel, however, contend that an inference to that effect may be drawn from Larson\u2019s testimony that after \u201cDoublemint\u201d appeared his sales of \u201cWintermint\u201d materially decreased. True, but a Tailing off in business may result from fair as well as from unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Insistence comes to be centered on the proposition that the trial court was not at liberty to determine the question of actual or probable confusion from a comparison of the packages and from the lack of direct testimony, but was bound to take that issue as settled by Wrigley\u2019s averments and admissions in court; and counsel cite many cases as supportive of their contention.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Undoubtedly a litigant has no cause for complaint if the court accepts his solemn and sworn admissions in pleadings and testimony as true. But we must reject the contention that -his adversary has the right to compel the court to do so. Otherwise a court could be forced by parties to decide moot, feigned, and collusive cases, or a chancellor might be made to proceed with an equitable accounting between partners who had stolen the property they brought into court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the present case on the counterclaim is not moot, nor feigned, nor collusive, and it presents a question of Larson\u2019s legitimate property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">In the \u201cWintermint\u201d package the sticks of gum are wrapped in green paper; also in the \u201cDoublemint\u201d package. Both have counterbands of white paper bearing words and devices in red and green printers\u2019 inks. To a casual glance the\u00b0packages seem alike in some degree. But the differences are noticeably prominent. \u201cWintermint\u201d is displayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>on Larson\u2019s oblique' banner; \u201cDoublemint,\u201d on the shaft of a spear having a head at each end. .Ajind the name of the maker in each case is given emphasis: \u201cLarson\u2019s Wintermint,\u201d \u201cWrigley\u2019s Doublemint.\u201d From a comparison the learned District Judge found that the distinctive words and marks were so dominating that the careless purchaser, desiring \u201cLarson\u2019s Wintermint,\u201d would not be misled into taking \u201cWrigley\u2019s Doublemint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> With nothing before us but the packages, we would be inclined to concur in the finding. But the record contains also Wrigley\u2019s averment in his bill that confusion had arisen. There was no proof to support that averment and Larson\u2019s parallel averment. But Larson\u2019s counsel may have' relied on the stipulation of fact in bill and counterclaim to save hunting up; and bringing in witnesses of wrongful sales. Furthermore, Wrigley and another interested with him gave testimony as experts in the gum business that confusion was likely to result from the similarities; and so there is a basis for at least the possibility that Wrigley\u2019s averment of fact and his expert opinion may be true, aind that Larson\u2019s diminished sales came from Wrigley\u2019s simulation of the \u201cWintermint\u201d package.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">In such a situation, the rule, in our judgment, is this: In a real and legitimate controversy, a party should be left within the knot of his averments in pleadings and admissions in testimony, unless the court can find an absolute demonstration from other evidence in the case or from facts within judicial notice, like the laws of physics, etc., that under no circumstances could the averments and admissions be true. This is in analogy to the rule respecting the sustaining of a demurrer to a bill for infringement of a patent on account of the invalidity of the patent on its face. Westrumite Co. v. Commissioners, 174 Fed. 144, 98 C. C. A. 178; Lange v. McGuin, 177 Fed. 219, 101 C. C. A. 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">In No. 2500 the decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">In No. 2498 the part of the decree that dismisses the counterclaim of Larson Company is reversed, with the direction to enter an injunction and order an accounting.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-8\"> Sullivan v.
