He recovered a verdict, and on entry of judgment thereon the railway company sued out this writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-16\">From the plaintiff\u2019s statement it appears the defendant\u2019s road extends from Pittsburgh, Pa., to Buffalo, N. Y., and the ground of action was that the railway had failed to comply with the federal Safety Appliance Act (Act March 2,' 1893, c. 196, \u00a7 2, 27 Stat. 531 [Comp. St. 1916, \u00a7 8606]), in that the couplers between which the plaintiff was injured \u201cwould not at said time couple with each other automatically upon impact, without the necessity of employes of d\u00e9fendant going between the ends thereof to render personal assistance.\u201d The said road being itself a highway of interstate commerce generally, and the negligence charged being a failure on its part to comply with the federal Safety Act, it follows that, if the plaintiff sustained his charge of the defendant\u2019s statutory negligence, and that his injury was caused by such negligence, he was entitled to recover, even if he was not himself engaged in interstate commerce when he was injured. Railroad v. Rigsby, 241 U. S. 33, 36 Sup. Ct. 482, 60 L. Ed. 874. Such being the case, the proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>given by tlie plaintiff that he was engaged in interstate commerce when injured \u2014 the competency of which is here questioned \u2014 becomes a matter of no moment. The verdict and the judgment thereon would have been justified, had there been no such proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">.Further complaint is made that there was no such proof of the plaintiff\u2019s earning power as warranted the submission of that question to the jur}. We have examined the record, and we find proof of the plaintiff\u2019s earning capacity and actual earnings before the accident. That proof of his earning capacity after the accident was not given was because the defendant objected to such proof, and it cannot now he heard, in the face of the court sustaining such objection, to urge as error that such proof was not furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
