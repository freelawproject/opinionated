Tbe record fails to show that before the jury retired any exception was so made as to direct the court\u2019s attention to either of the parts of its charge now complained of. The judgment is not .to be reversed because of rulings made in the course of the trial, of which complaint was not made to the court before the case went to the jury.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
