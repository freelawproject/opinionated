It was not claimed that every one present understood that he was joking, or that he intended them so to understand; the claim appears to have been that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>liad no intention to carry out his threat, and that, therefore, it was a joke; the instruction read in the light of the entire charge must he so construed, and in our judgment it was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> A threat is knowingly made, if the maker of it comprehends the meaning of the words uttered by him; a foreigner, ignorant of the English language, repeating these same words without knowledge of their meaning, may not knowingly have made a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">And a threat is willfully made, if in addition to comprehending the meaning of his words, the maker voluntarily and intentionally utters them as the declaration of an apparent determination to carry them into execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Defendant, while conceding that an intention actually to carry out the threat or the President\u2019s knowledge of the threat is not essential, contends that the language must be used with an evil or malicious intent to express a sentiment to be impressed upon the minds of persons through which it might create a sentiment of hostility to the security of the President, \u201cthat willfully implies an evil purpose \u2014 legal malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Waiving defendant\u2019s failure properly to except to the charges (his exception was general to the court\u2019s construction of the act), his present contention cannot he sustained, if by evil purpose or legal malice, more is meant than an intention to give utterance to words which, to defendant\u2019s knowledge, were in form and would naturally be understood by the hearers as being a threat; that is, the expression of a determination, whether actual or only pretended, to menace the Pres - ident\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">While under some circumstances, the word \u201cwillfully\u201d in penal statutes means not merely voluntarily, but with a bad purpose (Spurr v. United States, 174 U. S. 728, 19 Sup. Ct. 812, 43 L. Ed. 1150; Potter v. United States, 155 U. S. 446, 15 Sup. Ct. 144, 39 L. Ed. 214), nothing in the text, context, or history of this legislation indicates the materiality of the hidden intent or purpose of one who, in the presence of others, voluntarily uses language known by him to be in form such a threat, and who thus, to some extent: endangers the President\u2019s life (United States v. Stickrath [D. C.] 242 Fed. 151; United States v. Clark, 250 Fed. 449, - C. C. A. - [April 1, 1918, C. C. A. 5th Circuit]).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Judge KOHESAAT concurred in these conclusions, but died before the opinion was written.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-13\"> \u201cAmy person who knowingly and willfully deposits or causes to be deposited for conveyance in the mail or for delivery from any postoffice or by any letter carrier any letter, paper, writing, print, missive, or document containing any threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States, or who knowingly and willfully otherwise makes any such threat against the President, shall upon conviction be fined not exceeding $1,000 or imprisoned not exceeding five years, or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
