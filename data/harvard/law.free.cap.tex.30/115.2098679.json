Sarah Lacy et al.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b131-8\">Upon the question of jurisdiction the cases of Arberry v. Beavers, 6 Tex., 457, and Baker v. Chisholm, 3 Tex., 157, were examined and quoted at length, to show that they related to the special limited duties under discussion. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Notes 182, 433, 604.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b131-9\">The first section of the act of 1866, about apprentices, declares, that \u201cin all applications for apprenticeship, ten days\u2019 notice, as in the case of guardianship, shall be given, and no minor shall be apprenticed except at a regular term of the court.\u201d (See the act, <em>post </em>p. 119.) But the county court docs not derive its powers to apprentice from the statute by which the exercise of jurisdiction is regulated, but from the constitution, which gives it as clearly and positively as any other branch of the jurisdiction. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., p. 935, sec. 6.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b131-10\">It follows that the jurisdiction is over an inferior tribunal, by the exercise of a general superintendence and control, with the right, when necessary, to issue the writs of injunction, <em>certiorari, </em>&amp;c. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., p. 935, sec. 6, and Note 182, p. 57.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b131-11\">The 16th section of the IVth article of the constitution of 1866, gives the power to the county courts to apprentice minors under such regulations as may be prescribed by law. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., p. 937, sec. 16.) And while the 6th section of the same article does not expressly give appellate jurisdiction as to this subject-matter, yet it is within the superintendence and control of the district court. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., p. 935, sec. 6.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b131-12\">The most that could be said is, that if an appeal does not lie from the county court, its action may be brought into exercise by <em>certiorari.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b131-13\">It is a universal principle of the common law, that the father of a bastard has no parental power or authority over such illegitimate offspring,</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b131-14\">A bastard is a child born out of lawful wedlock.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>And there can surely be no lawful wedlock between parties who are under disability, and cannot exercise the freedom of consent essential to every contract.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b132-4\">Slaves could not marry, even with the consent of their masters, so as to constitute them husband and wife, and protect them from being witnesses against each other ; they could not take property by purchase or descent; they had no heirs, and could make no will; they were not entitled to the rights and considerations of matrimony, therefore they had no relief in eases of adultery; they were not the proper obj ects of cognation or affinity, bnt of <em>quasi </em>cognation only ; contubernism was the matrimony of slaves, a permitted cohabitation, not partaking of lawful marriage, which they could not control.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b132-5\">The state of slavery in this country compared with the Roman law in many respects. The progress of society in civilization, more correct notions on the subject of moral obligation, and, above all, the benign influence of the Christian religion, have softened many of the rigors attendant on slavery among the ancients. But the rights of the slave, in respect to marriage and the acquisition of property by way of inheritance, remain substantially on the same ground.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b132-7\">The chief justice quoted, and inclined to approve, the opinion of Matthews, J., that while in a state of slavery marriage could produce no civil effect, because slaves are. deprived of all civil rights, yet that emancipation gives to a slave his civil rights; and a contract of marriage, legal and valid by the consent of the master, and moral assent of the slave, from the moment of freedom, although dormant during slavery, produces all the effects which result from such contracts among free persons.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b132-8\">The object and purpose of our apprentice law was to give to parents or guardians of minor children, subject to their control, and for whose care and nurture the courts provide, the right of consent. But the father who had abandoned his wife and children has no power to rob the mother of the child, and direct its apprenticeship.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b132-9\">The trial in the district court was <em>de novo, </em>and the judgment was affirmed, without settling <em>the </em>general practice upon a <em>certiorari </em>in such cases.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b132-10\">Appeal from Cherokee. The case was tried before Hon. Be\u00fcbes A. Beeves, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-12\">This case introduces a new feature in the history of Texas jurisprudence. There was literally nothing in the laws of the republic in relation to apprentices. The 44th section of the act of 20th March, 1848, relating to guardians and wards, reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-13\">\u201cWhen a minor shall have no parents living, and no estate, the chief justice, shall have power, without the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>pointment of a guardian, to bind out such minor to some suitable person who will undertake the support and education of such minor; if a male, until he shall arrive at the age of twenty-one years; and, if a female, until she shall marry, or arrive at the age of twenty-one years, which ever shall first happen; and when any such minor shall have property, but not sufficient for his support and education, the chief justice may authorize the guardian of such minor to bind out such minor under the like rules and regulations.\u201d (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 8927.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-4\">And by the 39th article of the Penal Code, apprentices were put in the same category with children and slaves, as to offenses perpetrated at the instance of parents, guardians, or masters. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 1641.) These were the whole of our laws in reference to apprenticeship. And practically these two sections were dead letters. The jurisdiction was rarely, if ever, exercised by the county courts. In a country of such plenty, and where livings were so easily obtained, orphan children were generally provided for by the early marriages of widows; by the kindness of some relative or friend; and, more generally, by becoming <em>men </em>at ten or fifteen years of age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-5\">Our educational system paid for their tuition at any public school in the state. In the country, they remained upon farms and took to stock-raising, farming, driving teams, or hunting, as best suited their tastes. In the cities, they learned to set type, or handicraft with established mechanics; or else they turned to be merchants\u2019 clerks, law or medical students, never being charged for tuition, and not often for board or clothing; or, if religiously inclined, they took to preaching without preparation. The sufferings of orphans or begging by them was unknown. And while they were rarely hired to work, there was no such thing as \u201cgoing out to service.\u201d The <em>Reporter </em>takes this occasion, once again,to repudiate the \u201cgreat lie,\u201dthat to work was a degradation in the South, and that orphan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>children grew up in idleness or as vagabonds. hTor is it true, as a rule, that the children of the well-to-do people did not labor. In truth, in the South, as in all the rest of the world, to labor in some way was the rul\u00e9; to he idle, the exception. There were few organized charitable institutions; but there was a great deal of hospitable charity in taking care of the children of deceased relatives and friends, and bringing them up with tolerable educations. And while slavery had its great evils, (and what civilization, has not,) no system of property was better adapted to keeping families of deceased fathers together than that system. It was far more generally distributed than is usually believed. To own few slaves was the rule; - many, the exception. Of the three hundred and fifty thousand slave-owners in the whole South, one hundred and sixty thousand owned from one to three, and one hundred thousand from three to ten. When the humane slaveholder died, (and all small slaveholders, as a rule, worked with their slaves and were humane,) none were so anxious about the children as the faithful slaves. These, with the aid of the widows and children, generally \u201cworked out the debts,\u201d and the farms went along better than they had with thriftless masters. And among that far more numerous class, the six millions whose families were unconnected with slavery by ownership, to he busy laborers was the general rule. They included among them divines, physicians,' lawyers, editors, teachers, printers, engineers, all sorts of carriers, merchants, hotel-keepers, mechanics of every art, manufacturers, officers of every grade, professional politicians, overseers, and the vast numbers of small farmers who really made up the great agricultural strength of the southern states.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">2sTo .eight millions of civilized people were, so moral, none more independent. The \u201cpoor white trash\u201d was more a thing of imagination than reality. bText to the \u201c great lie,\u201d that the white man never worked in the South, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>was the shameless one, that the family without slaves had no social or political influence in southern society. Society there, as elsewhere, was greatly controlled by the learned professions and men in commercial life, or those callings which bring them into constant contact with the public. These were not the wealthy planters, by any means, but the classes before mentioned. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-4\">The orphans of those without slaves almost always found friends, who gave them employment until they took to professions, like our Crawfords, McDuffies, Clays, Houstons, Grundys, Johnsons, Hamiltons, Lipscombs, Arringtons, and hosts of other great lights, who have added lustre to the nation.- Indeed, we have few who have won renown in the southern states, who, as boys, did not labor on the farms, or in some other manual way, which gave constitutions and habits of application and conscious self-reliance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-5\">The sudden emancipation of four millions of illiterate people, who had hitherto been slaves\u2014a people without property, money, or book-learning\u2014required some change of legislation. It is not to be denied, that the shock was a great one, and that it distracted the minds of many, and caused inventions, as to how the labor should be controlled for the benefit of the old masters. Although most men had long felt, few were willing to acknowledge, that slavery was a very expensive institution of the master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">The legislature of Texas adopted an apprentice law as a remedy for this change. As it is printed in no digest as yet, and the case turns upon several of its sections, the act is here printed in full:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">\u201cAh Act establishing a general apprentice law, and defining the obligations of master or mistress and apprentice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-8\">\u201c1.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aei\">It is insisted by appellant, that the judgment in this case should be reversed, for want of jurisdiction of the district court to bring before it, by <em>controrari, </em>the proceedings of the county court apprenticing the minor, Elkin Pope, for its revision and correction. The law under which the action of the county court in this case was had conferred, it is said by appellant, on that court a special and exclusive jurisdiction over the entire subject-matter provided for therein, and that its judgments, or any proceedings had under this law, cannot he reviewed or brought in question, either by ajipeal or <em>certiorari, </em>in\u2019the district court or any other tribunal. We are referred to no authority to sustain this position. Reliance is had, it is supposed, however, upon the cases of Baker v. Chisholm, 3 Tex., 157, and Arberry v. Beavers, 6 Tex., 457. An examination of these cases makes it quite apparent that they cannot be relied upon to support the position contended for by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">In the first of these cases the court says: \u201c The authority conferred upon the chief justice of the county by this statute was special, and restricted to one express object. Bo mode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>is provided for revising Ms decision, either by the special statute which conferred the authority, or by any general law. His exercise of the authority conferred was definite and final.\u201d And in the other case it is said: \u201c The authority here conferred was in the nature of a special commission, which was determined by the performance of the act to which it extended. It did not constitute the officer a judical tribunal,\u201d or \u201cinferior jurisdiction,\u201d within' the meaning of the constitution. (Const., art. IV, sec. 10.) That had reference to those inferior judicial tribunals which are constituted to administer the justice of the county, and whose proceedings are according to the course of the common law. * * * That it was the chief justice of the county who was empowered to act in this case did not change the character of the authority conferred. The duties imposed by the act had no connection with his official duties as chief justice, and might as well have been required of any private person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The statute under which the county court acted in this case provides, \u201c That in all applications for apprenticeship ten days\u2019 notice, as in case of guardianship, shall be given, and no minor shall be apprenticed except at a regular term of said court.\u201d But the county court does not derive its jurisdiction in the matter from the statute, for, though it is to be regulated by law, it is conferred upon the court by the constitution of the state as directly and positively as on any other of the several branches of its jurisdiction. It follows, therefore, that its action in this particular is that of an \u201cinferior tribunal,\u201d and in which the district court is given by the constitution (art. IV, see. 6) a general superintendance and control, with power, when necessary for this purpose, to issue writs of injunction, <em>certiorari, </em>&amp;c. (Newson v. Chrisman, 9 Tex., 113, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The 16th section of the IVth article of the constitution, defining the jurisdiction of the county court, in express terms delegates to it authority to apprentice minors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>under such regulations as may be prescribed by law; and while the 6th section of the same' article, when enumerating the different subjects of which the original jurisdiction had been conferred on the county courts, to which the appellate jurisdiction of the district court should extend, does not, in direct terms, include or refer to this branch of the jurisdiction of the county court, yet it would, we think, require a more technical construction of this section of the constitution, than there seems any .necessity for giving it, to hold that it restrains the district court from the'exercise of a superintendence and control over the action of the county court in this particular, under the previous clause of the section conferring this authority in respect to all inferior tribunals. It could only be said, at most, if this reference to the subjects for which the county court is established should be regarded as a limitation of the appellate and original jurisdiction of the district court on it, rather than for description and identification of the county court, acting in the character and capacity here referred to, instead of as a court for the transaction of police and county business, that the district court could not, in respect to the matter in question, exercise appellate and original jurisdiction in a matter passed upon in the county court by. an appeal; yet it could nevertheless exercise a general control and superintendency over it by <em>certiorari, </em>or any other writ appropriate for this purpose, and in conformity with the established usage of the common law or statutory enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">That the district court, by virtue of the authority conferred on it by this section of the constitution, may exercise control over inferior tribunals, is fully sustained by decisions in analogous eases entitled to our highest consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u201cThe superintending control,\u201d says the supreme court of Arkansas, <em>(ex parte Anthony, 5 </em>Pike, 365,) \u201c given by the constitution to the supreme court, and all inferior and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>courts of law aud equity, is in no respect different from that possessed by the circuit courts, except in this, that the latter is limited to the county courts and justices of the peace, while the former is extended to all courts in the state. The language in both instances imports the same thing, and the power derived from it must be exercised in like manner by each tribunal; consequently no appellate jurisdiction is granted to either. \"Yet the power vested by the constitution in the supreme court, to issue writs of error, <em>supersedeas, certiorari, </em>and <em>habeas corpus, mandamus, </em>and <em>quo warranto, </em>and other remedial writs, and to hear and determine the same, does, in our opinion, confer upon this court, by express grant, the power of adjudicating all cases determined .by an inferior judicial tribunal in the state, when, according to the principles of the common law, the case so determined can by means of any of the writs aforesaid be legally and appropriately brought before it, and to this extent the constitution gives to this court an appellate jurisdiction of which it cannot be deprived by an act of the legislature. But the legislature is fully competent to prescribe by law the order of proceeding to be observed in the exercise of this power, provided the proceeding so prescribed does not in any manner abridge or affect the jurisdiction of this court.\u201d (Bob, a Slave v. The State, 2 Yerg., 173; Hays v. Pope County, 5 Pike, 308; <em>ex parte </em>Tarlten, 2 Ala., 35.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">It is also equally clear, that the writ of <em>certiorari </em>is an appropriate remedy in such cases as the present. \u201cIn England,\u201d says the supreme court of Ohio, (Walpole v. Ink, 3 Ohio, 143,) \u201c the remedy by <em>certiorari </em>is twofold, to remove the case for trial into the court above, or merely to inquire into the correctness of its orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">And in Ruhlman v. The Commonwealth, 5 Binney, 24, it is said: \u201cThe distinction is thus taken in Grenalt v. Burwell, 1 Salk., 263; S. C, Carth., 494; Com. R., 80; 1 Lord Ray, 469. Whenever a new jurisdiction is erected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>by act of parliament, and the court or judge that exercises this jurisdiction acts as a court or judge of record, according to the course \u00f3f the common law a writ of error lies on their judgment; but when they act in a summary method, or in a new course different from the common law, a writ of error does not lie, but <em>certiorari.\u201d </em>(Broks v. Morgan, 5 Ired., 485; Weldz v. Washburn, 16 Johns., 49; Savage v. Gulliver, 4 Mass., 177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">In Tennessee, where the circuit court has authority to issue the writ of <em>certiorari </em>merely by virtue of its authority to supervise and control inferior tribunals, in a case where the reputed father of an illegitimate child whom he had legitimated in the county court in the manner prescribed by the statute of that state, it was held that the county court had no power to put such child in the custody of the father, or to bind it contrary to the wishes of the mother, unless the child is a pauper. \u201cThe county,\u201d says Catron, J., \u201cwere mistaken in supposing that the reputed father had any right to the possession of the child. Therefore the order of the court, authorizing him to take possession thereof, must be quashed. And so the circuit court ought to have ordered, had the cause been brought up by <em>certiorari.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">It remains for us to inquire as to the correctness of the decision of the court below on the merits of the case presented by the <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">This proceeding commenced in the county court by the application of a\u00a1ipellant, under the 1st section of the 43d chapter of the acts of the last session of the legislature, to have apprenticed to her the minor, Elkin Pope, alleged in the amended application to be under .fourteen years of age. The minor is alleged to be the offspring of the appellee, Sarah Lacy and Harry Pope, born while they were held in slavery, and while they cohabited as man and wife, having married, as is said, \u201c after the usual fashion of marriages with slaves.\u201d The minor, it seems, has been at all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>times recognized by Harry Pope as Ms child, but the connection between him and the appellee, Sarah, had ceased some ten years before they were emancipated, and both of them had contracted other marriages, also after the custom of marriages with slaves; and have never since their separation recognized each other as husband and wife. The minor, Elkin, was with his mother when they were emancipated, and continued witMher or under her control until he was taken by force to the residence of appellant by her son, with the consent of said Harry. But, as soon as he seems to have been permited to do so, he returned to his mother, and remained with her or under her control until the commencement of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"A2uB\">The order of the court apjtrenticing the minor to the appellant seems to be approved by his reputed father, Harry Pope, and the only question which it is necessary for us to determine at the present time is, whether this is sufficient to authorize the court to apprentice him, notwithstanding the opposition of his mother, and her ability to support and maintain him. We are clearly of opinion that it is not. It is a universally recognized principle of the common law, that the father of a bastard has no parental power or authority over such illegitimate offspring. It is difficult to conceive upon what ground it can be imagined that the reputed father of the minor in question can be held entitled to exercise the rights of a parent over him. The fundamental definition of the word bastard is, a child born out of lawful wedlock. And there can surely be no lawful wedlock between parties who are under disability, and cannot exercise the freedom, of consent essential in any contract. (State v. Samuel, 2 Dev. &amp; Batt., 177; Hall v. Mullin, 5 Har. &amp; John., 193; Jackson v. Leroy, 5 Cow., 397.) In the first of these cases, it is held that the marriage of slaves, consisting of cohabitation merely by the permission of their owners, does not constitute the relation of husband and wife, so as to attach to them the privileges and disabilities incident to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>common law; and hence that a slave who was the wife of another slave might give evidence against him even in a capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"AHo\">And in Jackson v. Leroy, it is said: \u201cBy the civil law slaves could not take by purchase or descent. They had no heirs, and therefore could make no will. They were not entitled to the rights and considerations of matrimony, and therefore had no relief in case of adultery, Hor were they proper objects of cognation or affinity, but of <em>quasi </em>cognation only. (Taylor\u2019s Elements Civil law, 429; Cooper\u2019s Justinian, 411, 420.) Contubernism was the matrimony of slaves; a permitted cohabitation, not partaking of lawful marriage, which they could not contract. The same disability, I apprehend, will apply to the case of slaves with us. The state of slavery in this country compares with that existing under the Roman law in many respects. The progress of society in civilization, more correct notions on the subject of moral obligation, and, above all, the benign influence of the Christian religion, have softened many of the rigors attendant on slavery among the ancients. But the rights of the slave, in respect to marriage and the acquisition of property by way of inheritance, remain substantially on the same ground.\u201d (Cunningham v. Cunningham, 1 Harris &amp; McHenry, 561; Bynum v. Bostick, 4 DeS., 266; Marbletown v. Kingston, 20 Johns., 1; 20 How., St. Tr., 27.) These authorities show very conclusively that the permitted cohabitation existing formerly among our slave population did not partake of lawful marriage. If we could say the legal rights of husband and wife, parent and child, spring from these connections, it must also be held that corresponding disabilities flow from them, many of which are of a severely penal character, affecting almost this entire portion of our population.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Whether the mutual and continued voluntary recognition since emancipation of a subsisting marriage, between the parties to such pre-existing permissive cohabitation during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>slavery, does not give to such connection the sanction of legal marriage, pfesents a very different question.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">It is said with much force by Ma\u00ed\u00edhws, J., in delivering the opinion of the court in the case of Girod v. Lewis, (6 Mart., 559,) \u201cIt is clear that slaves have no legal capacity to assent to any contract. With the consent of their masters they may marry, and their moral power to agree to such a contract Or connection as that of marriage cannot be doubted; but whilst in a state of slavery it cannot produce any civil effect, because slaves are deprived of all civil rights. Emancipation gives to the slave his civil rights; and a contract of marriage, legal and valid by the consent of the master and moral assent of the \u2022 slave, from the moment of freedom, although dormant during slavery, produces all the effects which result from such contract among free persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">This opinion certainly places the law on this subject in as favorable a light for appellant as can possibly be insisted upon. But it evidently falls far short of supporting the judgment of the county court in this case. For most certainly emancipation can have this effect only in such connections as are existing between slaves at the time it takes place. Indeed, the only ground upon which the decision can be maintained is, that the assent manifested by their continued cohabitation, after acquiring capacity to contract, gives validity to the existing relation, sanctioned by moral, though not by legal obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">If, however, the father of this minor was his legitimate parent, I think it would be an erroneous and unreasonable construction of the statute to suppose that this child could be taken from its mother against her consent, and apprenticed solely at' his will and pleasure. It was evidently, to my mind, the object and purpose of the law to give this authority to the parents or guardians of minor children subject to their control, and for whose care and nurture they were providing. Surely it is not to be supposed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>merely because the father, when discharging his duties as such, is regarded as the head of the family, may, after years of desertion and abandonment, during which he has left his wife to struggle unaided for their support, rob her, by means of this law, of the society of her children, and thus add to the injury already done her the severest blow which can be inflicted upon a woman, whatever may be her condition or sphere in life.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Although it was insisted for appellant that the county court had exclusive and final jurisdiction in respect to the apprenticing of minors, yet as no objection was made to the manner of proceeding in the court below, and the trial of the matter in that court <em>de novo, </em>and especially as the judgment of the court is correct upon either hypothesis, we have not deemed it necessary to inquire at this time whether the writ, of <em>certiorari </em>authorized by the constitution, especially in absence of any statute regulating it, is limited merely to the bringing of the record and proceedings of the inferior court to the district, for the correction of- such errors of law as may have been committed in the proceedings had in such court, or whether, under it, the whole matter may be brought before the district court for a trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">There being no error in the judgment of which appellant can complain, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
