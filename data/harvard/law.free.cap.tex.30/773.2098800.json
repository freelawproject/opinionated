Frederick J. Malone.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b789-11\">Where the judgment was by default, it is no ground for a new trial that the attorney spoken to by the defendant had failed to put in a defense, unless it also appear that the plaintiff had in some way caused this neglect of duty.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b789-12\">Error from X)e \"Witt. The case was tried before Hon. J. J. Holt, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b789-13\">The suit was upon a note for ninety beeves, on which were several credits, acknowledged in the petition, and also for a note of $300, coin, alleged to be given in consideration of one of the credits. The defendants having made default, there was a judgment by default and writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>inquiry; and before the execution of the writ the defendant made a showing that he had spoken to counsel to defend, and asked to set the default aside; but the jury proceeded and assessed the damages. The defendants moved for a new trial, and filed an affidavit of meritorious defense; but at last it was a statement that the verdict was for $40 too much. As the $300 was for coin, or \u201c the equivalent in paper currency,\u201d and the verdict on this was for only \u201c $300,\u201d it may have been for too little. The court refused the motion, and the defendants prosecuted error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b790-6\"><em>Samuel G. Lackey, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbB\">I. The motion of defendants to set aside the judgment by default should have prevailed in the court below. They showed a sufficient reason for not filing their answer before the judgment by default was taken against them, and also showed, under oath, that they had a meritorious defense, and that they were ready to proceed with the trial, their witnesses being present. They sought no delay. (Donnell v. Winters, 20 Tex., 797.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b790-7\">II. Upon the petition the verdict was excessive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b790-8\">m. The obligation sued upon, of date 12th June, 1866, is not such a written contract as ascertains the sum due, and that therefore it is not such an obligation as carries interest after maturity. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 3740; O. &amp; W. Dig., Art. 1026.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b790-9\">The obligation sued upon was a written promise by the defendants to deliver to the plaintiff ninety beeves. The value of the beeves is not fixed by the written instrument. Their value could be ascertained only by evidence <em>aliunde. </em>If the obligation sued upon carried interest at all, it is respectfully submitted that it could only carry interest after the 1st of January, 1867. But as it is not an \u201c open account,\u201d and as it is not such a written contract as ascertains the sum, it is believed that it carries no interest whatever. The statute allows interest only upon \u201c open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>accounts\u201d and upon written contracts ascertaining the sum due.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b791-4\">Ho brief for the defendant in error has been furnished to the <em>Reporter.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b791-6\">Morrill, C.
