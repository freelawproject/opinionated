If the facts are true as alleged, the defendant was clearly guilty of an assault and batteiy.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">A party who commits an assault and beats another certainly is guilty of a violation of law. The appellee has not appeared in this court. It has not been suggested in what respect the indictment is insufficient. If the act done is an assault in violation of law, it is not necessary to allege the intent with which the act was done to constitute an offense. The wrongful intent will be inferred from the illegal act which is done. The allegation of an intent is unnecessary to constitute an offense where the act alleged . to have been done is in violation of law. The judgment is reversed, and the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
