J. T. Slack.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b370-9\">An indictment must state a <em>time when </em>as well as a place where the offense was committed, otherwise the adverbs \u201c <em>then </em>and there\u201d have no antecedent time, and the objection is good on motion in arrest of judgment.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-10\">Appeal from Harrison. 1 The case was tried before Hon. M. D. Ector, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The appellee, a freedman, was indicted for stealing a mule, and the jury found him guilty, and assessed his punishment at twelve months\u2019 imprisonment in the penitentiary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-4\">The court sustained a general motion in arrest of judgment, and the State appealed. The indictment alleged no date on which the offense was committed. The \u201c then and there \u201d could therefore only have reference to the place, not the time, for there was none alleged.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-5\">\n<em>William M. Walton, Attorney General,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASv\">supposed that the objection must be the omission of the words \u201cwithout the consent of the owner,\u201d and argued to prove that they were immaterial, under article 765 of the Code. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 2409.) But as the case turned upon a wholly different point, his ai\u2019gument is unnecessary.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-6\">\u00a1No brief for the appellee has been furnished to the <em>Reporter.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b371-7\">Willie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auez\">Neither the time nor place of the commission of the offense charged against the defendant is alleged in this indictment. The words \u201cthen and there\u201d are used in the indictment, but not in connection with the averment of the stealing, taking, and carrying away of the property, the time and place of which should be alleged, in order to give jurisdiction to the' court and show that the offense was not barred by limitation. And even if these words were connected with that allegation, they would be wholly insufficient to charge the time at which the theft was committed, because there is no day previously stated in the indictment to which the word \u201cthen\u201d could be referred. \u201cThe words \u2018then and there,\u2019 as used in an indictment, are words of reference, and when time and place have once been named with certainty, it is sufficient to refer to them afterwards by these words, and it will have the same effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>as if the time and place were actually repeated.\u201d (The State v. Cotton, 4 Foster, New Hamp., 146.) But where time has not been previously stated in the indictment, the word \u201cthen\u201d is without meaning, and cannot have the effect of fixing the date when the offense was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Because of the above-stated defects in the indictment, there was no error in the judgment of the court below in sustaining the motion in arrest of judgment, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
