A. J. Daugherty.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b376-5\">Where an indictment omits a material word, although it be but a preposition or a helping verb, the court will not, from a knowledge of the language, supply the missing word, so as to supply the probable intention of the grand jury, but will sustain a judgment quashing the indictment.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-9\">Appeal from Kaufman. The case was tried before Hon. K,. W. Scott, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-10\">This was an indictment under the act of 28th May, 1864, \u201c to punish unlawful interference with private property or private rights.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-11\">.The defendant was indicted in the district court of Kaufman county, at the fall term, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-12\">The indictment charged that the defendant, \u201cA.

Huston, 12 Tex., 245, it was averred, that the defendant did play at a game with cards, upon which money was then and there het, a certain public house, &amp;e. The court said: \u201cA knowledge of the language of the statute enables us to perceive that the word \u201c at\u201d was omitted, no doubt by accident, after the word \u201c bet.\u201d It is said, that it is evident that some word has been casually omitted, but there is no authority to supply the omission. Here the the word omitted is essential to the certainty necessary in the description of the offense, and that it cannot be supplied by intendment, and of consequence the omission must be fatal to the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In the cause now under consideration the word \u201cdid\u201d is essential to the validity of the indictment. And it may be said in this, as in the case cited, that \u201c there is evidently an omission in the indictment\u201d which might be supplied by the insertion of a word. It is at the same time possible to supply the omission by averments, showing that no offense had been committed. The court can only pass upon questions that are presented for consideration. It cannot supply defects in ple\u00e1ding, by supposing to be inserted what it may be presumed the pleader intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">There is no error in the judgment, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
