(Paschal\u2019s Pig., Art. 2055, Rote 648.) It was proved that the defendants were the joint owners of a tippling-shop, and that a party rented from them an adjoining room, which was commonly used for gaming purposes. The proof tended to show that the room was under the same proprietorship and control as the tippling-shop.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-5\"><em>John P.

The indictment is good. The charge is that the defendants suffered and permitted card-playing, on which money was bet, in a room attached to and a part of the house in which they were retailing spirituous liquors. The proof on the trial established the truth of the charge, and we can see no reason to disturb the finding of the jury and the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
