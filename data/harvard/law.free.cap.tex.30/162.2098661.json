Reeves, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-13\">Atanacio Hotchkiss was indicted for an assault \u201cwith intent to kill and murder.\u201d He was arrested upon a <em>capias </em>and entered into bond, which described the offense as \u201cassault with intent to kill.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The defendant did not appear, and when the district attorney moved to forfeit the bond, Francisco Acosta, one of the sureties, moved to quash the bond, because it recited no offense knowrn to the law. The motion was sustained, and the bond quashed. The State appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-4\">Wm. <em>M.

The party was arrested, and executed bond. A motion in general terms was made to quash the bond. The motion was sustained, and the securities discharged. \u2022 The bond is in full compliance with the statute, containing every requisite of the law. (Paschal's Dig., Art. 2732.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-6\">The charge recited against the defendant, \u201c assault with intent- to kill,\u201d is sufficient to support the bond. That is an offense known to the law of the land, or, if not, it contains an offense that is known. (Hodges v. The State, 20 Tex., 493.) MSS. case at Galveston, Wilson v. The State, [29 Tex., 240,] cited in Paschal's Dig., Note 708, decides the same point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-8\">Those cases demand a reversal of this one.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-9\">Ho brief for the appellee has been furnished to the <em>Reporter.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b179-10\">Donley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABW\">The motion to quash the bond in this cause, because the defendant was not charged with any offense against the law, was improperly sustained. It was held in the case of Hodges v. The State, 20 Tex., 493, that \u201can assault with intent to kill is an offense for which the accused might be convicted of the assault, if not also of the intent to murder.\u201d The recognizance in that case was held legally sufficient, as also in Wilson v. The State, Galveston T., 1860, [25 Tex., 169.]</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">Eemahded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
