The cause, as appears, was tried, <em>ex parte, </em>in the district court. We had supposed, on reading the brief of the plaintiffs in error, that they had good cause of reversal, but as the record, as now presented, does not authorize us to discuss the questions raised, all we can do is to affirm the judgment, which is accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
