(Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 4631a.)</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-9\">Appeal from McLennan. The case was tried before Hon. Thomas Habbison, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-10\">On the 31st of October, 1861, J. W. \u00a1Nowlin executed his note to B. F. Faulkner, of which the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-11\">\u201c[\u00a7334 15.] Waco, <em>October </em>31,1860.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-12\">On or before the 1st day of March next, I promise to pay B.

Pay to W. W. Slauter, or bearer, this note, being in consideration of land sold to me out of the Q-oode tract, near Waco. B. F. Faulkneb.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The original suit was commenced on the 5th of October, 1861. There were various amendments, in which it was shown the note was given for land, and the vendor\u2019s lien was claimed. On the 10th of November, 1866, the defendant excepted to the plaintiff\u2019s petition, on the ground that as to the second endorser there was no diligence; and he also pleaded that the endorsement of Faulkner was made on the 15th of March, 1861; that the note was due and payable on 1st day of March, 1861, and that the term of the district court of McLennan county intervened between the 15th of March, 1861, and the date of filing the original petition; and that no good cause is shown why the suit was not instituted at said term of said .court. The law and the facts were submitted to the court, and he decided that the administrator of the maker and also the endorser were liable for the amount of the note. Judgment was rendered accordingly. The only question in the case was as to the liability of the endorser. The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-5\"><em>Norris </em>&amp; <em>McCall, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnqA\">argued that the statute for fixing the liability of endorsers (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 229) was not a statute of limitation within the meaning of the 6th section of the 11th ordinance of the convention of 1866. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 4631.) They relied on Sydnor v. Gascoigne, (11 Tex., 458.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-6\">No brief for appellee has been furnished to the <em>Reporter.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b514-7\">Caldwell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afa0\">There is but a single point involved in this suit, and that is whether article 229 of Paschal\u2019s Digest is a \u201c statute of limitation\u201d in the sense as used in ordidance 11, section 6, constitution of 1866. [Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 4631o.]</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">In Ryan v. Flint &amp; Chamberlin, decided at the present term of this court, <em>[ante </em>382,] we held that a similar statute was not. We there defined a \u201c statute of limitation,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>and as this article does not come within the rule, it cannot be so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">It follows, as suit was not commenced to the first term of the district court (or the second, with cause shown, &amp;c.) after the cause of action accrued, the endorser is not liable. A parol agreement to forbear suing is not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The judgment of the court below is reversed as to Mc-Clelland, administrator, and the cause</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
