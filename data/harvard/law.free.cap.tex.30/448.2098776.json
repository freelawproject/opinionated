The State.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b464-5\">Where, on a trial for rape, the defendant asked the court to instruct the jury that if the prisoner procured the consent of the party ravished by promises, the jury could not find him guilty.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b464-6\">The evidence being fluctuating, the instruction ought to have been given, although the court had charged in the language of the statute. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 2184.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b464-7\">Where witnesses stated positively that the girl ravished was over fourteen years old, and others were of the opinion that she was only ten, a new trial ought to have been granted. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 2189.).</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">Appeal from Bastrop. The case was tried before Hon. John Ireland, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-9\">Charles Clark, <em>alias </em>Steiner, a freedman, was indicted for a rape, for that, &amp;e., he did then and there, feloniously and violently, make an,assault on and upon one Ann Washington, a freed girl, and her, the said Ann Washington, violently and against her will, and therefore feloniously, did ravish and carnally know.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-10\">One witness swore to the evidences of violence, and that the girl violated was a child. Another swore to her statements of violence immediately after the act, and m her own examination the outraged girl swore to the force; that she tried to halloo, but the prisoner put his hand over her mouth. But on cross-examination she swore that she consented on a promise of some candy\". Three witnesses swore to the fact that she was over fourteen years of age. It was also proved that she stated to a witness that she consented, and by an expert that she was over fourteen years of age. The court instructed the jury, that if she consented; and was over fourteen years of age, they would find the defendant not guilty; if not, find him guilty. The jury found the defendant guilty, and he was sentenced to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment in the penitentiary. The defendant moved for an arrest of judgment and for a new trial, which motions were overruled, and he appealed. There was a bill of exceptions, which seems not to have been noticed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>A.

The evidence Was very conflicting with regard to consent on the part of the person on whom the alleged offense was committed. There is also conflicting testimony about her age: some of the witnesses placing it at ten, others at fourteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">It is in proof that the girl stated before the examining court, in her examination in chief, that she refused the solicitations of defendant, but upon cross-examination admitted that upon promises of reward submitted to his embraces. Upon trial in the district court, with equal simplicity, she denied having given her consent, and on cross-examination admitted that she had.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">It was also in proof, that the girl had admitted several days after the alleged offense that she had consented. Under these circumstances, we think the minds of the jury ought to have been more particularly directed to the gist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>of the offense. The charge asked by the defendant would have done this, and should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">We look in vain for any evidence to sustain the verdict, unless the jury concluded that the person upon whom the alleged offense' was perpetrated was under ten years of <em>age: </em>This they could not have done without a total disregard of the evidence, as none of the witnesses estimated her age \u201cunder ten.\u201d Judgment reversed, and new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
