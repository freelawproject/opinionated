The lower court, by using the measure of damages of $25.00 per day, exceeded the terms of the contract and accordingly, we reverse and remand for the imposition of a judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\">REVERSED AND REMANDED, with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">DONNER and LEVINE, JJ., Concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
