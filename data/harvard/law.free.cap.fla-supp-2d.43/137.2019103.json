When Appellee\u2019s violation of driving with a suspended license was dismissed, the Court then ordered Ms. Howell, a state supervisor, under penalty of contempt, to issue the license forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\">The State failed to take a timely appeal. This Court is only concerned with the contempt proceeding against Ms. Howell.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">It is well settled that a court does not have contempt powers to enforce a violation of its order if it is rendered without jurisdiction over the subject matter or the parties. <em>In re </em>Elrod, 455 So.2d 1325 (Fla. 4th DCA 1984); <em>Kaylor v </em>Kaylor; 466 So.2d 1253 (Fla. 2d DCA 1985); <em>Friedman v Friedman, </em>224 So.2d 424 (Fla. 3d DCA 1969). Ms. Howell was not a party in the original criminal proceeding. The trial court never obtained jurisdiction over Ms. Howell either personally or as an employee of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The County Court judge further had no subject matter jurisdiction. He was without authority to order the issuance of a driver\u2019s license. Pursuant to Section 322.31 Florida Statutes (1987), final orders and rulings of the department where any person is denied a license are only reviewable by Writ of Certiorari issued by the Circuit Court in the county wherein the person resides. The appellee sought the wrong remedy by filing a motion of contempt. <em>State Department of Highway Safety v Voght, </em>489 So.2d 1168 (Fla. 2d DCA 1986); <em>Mellon v Cannon, </em>482 SO.2d 604 (Fla. 5th DCA 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The trial court exceeded its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The order of contempt is hereby vacated and set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
