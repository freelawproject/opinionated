The court\u2019s denial was based on the evidence presented by the State on June 1, 1989. At that time Officer Samuelson of the Hialeah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Police Department testified that he had visited the scene of an accident, observed blood on the mirror of one of the cars and later matched that observation with evidence that the defendant had a consistent wound on his forehead. The investigator also smelled alcohol on the breath of the person identified to him as being the driver of the car and ordered pursuant to section 316.1932(l)(a) and (l)(c) a blood sample to be taken for purposes of determining the alcohol content of the defendant\u2019s blood. The result of the test showed a reading of .1 percent. Upon the trial judge\u2019s denial of the motion, the defendant pled no contest, reserving his appeal to appeal to this court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\">We distinguish this case from <em>Chait v State, </em>27 Fla. Supp.2d 115 (1988), cited by the defendant. Here there is evidence that the defendant was driving. This case also does not require as a predicate for testing the criteria of section 316.1933, Florida Statutes. That statute requires a finding that \u201ca motor vehicle driven by or in the actual physical control of a person under the influence of alcoholic beverages. . .\u201d No such requirement of causality is required by section 316.1932. Only probable cause that the defendant was driving and that the defendant was impaired need be shown. Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Davis and Cardonne, JJ., Concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
