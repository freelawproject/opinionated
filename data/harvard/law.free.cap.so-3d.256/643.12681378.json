In 1999, Eric Brown pled guilty to killing his girlfriend and their unborn child. This is his fifth motion for post-conviction relief. Brown contends that under\n   <em>\n    Sanders v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7065362\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/9/1132/#p1136\">\n    9 So.3d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1136 (\u00b6 16) (Miss. 2009), he should not have been allowed to plead guilty without an on-the-record competency hearing. He has raised this issue before, and we found Brown's claims time- and successive-writ barred because\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   does not apply retroactively.\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Ct. App. 2015). For the same reasons as before, we affirm the dismissal of this latest PCR motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   LEE, C.J., IRVING AND GRIFFIS, P.JJ., BARNES, CARLTON, WILSON, GREENLEE, WESTBROOKS AND TINDELL, JJ., CONCUR.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
