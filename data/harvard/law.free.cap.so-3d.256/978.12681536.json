Based on an anonymous tip that defendant was selling heroin, a detective approached defendant, immediately patted him down and advised him of his rights, and then asked him a series of questions, which ultimately lead to the seizure of the evidence defendant sought to suppress. The United States Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Florida v. J.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    529 U.S. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    146 L.Ed.2d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) that an anonymous tip lacking indicia of reliability does not justify a stop and frisk. In so holding, the United States Supreme Court found that the reasonable suspicion necessary to justify a stop and frisk pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968)\"requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality, not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person.\"\n   <em>\n    J.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    529 U.S. at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508406\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/266/\">\n    120 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1379 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although defendant ultimately consented to the search that revealed the contraband, that consent was not sufficiently attenuated from the illegal stop and frisk to constitute an independent and intervening act of free will. Therefore, the district court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, we reverse the district court's ruling that denied defendant's motion to suppress, and remand for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   GUIDRY, J., would deny.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
