Gunn III filed suits to confirm title to their waterfront properties in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. The State of Mississippi (the \"State\"), the County of Jackson (the \"County\") and the City of Ocean Springs (the \"City\") asserted title to a portion of the same waterfront properties claimed by the landowners: a strip of sand beach located south of a road and a seawall. After a full trial on the merits, the chancellor found that the State of Mississippi held title to the sand beach in front of the Harris and Gunn properties as public-trust tidelands.

On remand, a five-day trial was held. On June 3, 2016, the chancellor issued an opinion letter to counsel, detailing his findings of fact and conclusions of law. The chancellor also entered final judgments in both cases. The final judgments confirmed title to Harris and Gunn to their properties up to the southern edge or toe of the seawall, except for easements awarded to the County where the seawall was located and to the City where the roadway was located. The judgments also confirmed that the sand beach located south of the seawall was public-trust tidelands owned by the State. As to the injunction granted by the Hinds County Chancery Court, the judgments directed the parties to provide the Hinds County Chancery Court copies of the judgments to resolve the injunction. Last, the final judgments recognized that the County and City had met their burdens of proof on their claims of ownership to the sand beach through prescriptive easements and adverse possession.

Harris and Gunn argue that the boundary line drawn by the Secretary of State, pursuant to the Public Trust Tidelands Act, governs. It is undisputed that the Secretary of State drew this line seaward of East Beach in the waters of the Mississippi Sound. Harris and Gunn support their argument by citing their deeds, which describe their property as reaching \"to the water's edge.\" The State, County and City respond that the line drawn by the Secretary of State is not determinative of the boundary of the tidelands. Instead, they argue that the line functions as a starting point to determine the boundary of the tidelands and does not control because they claim that the County constructed East Beach. Thus, the State, County and City argue that the artificial beach is tidelands, held in trust by the State.

The Application of Tidelands Law to the Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 21. The Secretary of State's final boundary map reflects the intent of the Legislature by applying common-law principles to the boundary of the tidelands. It is determinative of the boundary of the tidelands. In December 1994, the Secretary of State finalized the Ocean Springs Quadrangle of the map. The map includes a solid line drawn along the coast, seaward of East Beach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 22. To be clear, the 1994 map is the culmination and expression of the Legislature's intent to determine the boundary of public-trust tidelands through the Tidelands Act. While the Tidelands Act required the July 1, 1973, determinable high-water line to be used as a starting point to determine the tidelands boundary, the 1994 map finalized the boundary of the tidelands. In other words, the 1994 map is the finalized expression of the boundary of the tidelands. The Secretary of State is bound to the map that he has drawn. Under the common law, the 1994 map is only the starting point now in the sense that the Court must determine what if any effect accretion and reliction has had on the boundary of tidelands subsequent to the 1994 map's finalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 23. Here, though, the 1994 map's legend reflects\n   <em>\n    Gilich\n   </em>\n   's holding that artificially created tidelands do not accrete to the upward landowner. The legend provides that the solid line \"[d]enotes approximate location of mean high water in areas where the current location of said line (or the toe of the seawall in areas where beach renourishments has occurred) is the boundary of public trust lands.\" As this Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Wiesenberg\n   </em>\n   , an \"integral cog\" of the Tidelands Act was \"the amount of discretion which the Secretary of State was granted in finalizing the map.\" The map's legend is the result of this discretion-the Secretary of State's application of the common law to the boundary line of the tidelands. This Court has repeatedly held that the July 1, 1973 \"starting point is subject to state common law regarding tidelands, submerged lands, and riparian and littoral lands.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874113\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/163/263/#p265\">\n    163 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   273 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wiesenberg\n   </em>\n   , 633 So.2d at 986 ;\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9447451\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/815/1157/#p1161\">\n    815 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1162 ). Likewise, the 1994 map is now the starting\n   point subject to state common law regarding tidelands, submerged lands and riparian and littoral lands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 24. The chancellor understood the controlling tidelands law and limited his opinion to whether or not East Beach was a natural beach or a man-made beach. The chancellor wrote, \"the first line of inquiry must be to ascertain whether the disputed strip of sand is natural or man made. The resolution of the natural versus man-made question will substantially control the outcome of this matter.\" We agree. The dispositive issue is whether or not East Beach was a natural beach or whether it was an artificial beach created along a shoreline without any prior natural beach. Given the legend on the 1994 map, East Beach is public-trust tidelands because the chancellor found that East Beach was artificial and that there had not been any natural beach along the prior shoreline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 25. At trial, the dispositive issue was whether or not East Beach was originally a natural beach or man-made beach. The chancellor determined that the beach was man-made. On appeal (after the resolution of Issue I), the question becomes whether the chancellor's judgment is manifestly wrong or unsupported by credible evidence. Harris raises several alleged errors on the part of the chancellor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Confirmation of Title\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 26. Harris first argues that the chancellor manifestly erred by failing to confirm title. He contends that the chancellor failed to make \"any specific findings regarding the location of the southern boundary of the Harris and Gunn property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 27. This argument-which the chancellor addressed in his denial of reconsideration-ignores the plain language of the chancellor's final orders. The chancellor's description confirmed the southern boundary of the Harris property:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   ... thence run South along the property formerly of Striegel a distance of 925 feet, more or less, to a concrete monument which monument is 120 feet West of the point of beginning, thence continue South 87 feet, more or less to the toe/south face of the current seawall, thence run East 120 feet along the toe/south face of the current seawall ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The description also described an easement in favor of the County \"where the current seawall is now located\" and an easement in favor the City \"where the current East Beach roadway is now located.\" Likewise, the chancellor described Gunn's southern boundary:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   ... run thence South along the West line of the property of Striegel and along a line parallel to and 222 feet East of the East line of said Ashley Place Subdivision a distance of 1,015 feet, more or less, to a point on the North face of the seawall, continue thence South to the tow of the seawall, run thence West along the toe of the seawall 222 feet, more or less, to a point South of the Point of Beginning.... Said property being bounded ... South by the toe of the seawall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Gunn description also awarded prescriptive easements in favor of the County \"where the seawall is located\" and a prescriptive easement to the City \"where the East Beach roadway is located.\" Harris's argument that the chancellor erred by not confirming title is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Witness Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 28. Next, Harris raises a number of issues that he maintains are manifest error in the chancellor's assessment of witness testimony. \"This Court will not reverse a Chancery Court's findings of fact\n   where they are supported by substantial credible evidence in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Mullins v. Ratcliff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7583078\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/515/1183/#p1189\">\n    515 So.2d 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1189 (Miss. 1987). \"Where there is conflicting testimony, the chancellor, as the trier of fact, is the judge of 'the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of their testimony, as well as the interpretation of evidence where it is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sproles v. Sproles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11111568\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/782/742/#p747\">\n    782 So.2d 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 747 (Miss. 2001) (quoting\n   <em>\n    McKee v. Flynt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7456061\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/630/44/#p47\">\n    630 So.2d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47 (Miss. 1993) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 29. After review of the chancellor's judgments, opinion and the record, we find no error-and certainly no manifest error. Ample evidence in the record supports each of the chancellor's final judgments in this matter. Many of Harris's alleged errors on appeal are simply disagreements with the factual determinations made by the chancellor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Eyewitnesses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 30. Harris contends that the chancellor manifestly erred concerning two eyewitnesses: Joan Salvant and Larry Corban. Harris maintains that the chancellor erred in relying on Salvant's testimony, since she admitted that she was not familiar with the location of the boundary lines of the Harris and Gunn properties. Regarding Corban, Harris argues that the chancellor manifestly erred in finding that Harris and Gunn had not produced any eyewitnesses of the East Beach area during the relevant time frame. Harris contends that Corban provided eyewitness testimony about the East Beach area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Joan Salvant\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 31. Salvant's recorded deposition testimony was entered at trial by the State. Salvant testified that she spent every summer in the 1930s, the 1940s and into the 1950s at her family's property on the shoreline that is now referred to as East Beach. Salvant explained that Week's Bayou was at the western end of the shoreline; her family's property was further east; and the Marine Research Lab area was the furthest east at the end of the shoreline. Further, Salvant testified with familiarity to the whole coastline and had personally observed both low and high tides along the coast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 32. Relevant to the Harris and Gunn properties, Salvant testified that prior to the late 1940s no dry sand-from Week's Bayou east to the Marine Research Lab-would have been left uncovered at high tide. On the east end of the shoreline, Salvant recalled that the water nearly came up to the road with just enough room for her father to pull two wheels of their family car off the road to park. Also, Salvant maintained that the current sand at the beach along the shoreline was pumped up from the sound after World War II. She maintained that this happened two different times during two different years. In 2004 for her fiftieth wedding anniversary, Salvant again visited East Beach. She observed East Beach from Week's Bayou to the Marine Research Lab. Salvant testified that the current East Beach was not there prior to the end of World War II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 33. Harris now argues that the chancellor erred in relying on Salvant's testimony because Salvant had admitted she did not know the locations of the Harris and Gunn properties. Also, Harris highlights the fact that Salvant did not know whether the sand that was pumped up\n   from the sound was pumped up in front of the Harris or Gunn properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 34. The chancellor, however, did not abuse his discretion by relying on Salvant's testimony. Salvant testified that no dry sand was present at high tide the length of the shoreline from Week's Bayou (undisputedly west of the Harris and Gunn properties) to the point of the shoreline where the Marine Research Lab was built (undisputedly east of the Harris and Gunn properties). She also testified that sand was pumped from the sound along this same section of shoreline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 35. Further, substantial evidence corroborated Salvant's testimony. Jane Beaugez, an Ocean Springs resident since the late 1940s, testified to the changes in the shoreline throughout the years. Beaugez was familiar with the location of the Harris and Gunn properties and testified that from her earliest memory no uncovered sand was visible at high tide in front of either property. She further testified that the high tide came up to the seawall before the beach was built and that government workers built the beach by pumping in and trucking in sand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 36. Expert testimony also corroborated Salvant's account of the shoreline. The State's expert, Dr. Claus Meyer-Arendt (discussed below) concluded that East Beach along the shoreline was artificial. He also concluded that the current seawall was placed seaward of the former mean high-tide line-in the tidelands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 37. Much of the material that Meyer-Arendt relied on to form his conclusions was entered into evidence and corroborates Salvant's testimony. This evidence included newspaper articles and various documents concerning the construction of East Beach and its seawall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 38. Also, a composite of newspaper clippings referencing the construction of the seawall and East Beach lent credence to Salvant's testimony. One article, dated August 4, 1949, states, \"Plans call for a sea wall similar to the sea wall at West Beach. The county dredge will place sand up against the wall forming a nice bathing beach beyond the wall.\" Another article, dated May 26, 1951, states, \"The Ocean Springs seawall will be extended approximately one-half mile from its present terminus to Halstead road, a sand beach pumped in along the length of the wall and a new 40-foot roadway constructed behind it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 39. Correspondence between the Jackson County Board of Supervisors and the United States Army Corp of Engineers also supports portions of Salvant's account. According to Meyer-Arendt, the Jackson County Board of Supervisors, in their request for permission to build a beach, attached a map depicting that \"the beach would be built to a width of 200 feet along the entire length of the East Beach.\" The response letter from the United States Army Corp of Engineers, dated January 25, 1954, states, \"you are hereby authorized by the Secretary of the Army to construct a sand beach 200 to 300 feet wide by 11,700 feet long, in [the] Mississippi Sound, fronting Ocean Springs, Mississippi.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 40. Also supporting portions of Salvant's testimony, a number of the minutes from various meetings of the Jackson County Board of Supervisors concerning\n   the construction of the seawall were admitted in evidence. The proposal for the seawall was presented at a July 19, 1949, meeting, and the specifications for the wall were explained to potential bidders in 1950.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 41. In light of the evidence, the chancellor did not manifestly err in relying on Salvant's recollection. Despite the fact that Salvant was not familiar with the boundary line of the Harris and Gunn properties or the specific locations of the properties, she clearly testified about the entire length of the shoreline from Week's Bayou to the Marine Research Lab. Further, other evidence corroborates her account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Larry Corban\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 42. Corban's testimony from a previous proceeding was introduced; he testified that he first saw the East Beach area in 1946 or 1947. Corban testified that as far as he could recall no substantial change in the waterfront on East Beach had occurred in his lifetime. Also, Corban testified that \"It's my understanding that Jackson County built a seawall and road while I was in college, would have been in about 1950.\" Last, Corban testified that no substantial change had occurred to the properties from his first recollection in 1947 to the depiction of the properties in a 1992 aerial photograph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 43. Harris argues that the chancellor erred in finding that Harris and Gunn did not offer eyewitness testimony about the East Beach area. The actual issue here is that Harris does not agree with the chancellor's assessment of the weight and credibility of Corban's testimony. It is well settled law that \"the chancellor, as the trier of fact, is the judge of 'the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of their testimony ....' \"\n   <em>\n    Sproles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11111568\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/782/742/#p747\">\n    782 So.2d at 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    McKee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7456061\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/630/44/#p47\">\n    630 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   47 ). Two out of three of Corban's answers on direct examination were not definite: \"Not that I recall\" and \"It's my understanding ... while I was in college....\" Corban admitted that he was in college during the critical time period in the early 1950s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 44. Also, it is clear that the chancellor did consider Corban's testimony. In the final opinion letter sent to counsel, the chancellor mentioned that he considered\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the contrary evidence in coming to his conclusions: \"There is contrary evidence, as noted above and as otherwise reflected in the record, all of which the court has considered. However, when the evidence supporting the claim of a natural beach is weighed against that supporting a man made beach the former position is, at best, weak.\" We find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Expert Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 45. Harris claims two specific errors concerning the expert testimony admitted at trial. First, Harris argues that the chancellor blatantly disregarded the testimony of Donald Rowe who testified about his survey of the current mean high-water line. Second, Harris argues that consideration of the full expert report of Meyer-Arendt demonstrates that the mean high-water line has always been in the same location (and, therefore, East Beach is a natural beach). Neither argument has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Donald Rowe\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 46. At trial, Rowe testified to his survey of the current mean high-water line on February 22, 2012, for the Harris and Gunn properties. On that day, the mean high-water line for the Harris property ranged from 114 feet to 117 feet from the seawall. For the Gunn property, the range was from 137 feet to 145 feet from the seawall to the mean high-water line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 47. Rowe's testimony, though, was not relevant to the dispositive legal issue at trial of whether or not the beach was\n   natural or man-made. The fact that the mean high-water line was seaward of the current East Beach was an uncontested issue at trial. The contested issue at trial was whether or not East Beach was natural (and not tidelands) or man-made (and, therefore, tidelands). Thus, the chancellor did not manifestly err here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Dr. Claus Meyer-Arendt\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 48. Next, Harris argues that the chancellor erred by not considering Meyer-Arendt's testimony that his 1992 report concluded that a sand beach had existed along the shoreline in 1950. According to Harris, this fact, combined with Rowe's survey, demonstrates that East Beach was a natural beach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 49. Nothing in Meyer-Arendt's report, though, conflicts with the chancellor's conclusion that East Beach was man-made. Indeed, the 1992 report supports the position: \"Apparently some sand was placed on East Beach prior to the onset of seawall construction in 1949 ..., the modern beach was not completed until a second phase of nourishment in 1954 ....\" The report also states, \"The 1950 coastal chart ... reflected the initial disposal of dredge spoil at both Front and East Beaches, where the shoreline had been displaced about 200 ft (60 m) seaward along most of Front Beach and about half of that along East Beach (see figure 2).\" Also, as already mentioned, Salvant testified that sand was pumped in to create East Beach in two separate years. The chancellor did not manifestly err in his consideration of the expert report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Invasion of Property Rights\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 50. Last, Harris argues that the chancellor manifestly erred by failing to acknowledge that any action by Jackson County in creating East Beach was an invasion of private property rights, constituting a taking without just compensation under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. To support his argument, Harris again cites the testimony of Rowe and Meyer-Arendt, arguing that their testimony (discussed above) supports the claim that Jackson County pumped sand onto the Harris and Gunn properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 51. Harris's argument requires this Court to accept his interpretation of the evidence rather than the chancellor's findings. Harris maintains that Jackson County violated his property rights by pumping in sand on the East Beach shoreline because the 1954 letter from the United States Army Corp of Engineers conveyed no property rights to the Jackson County Board of Supervisors. Harris ignores, though, the earlier statement in the letter that the Board of Supervisors was authorized to create a sand beach \"in [the] Mississippi Sound.\" In denying reconsideration, the chancellor stated, \"Thus, because the evidence establishes that [the] beach was constructed in State-owned tidelands, the construction of the beach did not invade the property rights of the Plaintiffs.\" After review, we find no error here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 52. The chancellor correctly determined that the question of whether or not East Beach was natural or artificial controlled the legal dispute as to the boundary of the tidelands. With this legal framework established, the chancellor determined that no natural beach existed on the shoreline prior to the construction of East Beach. Ample evidence in the record supports this determination. Therefore, we affirm the chancellor's final judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 53.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   WALLER, C.J., KITCHENS, P.J., KING, COLEMAN, MAXWELL, BEAM AND ISHEE, JJ., CONCUR.
