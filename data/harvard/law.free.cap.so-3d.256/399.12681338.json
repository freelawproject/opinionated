For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Stacey Lockwood and Robert Lockwood were married on January 9, 1995. Two children were born of this marriage. The parties were divorced on June 26, 2013. By judgment dated June 23, 2013, the community property regime existing between Ms. Lockwood and Mr. Lockwood was terminated retroactive to May 24, 2012. On June 13, 2014, Ms. Lockwood filed a petition to partition the community property, and sworn descriptive lists were filed by both spouses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial on the partition of community property was conducted on July 7, 2016. At the conclusion of the proceedings, the trial court took the matter under advisement. On April 3, 2017, the trial court issued a written judgment, which valued and granted ownership of certain assets and liabilities to each party, denied numerous reimbursement claims, determined contempt and sanction issues, and ordered Mr. Lockwood to make an equalizing payment to Ms. Lockwood. Ms. Lockwood appeals from various aspects of the judgment partitioning the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A court of appeal may not set aside a trial court's finding of fact in the absence of manifest error or unless it is clearly wrong.\n   <em>\n    Snider v.

The court shall consider the nature and source of the asset or liability, the economic condition of each spouse, and any other circumstances that the court deems relevant. As between the spouses, the allocation of a liability to a spouse obligates that spouse to extinguish that liability. The allocation in no way affects the rights of creditors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (d) In the event that the allocation of assets and liabilities results in an unequal net distribution, the court shall order the payment of an equalizing sum of money, either cash or deferred, secured or unsecured, upon such terms and conditions as the court shall direct.

She argues that her initial investment of $14,110.09 is easily traceable as her separate property. Ms. Lockwood claims that an additional monetary value would also be discernable from the community property if a steady fixed interest rate of five percent (5%) over 18 years of marriage is applied. She therefore argues that her total separate property in her 401K plan would be $33,957.61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its written reasons, the trial court only allocated Mr. Lockwood \"one-half of the community interest in the 401K Plan pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, to be prepared by counsel for Stacey M. Lockwood in a form, and with such terms and conditions as are acceptable to the Administrator of the Plan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon review of the record, we find that the judgment regarding Ms. Lockwood's 401K plan is interlocutory and thus, pretermit any discussion on this issue. La. R.S. 9:2801 B provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Those provisions of a domestic relations order or other judgment which partitions retirement or other deferred work benefits between former spouses\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall be considered interlocutory until the domestic relations order has been granted \"qualified\" status from the plan administrator and/or until the judgment has been approved by the appropriate federal or state authority as being in compliance with applicable laws.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Amendments to this interlocutory judgment to conform to the provisions of the plan shall be made with the consent of the parties or following a contradictory hearing by the court which granted the interlocutory judgment. The court issuing the domestic relations order or judgment shall maintain continuing\n   jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties until final resolution. (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The record does not establish that the Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) has been granted \"qualified\" status from the plan administrator or that the judgment has been approved by the appropriate federal or state authority as required. Therefore, the trial court's ruling ordering a QDRO for the 401K plan is not yet appealable. We therefore pretermit discussion of any issues concerning the parties' interest in the 401K plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Rental Reimbursement\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ms. Lockwood contends that the trial court erred in finding that she is not entitled to rental reimbursement for Mr. Lockwood's use and occupancy of the former community home located at 2011 Ormond Boulevard in Destrehan. She contends that the trial court: (1) evicted Mr. Lockwood from the community home; (2) ordered that Mr. Lockwood was responsible for the mortgage payments and various other payments for his use and occupancy; and (3) ordered that Ms. Lockwood was entitled to rental reimbursement in the event that Mr. Lockwood did not make the required payments on the community home. Ms. Lockwood argues that the trial court erred in finding that she was not entitled to rental reimbursement in accordance with La.

(Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It is undisputed that Ms. Lockwood willingly and voluntarily left the former family home with the two minor children. There is no showing in the record that she subsequently demanded and was refused occupancy of the family home so as to entitle her to rent. The record does not indicate that Ms. Lockwood was prevented for any reason from seeking to have a fair rental value set during the time Mr. Lockwood occupied the family home, or that the parties agreed to defer a determination thereof. Moreover, Ms. Lockwood did not appeal the January 7, 2013 consent judgment allegedly awarding Mr. Lockwood use and occupancy of the family home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We further find that La. R.S. 9:374 C, as argued by Ms. Lockwood, is inapplicable under the circumstances of this case. La. R.S. 9:374 C is applicable only if a spouse occupies the residence \"in accordance with the provisions of Subsection A or B [.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   La. R.S. 9:374 A is not applicable in this case because the family home was not alleged to be the separate property of either spouse. La. R.S. 9:374 B deals with when the family home is community property or owned by the spouses in indivision, as is the situation here. However, subsection B only applies when either spouse petitioned for and the court awarded use and occupancy after a contradictory hearing. In the instant case, neither spouse petitioned for, nor did the court award use and occupancy, after a contradictory hearing. La. R.S. 9:374 C is only applicable where subsection A or B has been applied or where the trial court awards use and occupancy. In this case, the trial court did not award use and occupancy to Mr. Lockwood and neither party petitioned for use and occupancy as required by subsection B. We therefore find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ms. Lockwood's claim for rental reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Loss of value of family home\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ms. Lockwood contends that the trial court erred in finding that Mr. Lockwood was not responsible for the \"deplorable condition\" of the family home at the time of the sale in September 2013. She argues that when the family home was sold in September 2013, the condition of the home was \"significantly less\" than when she left it in February 2012. She further contends that the trial court was manifestly erroneous for excluding evidence that after they sold the family home in September 2013, the new owner subsequently resold the family home a few months later for an increased price of $140,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At trial, in support of her claim for loss of value of the family home, Ms. Lockwood's counsel attempted to submit into evidence a document purporting to show what the property was resold for by the new owner. Mr. Lockwood's counsel objected to the document based on relevance. After a discussion with counsel, the trial court found the document inadmissible. The trial transcript reveals that Ms. Lockwood's counsel did not object to the trial court's ruling, nor did counsel request to proffer the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Relevant evidence is evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.

In the absence of a contemporaneous objection and a proffer of the evidence, Ms. Lockwood cannot now complain that such exclusion was error. Therefore, we decline to review this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Honda Pilot\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ms. Lockwood contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the parties did not enter into a binding compromise that resulted in the transfer of ownership of the Honda Pilot from Ms. Lockwood to Mr. Lockwood. She argues that although she was originally granted exclusive use of the Honda Pilot, she entered into a compromise with Mr. Lockwood in open court wherein he agreed that he would pick up the vehicle although he was aware that it was no longer functional. Thus, she contends that the trial court erred in allocating the Honda Pilot to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At trial, Ms. Lockwood testified that when she originally left with the children, she took the Honda Pilot. The trial court subsequently granted her possession of the Honda Pilot, but as of the date of the trial, she did not know its location. She testified that the Honda Pilot was towed from her apartment complex because it was not running. Ms. Lockwood testified that although Mr. Lockwood agreed to take possession of the Honda Pilot, he never retrieved the car. The trial court found that no evidence was presented to show that there was a transfer in the ownership of the Honda Pilot, and Ms. Lockwood admitted that no transfer of the title for the Honda Pilot occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On review of the record, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the parties did not enter into a compromise regarding the Honda Pilot and in allocating Ms. Lockwood ownership of the Honda Pilot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Corvette and Corvette towing and storage fees\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Ms. Lockwood contends that the trial court erred in allocating to her full ownership of the Corvette. She also argues that the trial court erred in making her financially responsible for the towing and storage fees for the Corvette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In its written reasons for judgment awarding Ms. Lockwood full ownership of the Corvette and making her financially responsible for the towing and storage fees, the trial court made the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The undisputed evidence shows that Mr. Lockwood violated the court's order (awarding use and occupancy of the family home to Ms. Lockwood) by going to the family home without permission or authority. While a civil violation, Mr. Lockwood, somehow, was arrested for simple burglary of his own home and spent approximately five months in jail and four weeks at a state mental institution due to competency issues. Ms. Lockwood testified that while Mr. Lockwood was incarcerated, she was concerned that her credit would be ruined if the Corvette was repossessed. Therefore, she admits that she hired Jake's Towing to tow the vehicle from the family home, and that she transferred title to the Corvette without Mr. Lockwood's knowledge, permission or signature, even though the title was in both of their names. Ms. Lockwood's actions were in violation of the restraining orders against alienating or encumbering community property and were not in the community's best interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Ms. Lockwood claims that the towing and storage fees incurred post-termination of the community are community property so that each party is responsible for half of this debt. $24,138.16 / 2 =$12,069.08 each. The court disagrees. La. Civil Code art. 2360 provides that if an obligation is incurred for the common interest of the spouses or for the interest of the other spouse, it is a community obligation. Article 2363 defines a separate obligation as an obligation resulting from an intentional wrong. The court finds that this obligation resulted from an intentional wrong and was not incurred to benefit the community or Mr. Lockwood. In addition, this debt was incurred post-termination of the community. Therefore, the court finds that the towing and storage charge are Ms. Lockwood's separate obligation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We do not find that the trial court was manifestly erroneous in finding that Ms. Lockwood violated the trial court's restraining orders on encumbering and alienating community property. The record establishes that Ms. Lockwood alienated community property, the Corvette, when she sold \"her one-half interest,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   transferred title to the Corvette to Jake's Towing, and encumbered the Corvette with a substantial towing and storage fee in violation of the trial court's restraining orders forbidding encumbering and alienating community property. Ms. Lockwood contends that she acted in good faith and in the best interest of the community to prevent the car from being repossessed and to save her and Mr. Lockwood's credit. However, the transcript reveals that Ms. Lockwood's actions were not for the benefit of the community as shown by her testimony as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The main purpose for me was to get my name off of the car....That car was in my name. I just wanted my name off. Could never get my name off. I saw a way to get my name off and save my credit at the same time. Jake's paid the car off. And here we are.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Ms. Lockwood clearly did not act on behalf of the community when she sold \"her one-half interest,\" transferred title to the Corvette to Jake's Towing, and encumbered the Corvette with a substantial towing and storage fee which encumbered and alienated community property. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allocating the ownership of the Corvette and the related towing and storage fees to Ms. Lockwood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the above stated reasons, we affirm the trial court's April 3, 2017 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Ms. Lockwood's right to her initial investment and interest thereon as to her separate property in the 401K plan is not precluded by the language of the judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The January 7, 2013 consent judgment does not award Mr. Lockwood use and occupancy of the community home.
