The FWC also appeals the denial of its motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We reverse the order in its entirety, dissolve the injunction, and remand for entry of final summary judgment in favor of the FWC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Blackwater Wildlife Management Area (Blackwater WMA) is located in the Blackwater State Forest and is composed of more than 200,000 acres of public land in Okaloosa and Santa Rosa counties. Interspersed within the Blackwater WMA are a number of private parcels of land, or inholdings, that abut or are completely surrounded by public lands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over the years, the State acquired more and more land within the Blackwater State Forest, resulting in an increasing number of inholdings - including properties owned or leased by Appellees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 375.041, Fla. Stat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The FWC regulates hunting on public lands in Florida, including the Blackwater WMA. The FWC determines the types of hunting that will be permitted, authorizes specific areas for hunting, schedules hunting seasons for different types of game, and issues hunting licenses and permits. The hunting at issue in this case, deer dog hunting, has been authorized in the Blackwater WMA since at least the 1950's. During the deer dog hunting season, hunters use dogs trained to flush deer out of thickets in the forest or dogs trained to follow deer trails through the forest. While in pursuit of deer, the dogs and hunters occasionally leave the public lands where the FWC has authorized hunting and trespass onto private property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On multiple occasions, deer hunters and their dogs trespassed onto Appellees' private property; Appellees repeatedly complained to the FWC about these trespasses. Appellees also reported a number of criminal acts allegedly committed by the hunters including trespasses, threats to destroy Appellees' property, threats to Appellees' personal safety, several arson fires, and graffiti painted on Appellees' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response to Appellees' complaints, the FWC took several actions to curtail the trespasses onto Appellees' property. The FWC limited the length of the deer dog hunting season to forty-four days per year, restricted the geographic area in which deer dog hunting was authorized within the Blackwater WMA, and installed fencing to separate the public lands from Appellees' private property. The FWC also adopted a responsible hunter rule, which authorized game wardens to respond to calls from private property owners when trespassing deer dog hunters or their dogs enter private property. And most recently, in 2016, the FWC required, as a condition of issuing licenses and permits for deer dog hunting, that hunters equip their dogs with corrective collars that allow the hunters to control the movements of their dogs by shocking remotely any dog that trespasses onto private property. Despite these efforts by the FWC, trespasses continued to occur. Appellees argue that the FWC is responsible for the trespasses, as it licenses and permits deer dog hunting in the Blackwater WMA and regulates hunting by rule, and they assert that the FWC must prevent further trespasses by hunters and their dogs onto Appellees' private property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2016, Appellees filed a two-count complaint seeking to prevent the FWC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   from issuing deer dog hunting licenses and permits in the Blackwater WMA. They alleged that the FWC's decision to allow deer dog hunting on state-owned land directly led to the trespasses on their privately-owned land by hunters and their dogs. Appellees contended that these trespasses were so serious that they rose to the level of an inverse condemnation because Appellees were deprived of their right to exclude people from their private property (\"takings claim\"). Appellees further contended that the trespasses constituted a nuisance because the trespasses deprived Appellees of their right to the quiet enjoyment of their property. To support this contention, Appellees complained that the trespassing dogs were disruptive and potentially dangerous to livestock; it was unsafe for Appellees to go into their yards during deer dog season; fences did not stop the trespasses; and the trespasses prevented Appellees from hunting on their own property (\"nuisance claims\"). Appellees also sought an injunction requiring the FWC to abate the nuisance of the trespasses by hunters and their dogs onto their private property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The FWC moved for summary judgment on the takings claims and nuisance claims. The FWC argued that because Appellees failed to plead the required elements of a takings claim, no constitutional claims had been stated against the FWC and its sovereign immunity had not been waived. The FWC argued that the doctrines of separation of powers and sovereign immunity barred the nuisance claims because the FWC owed no duty to Appellees to prevent trespasses on their property and because the FWC's decision to authorize deer dog hunting in the Blackwater WMA was a discretionary decision, not subject to challenge in the courts. Finally, with regard to Appellees' request for an injunction, the FWC contended that the injunction was overbroad and impossible to comply with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Appellees' request for an injunction and the FWC's motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied the summary judgment motion, rejecting the FWC's sovereign immunity arguments as a matter of law. With regard to Appellees' request for an injunction, Appellees conceded that the court could not order the FWC to stop issuing deer dog hunting licenses and permits or to redraw the map of the areas where deer dog hunting was authorized. However, Appellees argued that the court could enter an injunction ordering the FWC to stop further trespasses onto Appellees' property by the hunters and their dogs and that the FWC could take whatever steps it deemed necessary to achieve that goal. The court entered the injunction, ordering the FWC \"to abate the nuisance of the deer hunting dogs from trespassing onto the property of the plaintiffs, and of the deer dogs and their hunters from interfering with the plaintiffs' right to the quiet enjoyment of their private property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The FWC appealed, and the trial court's order was automatically stayed, preventing the injunction from going into effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. App. P. 9.310(b)(2). Appellees moved to vacate the automatic stay of the injunction in an effort to prevent trespasses by hunters and their dogs onto Appellees' property during the 2017-2018 hunting season. During the hearing on the motion to vacate the automatic stay, Appellees testified to trespasses on their property during the 2016 hunting season - testimony identical in character to that offered during the hearing on the original injunction. The trial court entered an order vacating the automatic stay, and while acknowledging that \"it would be overreaching for the Court to direct the FWC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   not to physically release the licenses and permits for the upcoming hunting season,\" the court nonetheless concluded that the \"FWC is on notice its actions in issuing licenses and permits constitute a nuisance and contribute to the interference with the plaintiffs' right to the quiet enjoyment of their private property, and there is no other way to protect those constitutional rights at this juncture than to vacate the stay.\" This Court reinstated the automatic stay by order issued October 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    III. Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We agree with the FWC that the order on appeal should be reversed for three reasons. First, the FWC was entitled to summary judgment on Appellees' takings claims on sovereign immunity grounds because Appellees did not plead the required elements to allege valid constitutional claims. Second, the FWC was entitled to summary judgment on the nuisance claims on sovereign immunity grounds because the FWC owed no duty to Appellees and because the authorization of deer dog hunting in the Blackwater WMA was a discretionary function of the FWC. Third, the trial court erred in entering the injunction because the injunction violated the separation of powers doctrine and was overly broad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    A. Sovereign Immunity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sovereign immunity \"protects the state from burdensome interference from the performance of its governmental functions and preserves its control over state funds, property and instrumentalities.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v. State, Dep't of Corr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7612650\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/460/452/#p461\">\n    460 So.2d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461 (Fla. 1st DCA 1984) (citation omitted). \"In Florida, sovereign immunity is the rule rather than the exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Pan-Am Tobacco Corp. v. Dep't of Corr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7595970\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/471/4/#p5\">\n    471 So.2d 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5 (Fla. 1984). There are two general exceptions to this doctrine. First, sovereign immunity will not bar a claim against the State based on violations of the state or federal constitution.\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Revenue v. Kuhnlein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7460334\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/646/717/#p721\">\n    646 So.2d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 721 (Fla. 1994) (\"Sovereign immunity does not exempt the State from a challenge based on violation of the federal or state constitutions, because any other rule self-evidently would make constitutional law subservient to the State's will.\"). Second, the State is not immune from suit where it has waived its immunity pursuant to law. Art. X, \u00a7 3, Fla. Const. (allowing \"[p]rovision[s] [to] be made by general law for bringing suit against the state as to all liabilities now existing or hereafter originating\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pursuant to its enactment of section 768.28, Florida Statutes, the Legislature has explicitly waived the State's immunity from suit for liability in tort for damages. But this statutory waiver is strictly limited to circumstances where the State owes the plaintiff an underlying common law or statutory duty of care\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   where the challenged government actions are not discretionary and are not inherent in the act of governing.\n   <em>\n    Jordan v. Nienhuis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12146989\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/203/974/#p976\">\n    203 So.3d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 976 (Fla. 5th DCA 2016). With this framework in mind, we consider whether the doctrine of sovereign immunity precludes Appellees' constitutional takings claims and their tort-based nuisance claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    1. Constitutional Claims - Takings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Appellees claim that their property was unlawfully taken by the FWC in violation of article X, section 6 of the Florida Constitution when the FWC issued deer dog hunting licenses and failed to prevent trespassing hunters and dogs from entering Appellees' property. The FWC argues that sovereign immunity bars Appellees' takings claims because the allegations in the complaint were legally insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   When the trial court rejected the FWC's sovereign immunity arguments and denied\n   summary judgment as a matter of law, it never addressed the legal sufficiency of Appellees' takings claims. Instead, the court summarily rejected the FWC's sovereign immunity arguments, concluding that the FWC \"is not immune from constitutionally based takings claims.\" The trial court reached this conclusion in reliance on\n   <em>\n    Crowley Museum &amp; Nature Center, Inc. v. Southwest Florida Water Management District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205336\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/993/605/\">\n    993 So.2d 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2d DCA 2008). The Second District in that case restated the unremarkable proposition that the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not bar a constitutional claim against the government - a point the government in that case conceded on appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205336\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/993/605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205336\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/993/605/\">\n    at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the government argued that the plaintiff's complaint did not set forth a facially sufficient inverse condemnation claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205336\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/993/605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the Second District declined to address the government's argument because the facial sufficiency of the inverse condemnation claim was not raised in the trial court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8205336\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/993/605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Second District in\n   <em>\n    Crowley\n   </em>\n   did not reach the question posed to the trial court in this case: whether sovereign immunity bars a suit asserting an inverse condemnation claim against the State when the plaintiff fails to set forth a legally sufficient constitutional claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The dissent argues that this Court may not consider the legal sufficiency of Appellees' takings claims asserting that the FWC framed the issue on appeal as a challenge to the court's sovereign immunity ruling, without reference to the legal sufficiency of the takings claims. We disagree with the dissent for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   First, the FWC did in fact address the legal sufficiency of both the takings and nuisance claims in its Initial Brief and Reply Brief. In the Summary of the Argument section of its Initial Brief, the FWC stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The circuit court also erred when it found as a matter of law that the Plaintiffs' claims were not barred by sovereign immunity. The state of Florida has not waived sovereign immunity for its functions which are tantamount to legislative acts. A plaintiff cannot pursue a lawsuit against FWC for acts that are basic judgmental or discretionary governmental functions. FWC (like any public body or governmental entity) is not liable to any individual based on its enactment of or failure to enact laws or regulations or by its issuance of or refusal to issue licenses, permits, variances or directions. In addition, there is no duty of FWC to prevent the misconduct of third persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   FWC's decision to enact rules and regulations related to hunting in Blackwater WMA and its decision to issue permits for deer dog hunting in Blackwater WMA are decisions that fall within FWC's discretionary governmental functions.\n   <em>\n    The facts of this lawsuit as alleged by the Plaintiffs are not sufficient to maintain a cause of action against FWC for nuisance or takings claims.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Emphasis added). When arguing for the reversal of the trial court's imposition of an injunction, the FWC presented the following argument concerning the legal sufficiency of Appellees' claims, including the takings claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The circuit court did not make any of the required findings and as to the likelihood of success on the merits merely found as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Whether, and the extent to which the FWC's actions constitute a taking will be decided based on the evidence submitted at the jury trial of this case, as will the amount of any resulting damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The circuit court's order granting the Plaintiffs' motion for temporary injunctive\n   relief should be reversed also on the grounds that\n   <em>\n    it does not contain the findings required by Florida law and therefore does not comply with Florida law.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Emphasis added). The FWC raised the argument again in the section arguing for reversal of the trial court's denial of its motion for summary judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The facts alleged as alleged by the Plaintiffs in the case are not sufficient to state a cause of action against FWC for which sovereign immunity has been waived.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Initial Brief concluded with the FWC explicitly requesting the relief granted in this opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   FWC also respectfully requests that this Court find that the circuit court erred when it declined to grant summary judgment in favor of FWC on the Plaintiffs' claims and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this Court's ruling and what other and further relief this Court deems just and proper.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Contrary to the assertions made by the dissent, the majority is not addressing an issue that was never raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Second, implicit in the trial court's sovereign immunity ruling is the court's determination that the constitutional claims were legally sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cutler v. City of Jacksonville Beach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7572633\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/489/126/#p128\">\n    489 So.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128 (Fla. 1st DCA 1986) (observing that a claim must be legally sufficient to circumvent the application of the sovereign immunity doctrine). Only if Appellees pleaded the required elements of their takings claims could the trial court have ruled as a matter of law that sovereign immunity did not bar the claims against the FWC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7572633\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/489/126/#p128\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, the trial court's determination that sovereign immunity did not bar Appellees' takings claims against the FWC resolved a pure question of law. Thus, our review is de novo.\n   <em>\n    Plancher v. UCF Athletics Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847071\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/724/\">\n    175 So.3d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 725 n.3 (Fla. 2015).

The Second District rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the establishment of the preservation zones constituted a taking of their property because the plaintiffs\n   were denied the opportunity to exploit a property interest they previously believed was available for development. The court determined the allegations were insufficient to establish a taking because the plaintiffs retained the desired use of the majority of their land.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730815\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/636/761/#p764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730815\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/636/761/#p764\">\n    at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, Appellees do not, and cannot, allege that the FWC has forced them to submit to either a temporary or permanent physical occupation of their land.

But this allegation ignores the fact that Appellees are free to exclude the deer dog hunters and dogs from their property by pursuing criminal or civil remedies against the trespassing hunters and owners of the deer dogs. The FWC has not deprived Appellees of any right to pursue the third-party wrongdoers. Further, Appellees do not allege that they were deprived of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   economically beneficial use of their property, particularly when the deer dog hunting season is limited to forty-four days and the trespasses were fleeting and sporadic. Because Appellees failed to plead the required elements to state legally sufficient takings claims against the FWC, the trial court should have granted the FWC's motion for summary judgment on sovereign immunity grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    2.

And, again, the trial court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Crowley\n   </em>\n   was misplaced.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Crowley\n   </em>\n   offers no insight in determining whether sovereign immunity bars a claim of nuisance against the state and its subdivisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, the FWC's sovereign immunity defense to Appellees' nuisance claims emanates from section 768.28(1), Florida Statutes, and the doctrine of separation of powers. Section 768.28(1) provides a broad waiver of sovereign immunity to the state and its subdivisions for tort liability \"under circumstances in which the state or agency or subdivision, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant, in accordance with the general laws of the state.\" But even where the State owes a duty of care to a claimant, \"constitutional separation-of-powers considerations require that certain discretionary or planning level governmental functions remain immune from tort liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Mosby v.

Thus, our analysis of whether sovereign immunity bars Appellees' nuisance claims against the FWC proceeds in two steps. First, we must determine whether there is an underlying common law or statutory duty of care to Appellees with respect to the FWC's\n   actions to authorize deer dog hunting in the Blackwater WMA.\n   <em>\n    Trianon Park Condo. Ass'n, Inc. v.

Second, we must consider whether the FWC's actions are discretionary or operational in nature.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7626453\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/468/912/#p917\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With regard to the first step, we conclude the FWC owes no duty to Appellees to stop third parties acting in violation of the FWC's rules and state law from trespassing onto Appellees' private property even though the FWC's rules authorize deer dog hunting on public lands adjacent to private property owned by Appellees. The FWC's rules require deer dog hunters to obtain licenses and permits, limit the season during which deer dog hunting occurs, define the public lands on which deer dog hunting may occur, and require the use of remote tracking and behavior correction devices on each dog. On those occasions where hunters or their dogs strayed from the public lands where they were authorized to hunt and trespassed onto Appellees' private property, they did so in violation of the FWC's rules and regulations, as well as state laws prohibiting trespass, criminal mischief, and the like. Because \"there is no common law duty to prevent the misconduct of third persons,\" the FWC is not liable to Appellees for the failure of the hunters to abide by the FWC's rules and state law prohibiting trespass onto private property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7626453\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/468/912/#p917\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nor did the FWC owe a statutory or common-law duty to Appellees to monitor compliance by hunters with the FWC's deer dog hunting rules and regulations, particularly when the hunters had strayed beyond the public lands on which the FWC had authorized hunting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

We also note that some of the nuisances alleged in the complaint include criminal acts such as threats to destroy Appellees' property, threats to Appellees' safety, the setting of several arson fires, and the painting of graffiti on Appellees' property. It is absurd to suggest that the FWC is responsible for the criminal acts of third parties or that the deer dog hunting regulations invited such actions by the hunters. Because the FWC owed no duty to Appellees to prevent trespasses onto their property by the hunters or their dogs, the FWC was entitled to sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But even if the FWC did owe a duty of care to Appellees to prevent the trespasses by third parties onto their private property, sovereign immunity would bar Appellees' nuisance claims because the FWC's actions to authorize hunting on public lands are purely discretionary functions of the FWC.\n   <em>\n    Mosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8930115\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/909/323/#p326\">\n    909 So.2d at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And any doubt that this was the intended import of the injunction was removed when the trial court issued its order dissolving this Court's automatic stay of the 2016 order. Although the trial court acknowledged that \"it would be inappropriate and overreaching for the Court to direct the FWC not to physically release the licenses and permits for the upcoming hunting season,\" in the very next paragraph of its order, the trial court determined that the issuance of licenses and\n   permits for deer dog hunting \"constitute[s] a nuisance and contribute[s] to the interference with the plaintiffs' right to the quiet enjoyment of their private property, and there is no other way to protect those constitutional rights at this juncture than to vacate the stay.\" Because the injunction requires the FWC to abate the nuisance and the order vacating the stay clarifies that the very issuance of permits and licenses for deer dog hunting constitutes a nuisance, it is crystal clear that the injunction prohibits the FWC from issuing permits and licenses for deer dog hunting in the Blackwater WMA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the injunction leaves the FWC with no discretion or flexibility whatsoever to exercise its constitutional authority to regulate hunting and constitutes a judicial encroachment into the legislative authority of the FWC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The injunction is also overly broad.

The injunction entered by the trial court was overbroad and violated the separation of powers. Accordingly, we REVERSE the order denying the FWC's motion for summary judgment, DISSOLVE the injunction, and REMAND for entry of summary judgment in favor of the FWC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   B.L. Thomas, C.J., concurs;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Lewis, J., dissents with opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   I respectfully dissent and would affirm the trial court in all respects. In doing so, I am mindful of the conflicting interests that exist in this case. However, for the following reasons, my view of the law when applied to the facts leads me to conclude that any issue regarding Appellees' takings claims is not properly before us, sovereign immunity does not apply to Appellees' nuisance claims against Appellant, and the temporary injunction was properly entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In their Amended Complaint, each Appellee alleged both a takings claim and a nuisance claim against Appellant. Appellees also moved for the entry of a temporary injunction, requesting that the trial court enjoin Appellant from issuing any permits for deer dog hunting in a certain portion of the Blackwater WMA and enjoin\n   any deer dog hunting from occurring in that same portion during the pendency of the suit. Appellant moved for summary judgment, arguing in part, \"The plaintiffs have filed a nuisance count ... and a takings count .... The Plaintiffs['] claims are barred by the doctrine of separation of powers, sovereign immunity and prior decisions of this court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   During the hearing on the motions for injunctive relief and summary judgment, several Appellees testified. One Appellee described deer dog hunting as being \"extremely disruptive\" and \"potentially extremely dangerous\" to his livestock, and he testified that he has to put his own dogs in kennels when he hears the hunting dogs approach his property, and it can take anywhere from forty-five minutes to an \"hour plus\" for Appellant's \"guys\" to arrive if he catches the hunting dogs. The hunters are not pleased if the dogs are in Appellee's possession, and they try to intimidate \"you into releasing their dog back to them.\" There had been instances on Appellee's property during which his horses, because of the frenzy that ensues when the hunting dogs arrive, ran into fences and gates, tripped on tree stumps, and slipped on their side. When asked about harassment, Appellee testified that the Santa Rosa County Building Inspector threatened not to pass his building inspections, and a dog hunter threatened to burn his house down. His mailbox had been shot, and graffiti had been painted on the road in front of his house. Four arson fires had been set around his property between March 2014 and December 2014. He detailed his efforts to remedy the issue, including attending meetings, proposing rule changes, and meeting with one of Appellant's directors in October 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Other Appellees testified about threats made to them in the past by various hunters, about the danger they felt in going into their yards during deer dog hunting season, about how the fences they constructed did not stop the dogs from trespassing and causing damage upon their property, about dog fights that occurred between their own dogs and the hunting dogs, and about their repeated efforts to have Appellant remedy the situation. One Appellee testified that deer dog hunting interfered with the enjoyment of his property because he was not able to still hunt when \"about 15 dogs will come running through [his] food plot.\" Another Appellee testified that the hunters had blocked \"our roads and you have to wait for them to move,\" they threw all types of trash on her driveway, and although she had horses on her property at one time, she now keeps them at a friend's home because of how spooked they would become from the shooting and lights shining on them. Although a \"correction device requirement\" for the hunting dogs took effect on July 1, 2016, evidence presented below in support of Appellees' motion to vacate the automatic stay showed that dog trespasses continued on Appellees' property during the 2016-2017 hunting season. One of Appellant's employees testified that the potential for trespasses still existed, that the rule did not contain any training certification requirement for hunters, that hunters might not train their dogs properly using the collars, and that the rule did not mandate that collars automatically trigger themselves if the dogs crossed over certain GPS positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In the Order on Evidentiary Hearing and Hearing on Summary Judgment Motion, the trial court found that the credible testimony clearly and convincingly established that deer dog hunting days invade and interfere with Appellees' quiet enjoyment of their property, that the responsible hunter rule is not particularly helpful to private property owners who are no longer young and able-bodied, as catching\n   a deer-chasing dog is not an easy task, and that many of the private property owners are effectively denied the use and enjoyment of their property during the 12.1% of the year when Appellant allows deer dog hunting in the Blackwater WMA. After detailing the testimony of Appellees, the trial court found that the case \"should not be viewed as weighing competing interests of the private property owners against the desires of the FWC-authorized public hunters\" and that the \"rights of the private property owners to the enjoyment of their private land are not conditioned upon, nor subject to, those who want to hunt adjacent public lands.\" The court further found that the rights of private property owners cannot and should not be interfered with by state government and those authorized to participate in deer dog hunting. The trial court explained that Appellees \"are no longer asking the Court to change the FWC rules or regulations, nor to micromanage the deer hunting program that is part of FWC's wild game management responsibility.\" Instead, according to the trial court, Appellees were requesting a ruling that the flood of hunters and their dogs trespassing on their property constituted a nuisance and a taking of their property. The trial court found that Appellees set forth \"proper claims for injunctive relief and claims for per se and non-per se taking[s] claims under the circumstances present here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On the issue of sovereign immunity, the trial court determined that Appellant was not immune from liability for constitutionally-based takings claims or from nuisance claims. The trial court set forth:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Whether, and the extent to which, FWC's actions constitute a taking will be decided based on the evidence submitted at the jury trial of this case, as will the amount of any resulting damages. For now, it is clear that the trespasses onto the plaintiffs' property and the interference with the plaintiffs' property rights is a direct result of the FWC's continued allowance of the deer dog hunting in an area known to contain private property, and does constitute a nuisance. The plaintiffs are entitled to entry of an injunction requiring FWC to abate the nuisance during the pendency of these proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The trial court ordered Appellant \"to abate the nuisance of the deer hunting dogs from trespassing onto the property of the plaintiffs, and of the deer dogs and their hunters from interfering with the plaintiffs' right to the quiet enjoyment of their private property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Summary Judgment - Inverse Condemnation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   With respect to Appellees' takings claims, the majority reverses based upon its determination that Appellees failed to state legally sufficient claims. However, not only is the legal sufficiency of Appellees' takings claims not appealable in this non-final appeal, but Appellant, by not making any argument on the issue, abandoned any challenge regarding Appellees' takings claims on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   This is an appeal of a non-final order pursuant to Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.130.

The above-referenced appellate rules do not authorize an appeal from a non-final order denying a motion based on the sufficiency of a takings claim. In fact, had the non-final order on appeal simply determined that Appellees had set forth a sufficient takings claim, the order would not have\n   been an appealable non-final order.

In\n   <em>\n    Cutler\n   </em>\n   , this Court noted that the appellant alleged in part that the appellee was legally responsible for acts of negligence on the part of the lifeguards or members of the beach patrol at the time of the appellant's daughter's drowning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7572633\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/489/126/#p128\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7572633\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/489/126/#p128\">\n    at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, in reversing and remanding in part, we held that dismissal of the claim should have been without prejudice. Here, as stated, we are not faced with an appeal of a final order dismissing Appellees' claims. Instead, this non-final appeal addresses a summary judgment order that primarily determined that Appellees' claims were not barred by sovereign immunity as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Furthermore, even if we did have jurisdiction to address the legal sufficiency of Appellees' takings claims, Appellant does not argue on appeal that the trial court erred in determining that the takings claims were legally sufficient. In fact, Appellant has not expressly challenged in its Initial Brief the trial court's determination that sovereign immunity does not bar Appellees' takings claims. Instead, in its Initial Brief, Appellant frames the issues on appeal by stating that it is appealing the entry of the temporary injunction and \"the denial of [its] motion for summary judgment to the extent that the summary judgment determined as a matter of law that\n   [it] is not entitled to sovereign immunity.\" Appellant's arguments regarding sovereign immunity pertain only to whether the doctrine bars Appellees' nuisance claims. Moreover, none of the cases cited by Appellant on appeal were cited in support of an argument that the trial court erred in determining that sovereign immunity did not bar Appellees' takings claims or that Appellees' takings claims were legally sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Anheuser-Busch Companies v.

In fact, the first time the legal sufficiency of Appellees' takings claims was mentioned on appeal was in the majority opinion. Indeed, portions of the majority opinion closely resemble Appellant's summary judgment argument concerning the legal sufficiency of the takings claims that was made below. The majority's reliance upon various conclusory statements made in Appellant's Initial Brief, including statements made in the context of the entirely separate issue of the temporary injunction and statements made in the Summary of the Argument section, in no way supports its conclusion that the legal sufficiency of Appellees' takings claims is an issue that is properly before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caldwell v.

Instead, a review of the Initial Brief supports my view that the legal sufficiency issue is not properly before us on appeal. Absolutely nothing in Appellant's Initial Brief resembles what the majority has addressed in its opinion with respect to this issue. It is not an appellate court's function to take a conclusory statement made by a party and formulate an argument in support of that statement and in favor of the party. If Appellant wished to challenge on appeal the trial court's findings that Appellees' takings allegations were legally sufficient or that sovereign immunity does not bar the takings claims, it had a duty to set forth its arguments in favor of such a\n   challenge. There is no question in this case that no such challenge was made as to these issues. Moreover, while the majority cites\n   <em>\n    Plancher v. UCF Athletics Association, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847071\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/724/\">\n    175 So.3d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 729 n.3 (Fla. 2015), for the proposition that the issue of sovereign immunity is a legal issue subject to de novo review, our standard of review does not excuse the requirement that a party raise an issue on appeal before this Court may address it. For these reasons, the majority's reversal as to the takings claims is wholly inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Alternatively, if we had jurisdiction to address the legal sufficiency of Appellees' takings claims and if Appellant had raised the issue on appeal, affirmance as to the issue would still be proper.

In\n   <em>\n    City of Oviedo\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth District affirmed a temporary injunction enjoining the appellant from withholding approval of planned sewer improvements by the appellee on the ground that the appellee refused to sign a franchise agreement proffered by the appellant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11868280\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/206/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11868280\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/206/\">\n    at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fifth District noted that the preliminary injunction enjoined the appellant \" 'from withholding development on the grounds that Alafaya has not entered into a franchise agreement with the City' \" and set forth that \"[b]ecause Oviedo is still free to adopt\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   rules and regulations pertaining to the use of its rights of way ..., the injunction entered does not unduly hamper Oviedo's regulatory powers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11868280\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/206/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11868280\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/206/\">\n    at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Any argument that Appellant is in doubt as to what the trial court directed is meritless. The injunction is clear that Appellant is to abate the nuisance of deer hunting dogs on Appellees' property. As stated, the trial court left it up to Appellant to decide how that directive is to be accomplished and how the alleged nuisance in the Blackwater\n   WMA is to be abated. Like the situation in\n   <em>\n    City of Oviedo\n   </em>\n   , the injunction in this case does not unduly hamper Appellant's authority in the Blackwater WMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In support of its decision, the majority refers to the trial court's order vacating the automatic stay that was entered while this appeal was pending and the court's language characterizing the issuance of licenses and permits as a nuisance. Unlike the majority, I do not read the order on appeal to prohibit the issuance of licenses and permits. As Appellant's counsel noted below about the language in the order vacating the stay, \"[T]hat was something that wasn't included in the terms of the injunction orders that were entered a year ago,\" and the order vacating the stay \"contained some new language that actually went a little bit further\" than the order on appeal. In fact, we granted Appellant's motion to reinstate the automatic stay because the language used in the order vacating the stay improperly expanded the scope of the temporary injunction to include the issuance of licenses and permits. Thus, an affirmance of the order on appeal would in no way prohibit Appellant from issuing hunting permits. Instead, Appellant would be free to choose how to keep hunting dogs from trespassing onto Appellees' property. As such, entry of the injunction was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In conclusion, because the trial court did not err in denying the motion for summary judgment and in entering the temporary injunction, I would affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER ON MOTION FOR REHEARING EN BANC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   A judge of this Court requested that this cause be reheard en banc in accordance with Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.331(d).

May the appellate panel nonetheless resolve and dismiss the entire case in favor of the Commission on a basis neither raised nor briefed nor argued by any party on appeal? If so, may it do so without notice and supplemental briefing?

But it was incumbent on the Commission to raise this issue on appeal in some meaningful way; we typically don't have jurisdiction to raise and resolve an issue as a basis for reversal, implicit or otherwise, in a trial court's ruling, unless it is brought to our attention and briefed on appeal (with the exceptions discussed above). Close questions arise as to whether an issue or argument has been presented on appeal, but that's not the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The panel majority also says the Commission \"argues that sovereign immunity bars [the property owners'] takings claims because the allegations in the complaint were legally insufficient,\" but no such argument was presented in the Commission's briefs. The only mention of a takings claim in the initial brief are\n   <em>\n    two words\n   </em>\n   -\"or takings\"-interlineated in a sentence near the end of FWC's summary of the argument (\"The facts of this lawsuit as alleged by the Plaintiffs are not sufficient to maintain a cause of action against FWC for nuisance\n   <em>\n    or takings\n   </em>\n   claims.\") (emphasis added). No legal argument, citation of authority, or recitation of FWC's trial court analysis on the takings claims was presented thereafter.

For this reason, the property owners surely were taken aback when they found out the panel majority had not only\n   vacated the temporary injunction but had dismissed their entire case on the basis of an unraised claim-and done so without notice to, and supplemental briefing by, the parties. The result of adjudicating the takings claim without briefing by the parties is that the law of takings is now a bit more muddled,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   a reason why the property owners have justifiably sought rehearing and rehearing en banc based on decisional conflicts, as well as a certified question: \"Whether a compensable taking may arise from recurrent trespasses and physical incursions upon private property, even if of finite duration, by invitees licensed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to conduct hunting in an adjacent state wildlife management area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Even if supplemental briefing had been sought from the parties, the basis for doing so would be to\n   <em>\n    reverse\n   </em>\n   the injunction (and dismiss the case), which\n   <em>\n    Florida Carry\n   </em>\n   says can't be done, thereby creating direct intramural precedential tension. The issue of the extent to which a panel can expand the scope of appellate review is worthy of the Court's collective discussion, no matter how it is resolved. Absent that discussion, this case sets a precedent for panels having discretion to expand the scope of appellate review without notice to the parties or supplemental briefing to\n   <em>\n    reverse\n   </em>\n   on a legal theory the appellant did not raise on appeal; no exception to the waiver rule is required. It ratchets back the rote application of waiver rules, thereby lessening the strictures of the adversary process model. Some will lament this change, some will not, but the net result is that an objection that an issue, argument or theory \"wasn't raised\" is no longer an insurmountable bar to a panel's adjudication of a case. As the general discussion above makes evident, however, much room exists for debate and clarification of the extent of appellate court power to do justice in each case within the parameters of an adversarial model of adjudication, making the denial of en banc review a lost opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    The patchwork-like composition of the Blackwater WMA is the result of Florida's land acquisition program whereby the State purchases private property for conservation and recreational purposes.

In\n    <em>\n     Richards\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff could seek relief for a taking if the governmental action imposed \"special and peculiar\" damages on a neighboring property owner (who was next to a new railroad tunnel).\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673804\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/546/#p557\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Argent v.

Cir. 1997) (Plaintiffs stated takings claim where \"burdensome pattern of [flight] activity\" was alleged.). The principle in this line of cases is that a government-created nuisance may support a takings claim if the burden imposed is peculiar/special as to a limited set of property owners who bear the burden disproportionately compared to others. Harm arising from reasonable and normal uses, if widely shared by the public at large, would not be actionable as a taking; but burdens from a nuisance endured by a handful of neighboring property owners may be actionable (i.e., states a claim for relief).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Richards\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673804\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/546/#p557\">\n     233 U.S. at 557\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673804\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/233/546/#p557\">\n     34 S.Ct. 654\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     Argent\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"969450,11909996\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/1277/\">\n     124 F.3d at 1284\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Of course, not every nuisance is a taking, only those that fit this narrow category as defined by the caselaw. Under the facts alleged and developed in discovery, the property owners have to take precautionary steps and refrain from normal use of their properties for over a month during the holiday season each year when an influx of hunting dogs and hunters come onto their property (akin to taking precautions if ash or fumes invade from a neighboring waste treatment plant). By dismissing the takings claim outright on appeal-without the issue having been raised or even briefed-the property owners have been deprived of the ability to argue the takings issue and the law on takings has been clouded.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
