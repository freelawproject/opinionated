Charles Blake was convicted of sexually battering a seven-year-old child during a family barbeque. He was sentenced to life in prison. On appeal, Blake argues the judge made several evidentiary errors that entitle him to a new trial. But after review, we find no errors, particularly none that warrant reversal. The evidence that Blake sexually penetrated Robert's\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   anus with his finger-or, as the young child put it, dug \"in his butt\"-was so overwhelming as to render any alleged evidentiary error harmless. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Sexual Battery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2. Seven-year-old Robert lived with his mother and older sister at his grandmother's house. On Labor Day, his grandmother hosted a barbeque. Included in this family gathering were the grandmother's boyfriend and the boyfriend's brother, Charles Blake. Blake ingratiated himself with the other guests, buying alcohol for the grown-ups and taking the kids to the store to buy treats with the $5 each he gave them. According to Robert, Blake made a separate proposal to him, specifically offering the child an additional $100 to visit Blake at his house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. Robert's uncle, who was manning the grill, told his and his sister's kids to play inside, so the grown-ups could enjoy some adult conversation. While the kids were playing inside, Blake entered the home. Robert's cousins and sister were in the dining room, all sitting on a couch. At first, they did not notice Robert was not with them. But a bit later, his teenaged cousin looked into the adjacent living room and saw Blake in a chair with Robert standing in front of him. This same cousin wondered aloud what Blake was doing with Robert because she saw Blake \"pulling [Robert] back and forth.\" When Robert's sister turned her attention to the living room, she too saw Blake physically moving Robert back and forth. From the strange look on Robert's face, she knew something was wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. The two girls jumped up and went toward Robert. He quietly whispered for his sister and cousin to \"go get ma.\" His sister went straight to their mother, who was in her bedroom. She told her something was wrong with Robert. His mother called to him several times. Robert eventually emerged from the table. He was shaking and had tears in his eyes. Robert had a terrified look on his face-an expression his mother had never seen before. The young child told his mother and sister that Blake had been \"in there digging in my butt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. Robert's mother testified she blacked out in shock by this news. Witnesses corroborated that she grabbed a bottle and charged toward Blake. On the witness stand, she readily admitted becoming enraged and attacking Blake. Blake ran out of the house. And Robert's mother called the police, who advised her to take Robert to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6. Police Sergeant Norman Starks met the family at the hospital and interviewed the mother. Afterwards, he went to the grandmother's house to view the crime scene and gather a list of witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7. The next day, Blake and his brother came to the police station for questioning. Blake told him he had left his bag behind when he fled from Robert's enraged mother. And he asked for Sergeant Starks's help to get it back. Robert's uncle had the bag and agreed to drop it off at the police station. Before returning the bag to Blake, Sergeant Starks opened the bag and inventoried its contents in front of Blake and Blake's brother, apparently without any objection. On top of all items in the bag was a tube of \"Warm Touch\" warming gel lubricant. Sergeant Starks told Blake he would have to retain the tube as potential evidence. He photographed the rest of the items-including several latex gloves-and returned the bag to Blake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8. The next month, Sergeant Starks took Robert to a forensic specialist trained in interviewing children. Robert told the interviewer how Blake had touched his buttocks. When she asked him to explain what he meant by \"touched,\" Robert demonstrated to her how Blake's \"finger wiggled inside his buttocks and his buttocks hurt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9. Blake was charged with sexually penetrating Robert, a child under the age of fourteen, by inserting his finger into Robert's anal opening, when Blake was more than twenty-four months older than Robert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss. Code Ann. C 97-3-95(1)(d) (Rev. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10. The Friday before trial, Blake moved for a continuance, arguing he needed more time to locate a potential witness-Dr. Jeffrey Ming, the emergency room physician who evaluated Robert that night. The trial court denied this motion. The court found Blake's counsel could not show any diligent efforts to locate Dr. Ming, though Blake had been under indictment for more than two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11. At trial, Sergeant Starks testified first. While he was testifying, the State introduced-over Blake's objection-the photographs of the contents of his bag and the tube of warming gel lubricant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12. Robert's mother and sister also testified. Both were allowed, under the tender-years exception, to testify about Robert's statements immediately after the assault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss. R. Evid. 803(25). The two repeated that Robert had said Blake was \"digging in my butt.\" The forensic interviewer also testified about Robert's description of Blake's fingers wiggling in his butt. Robert's sister recounted seeing\n   Blake physically manipulating Robert, back and forth. She recalled the strange look on Robert's face. And Robert's cousin corroborated that Blake, with his hand behind Robert's back, was pulling the child back and forth. Robert's other cousin testified that he was \"certain\" he saw Blake's hand inside Robert's pants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13. The jury then heard from Robert himself. He recounted how Blake \"put his hand in my butt.\" On cross-examination, when asked at what point he whispered to his cousin for help, Robert replied \"when [Blake] was digging in my butt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14. The defense called no witnesses. Robert's counsel attempted to recall Sergeant Starks to impeach Robert's mother. But the State objected. The trial judge sustained the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15. Blake's counsel did introduce Robert's medical records from his emergency-room visit. But the trial court struck the emergency-room doctor's diagnosis-\"alleged fondling\"-because, in the court's view, the description of fondling \"may be misleading or confusing to the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16. The jury found Blake guilty of sexual battery. And the trial judge sentenced Blake, a habitual offender, to life without parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2097-3-101\">\n    Miss.

After his post-judgment motions were denied, Blake appealed his conviction to this Court. Blake argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (1) The trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to present a complete defense by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (a) denying his request to recall Sergeant Starks to impeach Robert's mother,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (b) denying his request to continue trial so he could locate the emergency room doctor, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (c) redacting the doctor's diagnosis from Robert's medical records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (2) The trial court erred by admitting tender-years testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (3) The trial court erred by admitting into evidence the contents of Blake's bag.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Blake's Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 18. Blake suggests a series of trial-court rulings infringed on his constitutional right to present a full defense in his case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ross v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8337690\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/954/968/#p996\">\n    954 So.2d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 996 (Miss. 2007) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cir. 1997) ). But we discern no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Attempted Recall of Sergeant Starks\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 19. Blake first asserts he was wrongly prohibited from impeaching the credibility of Robert's mother. Blake claims her credibility was an important aspect of his defense because it was she who, through the tender-years exception to the hearsay rule,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified Robert told her Blake had been \"digging in my butt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 20. While Blake was certainly entitled to present his defense theory, any supporting evidence must comply with the Mississippi Rules of Evidence.\n   <em>\n    Terry v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11704826\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/718/1115/#p1121\">\n    718 So.2d 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1121-22 (Miss. 1998). Rule 613 permits the admission of \"[e]xtrinsic evidence of a witness's prior inconsistent statement\" if certain conditions are met. Miss. R. Evid. 613(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 21. Blake argues the trial court wrongly believed Blake's failure to confront Robert's mother with her prior statement barred Blake from recalling Sergeant\n   Starks to offer extrinsic evidence about the statement. In one respect, we agree with Blake's argument about this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 22. In the past, Mississippi adhered to the former rigid common-law practice, requiring confrontation before impeachment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This impeachment method mandated that, before an attacking party may offer extrinsic evidence of an inconsistent statement, the witness must be confronted with the statement and be given a chance to explain or deny it. But this is no longer the case in Mississippi courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, this Court has held that under Rule 613(b), extrinsic evidence may be offered\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   a witness has had an opportunity to explain or deny it. In\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. State\n   </em>\n   , this Court explained, \"[ Rule] 613(b) does not provide that the witness has to first be afforded the opportunity to explain or deny the statement\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the admission of extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050809\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/905/1209/#p1212\">\n    905 So.2d 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1212-13 (Miss. 2005) (emphasis added) (citing Miss. R. Evid. 613(b) ). \"The witness must only be afforded the opportunity to explain or deny the statement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050809\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/905/1209/#p1212\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Portis v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12670464\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/245/457/#p471\">\n    245 So.3d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 471 (Miss. 2018). So prior confrontation is no longer required under our procedure rules,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it was not required here. Still, after review, we find there was no evidentiary error because there was no admissible prior inconsistent statement for Rule 613(b) purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 23. To be admissible under Rule 613(b), the extrinsic evidence must be a \"witness's prior\n   <em>\n    inconsistent\n   </em>\n   statement.\" Miss. R. Evid. 613(b) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Portis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12670464\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/245/457/#p471\">\n    245 So.3d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And here, the police statement Blake wanted to introduce through Sergeant Starks was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   inconsistent with Robert's mother's trial testimony. Instead, Blake hoped to shoehorn his impeachment of the child witnesses' testimony by attacking a statement made by Robert's mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 24. Blake's counsel proffered that Sergeant Starks would testify that, when he interviewed Robert's mother at the emergency room, \"she specifically stated that none of the children indicated to her that they knew anything or saw anything.\" This statement is not inconsistent with her trial testimony. On cross-examination, counsel asked Robert's mother:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q: Now, prior to [hitting Blake], did you make any attempt to talk to any of the kids to ask them what they saw supposedly?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A: No, I did not. The look on my son's face told it all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q: Did you tell Mr. Starks that you had talked to those kids after you had attacked Mr. Blake?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q: Did you tell Mr. Starks that the children that you talked to told you that they didn't see anything?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A: No, I did not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Both the statement and trial testimony can certainly be true. Telling Sergeant Starks that none of the children specifically mentioned to her that they saw anything differs from reporting that each child who was present affirmatively told her he or she did not see Blake assault the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 25. Furthermore, that Blake sought to introduce the statement to show Robert's mother reported that\n   <em>\n    the children\n   </em>\n   had said they did not see anything shows Blake's true intent. He did not intend to impeach the mother, but rather to attack the\n   <em>\n    children\n   </em>\n   's trial testimony about what they purportedly saw Blake do. Because the extrinsic evidence Blake proffered was not proper impeachment evidence, the trial judge did not reversibly err by prohibiting Sergeant Starks from being recalled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Motion for Continuance to Locate Dr. Ming\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 26. Blake also claims the trial court erred in denying him a continuance to attempt to find Dr. Ming to testify as an expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 27. \"The grant or denial of a continuance lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Here the denial of the continuance was based on Blake's failure to show due diligence in trying to locate Dr. Ming. As the trial judge recognized, \"in the context of a denied motion for continuance for absence of a witness some showing of due diligence must be made.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11710509\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/716/1096/#p1097\">\n    716 So.2d 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1099 (Miss. 1998). And the record shows \"no effort on the part of the defendant to procure the presence of the witness until the trial ... was practically in progress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11710509\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/716/1096/#p1097\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thigpen v.

Blake also takes issue with the judge's redacting the diagnosis of \"alleged fondling\" from Robert's emergency-room records, which were admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 29. The suppression of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

And here, the trial judge exercised his discretion to exclude the phrase \"alleged fondling\" because it potentially could confuse the jury. The trial court was concerned the jury could be misled to think Dr. Ming was using the term \"fondling\" in the\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   sense. There was no indication Dr. Ming understood that \"fondling\" was a specific statutory\n   crime that differed from the charged crime of \"sexual battery.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss. R. Evid. 403 (\"The court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of ... confusing the issues[ or] misleading the jury[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 30. Blake argues the trial court erred because \"[a]n opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue.\" Miss. R. Evid. 704. While Blake is correct that Rule 704 abolished the \"ultimate issue rule,\" the abolition of this rule \"does not result in the admission of all opinions.\" Miss. R.

App. 1999) (noting that a medical expert could use the legal label \"serious bodily injury\" so long as \"the witness had the meaning of the term explained\"). The medical records give zero indication the legal criteria of the statutory crime of fondling-as opposed to sexual battery-had been explained before Dr. Ming diagnosed Robert with \"alleged fondling.\" So the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the diagnosis as misleading to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss.

Next, Blake insists the trial judge wrongly permitted Robert's mother, Robert's sister, and the forensic interviewer to testify about what Robert told them. In general, statements made outside the court submitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted are inadmissible hearsay. Miss. R. Evid. 801, 802. But our rules do contain several exceptions, including the one the trial court applied here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 33. Under Rule 803(25), \"[a] statement by a child of tender years describing any act of sexual contact with or by another is admissible if\" two prerequisites are met:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (A) the court-after a hearing outside the jury's presence-determines that the statement's time, content, and circumstances provide substantial indicia of reliability; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (B) the child either: (i) testifies; or (ii) is unavailable as a witness, and other evidence corroborates the act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Miss.

At trial, the State introduced the contents of Blake's bag/backpack. In particular, the State wanted to introduce warming gel (Warm Touch Warming Jelly) and latex gloves found inside the bag. Blake objected vigorously to the relevance of these objects. Blake noted that not a single witness could tie the bag to the crime, stating that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   not a single witness will testify that they saw Mr. Blake access that bag other than bring the bag over with him when he came to the residence.

Blake argued that he carried that bag and sold things out of it. The State argued that the gel was relevant under Rule 404(b) to establish motive, intent, and opportunity. It argued that an internet search by the State indicated that the gel is used for \"sexual means\" and that it was used as part of an intent, plan, or scheme to engage in sexual battery. It also argued that the item \"was in the same room with the child.\" The State maintained that the gel was relevant and that the probative value trumped any prejudicial effect, \"[e]specially, given the fact that we're trying a sexual abuse of a vulnerable individual, a child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 49. Sergeant Starks testified before the judge about the preliminary evidentiary issues. He testified that during his interview with Blake, Blake mentioned that he had left a bag at the house, that he had not received it back, and that he wanted it back. Blake mentioned that the bag contained his merchandise. Sergeant Starks asked that Robert's uncle bring the bag to him. Robert's uncle gave Sergeant Starks the bag outside the presence of Blake, so Sergeant Starks took the bag to Blake and opened it in Blake's presence in order to document its contents because he did not want Blake to accuse him of taking something. He stated that he was not searching for evidence, but when he located the warming gel on the top, he took it for evidence. Sergeant Stark stated that he did not have any evidence to connect the gel to the allegations in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 50. The court found that the gel was admissible under Rule 404(b) as evidence of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, and knowledge, and that it was more probative than prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 51. In the presence of the jury, the State asked Sergeant Starks if he was familiar with toothpaste. The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Q. Does toothpaste come in a container?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   A. Yes, sir. Toothpaste comes in tubes or it comes in cylinders, of course,\n   long cylinders also, but it all - most of the ones I get come in tubes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Q. Does it come in a box, as well?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Q. Was this contained in a box even though it was not toothpaste?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   A. No, sir, it was not in the box.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The State did not adduce any evidence that this warming gel is normally packaged in a box. Sergeant Starks testified that he did not check the tube to see if it had been opened. The photograph of the tube does not indicate any depressions that would indicate use. The actual tube, which was admitted into evidence, has been retained at the circuit court. The photographs also showed several unpackaged latex gloves (at least ten). No witness testified that those gloves appeared to have been used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 52. The bag did not appear in any of Sergeant Starks's many photographs of the home taken the night of September 3, 2012. Sergeant Stark testified that, during his investigation of the house, he did not find any warming gel or latex gloves. He stated that the seat alleged to be the scene of the crime did not appear to be out of order or to have any liquids or foreign substances on it. Robert's mother testified that she never saw Blake bring the bag in the home, and that she only found out about the bag afterward. His uncle's partner testified that Blake had the bag when he arrived. His sister testified that Blake arrived with the bag and placed it in the front room. No witness testified that Blake moved or touched the bag after entering the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 53. During closing arguments, the State mentioned the gel, stating that \"what makes its [sic] even more telling is this man shows up with a book bag and in that book bag are latex gloves and jelly.\" Blake's argument primarily focused on the existence of reasonable doubt as to the element of penetration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 54. The trial court found (and the State argued at trial) that the gel and gloves were admissible under Rule 404(b) to show motive, intent, knowledge, and plan. Yet, Rule 404(b) governs evidence of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts.\" Miss. R. Evid. 404(b). The State did not demonstrate that the gel and gloves were evidence of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts,\" so Rule 404(b) is inapposite and inapplicable, and the trial court erred in utilizing it to admit the evidence. The State appears to have abandoned the Rule 404(b) argument on appeal, and argues that the evidence was otherwise admissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 55.

Rule 401 states that evidence must make a fact more or less\n   <em>\n    probable\n   </em>\n   . The speculative \"intent\" the warming gel purports to show is no more likely than any other motive, such as: he was planning on selling the gel as merchandise (it was contained in his merchandise bag), he was planning a rendezvous with an adult later, he carried it in case of a chance encounter with an adult, part of his body had chafing problems and he used the gel to lubricate, or many other possible uses that are just as likely, if not more likely, than the intent to commit sexual battery. The majority problematically states that \"[t]he fact Blake packed a tube of warming gel lubricant and latex gloves for a family barbeque he knew children would attend certainly goes to the relevant question of Blake's intent that day.\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 43. First, this statement assumes facts not contained in the record: nothing in the record indicates when Blake packed the gel and gloves or why, or that he packed them\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   the barbeque; rather, the record indicates that he always carried this bag and that it contained merchandise that he sold. Second, such a sweeping statement regarding what sort of evidence is probative of intent places every person who carries a condom under suspicion of intent to commit a sexual crime. Not every remote item that might indicate sexual activity is probative of evidence of a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 56. The evidence shows only that, at some point on the day of the incident, Blake's bag was on the property. No witness testified that on the day of the crime they saw the contents of the bag, which tended to contain his \"merchandise.\" No evidence exists that the bag or anything in it was used during the crime. No evidence placed the bag in the same room as the crime during the crime.

The gel and gloves were not located during Sergeant Starks's investigation of the property at which the alleged crime occurred, and were not found at the scene.

Furthermore, no witness testified as to the location of the objects during the crime, or immediately prior to or subsequent to the crime.

Even if the gel and gloves are relevant, they are more prejudicial than probative.

Given that no evidence connected the gel and gloves to the alleged battery, any probative value of the objects is negligible. The State implied that these objects were sexual in nature, which invited rampant speculation and could easily inflame the jury, especially in a child sexual abuse case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v.

The majority finds that the admission of this evidence was harmless because the evidence against Blake is \"overwhelming.\" While I agree that the evidence is overwhelming that Blake did\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   untoward to Robert, the evidence of\n   <em>\n    penetration\n   </em>\n   is not overwhelming. Robert's testimony regarding whether Blake touched the outside of buttocks or penetrated his anus was unclear. He testified that Blake was \"digging in his butt\" and also that he told the forensic interviewer that Blake touched him \"on\" his buttocks. The forensic interviewer testified that Robert's initial disclosure was that Blake had touched Robert \"on\" his buttocks. Robert did not mentioned that Blake touched him inside his buttocks. Only after the interviewer asked clarifying questions did Robert state that Blake touched him inside his buttocks. The forensic interviewer's testimony regarding what Robert told her thus indicated that he used both \"on\" and \"in,\" and that he had used \"in\" only after she asked follow-up questions. None of the witnesses testified that they saw actual penetration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 62.
