For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Sasol Chemicals (USA), L.L.C. (Sasol), a South African company doing business in the United States, is currently constructing and developing a new chemical facility known as the Sasol Megaproject in Calcasieu Parish. The Meyers own more than five acres of landlocked residential and commercial property (hereafter \"the property\") in the site where the Megaproject is being constructed. Mr. Meyers operates his business, M &amp; D Construction, on the property, which is located near many of M &amp; D Construction's industrial clients. For several years, Sasol made offers to the Meyers for the purchase of their property, but no agreement was reached between them due to the Meyers' belief that Sasol's offers did not reflect the fair market value of their property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   During a November 17, 2014 meeting of the District's Board of Commissioners (the Board), Resolution 2014-056 (the Resolution) was unanimously adopted, whereby the District made findings and provided \"certain assurances with respect to the acquisition of property needed\" for the Megaproject.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board noted in the Resolution that in 2011, the District had been \"instrumental in obtaining, for the benefit of SASOL, a six hundred (600) acre parcel\n   ... within the territorial limits of the District ... which enabled Sasol to choose the Southwest Louisiana area for the Sasol Megaproject over another competing location in Canada.\" It further explained that the Megaproject would be built with \"heavy equipment and large modules that will be pre-assembled off-site and delivered by vessels berthed at a dock in close proximity to the Plant Site Property which will then be transported overland to the Plant Site Property.\" According to the Resolution, Sasol intended to make a \"$16-$21 billion capital investment\" for its Megaproject, the construction and operation of which would \"promote economic development in the area.\" The Resolution stated that Sasol had purchased the majority of properties within the proposed site of the Megaproject and that it needed the District's help in acquiring the remaining twenty-four privately owned properties. The Resolution authorized and directed the District \"to take all steps deemed necessary and appropriate\" to acquire ownership of, by voluntary purchase or quick-take expropriation, those needed properties, one of which was owned by the Meyers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In January 2015, the Meyers filed a petition for intervention joining another affected homeowner in an action he had filed in the trial court challenging the District's expropriation authority and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District made a written offer to purchase the Meyers' property, for an amount approximately $2,000,000 less than what the Meyers had been offered by Sasol in April 2015. The Meyers rejected the District's offer and made a counteroffer. Soon afterward, the Meyers filed an amended petition of intervention to seek a judicial declaration that the Resolution violated and was not authorized by the Louisiana Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   By letter dated August 8, 2016, the District declined to accept the Meyers' counteroffer. The letter contained a warning that should the parties be \"unable to agree to a voluntary transfer\" of the property, \"\n   <strong>\n    the District intends to proceed with initiated legal proceedings to expropriate\n   </strong>\n   \" the property through the methods authorized in the Louisiana Constitution and the Louisiana Revised Statutes. (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Following an August 31, 2016 evidentiary hearing, the trial court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the Meyers, \"enjoining and barring\" the District from expropriating any portion of their property located at 2755 Houston River Road in Westlake, Louisiana. The District now appeals, asserting in its sole assignment of error that the trial court abused its discretion in enjoining it \"from exercising its constitutional right to file suit to expropriate the Meyers' property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"A trial court's determination as to whether to issue a preliminary injunction is subject to the abuse of discretion standard of review.\"\n   <em>\n    Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church v.

More specifically, the District asserts that injunctive relief is inappropriate in this case because were it to file suit to expropriate the Meyers' property, even by a quick-taking, the procedures listed in Title 19 will allow the Meyers to assert their objections to the expropriation and the safeguards provided therein will prevent the Meyers from suffering any irreparable injury. Along those lines, the District points out that the supreme court has held that the quick-taking expropriation statutes are constitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State, through Dep't of Highways v.

Finally, the District argues that whether the expropriation it threatened against the Meyers is constitutional is irrelevant for purposes of whether it should have been enjoined from expropriating the Meyers' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Meyers counter that the District's arguments are fundamentally flawed because they rest on the incorrect assumption that the District has the lawful right to expropriate their property. The Meyers insist that the Resolution authorizing the District to expropriate their property is unconstitutional because it fails to articulate a public purpose beyond that of a general benefit to the local economy, which the Louisiana Constitution now forbids consideration of in determining if the taking is for a public purpose. Instead, the Meyers submit that the sole purpose of the Resolution is to deprive them of their private property for the sole benefit of another private, for-profit, foreign-controlled company. According to the Meyers, the District's actions in this matter amount to nothing short of the selling of its expropriation powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Meyers direct this court's attention to a recent supreme court decision that discusses the limits of a public port's expropriation power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Bernard Port, Harbor &amp; Terminal Dist. v.

Rase, III, Executive Director of the Port of Lake Charles (the Port). Mr. Rase testified that he was present at the November 17, 2014 meeting during which the Board approved the Resolution. According to Mr. Rase, the Port had \"entered into an agreement with Sasol for a lease on a dock and then to provide what was required to have them go forward with their expansion\" before it passed the Resolution.\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Rase confirmed that were it not for Sasol's Megaproject, the District would not have looked at acquiring the Meyers' property\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The other evidence that the Meyers entered into the record at the preliminary injunction hearing included the aforementioned correspondence between the District and the Meyers; a letter from the Calcasieu Parish Assessor, verifying that the Meyers' property has a homestead exemption; and a copy of a Receipt, Release, and Indemnification Agreement between Ryan and the District showing that they had entered into a settlement of Ryan's claims against them in this matter for the sum of $291,666.67. Upon questioning by the Meyers' attorney, Mr. Rase agreed that given the sizes of the properties, the District was paying Ryan $145.00 per square foot versus the less than $4.00 per square foot that the District offered to the Meyers when it issued the ultimatum to them several weeks before. The District did not offer any exhibits at the preliminary injunction hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After hearing closing arguments, the trial court expressed its opinion that, contrary to what was provided in the Resolution, Sasol had not exhausted its efforts to\n   voluntarily acquire the Meyers' property. Referencing the appraisal attached to the letter in which the Meyers made a counteroffer to the District's offer to buy their property, the trial court noted that given \"what's being paid on the fair market, it would be wrong for this court not to intervene.\" Ultimately, the trial court found that the District had improperly agreed \"to do for Sasol that which Sasol can do for itself.\" Accordingly, the trial court enjoined the District from filing suit to expropriate the Meyers' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We conclude that the Meyers met their burden of making \"a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing\" that the Resolution authorizing the taking of their property is unconstitutional because: 1) there is no public purpose to support it, in violation of La.Const. art. I, \u00a7 4 ; 2 ) their property would be transferred to a foreign-controlled entity, in violation of La.Const. art. VI, \u00a7 21 (B); and 3) their property is covered by a homestead exemption and, thus, cannot be expropriated per La.Const. art. VI, \u00a7 21 (D).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jurisich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11485562\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/749/597/#p599\">\n    749 So.2d at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, we find it important to note that the District put the Meyers between a rock and a hard place by threatening to expropriate their property if they refused to accept what the trial court found to be a low-ball offer. In addition, the District stands behind its Resolution to expropriate the Meyers' property, and it refuses to address the Meyers' claims of its unconstitutionality, insisting that even if the Meyers' claims are valid, they will not suffer any irreparable injury because their objections can be addressed in the expropriation suit, should the District ever choose to file one. Given the circumstances, we conclude that the Meyers' right to own private property must prevail over those of the District. Our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the United States Supreme Court has chosen to review, on a petition for certiorari,\n   <em>\n    Violet Dock\n   </em>\n   , despite the fact that the St. Bernard Port made a stronger, yet arguably questionable, argument as to the existence of a valid public purpose for expropriation in that matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its great discretion in granting a preliminary injunction barring the District from filing suit to expropriate the Meyers' property. This matter will be remanded for the trial court to determine the constitutionality of the Resolution authorizing the District to expropriate the Meyers' property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The judgment of the trial court granting a preliminary injunction in favor of Vernon Christopher Meyer and Carla Michelle Meyer, enjoining the Lake Charles Harbor and Terminal District from expropriating their property at 2755 Houston River Road in Westlake, Louisiana is affirmed. This matter is remanded to the trial court to hold a hearing to determine whether the Resolution is unconstitutional such that the District should be permanently enjoined from enforcing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

Subsequently, Mr. Ryan amended his petition to add the District as a defendant and seeking to enjoin the District from expropriating his property and to obtain a declaratory judgment finding that his property cannot be subject to expropriation by the District.

The offer by the Meyers has been outstanding for months.
