Mr. LeBlanc alleges a ten-year prescription based on detrimental reliance and unjust enrichment, while Thibodeaux asserts a liberative prescription of three years arguing a claim for money owed. Finding no manifest error on the part of the trial judge, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We must decide whether the trial court was manifestly erroneous in finding that the plaintiff's action against the defendants had prescribed and in dismissing the plaintiff's suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Virginia Thibodeaux owned a business called Country Windshields in Arnaudville, Louisiana. Her husband, Fred Thibodeaux, described himself as the shop foreman. Randy LeBlanc apparently owned LeBlanc's Automotive and Glass LLC in Lafayette. In February 2009, Randy LeBlanc and Fred Thibodeaux discussed the sale of Thibodeaux's windshield business to LeBlanc. Mr. LeBlanc alleges that the parties reached an agreement on an installment-type sale of the building for $3,000 per month for twelve years. Mr. Thibodeaux states that he and Mr. LeBlanc discussed $3,000 per month, but only as an estimate; that Mr. LeBlanc was in a hurry for some reason; that he (Mr. Thibodeaux) was not ready to finalize a contract to sell; that he had not \"spoken to the boss\" (Virginia Thibodeaux); and that negotiations were ongoing when the parties reached an impasse in May of 2009. It is undisputed that Mr. LeBlanc never paid any installments or monthly payments to Thibodeaux. Mr. Thibodeaux testified that there were never any signed papers; and that there was no agreement, no contract, and nothing final between them regarding a sale. The record contains no written contract or agreement between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Around February of 2009, Mr. LeBlanc asked, and was given permission, to build offices in part of Thibodeaux's building. He incurred expenses in the form of lumber and material purchases for flooring, wiring, painting, electrical supplies, and labor. He also sent two of his employees to inspection school at the cost of $160 each. When the impasse on the sale price was reached in May of 2009, Mr. Thibodeaux agreed to pay for Mr. LeBlanc's expenditures, and he asked for LeBlanc's bills. The record contains an invoice dated May 7, 2009, from \"LeBlanc's Automotive and Glass LLC\" in Lafayette, listing materials and labor \"Sold to\" \"Country Windshields\" in St. Martinville. The total on the invoice is $14,244.35. Mr. LeBlanc incorporated the text of this invoice into his petition and entered the invoice as \"Plaintiff's Exhibit 1.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. LeBlanc's only other exhibit was a copy of a check dated May 8, 2009, written by payor \"Country Windshields, Inc.\" to payee \"LeBlanc's Automotive and Glass\" in the amount of $14,104.35, which Mr. LeBlanc entered as \"Plaintiff's Exhibit 2.\" Mr. LeBlanc testified that a copy of Thibodeaux's check was faxed to him, but he never received the actual instrument/check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. LeBlanc testified that he went to Thibodeaux's house and lawyer's office repeatedly, but never got paid. Mr. Thibodeaux testified that LeBlanc brought additional receipts; that Mr. Thibodeaux wrote an even larger check than the above-referenced; and that he called LeBlanc repeatedly to pick up the check at the lawyer's office, but LeBlanc would not answer his phone. In questioning Mr. LeBlanc, Mr. Thibodeaux's attorney asked if Mr. LeBlanc had refused to sign the release that accompanied the check, and Mr. LeBlanc indicated that was because the check was for only $6,000 at that time. The only testimony given was that of Mr. LeBlanc and Mr. Thibodeaux, and the only exhibits entered were those of the plaintiff described in the preceding paragraph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. LeBlanc filed suit in November of 2014, over five years after the invoice/demand was given to Thibodeaux in May of 2009. Thibodeaux brought an exception of prescription. After some initial no-shows by the plaintiff and/or his lawyer, the exception was tried, with the above testimony\n   and evidence entered into the record. The trial court granted the exception, and Mr. LeBlanc filed the appeal now under review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Ordinarily, the exceptor bears the burden of proof at the trial of the peremptory exception.\n   <em>\n    Campo v.

In support of his position, Mr. LeBlanc argues that (1) a valid oral contract existed under La.Civ.Code arts. 1906\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 1927,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which Thibodeaux breached by refusing to sell the property. Mr. LeBlanc further argues that (2) he sustained damages under La.Civ.Code art. 1967 because he detrimentally relied upon Mr. Thibodeaux's promise to sell, which is also in the contract realm. Mr. LeBlanc finally argues that (3) Thibodeaux was unjustly enriched under La.Civ.Code art. 2298 by Mr. LeBlanc's expenditures, also arising under a ten-year prescriptive period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Thibodeaux, on the other hand, argues that there was no contract, agreement, or promise to sell; and that the applicable prescriptive period is three years under La.Civ.Code art. 3494 because LeBlanc's action is for the recovery of money owed and compensation for services rendered, or, an action on an open account. Thus, he argues, the action is prescribed. Thibodeaux further argues that, because the amount of the alleged contract was well over $500, the contract or agreement must be proved by at least one witness\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   corroborating circumstances, pursuant to La.Civ.Code art. 1846, which it was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We find no manifest error in the trial court's judgment granting the Thibodeaux's exception of prescription and dismissing Mr. LeBlanc's suit. The parties are conflating a contract to sell Country Windshields and the obligation to repay the money that Mr. LeBlanc spent on a building that he did not own. We agree with Thibodeaux that the contract to sell the business was never perfected. It was\n   never reduced to writing, which is a requirement for the sale of immovable property.

It is well-settled: \"The character of an action disclosed in the pleadings determines the prescriptive period applicable to that action.\"\n   <em>\n    Starns v.

A suit to recover money is specifically addressed in La.Civ.Code art. 3494, and it is this article's three-year prescriptive period that applies in this case. Its applicability turns on the\n   <em>\n    specificity\n   </em>\n   of La.Civ.Code art. 3494 and the fact that it is an\n   <em>\n    exception\n   </em>\n   to the\n   <em>\n    residual\n   </em>\n   rule in La.Civ.Code art. 3499.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Comparison of Articles 3494 and 3499\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Louisiana Civil Code Article 3494, prior to its amendment in 2018, stated in pertinent part (emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The following actions are subject to a liberative prescription of three years:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    An action for the recovery of compensation for services rendered\n   </em>\n   , including payment of salaries, wages, commissions,\n   <em>\n    tuition fees\n   </em>\n   , professional fees, fees and emoluments of public officials, freight, passage,\n   <em>\n    money\n   </em>\n   , lodging, and board;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (4)\n   <em>\n    An action on an open account\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Louisiana Civil Code Article 3499 states (emphasis added): \"\n   <em>\n    Unless otherwise provided by legislation\n   </em>\n   , a personal action is subject to a liberative prescription of ten years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Grabert v.

Mr. LeBlanc testified that his employees and a financial advisor were with him at one meeting with Mr. Thibodeaux, but he did not call them as witnesses or even provide affidavits from them regarding what they heard or saw. In addition to La.Civ.Code arts. 2440 and 1832, which require the sale of an immovable to be in writing, La.Civ.Code art. 1846 provides that if a contract is valued at over $500, its existence \"must be proved by at\n   least one witness and other corroborating circumstances.\" No such proof has been submitted in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Further, the record reveals that Mr. Thibodeaux did not\n   <em>\n    induce\n   </em>\n   Mr. LeBlanc to prematurely spend his own money on Thibodeaux's building. It was Mr. LeBlanc\n   <em>\n    who asked\n   </em>\n   to build the offices. He seemed in a hurry, and Thibodeaux allowed him to proceed. In discussing a sale, there is no evidence that Thibodeaux required any consideration from Mr. LeBlanc in the form of a down payment or an earnest money deposit of any kind. He did not even require a single rent payment from Mr. LeBlanc. Such a promise, if made, would have been a gratuitous promise, and gratuitous promises are not enforceable under La.Civ.Code art. 1967 if formalities are required but not observed. The sale of an immovable is required to be in writing. In fact, even a\n   <em>\n    promise to sell\n   </em>\n   an immovable must be in writing. \"A sale or promise of sale of an immovable must be made by authentic act or by act under private signature, except as provided in Article 1839.\" La.Civ.Code art. 2440.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Detrimental reliance is generally based upon an oral promise that imposes a burden upon the other party; such a promise is\n   <em>\n    onerous\n   </em>\n   because of the burden imposed.\n   <em>\n    Cenac v.

Regardless of whose fault it was, LeBlanc was never paid. If LeBlanc had pursued his remedy on the invoice within the time allowed under La.Civ.Code art. 3494, he likely would have recovered some money.
