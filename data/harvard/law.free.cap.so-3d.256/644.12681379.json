Foster then testified that Thomas again left her house with M.A., approximately 20 minutes later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Foster testified that she did not notice anything unusual about Thomas while he was at her house. Foster also testified that she did not see Thomas consume any alcohol or prescription medications while he was at her house. Foster further testified that she would not have allowed M.A. to leave with Thomas if Foster had thought that Thomas was intoxicated, impaired, or unable to operate a vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thomas testified that, while he was at Foster's house, he took Seroquel, a prescription drug, and drank beer. Thomas also testified that, in addition to his prescription for Seroquel, he had prescriptions for other drugs; Thomas testified that it was possible that he had taken some of those prescription drugs in addition to the Seroquel within 24 hours of the accident. Thomas also testified that he purchased beer-\"a tallboy\"-while on his errand to the Dollar General discount store. When asked if it was possible that he had purchased more than one beer, Thomas responded, \"[a]nything is possible.\" Thomas further testified that while he was at Foster's house he drank \"one tallboy beer\" and that he was not sure if he had drunk more than the one beer. Thomas also testified that he \"could have\" drunk more than one beer. Thomas testified that he \"remember[ed] not being impaired when [he] left the driveway\" of Foster's house with M.A. When asked whether he was impaired at the time he was driving toward the intersection just before the accident, Thomas replied, \"[n]o, sir, not that I know of.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jack Sewell, a pharmacist at the pharmacy where Thomas filled his prescriptions, testified that some of the prescriptions he filled for Thomas, including Seroquel, cause drowsiness. Sewell testified that drinking alcohol with these prescriptions would \"just add[ ] to\" that drowsiness effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thomas left Foster's house at approximately 4:40 p.m. with M.A. in his vehicle and drove south on County Road 41. At approximately 5:00 p.m., Thomas was approaching the intersection of County Road 41 and State Highway 167 (\"the intersection\"), which is where the accident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   There are stop signs on County Road 41 requiring the traffic traveling on County Road 41 to yield to the traffic traveling on State Highway 167; there are no stop signs halting traffic traveling on State Highway 167. Thomas testified that he drove over several \"rumble strips\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on County Road 41 as he approached the intersection. Thomas drove his vehicle into the intersection without stopping at the stop sign on County Road 41. Thomas's vehicle collided with the vehicle being driven by Randell Heard. Thomas testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[Wells's trial counsel:] Why didn't you see the stop sign?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[Thomas:] I can't tell you that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[Wells's trial counsel:] Why didn't you stop at the stop sign?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[Thomas:] I can't tell you that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[Wells's trial counsel:] Why didn't you see the Heards traveling in their silver car to your right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[Thomas:] I can't tell you that.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Elizabeth Mims witnessed the accident. Mims testified that it appeared that Thomas slowed his vehicle before entering the intersection but did not completely stop his vehicle. Mims testified that she witnessed Thomas drive his vehicle into the intersection in front of the Heards' vehicle, which, she said, caused the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the accident occurred, Mims checked on the occupants of both vehicles. Mims testified that \"when [she] got to\" Thomas's vehicle she could smell alcohol. Mims later clarified that, although she was certain that the odor of alcohol was coming from Thomas's vehicle, she could not identify the source of the odor of alcohol. Mims also testified that she spoke with another woman at the scene of the accident who also indicated that she smelled alcohol. However, Mims did not indicate where at the scene of the accident this other woman had smelled alcohol; specifically, Mims did not testify that this other woman smelled alcohol emanating from Thomas or his vehicle. Chris Sirois, an emergency medical technician dispatched to the scene, testified that he did not smell alcohol while he was \"treating or paying attention to\" M.A., who was in the vehicle driven by Thomas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thomas, M.A., and the Heards sustained serious injuries as a result of the accident and were transported to medical facilities for emergency care; Thomas was transported to Southeast Alabama Medical Center (\"SAMC\"). Upon Thomas's arrival at SAMC's emergency room, Danielle Stanridge, a laboratory technician at SAMC, testified that she drew blood from Thomas in order to run a medical analysis of Thomas's blood, which she said was the \"common and customary\" practice. Stanridge used an alcohol swab to sterilize Thomas's arm before she drew his blood sample.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   SAMC conducted a \"medical-alcohol test\" as part of the analysis performed on Thomas's blood sample. Dr. Jack Kalin, the former chief toxicologist of the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences and a private consultant in forensic technology certified in forensic technology by the American Board of Forensic Technology, explained that the medical-alcohol test performed by SAMC on Thomas's blood sample tested for the concentration of ethanol in Thomas's blood sample. Jeff Sheppard, who was SAMC's laboratory director at the time of the accident, testified that the presence and amount of alcohol in a patient's blood sample is important information for the treating physician to have\n   in deciding whether to use anesthesia on the patient or to prescribe prescription drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sheppard testified that the medical-alcohol test conducted on Thomas's blood sample indicated that Thomas's blood sample had a \"value\" of \"68 milligrams per deciliter.\" Sheppard testified that this was an \"abnormal\" result, which was explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[Wells's trial counsel:] For example, if I've had a cholesterol test done, it tells me here's the normal range, and if mine is high, it will report back above normal. Is that kind of what this is telling us?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[Sheppard:] Yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dr. Kalin testified that, based on Thomas's blood sample containing 68 milligrams of alcohol per deciliter, Thomas's blood-alcohol concentration \"would have been somewhere between a .05 grams percent and a .06 grams percent.\" Dr. Kalin testified that, based on Thomas's blood-alcohol concentration of .05% to .06%, he opined that Thomas would have consumed \"two to three beers, rather than just one.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dr. Jimmie Valentine, a consultant in clinical pharmacology and toxicology, who was called as a witness by Thomas, testified that the method used to collect Thomas's blood sample and to test for the presence of alcohol was not performed pursuant to forensic standards. For instance, Dr. Valentine testified that, if a sample of Thomas's blood had been taken for the specific purpose of testing it to determine Thomas's blood-alcohol concentration, an alcohol swab should not have been used to sterilize Thomas's arm before his blood was drawn. Dr. Valentine testified that, when an alcohol swab is used to clean the skin, some of the alcohol could be absorbed into the skin, which could contaminate the blood sample drawn. Dr. Valentine explained that the test conducted by SAMC on Thomas's blood sample to determine the presence of alcohol did not reveal the specific type of alcohol present in Thomas's blood sample. Dr. Valentine explained that the alcohol swab used by Stanridge to sterilize Thomas's arm probably contained isopropyl alcohol, while the beer Thomas drank contained ethanol alcohol. Dr. Valentine further explained that the test run by SAMC on Thomas's blood sample would have detected both kinds of alcohol, among other things, generally; there was no way to tell if Thomas's blood sample had been contaminated with the isopropyl alcohol from the alcohol swab. Dr. Valentine testified that the preferred method \"for doing alcohol analysis\" is a method called \"gas chromatograph.\" SAMC did not use the gas-chromatograph method in determining that Thomas's blood sample contained 68 milligrams per deciliter. Regardless, accepting that Thomas's blood sample contained 68 milligrams of ethanol per deciliter, Dr. Valentine agreed with Dr. Kalin's assessment of Thomas's blood-alcohol concentration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Dr. Kalin testified that it is possible for people with a blood-alcohol concentration of less than .08% to be impaired and to have difficulty driving:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[Heards' trial counsel:] And a blood/alcohol of a .08, you use the word intoxicated, in your area of expertise, can individuals be impaired such as they are unsafe and unfit to drive an automobile at less than a level of .08?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"[Dr. Kalin:] State law provides a presumption that .08 or greater, then you are under the influence of alcohol. However, state law also recognizes the scientific reality that people below .08 can be impaired and have difficulty driving. So, if someone can be demonstrated to be impaired with an ethanol concentration\n   of less than .08, they can be convicted of drunk driving.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Dr. Kalin explained the effects Thomas may have experienced as a result of his blood-alcohol concentration of .05% to .06%:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[Heards' trial counsel:] ... What effect could you expect to see in Mr. Thomas with the level of blood/alcohol content of .05 to .06 that you've described?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"[Dr. Kalin:] I'm going to answer your question literally-you would see nothing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"[Heards' trial counsel:] In other words, would someone be able to visually tell if you were intoxicated or impaired?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"[Dr. Kalin:] Quite possibly not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"[Heards' trial counsel:] Would there be effects to Mr. Thomas at that level?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[Dr. Kalin:] Yes, there would be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"[Heards' trial counsel:] And in reaching that opinion, are you trained in that regard in all of your training with the State Of Alabama and your toxicological research?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"[Dr. Kalin:] Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"[Heards' trial counsel:] And is that part of what you have always done for the State Of Alabama?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"[Dr. Kalin:] Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"[Heards' trial counsel:] Can you tell us what those affects would be?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"[Dr. Kalin:] The .05 to .06 you would expect the person's inhibitions to be inhibited. Ethanol is a central nervous system depressant, which means it turns things off. The first thing it turns off is your higher mental functions and that's the little voice in the back of your head that tells you to behave. That's why a couple of drinks at a party make you talk, maybe you shouldn't say what you're saying, but nonetheless you do. That's a little bit of a buzz, you feel a little bit of euphoria, you may be at the greater risk-well, more prone to risky activity. You would be surprised over how many people get in fights over these levels of alcohol because their inhibitions are inhibited. You're going to have some fine motor skill problems, how many things can you juggle at one time. You may do okay, but you're certainly not going to do as well as you would otherwise without the ethanol. Your judgment is going to be a problem in what you see, what you perceive, what you think, what you know. That's all impaired even by low levels of ethanol. That's what the buzz is, the buzz is something that makes you care less about your circumstances than you probably otherwise should.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"You may experience some visual acuity problems, you may have difficulty focusing and you may not see very-as well as you would otherwise, or you may see well enough, but one of the things that you do lose is your peripheral vision,\n   where people can't see what's coming on the sides. I'm sorry I'm holding up my hand in front of the Court Reporter, but that's a demonstration of what peripheral vision is. I can see something out the side of my head, I don't have to turn left or right to see traffic coming. This is a common problem that some people experience with low levels of alcohol, the loss of that capability, you just don't see it, you never see it coming.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"So, you're not going to have a problem typically with your speech, other than you're probably going to use much more of it than you should.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"You're not going to have problems with your balance. You can probably stand up and move around and not have much of a problem, but that doesn't mean that you will have all your faculties sufficiently to do complicated tasks.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   However, Dr. Kalin also testified that, although everyone experiences the same effects of alcohol, not everyone experiences them at the same blood-alcohol concentration. (R. 203.) For instance, Dr. Kalin testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"[Thomas's trial counsel:] And that was the purpose in asking that because although you describe that there may be visual acuity, there may be peripheral vision impacted, there may be judgment impacted with this level of blood/alcohol concentration that you say existed, does not mean that Mr. Thomas was experiencing those things, does it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \"[Dr. Kalin:] That's correct.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On November 29, 2013, Wells, \"in her capacity as guardian ad litem and next friend\" of M.A., sued Thomas, among others, asserting claims of negligence and wantonness. On January 24, 2014, in a separate action, the Heards sued Thomas, among others, asserting claims of negligence and wantonness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thomas answered both complaints. The trial court consolidated the two actions for purposes of discovery and trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On August 11, 2015, Thomas filed a motion to \"strike, dismiss, and/or remove\" Wells as the \"representative\" of M.A. Thomas noted that the Houston Juvenile Court had appointed Wells as M.A.'s \"juvenile attorney\" on June 26, 2012. However, Thomas argued that, pursuant to \u00a7 6-5-390, Ala. Code 1975, Wells had no legal authority to file the underlying action against Thomas. Section 6-5-390 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"A father or a mother, provided they are lawfully living together as husband and wife, shall have an equal right to commence an action for an injury to their minor child, a member of the family; provided, however, that in the event such mother and father are not lawfully living together as husband and wife, or in the event legal custody of such minor child has been lawfully vested in either of the parties or some third party, then and in either event the party having legal custody of such minor child shall have the exclusive right to commence such action.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On August 13, 2015, Wells filed a response, arguing that the underlying action \"was properly commenced in the name of the guardian ad litem for the benefit of\" M.A. The trial court did not rule on Thomas's motion. Instead, on August 21, 2015, the trial court entered an order appointing\n   Wells as guardian ad litem and next of friend of M.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Trial began on August 24, 2015. At the close of the Heards' and Wells's cases, Thomas filed a motion for a judgment as a matter of law (\"JML\"). Generally, Thomas alleged that the Heards and Wells had failed to present sufficient evidence to support their negligence and wantonness claims. The trial court denied Thomas's motion for a JML. At the close of all the evidence, Thomas again filed a motion for a JML, raising the same issues he had raised in his initial motion. The trial court denied Thomas's second JML motion, and the case was submitted to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On August 28, 2015, the jury returned a verdict against Thomas and in favor of the Heards, upon which the trial court entered the following judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"Case tried to a jury and the jury returned the following verdict:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \" 'We, the jury, find for the plaintiffs and against the defendant and assess plaintiffs' damages as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \" '\n   <em>\n    Randell Heard\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \" 'Compensatory: Eight hundred fifty thousand dollars ($850,000).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \" 'Punitive: Seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \" '\n   <em>\n    Donna Heard\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \" 'Compensatory: Four hundred fifty thousand dollars ($450,000).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \" 'Punitive: Seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000).'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \"The Court enters the judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The jury also returned a verdict in favor of Wells, upon which the trial court entered its judgment, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \"Case tried to a jury and the jury returned the following verdict:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \" 'We, the jury, find for the plaintiff and against the defendant and assess plaintiff's damages as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \" '[\n   <em>\n    M.A.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \" 'Compensatory: Five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \" 'Punitive: Five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \"The Court enters the judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   On September 11, 2015, the Heards filed a \"motion for costs\" requesting costs in the amount of $21,140.30. On September 15, 2015, Wells also filed a \"motion to tax costs\" requesting costs in the amount of $17,221.54. Each motion was supported with extensive documentary evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   On September 25, 2015, Thomas filed a motion to alter, amend or vacate the trial court's August 28, 2015, judgments. Thomas argued, among other things, that the \"jury's award of damages based on wantonness was against the great weight of the evidence\" and that the \"jury's award of punitive damages was not supported by clear and convincing evidence.\" Thomas also argued that, under \u00a7 6-5-390, \"Wells was not entitled to make any claim on behalf of [M.A.].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Also on September 25, 2015, Thomas filed a renewed motion for a JML. As he did in his first two JML motions, Thomas argued that the Heards and Wells had failed to present sufficient evidence to support their negligence and wantonness claims and that they had failed to present sufficient evidence to support the jury's award of punitive damages. Thomas also argued that, pursuant to \u00a7 6-5-390, \"Wells is not allowed under Alabama law to pursue damages for [M.A.].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Also on September 25, 2015, Thomas filed a motion for a remittitur, which he amended on October 9, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On October 19, 2015, following a hearing, the trial court denied Thomas's postjudgment motions and granted the motions for costs filed by the Heards and Wells. Thomas separately appealed as to the Heards and Wells. We have consolidated the two appeals for the purpose of writing one opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Cheshire v.

In the present case, it is undisputed that Thomas drove his vehicle into the intersection without coming to a complete stop at the stop sign regulating traffic traveling south on County Road 41. The evidence indicates that Thomas slowed his vehicle as he approached the intersection but that he did not bring his vehicle to a complete stop before he drove into the intersection, where the collision occurred. There is no evidence indicating that Thomas was driving his vehicle at an unsafe speed. There is evidence indicating that Thomas drank at least one \"tallboy\" beer and that he took a Seroquel pill before leaving Foster's house. There was testimony presented that Seroquel causes drowsiness and that that effect would be exacerbated by alcohol. There was also evidence presented indicating that Thomas drank more than one\n   beer. In fact, the evidence indicates that Thomas's blood-alcohol concentration \"would have been somewhere between a .05 grams percent and a .06 grams percent.\" The evidence also indicates that witnesses smelled alcohol in the area of Thomas's vehicle immediately after the accident. Dr. Kalin testified as to the effects a person with a blood-alcohol concentration of .05% to .06% may experience. Dr. Kalin testified that a person with a blood-alcohol concentration of .05% to .06% may be \"more prone to risky activity\"; may have \"some fine motor skill problems, how many things can you juggle at one time\"; and \"may experience some visual acuity problems,\" including potential loss of peripheral vision. However, Dr. Kalin testified that there was no evidence indicating that Thomas was actually experiencing these effects. Further, Thomas explicitly testified that he was not impaired when he left Foster's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Viewing these facts in a light most favorable to the Heards and Wells, as we must, there is substantial evidence that Thomas drove his vehicle into the intersection without stopping at the stop sign regulating traffic on County Road 41, and that his driving so caused the accident. There is substantial evidence that Thomas drove his vehicle while he had a blood-alcohol concentration of .05% to .06%. There is also substantial evidence from which the jury could infer that, while Thomas was driving his vehicle with a blood-alcohol concentration of .05% to .06%, Thomas was experiencing the above-mentioned effects testified to by Dr. Kalin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Thomas argues that, based on this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Essary\n   </em>\n   , these facts are not substantial evidence of wantonness. In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Essary\n   </em>\n   , Essary failed to completely stop at a stop sign before he drove his vehicle into an intersection, thereby causing an accident. Essary's vehicle collided with another vehicle, causing serious injuries to the occupants of the other vehicle. The facts indicated that Essary had come to a \"rolling stop\" and had tried to \"shoot the gap\" between two vehicles. The occupants of the vehicle Essary's vehicle collided with sued Essary, alleging negligence and wantonness. Essary filed a motion for a JML as to the wantonness claim. The trial court granted Essary's JML motion, but the Court of Civil Appeals reversed the trial court's judgment. On appeal, this Court reversed the Court of Civil Appeals' decision, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   \"Although the evidence indicates that Essary knowingly entered the intersection, there is nothing from which the trier of fact could infer that, in moving his vehicle through the intersection, Essary's state of mind contained the requisite consciousness, awareness, or perception that\n   <em>\n    injury was likely to, or would probably, result\n   </em>\n   .

In other words, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Essary\n   </em>\n   assumed that the motorist who caused the accident had no consciousness that an injury would likely occur from his actions because presumably he would not engage in activity that would knowingly result in harm to himself. However, this Court did indicate that that presumption could be rebutted if there were substantial evidence that the motorist was not in possession of his \"normal faculties\" as a result of \"voluntary intoxication\" such that he was indifferent to the risk of injury to himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The present case raises the same issue. Unlike the motorist in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Essary\n   </em>\n   , however, Thomas voluntarily consumed alcohol and at least one prescription drug before causing the accident. Dr. Kalin testified to the following effect, among others, that Thomas was potentially experiencing as a result of his voluntary consumption of alcohol:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   \"Your judgment is going to be a problem in what you see, what you perceive, what you think, what you know. That's all impaired even by low levels of ethanol. That's what the buzz is, the buzz is something that\n   <em>\n    makes you care less about your circumstances than you probably otherwise should\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   This constitutes substantial evidence from which a jury could infer that Thomas was not in possession of his \"normal faculties\" as a result of voluntary intoxication such that he was indifferent to the risk of injury to himself. Or, as alternatively stated by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

Accordingly, we do not find convincing Thomas's argument that the Heards and Wells failed to present substantial evidence of wantonness; there was substantial evidence from which the jury could have reasonably inferred that Thomas was not in possession of his normal faculties at the time of the accident as the result of his voluntary consumption of alcohol and at least one prescription drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Thomas argues that, based on the evidence presented, a judgment in favor of the Heards and Wells on their wantonness claims requires \"the impermissible stacking of multiple inferences to imply that Thomas was impaired.\" Thomas's brief, at p. 33. We disagree.

The only inference the jury needed to make was that Thomas was actually experiencing those effects at the time of the accident. The jury's inference that Thomas was experiencing those effects is reasonable, given the substantial evidence presented by the Heards and Wells. Thomas's argument is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Next, Thomas argues that the Heards and Wells \"failed to present clear and convincing evidence of wantonness so as to support submission of punitive damages to the jury.\" Thomas's brief, at p. 40.

This is so, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Essary\n   </em>\n   made clear, because there is a presumption that a person will not consciously do something that will cause himself harm. However, the self-preservation presumption may be rebutted by, among other things, evidence indicating that the actor did not have possession of his or her normal faculties such that he or she did not appreciate the danger the actor's actions posed to himself or herself. We have determined that the Heards and Wells presented\n   <em>\n    substantial evidence\n   </em>\n   sufficient to rebut the self-preservation presumption. We must now determine if the Heards and Wells have presented\n   <em>\n    clear and convincing evidence\n   </em>\n   rebutting the self-preservation presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   As set forth above, the Heards and Wells had to present:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   \"Evidence that, when weighed against evidence in opposition, will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm conviction as to each essential element of the claim and a high probability as to the correctness of the conclusion.

Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The Heards and Wells presented clear and convincing evidence of Thomas's voluntary intoxication sufficient to rebut the self-preservation presumption. The evidence indicates that Thomas consumed alcohol and at least one prescription drug before driving his vehicle away from Foster's house. As Thomas approached the stop sign, he slowed the vehicle he was driving and then, without coming to a complete stop, drove his vehicle into the intersection; this is clear and convincing evidence that Thomas was aware of the presence of the stop sign and that he consciously chose to disregard it. From Thomas's equivocal testimony as to how much he drank, the jury could have concluded that he drank more than one beer. There is clear and convincing evidence to support such a conclusion given that Thomas's blood-alcohol concentration was between .05% and .06% at the time of the accident. Testimony was unequivocal that several of the drugs Thomas could have possibly taken, including Seroquel, which he did take, cause drowsiness and that alcohol would exacerbate that effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Dr. Kalin testified that it is possible for people with Thomas's blood-alcohol concentration to be impaired; that one \"would expect\" their \"inhibitions to be inhibited\"; that they would be \"more prone to risky activity\"; that they would have \"some fine motor skill problems\"; that their \"judgment is going to be a problem in what [they] see, what [they] perceive, what [they] think, [and] what [they] know. That's all impaired even by low levels of ethanol.\" Additionally, a person with Thomas's blood-alcohol concentration \"may experience some visual acuity problems,\" may \"have difficulty focusing,\" \"may not see ... as well as [he] would otherwise,\" and will lose peripheral vision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Dr. Kalin did testify that not everyone experiences the same effects at the same blood-alcohol concentration. Further, he did discuss the impact of the alcohol on Thomas in terms of what \"may\" occur. However, if there is any lingering doubt as to whether there was clear and convincing evidence to rebut the self-preservation presumption, Thomas's own testimony indicated that he was impaired:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   \"[Wells's trial counsel:] Why didn't you see the stop sign?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   \"[Thomas:] I can't tell you that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   \"[Wells's trial counsel:] Why didn't you stop at the stop sign?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   \"[Thomas:] I can't tell you that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   \"[Wells's trial counsel:] Why didn't you see the Heards traveling in their silver car to your right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   \"[Thomas:] I can't tell you that.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The above-summarized evidence in conjunction with Thomas's own testimony constitutes clear and convincing evidence from which a jury could derive a firm conviction that Thomas was not in possession of his \"normal faculties\" as a result of voluntary intoxication so that he was indifferent to the risk of injury to himself. Accordingly, Thomas's argument that the Heards and Wells failed to present clear and convincing evidence of wantonness is not convincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Next, Thomas argues that, even if this Court determines that the Heards and Wells presented clear and convincing evidence sufficient to support an award of punitive damages on their wantonness claims, the jury's punitive-damages awards were excessive.

Finally, I do not think a remand of the case to the trial court is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \" 'Wantonness' has been defined by this Court as the conscious doing of some act or the omission of some duty while knowing of the existing conditions and being conscious that, from doing or omitting to do an act, injury will likely or probably result.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Essary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8199925\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/992/5/#p9\">\n    992 So.2d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9 (Ala. 2007). I see no evidence of wantonness on the part of Timothy Joel Thomas in connection with his pulling into the intersection in which the accident occurred. For example, there is no evidence indicating that Thomas saw one or more approaching vehicles and decided to try and \"shoot the gap,\" as did the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Essary\n   </em>\n   , a case in which this Court nevertheless found there to be insufficient evidence of wantonness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Although there is much discussion in the main opinion of the fact that Thomas had a blood-alcohol content of .05% or .06%, I find little in that fact to support a wantonness claim, especially when the \"legal limit\" is .08% (and formerly was .10%). Of course, there is the added factor in this case of the prescription drug also taken by Thomas, along with testimony that the alcohol consumed by Thomas might enhance the tendency of the prescription drug to cause drowsiness. But by how much? Was Thomas aware that this might occur? What degree of impairment did Thomas experience above and beyond the normal impairing effect of a .05% or .06% blood-alcohol measurement ? I do not believe the records before us contain answers to these questions, leaving us to speculate as to the answers. To my mind, then, the evidence before us is not evidence of wanton conduct on the part of Thomas. Negligence, yes. But not wantonness. And in any event, not evidence from which a jury could find wantonness to be \"clearly and convincingly\" established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The main opinion appears to deal with this deficiency, at least in part, by comparing and contrasting this case with\n   <em>\n    Essary\n   </em>\n   . It is true that this Court in\n   <em>\n    Essary\n   </em>\n   , in finding insufficient evidence of wantonness, took note of the\n   <em>\n    lack\n   </em>\n   of any evidence that the defendant was impaired. But the negative inference drawn by the main opinion from this notation in\n   <em>\n    Essary\n   </em>\n   is not warranted and was not intended by\n   <em>\n    Essary\n   </em>\n   . In particular, the fact that Thomas may not have been \" 'in possession of his normal faculties' \" does not readily correspond, but in fact would seem to be at odds with, the requisite \" ' \" 'consciousness ... that the doing or not doing of some act will likely result in injury.' \" ' \"\n   <em>\n    Essary\n   </em>\n   , 992 So.2d at 12, 9 (emphasis omitted) (quoting, respectively,\n   <em>\n    Griffin Lumber Co. v.

And again, my struggle with this issue only increases when one turns to the question whether there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find wantonness under a \"clear and convincing\" evidence standard as required for the awards of punitive damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Finally as to the merits, I cannot agree with the analysis offered by the main opinion with respect to the issue of the costs\n   awarded to the Heards and to Wells in relation to certain medical-deposition testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Aside from my position as to the merits of various issues as discussed above, I do not believe it is necessary for the Court today to remand this cause to the trial court. Although we have said, as the main opinion notes, that a trial court is to express the reasons for its denial of a motion for a remittitur in a written order to give this Court the benefit of the trial court's evaluation of the verdict, that is not an ironclad rule. See\n   <em>\n    Phillips Colleges of Alabama, Inc. v.

Where the record on appeal is sufficient for this Court to review the excessiveness issue, as it is in the present case, a\n   <em>\n    Hammond\n   </em>\n   remand is not necessary.\" (citation omitted)). In this regard, it is also worth noting that we employ a de novo standard on appellate review of a punitive-damages award. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Schaeffer v.

The Heards and Wells had separately sued Thomas alleging negligence and wantonness and seeking to recover damages for injuries the Heards and M.A. had suffered as the result of an automobile accident. A jury returned verdicts in favor of Randell Heard, awarding compensatory damages of $850,000 and punitive damages of $750,000; in favor of Donna Heard, awarding compensatory damages of $450,000 and punitive damages of $750,000; and in favor of Wells, awarding compensatory damages of $500,000 and punitive damages of $500,000.

The jury awarded Wells $500,000 in compensatory damages and $500,000 in punitive damages; the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages for Wells is 1:1.

Thomas attached to his motion his own affidavit, but the affidavit was not signed by Thomas or notarized. Thomas's unsigned affidavit states that Thomas is currently unemployed, that he has not been employed since the accident, that he has no current source of income, no assets, and no money in his checking account, and that he is unable to satisfy any portion of the judgments entered against him. The Heards filed a motion to strike Thomas's affidavit on the basis that Thomas had failed to sign the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   In its orders on remand denying Thomas's motion for a remittitur, the trial court refused to consider not only the unsigned affidavit, but also all testimony offered by Thomas. The trial court held that Thomas \"\n   <em>\n    was not a credible witness\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis in original.) The trial court further stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   \"In oral argument before this court [Thomas's] counsel made the statement that [Thomas's] affidavit can be considered by the court as evidence in the case and proof of [Thomas's] financial condition, and verification was not needed. Plaintiffs urged [Thomas's] affidavit to be struck as not timely filed; however, it really doesn't matter. If the witness on the affidavit is found not to be a credible witness by the court, then verification of that information would be necessary to convince the court that the contents are true. Such was not provided, and, therefore, since [Thomas] is not credible, the court finds no evidence of [Thomas's] true financial condition, and, thus, concludes that the financial condition of [Thomas] was not a factor that diminished the appropriateness of the punitive damages awarded.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   We note that the trial court did not strike Thomas's affidavit, as the Heards requested. Instead, the trial court simply found that Thomas was not a credible witness and that his testimony, in any form, was not credible. In\n   <em>\n    Cameron v.

Instead, ignoring that portion of\n   the trial court's orders, Thomas simply asserts that he offered testimony concerning his financial position. Because Thomas has not challenged the trial court's finding that he was not a credible witness, we will not consider this testimony. We further note, although not argued by Thomas, that the trial court did not err in refusing to give any weight to Thomas's unsworn affidavit testimony.
