Shepard appeals his capital-murder conviction and life sentence. We find no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On November 17, 2013, at 9:33 p.m., Jackson police were dispatched to a residence on Randall Street about a possible shooting. The responding officer found the front door of the residence open and Tony Brown lying just inside on the floor of the living room bleeding, mortally wounded, and unable to speak. Brown had called 911 himself and was holding money in one hand and a cell phone in the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Brown passed away while ambulance attendants were preparing him for transport. He had suffered nine gunshot wounds. One projectile was recovered from Brown's abdomen during the autopsy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. There was evidence of forced entry into Brown's house. Burglar bars on one of the windows had been tampered with, and the window was forced open. Additionally, a crowbar was found on the hood of a car parked near the opened window, and there were footprints on the hood of the car. The foot impressions were insufficient for forensic comparison, and no usable fingerprints were found on the crowbar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Investigators found multiple spent .40-caliber shell casings inside Brown's house in various rooms and bullet holes throughout the house. Brown's bedroom was in disarray, and drawers appeared to have been rifled through, indicating a burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. On November 20, 2013, detectives with the Jackson Police Department interviewed Willie Thomas, who was thirteen years old at the time of the incident. In his recorded interview, Thomas told the police that he was walking home from the barbershop and was right by the pathway in front of Brown's house when he heard gunshots. Thomas stated he saw three guys, later identified as Shepard, Jordan Johnson, and Lucious Perkins, running from the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Thomas stated that Johnson and Perkins ran through a field and jumped a fence. Thomas heard the man identified as Perkins say something about having to \"get that money.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. According to Thomas, Shepard initially ran, but then returned to the scene. Thomas stated that before the police arrived, Shepard was hiding near an abandoned house. Thomas explained that Shepard was in the \"cut\" or \"look[-]through pathway\" and was on the phone. Thomas agreed that Shepard was \"looking out\" for the other guys. After the police arrived on the scene, Shepard came out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Additionally, Thomas explained that Shepard knew Brown and that Shepard had previously broken into Brown's house. When Brown confronted Shepard about it, Brown and Shepard exchanged verbal death threats. Thomas advised that the confrontation occurred on the day of the shooting at 6:05 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. During the interview, Thomas was given photo lineups and identified Shepard, Johnson, and Perkins as the three men he saw the night of the shooting. Thomas advised that Johnson and Perkins were in Brown's house, but Shepard was outside, on the phone, \"looking out.\" Thomas wrote on the photo lineups and identified which man was the shooter. Specifically, Thomas wrote, \"this man was sho[o]ting at him,\" and \"this man was sho[o]ting the man [in] the back.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Based on Thomas's recorded statement, Shepard, Johnson, and Perkins were arrested. Two .40-caliber semiautomatic pistols were recovered from Johnson's house. A ballistics comparison was conducted, which showed that projectiles recovered from Brown's house and the autopsy were fired from one of the pistols in Johnson's possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. Shepard, Johnson, and Perkins were subsequently indicted on the charge of capital murder. The indictment charged Shepard as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [O]n or about November 17, 2013[,] while acting in concert with and/or aiding, abetting, assisting[,] or encouraging another or others, [Shepard] did willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously kill Tony Brown, a human being, without the authority of law, with or without any design to effect death while and when engaged in the commission of the crime of burglary of a dwelling, or any attempt to commit such felony, by shooting the said[ ] Tony Brown with a firearm, in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated [section] 97-3-19(2)(e) (1972).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. At trial, the State's key witness was Thomas. Thomas testified that he was on the corner of Randall Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive when he heard gunshots. He saw three guys, including Shepard, who \"was standing outside watching out.\" Thomas stated that at the time of the gunshots, Shepard was standing in the front of Brown's house. The other two guys, Johnson and Perkins, ran out of the\n   house and went through the pathway near Brown's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14. On cross-examination, Thomas was asked to clarify whether he saw Shepard hiding in an abandoned house close to the scene of the crime. Thomas explained that it was not an abandoned house, but two abandoned buildings that were close together with \"a little space open.\" Thomas stated he saw Shepard on the street between the abandoned buildings and that Shepard was on the phone. Thomas further stated no one could see Shepard because the buildings were so close together. Thomas testified that when the police arrived, Shepard walked past the police, spoke to one of the officers, and then left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15. During Thomas's cross-examination, defense counsel played portions of Thomas's recorded interview with the police. Thomas acknowledged that it was his cousin who told him that Shepard had previously broken into Brown's house and had exchanged death threats with Brown. Thomas admitted that he did not actually hear Brown and Shepard exchange threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16. Regarding the photo lineups, Thomas testified that despite his notations, he did not see who shot Brown. Thomas acknowledged that what he wrote on the photo lineups \"wasn't exactly the truth.\" Defense counsel then asked whether there was anything else that Thomas needed to clarify, to which Thomas replied, \"no, sir.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17. On redirect, Thomas was adamant that at the time he heard gunshots, he saw Shepard standing by the abandoned buildings, \"looking out.\" Thomas testified that following the shooting, Shepard \"stayed, then he left, then he came back to the scene.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18. Detective Daryl Owens with the Jackson Police Department testified that he observed Shepard at the scene of the crime, standing around after the shooting. Detective Owens explained that in his experience as a detective, he had seen defendants return to the scene of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 19. Shepard did not testify at trial, but called four witnesses on his behalf. Rosalind Howard testified that Shepard was with her on the day of the shooting. Howard explained that she and Shepard went to the grocery store. Shortly after they returned from the grocery store, Shepard, Howard's niece, Hazel, and Tommie Lewis went to the store for snacks. Howard testified that when Shepard, Hazel, and Lewis returned to her house, they were talking about an encounter Shepard had with Brown \"a couple [of] days before.\" According to Howard, Shepard said that Brown had confronted him and had heard that he had been in Brown's house. Shepard told Brown that he did not know what Brown was talking about. However, Howard testified that Shepard admitted to her that he had broken into Brown's house in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 20. At some point, Shepard spilled hot sauce on his pants and left Howard's house to change clothes. Although Howard did not recall what time that occurred, she testified that it was dark outside. Howard stated Shepard left by himself and was gone no more than ten or fifteen minutes. Howard acknowledged that Shepard could have committed the crime during the time that he had left her house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 21. Lewis testified that around 9:38 to 9:40 p.m., he, Hazel, and Shepard were walking out of the door to go to the store when they heard two or three gunshots. They proceeded to the store to get there before it closed at 10:00 p.m. When they returned to Howard's house, they saw a news report about a shooting on Randall Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 22. On cross-examination, Lewis initially stated that Shepard was with him the whole night. However, upon further examination,\n   Lewis acknowledged that Shepard left Howard's house to get some clothes, but was gone \"no longer than five minutes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 23. Codefendant Johnson, who pled guilty to the murder of Brown,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that on November 17, 2013, he and a man named \"Little John\" got a crowbar from Perkins's house and used the crowbar to pry open the window to Brown's house. Little John entered the house first, followed by Johnson. After Johnson took items from Brown's house, he climbed back out the window. At that time, Brown pulled up in his vehicle, ran straight toward the front door, and started yelling, \"I got you MF now.\" Johnson stated he then heard eight or nine gunshots and \"jumped back across the fence and ran back through the pathway.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 24. Johnson stated he was familiar with the pathway near Brown's house. Johnson described the pathway as \"a little grass field\" and said it was close to Brown's house, on the side of the house. Johnson testified that he used the pathway to get to Brown's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 25. Additionally, Johnson testified that he did not see or speak to Shepard on the day of the crime, and did not plan or conspire with Shepard prior to the crime. However, Johnson admitted that following his arrest, he lied to the police and told them he did know what had happened. Moreover, Johnson admitted he never told the police about Little John.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 26. Codefendant Perkins pled guilty to accessory before the fact to burglary. Perkins testified that on November 17, 2013, around 8:30 or 9:00 p.m., Johnson and Little John came to his house and asked for a crowbar. Perkins stated he heard gunshots approximately twenty to thirty minutes later. Perkins further testified he did not see Shepard on the day of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 27. On cross-examination, Perkins acknowledged that during his plea hearing, he never mentioned Little John. Instead, during his plea, Perkins advised the circuit court, under oath, that he gave the crowbar to Johnson. When asked to explain, Perkins responded that at the time he pled guilty, he simply did not remember Little John. Perkins agreed that he did not tell the same \"truth\" at trial as he told during his plea hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 28. In rebuttal, the State presented Detective Owens, who interviewed Shepard after his arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the recorded interview, Shepard advised Detective Owens that he was at Howard's house on November 17, 2013. Shepard further advised that he, Hazel, and Lewis went to the store around 7:00 p.m. Shepard denied going to the grocery store with Howard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 29. Shepard stated he did not hear gunshots on the night of the shooting. Shepard learned of the shooting from a phone call he received when he returned from the store, which, according to Shepard, was around 8:00 p.m. However, as Detective Owens noted, the evidence showed the shooting did not occur until 9:33 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 30. Shepard further stated that although he knew of Brown, he had never spoken to him. Shepard advised he did not have any involvement with Brown's house, Johnson, or Perkins on November 17, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 31. Following a jury trial, Shepard was found guilty of capital murder. He was sentenced to serve life in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, without the possibility of parole. Shepard subsequently filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a motion for a new trial, which the circuit court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 32. Shepard now appeals and raises five assignments of error: (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, (2) the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence, (3) the circuit court erred in refusing his circumstantial-evidence jury instruction, (4) the circuit court erred in sustaining the State's reverse-\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (5) he received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    I. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 33. Shepard first argues the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Shepard claims Thomas's testimony \"created nothing more than an inference that [he] was merely present near the scene of the crime and does not support any rational conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that [he] was an accomplice, before or after the fact, to the burglary or homicide.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 34. In considering whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction, \"the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045491\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/35/480/#p485\">\n    35 So.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 485 (\u00b6 16) (Miss. 2010) (citation omitted). Where the facts and inferences \"point in favor of the defendant on any element of the offense with sufficient force that reasonable [jurors] could not have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty, the proper remedy is for the appellate court to reverse and render.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045491\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/35/480/#p485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). However, if \"reasonable fair-minded [jurors] in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions on every element of the offense, the evidence will be deemed to have been sufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045491\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/35/480/#p485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 35. The indictment alleged that Shepard, \"while acting in concert with and/or aiding, abetting, assisting[,] or encouraging another or others, did willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously kill Brown ... while and when engaged in the commission of the crime of burglary of a dwelling.\" \"One who aids and abets another in the commission of a crime is guilty as a principal.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8215842\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/983/270/#p276\">\n    983 So.2d 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 276 (\u00b6 14) (Miss. 2008). \"To aid and abet the commission of a felony, 'one must do something that will incite, encourage, or assist the actual perpetrator in the commission of the crime or participate in the design of the felony.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8215842\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/983/270/#p276\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Vaughn v.

Here, in his statement to the police, Thomas stated Shepard was standing in the pathway or cut-through near Brown's house and was on the phone. Thomas agreed that Shepard was \"looking out\" for the other guys in the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 37. At trial, Thomas again testified that he saw three guys at Brown's house, including Shepard, who was standing outside, on the phone, \"watching out.\" Thomas further testified that Shepard left the\n   scene after gunshots were fired, but subsequently returned. This testimony was confirmed by Detective Owens, who testified that he too saw Shepard at the scene following the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 38. Regarding Johnson's involvement, Thomas testified that following the shooting, he saw Johnson run through a field and jump a fence. This testimony was consistent with Johnson's testimony, who said that following the gunshots, he jumped the fence and ran through the pathway, which he described as a \"grass field.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 39. Although Johnson testified that Shepard was not involved in the crimes, he confirmed the existence of the pathway and its proximity to Brown's house. Moreover, Johnson testified that he utilized the pathway to break into Brown's house. Importantly, it was this pathway where Thomas stated he saw Shepard standing, watching out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 40. While Shepard denied any involvement in the crimes, he advised the police that he returned to Howard's house around 8:00 p.m. According to Howard, Shepard subsequently left her house to change clothes. Detective Owens testified that Shepard would have had sufficient time to get from Howard's house to Brown's house prior to the shooting at 9:33 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 41. Overall, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we find sufficient evidence existed to support Shepard's conviction. Indeed, sufficient evidence was presented to show that Shepard assisted or participated in the commission of the felony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Shepard's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict was properly denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    II. Weight of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 42. \"In reviewing the denial of a motion for a new trial 'based on an objection to the weight of the evidence,' this Court 'will only disturb a verdict when it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence that to allow it to stand would sanction an unconscionable injustice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kirk v.

Although Thomas's statement to the police and his subsequent trial testimony differed at times, the testimony was not substantially inconsistent. Thomas maintained throughout litigation that at the time of the gunshots, he saw Shepard standing outside of Brown's house, on the phone, \"watching out.\" While Thomas acknowledged certain lies during his testimony, it was for the jury, not this Court, to weigh the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses and to resolve the issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7035722\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/64/1029/#p1033\">\n    64 So.3d at 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 45.

Based on this Court's highly deferential standard, we cannot say that the circuit court erred in finding a prima facie case of racial discrimination. The record shows that while Shepard accepted as a juror the only white venire member on the first panel, he exercised peremptory strikes against all but one white venire member on the second panel. Specifically, of the four viable white venire members on the second panel, Shepard exercised peremptory strikes against three. Additionally, of the eight viable venire members on the third panel, only one was white, and was struck by Shepard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    B.

In his initial response to the State's challenge of Barber, defense counsel stated that Barber did not respond to any questions during voir dire and \"laughed too many times at [the prosecutor's] jokes and did not like [his] jokes at all.\" Additionally, defense counsel explained that Barber had a master's degree and may not be able to \"conceptualize or even give proper context to what's going on [in Brown's neighborhood].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 57. Demeanor, educational background, and employment history are sufficient race-neutral reasons for striking venire members.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Here, although the circuit court did not specifically find that Shepard's reasons for the peremptory strike were race-neutral, the record shows the court continued to the third part of the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analysis and required the State to respond in an effort to determine whether the reasons were pretextual. We do not find the circuit court's conduct to be improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    C. Pretext\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 59. In response to Shepard's race-neutral reasons, the prosecutor stated he did not recall Barber \"liking [his] material any more so than counsel opposite's\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   and noted that Barber was attentive, \"paying attention to the questions, responding with a nod or a head shake as asked.\" Additionally, in response to defense counsel's statement that Barber failed to respond to any questions during voir dire, the prosecutor noted that defense counsel had accepted other individuals as jurors who did not respond to questions or participate during voir dire, including at least one black male.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 60. As far as Barber's master's degree and his alleged inability to relate to or understand the neighborhood in which the crime occurred, the prosecutor noted that at no time did defense counsel ask Barber what type of work he did or question the field in which Barber had his degree. Moreover, when asked whether he knew where Barber lived, defense counsel stated he did not recall, but thought Barber lived in Clinton. However, Barber was in fact a resident of Jackson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 61. The circuit court found Shepard's reasons for striking Barber were pretextual and an effort to engage in purposeful discrimination. Based on our review of the record and given the great deference afforded to the circuit court, we do not find the circuit court's determination was clearly erroneous. The record indicates Shepard's reasons for striking Barber were a thinly veiled way of saying that Barber, an educated white male, would be unable to relate to or understand a black neighborhood. However, simply because Barber has a master's degree in some unknown field does not make him incapable of understanding a neighborhood such as Brown's. Thus, the circuit court's conclusion that such an explanation was a pretext for discrimination is not reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    V. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 62. Shepard last argues he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, Shepard claims his counsel was ineffective for: (1) \"eliciting testimony [through Thomas and Howard] that he had been accused of and possibl[y] admitted to burglarizing Brown's house at a previous time\" and (2) failing to request an alibi instruction. To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, Shepard must show: (1) his counsel's performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.
