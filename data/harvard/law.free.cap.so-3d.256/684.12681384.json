The jury, by a vote of 10 to 2, recommended that Johnson be sentenced to death. The trial court followed the jury's recommendation. Johnson appeals his convictions and death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before trial, Johnson informed the trial court that he would not proceed on his plea of not guilty and that he would proceed solely on the plea that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect at the time of the offense. (R. 87-88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At trial, the State set forth evidence indicating the following. Shortly before midnight on December 3, 2009, Phillip Davis, a police officer employed by the City of Pelham, stopped Johnson in Pelham as he was driving north on Interstate Highway 65. The traffic stop was recorded on a digital camera located in Officer Davis's vehicle. Officer Davis also had a wireless microphone attached to his person that recorded sound during the traffic stop. The digital recording was played for the jury at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer Davis notified the dispatch center of the traffic stop before exiting his vehicle. After exiting his vehicle, Officer Davis approached the driver's side window of Johnson's vehicle, which was an Acura sedan that had a personalized Alabama license plate that read \"JCREW1.\" Officer Davis informed Johnson that he was being stopped for speeding and asked him for his driver's license. Officer Davis then asked Johnson: \"Is this your car?\" Johnson responded: \"Nah, I just stole it.\" Officer Davis replied: \"I'm glad you're in a jovial mood. The only reason I asked is to see if you have your proof of insurance. Sometimes when you're borrowing a car you don't know where it is.\" After receiving Johnson's driver's license, Officer Davis returned to his vehicle. While Officer Davis was in his vehicle, Johnson turned off the interior lights of his vehicle and raised the automatic sunshade in the rear window of his vehicle. After approximately five minutes, Officer Davis returned to the driver's side window of Johnson's vehicle to issue Johnson a speeding ticket. Officer Davis asked Johnson where he worked, and Johnson responded: \"I don't see why it matters.\" Officer Davis replied: \"Okay. Unemployed.\" Officer Davis then wrote on the ticket. Johnson then stated: \"Man, I've been on the road for like four hours, man. My brother is a cop. I totally understand that you're just doing your job.\" Officer Davis responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Now, you want to be cool? Now, you want to start acting reasonable? Now? Now that I've brought a ticket up here, you want to start being reasonable? That's amazing. Have your brother call me, and I'll tell him how you acted, and then we'll see how that works out, okay?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Davis then leaned toward the driver's side window and stated: \"I need your signature at the bottom.\" Immediately, Johnson shot Officer Davis in the face with a pistol, and Officer Davis fell to the ground. Johnson then drove away without delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Alfredo Paredes, a senior medical examiner with the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, performed the autopsy on Officer Davis's body on December 4, 2009. Dr. Paredes testified that Officer Davis \"died from a gunshot wound to the face that injured his spinal column.\" (R. 1515.) Dr. Paredes also testified that, based on his examination of the gunshot wound, the gunshot was fired within a few inches of Officer Davis's face. (R. 1507.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A couple of minutes after the shooting, a truck driver observed Officer Davis's body lying across the fog line of the right-hand lane of the interstate. The truck driver stopped and telephoned emergency 911. The police officers who initially responded to the scene of the shooting discovered Officer Davis's ticket book lying near his body. The most recent ticket in the book contained information about Johnson, including his name, his address, a description of his vehicle, and his license-plate number. A few minutes after arriving at the scene of the shooting, the officers watched the digital recording of the traffic stop in Officer Davis's vehicle, and they were able to see what had transpired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly after midnight on December 4, 2009, Loleatha Story, who lives in the Inglenook neighborhood on the northern side of Birmingham, heard a vehicle drive into the alley beside her house. Story looked out her window and saw an Acura sedan park in the alley. Story saw a white male get out of the Acura, walk to her daughter's vehicle that was parked near the house, and attempt to open the door of her daughter's vehicle. Story asked the man what he was doing. The man responded by raising his hand and walking away. Story then called the police and gave them the license-plate number of the Acura, which was \"JCREW1\". The police informed Story that they were looking for that vehicle and that she should not go outside. Story continued to look out her window, and she observed someone in a gray Toyota Tundra truck pick up the driver of the Acura and drive away. A map of Story's neighborhood was admitted into evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly after the police officers responded to the scene of the shooting and observed what had transpired, they issued a notice to \"be on the look out\" (\"BOLO\") for an Acura sedan with a \"JCREW1\" license plate. Approximately one hour after the shooting, Jason Grant, a police officer employed by the City of Trussville, became aware that the owner of the Acura sedan was the brother of another Trussville police officer, Bill Johnson (\"Bill\"), and that another officer had recently seen Bill's gray Toyota Tundra traveling down the road. Officer Grant then telephoned Bill and directed him to go to Johnson's house in Kimberly, which is a community on the northern side of Birmingham. About five minutes later, Officer Grant telephoned Bill again to make sure that he was going to Johnson's house. At that time, Bill stated that he had not been in contact with Johnson and that he was going to his sister's house that was south of Birmingham because, Bill said, Johnson had been temporarily living at that house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Grant responded by ordering Bill to go to Johnson's house, and Bill replied that he would go to Johnson's house. However, Bill never went to Johnson's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Around 1:30 a.m. on December 4, 2009, Officer Grant became aware that the Acura sedan with the \"JCREW1\" license plate had been found in Inglenook and that the driver of the Acura had been picked up in a truck matching the description of Bill's truck. Officer Grant telephoned Bill again and informed him that a BOLO had been issued for his truck and that he needed to immediately stop if he saw any police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the telephone conversation with Officer Grant and while traveling southbound on Interstate Highway 65 with Johnson in the truck, Bill stopped on the side of the interstate near some police officers from the City of Hoover, and Bill and Johnson exited the truck. The Hoover police officers took Johnson into custody without resistance. As Johnson was being taken into custody, he was asked whether he was Bart Johnson. Initially, Johnson did not reply, but as he was being taken to a police vehicle, he stated: \"Hey, man, I'm your guy. I'm the one you're looking for.\" (R. 1407.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A .40 caliber pistol was recovered from the glove compartment of Bill's Toyota Tundra truck. DNA analysis revealed that, with a high degree of certainty, blood found on that pistol came from Officer Davis. DNA analysis further revealed that, with a high degree of certainty, blood found on Johnson's Acura sedan and on his clothing came from Officer Davis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The defense set forth evidence indicating the following. Johnson was employed as a pharmacist by Fred's Pharmacy. Wes Maddox, a pharmacist who was in charge of Fred's Pharmacy stores in Alabama and who had worked with Johnson, testified that he was not aware that Johnson had any anger issues and that Johnson was a good employee. In the days leading up to the shooting, Johnson had been working in Bayou La Batre at the grand opening of a new Fred's Pharmacy store. Maddox testified that, at his request, Johnson had assisted with opening the new store on November 19-20, 2009, and November 30-December 3, 2009. Maddox further testified that the grand opening had been stressful and that Johnson had worked long hours during that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Albert Smith, a family-practice physician, testified that he had treated Johnson for migraine headaches and that he had prescribed Imitrex to Johnson to help alleviate his symptoms. Dr. Smith stated that he had seen anxiety listed as one of the possible, but rare, side effects of Imitrex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. Charles Golden testified for the defense as a mental-health expert. Dr. Golden examined Johnson, interviewed several of his family members, and watched the digital recording of the shooting. Dr. Golden concluded that Johnson suffered from dyssomnia, a somatoform disorder, and a personality disorder that included aspects of depression, anxiety, and paranoia. Dr. Golden further concluded that Johnson suffered an acute or brief psychotic episode that rendered him incapable of understanding the wrongfulness of his acts at the time he shot Officer Davis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In rebuttal, the State presented expert testimony from Dr. Thomas Boll and Dr. Glen King. Dr. Boll and Dr. King examined Johnson. Dr. Boll testified that, in his opinion, Johnson did not suffer from a brief psychotic disorder, an undifferentiated somatoform disorder, or a depersonalization disorder not otherwise specified. Dr. Boll further testified that he did not find any evidence of any type of psychotic\n   process or thought disorder. Dr. King testified that, in his opinion, on December 3, 2009, Johnson was not suffering from a severe mental disease or defect that rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In his brief to this Court, Johnson raises several issues that were not first raised in the trial court; thus, those issues were not preserved for appellate review. Nevertheless, because Johnson was sentenced to death, his failure to raise those issues in the trial court does not prevent this Court from reviewing those issues for plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rule 45A, Ala. R.App. P., provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"In all cases in which the death penalty has been imposed, the Court of Criminal Appeals shall notice any plain error or defect in the proceedings under review, whether or not brought to the attention of the trial court, and take appropriate appellate action by reason thereof, whenever such error has or probably has adversely affected the substantial right of the appellant.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Specifically, Johnson argues that \"no evidence was presented during the trial about Officer Davis having a baby at home or about him putting his baby to bed before his death.\" Johnson's brief, at 34-35. Johnson does not explain with any degree of specificity how he was prejudiced by the prosecutor's comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   At the beginning of the prosecutor's rebuttal closing argument, he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"The state represents the point of view of Philip Davis.

The defense did not object to any of these comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   During the prosecutor's rebuttal closing argument, the trial court instructed the jury: \"Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard the facts and that's what you are to take is what you've heard. This is just argument of counsel.\" (R. 1998.) Then, during the trial court's instructions to the jurors before they began their deliberations, the trial court stated: \"You are to base your verdicts in this trial upon the evidence, the evidence that you've heard in this trial in the form of live testimony, the evidence in the form of exhibits.\" (R. 2034-35.) The trial court also instructed the jury: \"You are not to consider [as] evidence in this case the arguments of the attorneys in this case.\" (R. 2035.)

However, considering that the defense failed to object to these comments and that the trial court specifically instructed the jury that argument of counsel was not evidence, we fail to see how the prosecutor's passing comments concerning Officer Davis's child \" ' \"so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9443377,9443234\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/814/925/\">\n    814 So.2d at 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

See \u00a7 32-5A-195, Ala.Code 1975; see also Rule 760-X-1-.07, Ala. Admin. Code (Dep't of Pub. Safety). Therefore, the Department of Public Safety can suspend a driver's license if the driver receives six speeding tickets in a two-year period. In the present case, there was evidence indicating that Johnson had received significantly more than six speeding tickets, but the specific date when he received each individual ticket was not introduced into evidence during the guilt phase of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The only testimony concerning the possible suspension of Johnson's license came from the defense's expert, Dr. Golden. Dr. Golden testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"[Defense counsel]: Now, we are dealing with irrationality here, Dr. Golden. Is it rational to you that this incident may have happened because he was just tired of getting too many speeding tickets?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \"[Dr. Golden]: No, I don't think so. I had talked about this with Bart. Initially he actually didn't say this. Part of this conversation comes out of the conversation I had with him earlier about what his reaction to the speeding tickets were and whether they bothered him because I was examining that theory that somehow getting another speeding ticket, you know, maybe his license would be suspended for life because they have so many-something about it that made this speeding ticket different from all the other tickets. And he came to that, you know, he didn't like getting stopped by police officers-I don't think any of us actually like being stopped for speeding-but that this wasn't anything special, as far as he could identify or recall. It didn't have any special meaning. So, attacking the officer just to avoid getting a ticket would make no rational sense. And then attacking him after the ticket had already been recorded and written makes even less sense.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   (R. 1712-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This Court has stated that \"[a] prosecutor may argue every legitimate inference from the evidence 'and may examine, collate, [sift] and treat the evidence in his own way.' \"\n   <em>\n    Woodward v.

Nevertheless, the prosecutor suggested that one possible motive for the shooting was the possibility that Johnson could lose his license, which was a subject that had been raised by the testimony of Dr. Golden. Based on the evidence that was before the jury, it was within the realm of possibility that Johnson's license could have been suspended if he received a speeding ticket from Officer Davis. The evidence before the jury was that Johnson had received 18 speeding tickets over the 13-year period immediately preceding the incident involving Officer Davis; thus, it was possible that Johnson could have received 5 speeding tickets during the 2-year period immediately before the incident involving Officer Davis. It is simply not true to state that there was\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   evidence indicating that Johnson could lose his license if he received a speeding ticket from Officer Davis. Also, concerning the prosecutor's statement that, if Johnson lost his license, it \"may cost him the opportunity for his job,\" we note that there was evidence indicating that Johnson's job required travel; thus, it was a legitimate inference to argue that, if Johnson lost his license, it might affect his job. Therefore, considering that a prosecutor may argue every legitimate inference from the evidence and that counsel should be given wide latitude in making such arguments, we hold that the prosecutor's unobjected-to comments did not constitute error, much less plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Next, Johnson contends that the prosecutor improperly argued a fact not in evidence when he stated that Johnson admitted to shooting Officer Davis. During the prosecutor's rebuttal guilt-phase closing argument, he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \"Did [Johnson] decide to do that on purpose when he did it? You bet you. He reached over and got a gun and put it in his face and pulled the trigger. He knew exactly what he was doing and did do that. I'm not the one who is saying that. He said that. He admits to doing that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \"We can show you the picture of him doing it, but he's not saying he didn't do that. He intentionally picked up a gun, stuck it out the window, put it in a man's face and pulled the trigger. He intentionally did that.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   (R. 1976-77.) The defense did not object to these comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   At trial, there was evidence indicating that, a couple of hours after the shooting, as Johnson was being taken into custody, he stated: \"Hey, man, I'm your guy. I'm the one you're looking for.\" Also, Johnson's expert testified that Johnson saw the video of the shooting and then \"basically said, well, I guess this must have happened, this must have been what happened, or these things happened.\" (R. 1637.) Johnson's expert was also asked\n   whether Johnson cognitively accepts that he caused Officer Davis's death, and Johnson's expert responded: \"We told him he did it. We showed him the video. We said, 'It was you. You did it.' He seems to have come to a-he has accepted that.\" (R. 1725.) Furthermore, before trial, Johnson informed the trial court that he would not proceed on his plea of not guilty and that he would proceed solely on the theory that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect at the time of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   According to Johnson, the prosecutor's comments were improper because \"there was no testimony at trial that [Johnson] confessed, nor was there testimony that he said he knew what he was doing.\" Johnson's brief, at 38. However, the prosecutor did not say that Johnson confessed to anything concerning his mental state at the time of the offense. Read in context, the prosecutor was saying that Johnson did not deny being the person who \"reached over and got a gun and put it in [Officer Davis's] face and pulled the trigger.\" That remark is consistent with the evidence and with Johnson's plea. Therefore, viewed in the context of the entire closing argument, we cannot say that the prosecutor's comments \" ' \"so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process\" ' \" or that the comments \"resulted in substantial prejudice to the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7029224\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/74/1039/\">\n    74 So.3d at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The prosecutor stated that he was the one who told the officers not to wear their guns and that he was criticized for doing so because police officers \"don't like to be without [their gun].\" (R. 1996.) The prosecutor explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   \"Here is the point. Bill Johnson got in that truck, had been a long-time police officer, and didn't bring his gun.

So, he don't wear his gun, even though every police officer I know would have their gun with them. He doesn't.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   (R. 1996-97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Johnson further argues that the prosecutor \"inject[ed] his own beliefs into the closing arguments\" with the following three comments near the end of his rebuttal guilt-phase closing argument. Johnson's brief, at 42. First, Johnson cites the prosecutor's statement that \"[t]hat's what I think the facts say that [Johnson and his brother] had in mind.\" (R. 1999.) Next, Johnson cites the prosecutor's statement that, \"[g]uys, that is my best judgment about the facts in this case and what actually happens with the facts.\" (R. 2001.) Finally, Johnson cites the prosecutor's statement that, \"[o]nce again, murder doesn't make sense. I've never known it to.\" (R. 2002.) The defense did not object to any of the above-referenced comments cited by Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Viewing the prosecutor's comments in context, we conclude that they were simply permissible comments about Johnson's guilt that were based on the evidence. The prosecutor did not encourage the jury to convict Johnson based on information outside the evidence, and the prosecutor's comments would not permit an inference by the jury that his beliefs are based on information outside the evidence. Furthermore, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has stated, \"a prosecutor's 'use [of] the phrase \"I think\" in an innocuous, conversational sense' does not violate due process because such use 'do[es] not suggest an attempt to replace the evidence with the prosecutor's personal judgments.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Higgs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9294621\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/353/281/#p332\">\n    353 F.3d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In the present case, the prosecutor's innocuous use of phrases such as \"in my opinion,\" \"sounds to me like,\" \"that is my best judgment,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   and \"I think\" did not violate due process. Every time the prosecutor phrased a statement in the form of an opinion, the statement was directly related to the evidence that was presented at trial. Additionally, we again note that the trial court instructed the jurors that they \"are not to consider [as] evidence in this case the arguments of the attorneys in this case\" and that they \"should base [their] verdict upon the evidence and not on speculation, conjecture, sympathy or emotion.\" (R. 2035.) Therefore, viewing the prosecutor's unobjected-to comments in the context of the entire closing argument and considering the trial court's instructions, we cannot say that the prosecutor's comments \" ' \"so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process\" ' \" or that the comments \"resulted in substantial prejudice to the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Brown\n   </em>\n   , 74 So.3d at 1051. Accordingly, we hold that there was not any plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Next, Johnson argues that the prosecutor committed prosecutorial misconduct during his closing argument by falsely stating that Johnson did not have a sister. One of the expert reports admitted into evidence at trial revealed that Johnson has a half sister. (C. 508.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   During the prosecutor's rebuttal guilt-phase closing argument, he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   \"Now, what has to happen? At this point, in that truck, if [Johnson and his brother] can get anywhere south of the accident all they have to say is, 'Hey, look, I found my brother asleep on the couch in Clanton with my sister'-\n   <em>\n    he doesn't have a sister.\n   </em>\n   I don't know where they were planning to go, but it was somewhere down that way. That's what he tells Grant, 'I'm going to Clanton.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   \"Actually, ladies and gentlemen, what Grant said was 'Clanton or Calera.' I can't remember which. Those were his words, 'Clanton or Calera is what he told me and I told him come to Tarrant.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   \"Here is what happens, guys. If they get there and this shirt with blood on it disappears and the gun in the truck disappears, we've got nothing. All he's got to say is 'my car was stolen and my billfold was in it. So, whoever shot that police officer had my driver's license and he gave that driver's license to the police officer, and all the information on that ticket came from that driver's license.' That's what works. That's what they had in mind. That's what I think the facts say that they had in mind.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   (R. 1998-99) (emphasis added). The defense did not object to this statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Alabama Supreme Court has stated: \"Counsel should not be permitted to state as fact that which is damaging to defendant, and of which there is no legal proof.\"\n   <em>\n    Rogers v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5304615\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ala/275/588/#p593\">\n    275 Ala. at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5305558,5304615\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/157/13/\">\n    157 So.2d at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In the present case, because there was undisputed evidence indicating that Johnson has a half sister, the prosecutor's passing remark that Johnson does not have a sister could be construed as a misstatement of a fact. However, there is no indication that that misstatement prejudiced or damaged Johnson in any way. The prosecution's argument was that Johnson and his brother were attempting to flee to a location south of Birmingham after the shooting in an effort to create an alibi. It is irrelevant whether that location was Johnson's sister's house or some other place south of Birmingham. Further, Officer Grant's testimony was that, during his telephone conversation with Johnson's brother after the shooting, Johnson's brother stated that \"he hadn't been able to get in contact with his brother, that he had\n   talked to his sister and his sister advised that his brother had been staying down there, living on her couch.\" (R. 1390.) That statement makes little sense as an attempt to create an alibi if Johnson does not actually have a sister; accordingly, the prosecution's theory that that statement was an attempt to create an alibi makes little sense if Johnson does not have a sister. Therefore, there is no indication that the prosecutor's passing misstatement caused Johnson any prejudice. If anything, the misstatement hurt the prosecution's argument. Furthermore, again, the trial court instructed the jurors that they could not consider the attorneys' arguments as evidence, and we presume that the jurors followed those instructions. Consequently, we cannot say that the prosecutor's unobjected-to comment \" ' \"so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process\" ' \" or that the comment \"resulted in substantial prejudice to the defendant.\" See\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Brown\n   </em>\n   , 74 So.3d at 1051. Thus, we hold that the prosecutor's comment does not constitute plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Johnson also states that the cumulative effect of the alleged prosecutorial misconduct denied him a fair trial. We have considered each of the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct individually and have held that none of the allegations require reversal. After reviewing the record and considering the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct cumulatively, this Court further holds that the cumulative effect of any alleged errors did not probably injuriously affect Johnson's substantial rights and, thus, does not require reversal. See\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11091508\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/789/941/\">\n    789 So.2d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 942-43 n. 1 (Ala.2001) (stating that \"[t]he correct rule is that, while, under the facts of a particular case, no single error among multiple errors may be sufficiently prejudicial to require reversal under Rule 45, [Ala.

Therefore, this claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Next, Johnson argues that the prosecutor made several improper statements during his opening and closing statements in the penalty phase of the trial. As with the statements challenged in Part I, Johnson contends that the prosecutor improperly argued prejudicial facts that were not in evidence, improperly held himself out to the jury as an expert, and made improper arguments that were calculated to inflame the minds of the jurors. Johnson did not object to any of these allegedly improper statements; therefore, we review these claims for plain error only. See Rule 45A, Ala.

The prosecutor did not urge the jury to ignore its penalty-phase role and simply rely on the fact that the State had already determined that death is the appropriate sentence. In fact, the prosecutor made clear that, although the prosecution was asking for the death penalty, the sentencing-recommendation \"choice\" belonged to the jury. Contrary to Johnson's argument, nothing in the prosecutor's comments would lead the jury to believe that the whole governmental establishment had already determined that the sentence should be death.

Therefore, considering L.M.'s answers and the fact that the trial court was in a decidedly better position than this Court to assess L.M.'s credibility, we find that the trial court did not err in refusing to strike L.M. for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   Concerning prospective juror W.W., during individual voir dire, the trial court asked him whether he would automatically vote for the death penalty if the case reached the penalty phase. W.W. responded: \"I think so. It might be tempered by what you say to me, your instruction.\" (R. 636-37.) The trial court then stated that it would give the jurors the law regarding the appropriate circumstances in which one could consider the death penalty,\n   and the trial court asked W.W. whether he could \"consider life without parole if it was appropriate under the circumstances.\" (R. 637.) W.W. responded: \"Yes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7545276\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/548/488/#p490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   W.W. stated that he could treat both sides fairly and impartially.

Based on those statements, we conclude that the trial court did not exceed its discretion in finding that W.W. could make his sentencing recommendation according to the evidence and the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Next, Johnson contends that the trial court erroneously struck prospective jurors M.P. and W.Wi. for cause. According to Johnson, those prospective jurors disfavored the death penalty but would not automatically vote against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   During individual voir dire, prospective juror M.P. initially indicated to the trial court that she could consider either life imprisonment without parole or the death penalty depending on the circumstances of the case. Shortly thereafter, in explaining why she did not answer one of the questions on her juror questionnaire, M.P. stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-323\">\n   \"The reason was if I had the choice of my choice, I would not vote anybody to death. I wouldn't want that on my conscience. But if I was instructed one way or the other, then I would say I don't have a choice.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   (R. 140.) M.P. further explained: \"If the judge said to me under oath or rules that I have to pick or say that is what the death penalty was, obviously then I have to go with that.\" (R. 141-42.) The prosecutor then explained to M.P. that the trial court would not tell the jury which sentencing recommendation to choose. Instead, he explained, the choice would belong to the jury. M.P. responded: \"Then I would go with life without parole.\" (R. 142.) The prosecutor asked M.P. whether she \"would automatically go with life without parole.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7545276\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/548/488/#p490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   M.P. responded: \"Yes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7545276\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/548/488/#p490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   In response to questioning from defense counsel, M.P. stated that she would consider the death penalty \"if [she] had to consider it\" and that she could vote for the death penalty \"if [she] had to vote for it.\" (R. 143.) The trial court then asked M.P. whether she was a person who could follow the court's instructions and, depending on the circumstances, recommend either the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole. M.P. answered: \"No.\" (R. 146.) M.P. explained: \"Like I said, I don't think I can put anybody to death. If it was life without parole, I could do that, but not put them to death.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7545276\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/548/488/#p490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   M.P. further explained: \"I think just sitting here has made me realize I can't.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7545276\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/548/488/#p490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defense counsel then asked M.P.: \"You would follow the instruction of the law and if you had to do it you would consider death?\" (R. 147.) M.P. responded that she would. Finally, the trial court asked M.P. whether she would have a problem recommending either the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole. M.P. responded: \"I will have a problem.\" (R. 147-48.) M.P. then stated that she would not be able to consider both the death penalty and life imprisonment without parole and that she \"wouldn't be able to follow the law all the way then.\" (R. 148.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   M.P.'s answers indicated that she was biased against the death penalty and that she could not set aside that bias and consider both the death penalty and life imprisonment without parole. In fact, M.P. ended her individual voir dire by stating that she would not be able to follow the law. Therefore, the trial court did not err in striking M.P. for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   When asked about the death penalty during individual voir dire, prospective juror W.Wi. stated: \"I think I could live with life without parole, but I don't know that I could go along with the death penalty.\" (R. 646.) When asked again whether he could consider either life imprisonment without parole or the death penalty, W.Wi. stated: \"Like I said, I think I could render life, but I don't think I could render death.\" (R. 647.) W.Wi. further stated: \"If guilty and we have a choice of, then I'm going to make the choice of life without parole as opposed to the death penalty if I have that choice. If I don't have that choice, I don't feel comfortable.\" (R. 648.) The trial court then asked W.Wi.: \"That's a fixed view that you have and it can't be changed?\" (R. 648.) W.Wi. responded: \"That's just the way I feel.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7545276\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/548/488/#p490\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   Contrary to Johnson's allegation, there is nothing in W.Wi.'s individual voir dire that would indicate that he would not automatically vote against the death penalty. Johnson states in his brief that W.Wi. merely \"expressed hesitancy about imposing death.\" Johnson's brief, at 56. In reality, W.Wi. indicated a strong bias against the death penalty, and, after significant questioning, he never denied that bias. Therefore, the trial court did not err in striking W.Wi. for cause due to his inability to consider the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   Next, Johnson contends that the trial court erroneously refused to remove prospective jurors W.P., M.H., B.A., C.S., E.C., M.G., J.S., J.C., M.I., C.B., C.H., D.R., P.H., and M.C. for cause. According to Johnson, those prospective jurors indicated that they had a fixed opinion that Johnson was guilty. See \u00a7 12-16-150(7), Ala.Code 1975 (providing that \"[i]t is good ground for challenge of a juror by either party ... [t]hat he has a fixed opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant which would bias his verdict\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-333\">\n   Concerning prospective jurors W.P. and M.H., the trial court did not grant Johnson's initial challenges for cause during individual voir dire. However, later, during group voir dire, prospective jurors W.P. and M.H. were removed for cause because they stated that they could not entertain a mental-illness defense. (R. 1220, 1241-44.) Therefore, because W.P. and M.H. did not serve on the jury and because Johnson was not forced to use any of his peremptory challenges to remove them, any error in denying the initial challenges for cause was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   Prospective juror B.A. stated that she remembered seeing something about the incident on the news around the time the shooting occurred, but she did not remember any specific details of the incident. B.A. explicitly stated that she did not have an opinion concerning who was responsible for Officer Davis's death and that she did not remember whether she had any opinion about the incident when she saw something about it on the news. (R. 330-31.) Therefore, the trial court acted within its discretion when it refused to strike B.A. for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   Prospective juror C.S. stated that, based on media accounts, she believed that\n   Johnson shot Officer Davis. C.S. stated that she could set aside anything she had heard about the case and rely solely on the evidence presented in court and that she could follow the trial court's instructions concerning the law. (R. 451, 456.) C.S. also stated that she would be \"objective.\" (R. 451.) Thus, the trial court did not err in finding that C.S. could be a fair and impartial juror and in denying Johnson's challenge for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   Prospective juror E.C. stated that she had \"some media knowledge of the events,\" but she did not remember many details of the incident. (R. 471.) E.C. stated that she could set aside anything she had heard about this case and any impressions or opinions that she might have gathered from what she heard and that she could render a verdict solely on the evidence presented in the courtroom and the trial court's instructions concerning the law. E.C. also stated that, around the time the incident occurred, she discussed the incident with people at work. E.C. could not remember the opinions of any of her coworkers. E.C. had mentioned to her coworkers that possibly drug use was a cause of the incident because Johnson was a pharmacist. E.C. then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-340\">\n   \"I would believe that [Johnson] is responsible. But as the judge stated yesterday, there are reasons why he has pled not guilty. I don't know what those are.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-341\">\n   \"So, from the previous knowledge that I have, I would say yes that I have an opinion.

Thus, the trial court did not err in denying Johnson's for-cause challenge to E.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   Prospective juror M.G. told the trial court that she could set aside anything she had heard about the case and any opinions she had formed and that she would consider only the evidence presented in court and the law as instructed by the trial court. The prosecutor asked M.G. whether she could set aside any prior opinions that she had formed or heard concerning the present case. M.G. responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-346\">\n   \"Yes, sir, because I have to consider that what I read and heard-I'm actually a little embarrassed that I don't remember details. But I have to realize that is what was reported. What will come out I would have to assume is more than that.

M.G. also stated: \"In spite of the fact that I do have an opinion, I am also able to listen to any evidence and make a decision based on that.\" (R. 603.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   M.G. ended her individual voir dire with the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-350\">\n   \"The Court: You understand we are looking for jurors, as in any case, civil, criminal or whatever, that they give both parties a level playing field whenever they first come in here.

However, she repeatedly stated that she could set aside that opinion and that she would base her verdict solely on the evidence that was presented at trial. Therefore, M.G. indicated that her opinion was not fixed. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to strike M.G. for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   Prospective juror J.S. stated that he had read about the incident and had discussed it with his friends. In response to questions from the State, J.S. stated that he could set aside any opinions that he had and that he could render a verdict based solely on what he saw and heard in the courtroom. In response to questions from defense counsel, J.S. stated that he was shocked by the shooting and that, based on what he had read in the newspaper, he thought \"it seemed a little excessive for the situation.\" (R. 624.) J.S. also indicated that, based on the reports he heard, he believed that Johnson shot Officer Davis. J.S. ended his individual voir dire with the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-358\">\n   \"The Court: Let me ask you this, [J.S.].

However, J.C. repeatedly stated that he could set aside that opinion and base his verdict solely on the evidence presented at trial. (R. 728-29, 734.) At the end of J.C.'s individual voir dire, the trial court specifically asked J.C.: \"But from what I gather it's not a fixed opinion?\" (R. 734.) J.C. responded: \"That's correct.

However, M.C. repeatedly stated that she could set aside any opinions she had formed and that she would render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented at trial. (R. 971, 976, 981-82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   M.C.'s answers did not indicate that she had a fixed opinion concerning Johnson's guilt.

According to Johnson, those prospective jurors indicated that they would not consider an insanity defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   Prospective jurors W.P., M.H., C.Hu., A.C., and K.T. were struck for cause by joint agreement during group voir dire because they stated that they could not consider an insanity defense. (R. 1220, 1241-44.) Therefore, because W.P., M.H., C.Hu., A.C., and K.T. did not serve on the jury and because Johnson was not forced to use any of his peremptory challenges to remove them, any error in otherwise not striking those prospective jurors for cause was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-407\">\n   Concerning Johnson's defense of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, prospective juror C.S. stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-408\">\n   \"Prospective juror [C.S.]: In this case because that second part that the judge explained about that he was asking for a plea of innocence based on mental illness and I wouldn't believe that.

C.S. further stated that she would be fair to both sides. (R. 452-53.) C.S. clarified that her familiarity with good and bad psychiatrists would factor into her evaluation of the witnesses who testify. C.S. stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-417\">\n   \"Prospective juror [C.S.]: Again, I believe it is because I've had a lot of experience with psychiatric care within this town, that I know many of the psychiatrists based on the care that they render, because of what I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-418\">\n   \"[Defense counsel]: But you don't really believe in a psychiatric defense, do you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-419\">\n   \"Prospective juror [C.S.]: Let me put it this way.

During individual voir dire, W.W. explained: \"I personally don't believe that is an excuse. You still murdered someone.\" (R. 638.) However, in response to questions from the prosecutor, W.W. confirmed that he could set aside his personal feelings, listen to all the evidence, and follow the trial court's instructions concerning the defense of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. (R. 638-39.) Furthermore, at the conclusion of W.W.'s individual voir dire, in response to questions from the trial court, W.W. assured the court that he could disregard his personal feelings, that he could listen to all the evidence, and that he could follow the court's instructions. (R. 641.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-424\">\n   The trial court was in a much better position than this Court to assess W.W.'s credibility. W.W. stated multiple times that he could set aside his personal feelings, listen to all the evidence, and follow the trial court's instructions concerning an insanity defense. The trial court believed that testimony. There is no basis for us to hold that the trial court exceeded its discretion in refusing to remove W.W. for cause.

In response to questioning from the prosecutor, L.M. confirmed that, regardless of the fact that she believed in the principle of an eye for an eye, she would consider all the evidence and follow the trial court's instructions.

Before the trial court sustained the prosecutor's objection to defense counsel's question, L.M. stated that she would not automatically vote for the death penalty, and she repeatedly stated that she would consider all the evidence and follow the trial court's instructions. After the prosecutor's initial objection, in order to clear up any ambiguity, the trial court fulfilled its function by questioning L.M. further to ascertain whether she could be impartial. In response to the trial court's questioning, L.M. confirmed that she could set aside her belief in the principle of an eye for an eye and that she would base her sentencing recommendation on the law given by the trial court and on the evidence presented in the courtroom. There is no evidence indicating that the trial court's disallowance of defense counsel's question resulted in any prejudice to Johnson. Therefore, the trial court did not exceed its discretion, and we conclude that Johnson's claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-474\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-475\">\n   In prospective juror C.S.'s juror questionnaire, she answered \"yes\" to the following question: \"In your opinion, whatever the reason may be, do you have such a strong opinion of murder in general that you feel it would be difficult for you to give a fair and impartial trial sitting as a juror to one charged with murder?\" (R. 450.) During individual voir dire, the prosecutor asked C.S. to explain her answer to that question, and she complied with the prosecutor's request. (R. 450-51.) Johnson's counsel also asked C.S. to explain her answer to that question, and, again, she explained her answer. (R. 453-55.) When Johnson's counsel confronted C.S. with the question yet another time, the prosecutor objected on the ground that the question had already been asked and answered multiple times, and the trial court agreed with the prosecutor. (R. 455.) Finally, the trial court questioned C.S., as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-476\">\n   \"The Court: Of course you told me a while ago that you could set aside anything that you've heard, seen or observed and rely solely on the evidence and the law I instruct you.

Before the trial court sustained the prosecutor's objection to defense counsel's question, C.S. had already answered that specific question at least twice. Furthermore, after the prosecutor's objection, in order to clear up any ambiguity, the trial court fulfilled its function by questioning C.S. further to ascertain whether she could be impartial. In response to the trial court's questioning, C.S. confirmed that she could set aside anything she had previously observed, that she could rely solely on the evidence presented at trial and on the law given by the trial court, and that she could consider both life imprisonment without parole and the death penalty. There is no evidence indicating that the trial court's disallowance of defense counsel's question resulted in any prejudice to Johnson. Therefore, the trial court did not exceed its discretion, and we conclude that Johnson's claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-484\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-485\">\n   Next, Johnson argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a change of venue. Specifically, Johnson argues that the community was so saturated with pretrial publicity that no impartial jury could be selected and that the pretrial publicity created actual prejudice against him on the part of the jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-486\">\n   Before trial, Johnson filed a motion for a change of venue. (C. 399-404.) In that motion, Johnson stated that the death of Officer Davis had received widespread publicity in the local newspapers. Johnson also pointed out that the local newspapers had published several stories about the aftermath of Officer Davis's death. The motion also stated that \"[s]imilar publicity was broadcast over the radio and television in Shelby County and the surrounding areas.\" (C. 401.) Although the motion made general allegations such as \"[t]hese reports described the death, arrest and legal proceedings in sensationalized detail,\" the motion did not provide any specific details concerning the sensational nature of any specific media report.

Johnson has not demonstrated either presumed prejudice or actual prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-507\">\n   Concerning presumed prejudice, although Johnson has shown that there was widespread publicity concerning the death of Officer Davis and its aftermath, he has not set forth any evidence indicating that the media reports were anything other than largely factual accounts, nor has he set forth any evidence indicating that the media reports were inherently prejudicial, inflammatory, or sensational. The present case does not present an \"extreme\" situation in which the presumptive-prejudice standard would be applicable. Therefore, we hold that Johnson failed to carry his burden of showing presumed prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-508\">\n   Concerning actual prejudice, Johnson has not pointed out any juror who had a preformed opinion that Johnson was guilty and who could not lay aside that preformed opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented at trial. In Johnson's brief, he cites prospective jurors W.P., M.H., B.A., C.S., E.C., M.G., J.S., J.C., M.I., C.B., C.H., D.R., P.H., and M.C. to support his contention. Johnson simply states that those prospective jurors \"all said they already believed Mr. Johnson was guilty based on the pretrial publicity of the case.\" Johnson's brief, at 63. First, concerning those prospective jurors, only J.C. ultimately served on the jury and decided the case, and prospective jurors W.P. and M.H. were removed for cause. Furthermore, as we addressed in Part III.C.,\n   supra, to the extent that any of the prospective jurors who were not removed for cause, including J.C., had a preformed opinion that Johnson was guilty, voir dire revealed that that opinion could be laid aside and that those prospective jurors could render a verdict based on the evidence presented at trial. Therefore, Johnson has failed to meet his burden of showing actual prejudice; thus, he has failed to establish any error concerning the trial court's denial of his motion for a change of venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-509\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-510\">\n   Next, Johnson argues that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to support either of the two aggravating circumstances that were offered to allow the imposition of his death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-511\">\n   Section 13A-5-45(f), Ala.Code 1975, provides: \"Unless at least one aggravating circumstance as defined in Section 13A-5-49 exists, the sentence shall be life imprisonment without parole.\" In the present case, the State offered the following two aggravating circumstances to allow the imposition of the death penalty: (1) \"[t]he capital offense was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting an escape from custody\" and (2) \"[t]he capital offense was committed to disrupt or hinder the lawful exercise of any governmental function or the enforcement of laws.\" \u00a7 13A-5-49(5) and (7), Ala.Code 1975. The jury was instructed concerning both of those aggravating circumstances. (R. 2211-12.) The jury then returned a recommendation of death for each conviction. (R. 2250-51.) In sentencing Johnson to death for each conviction, the trial court found that both of those aggravating circumstances existed. (C. 438.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-512\">\n   Concerning whether the offense was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting an escape from custody, we note that, under Alabama law, refusal to sign a written ticket is cause for an arrest. \u00a7 32-1-4, Ala.Code 1975. During the penalty phase, Peter Fulmer, a lieutenant with the Pelham Police Department, testified that, until a ticket is signed, the person who is receiving the ticket is \"not free to leave.\" (R. 2062.) Lt. Fulmer explained: \"By signing the ticket, they are not acknowledging their guilt, they are just promising to appear in court. They're basically making their bond on that charge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lt. Fulmer further testified that if a person refuses to sign the ticket, the officer issuing the ticket does not \"have any choice but to take them-make a physical custodial arrest.\" (R. 2062-63.) At trial, the State presented evidence indicating that Officer Davis stopped Johnson for speeding, prepared a written speeding ticket, and intended to issue that ticket to Johnson. However, when Johnson was asked to sign the ticket, he shot Officer Davis and drove away. Specifically, the recording of the traffic stop revealed that, while Officer Davis held his ticket book in his hands, he leaned toward the driver's side window and told Johnson: \"I need your signature at the bottom.\" Then, immediately, Johnson shot Officer Davis in the face and drove away. Therefore, the State presented evidence indicating that Johnson did not intend to sign the ticket, which would have led to his arrest if he had not shot Officer Davis.

In the present case, the State presented evidence indicating that Johnson murdered Officer Davis while he was on duty and while he was conducting a traffic stop.

When the State rested, the defense moved for a judgment of acquittal arguing that the State had failed to prove a prima facie case. (R. 1551.) The trial court denied that motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7561940\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/521/80/#p84\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-517\">\n   On appeal, Johnson argues that his decision to withdraw his plea of not guilty and to plead only not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea and that the trial court should have conducted the guilty-plea colloquy required by Rule 14.4(a), Ala. R.Crim. P., which would have required the trial court to ascertain whether Johnson's plea was voluntary and whether he understood the consequences of his plea. However, on its face, Rule 14.4(a) applies only when the trial court \"accept[s] a plea of guilty,\" and there is no such rule of law requiring the trial court to conduct a colloquy when the defendant pleads only not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. As this Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-518\">\n   \" ' \"A plea of guilty is more than a voluntary confession made in open court.

Thus, contrary to Johnson's contention, we hold that his decision to plead only not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect was not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea. Therefore, considering that there is no rule of law requiring the trial court to conduct a Rule 14.4(a) -type colloquy when the defendant pleads only not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect and that Johnson's plea was not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea, we hold that the trial court did not err in allowing Johnson to withdraw his plea of not guilty and to plead only not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect without first ascertaining whether his decision was voluntary and whether he fully understood the consequences of his decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   VIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   Next, Johnson argues that the trial court erroneously excluded as hearsay a written statement provided to the Alabama State Pharmacy Board by Wes Maddox, who was Johnson's work supervisor. Specifically, Johnson argues that the statement was not hearsay and that, if it was hearsay, it was admissible under Rule 803(6), Ala. R. Evid., which contains the business-records exception to the hearsay rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-523\">\n   Maddox testified that an investigator for the Alabama State Board of Pharmacy asked him to write a statement concerning Johnson and that he complied with that request. Defense counsel attempted to introduce that written statement at trial. (R. 1557.) The prosecutor objected on the ground that the statement was hearsay. (R. 1557, 1568.) Defense counsel argued that the statement was not hearsay because, he said, the \"proper predicate was laid when [Maddox] said 'I wrote the letter.' \" (R. 1569.) The trial court responded: \"I know, but any time a witness writes a letter to someone it doesn't make it an exception.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042652\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/29/252/#p253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Then, the trial court sustained the objection.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7042652\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/29/252/#p253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Later, defense counsel asked the trial court to reconsider its ruling and argued that the statement was admissible under Rule 803(6), Ala. R. Evid. (R. 1571.) Specifically, defense counsel argued that the statement was admissible under the business-records exception to the hearsay rule because, he said, Maddox was a supervisor for Fred's Pharmacy and it was his regular duty to make reports to the Alabama State Board of Pharmacy. (R. 1572.) Again, the trial court ruled that the letter was inadmissible. (R. 1574.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-524\">\n   The written statement is part of the record on appeal. It is a one-page letter written by Maddox to the Alabama State Pharmacy Board on December 11, 2009. The letter states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-525\">\n   \"As a follow up to our conversation today, I am providing you with a statement based on what we discussed. My name is Wes Maddox and I am the HealthCare Manager for Fred's Pharmacy in the state of Alabama. Bart Johnson has worked for me since May 2007. Below is a list of Fred's Pharmacy locations in which he has worked and the position he held at each:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-526\">\n   \"4/20/01-Store 1186-PH08 (student Part-time)/PH04 (Hourly Pharmacist)/PH03 (Salaried Pharmacist)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-527\">\n   \"1/21/05-Store 1371-PH02 (Pharmacy Manager)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-528\">\n   \"2/03/06-Store 2504-PH02 (Pharmacy Manager)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-529\">\n   \"3/28/08-Store 2036-PH02 (Pharmacy Manager)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-530\">\n   \"Most recently Bart has been the PIC at store 2036 in Jasper, AL.

I have never had any issues with Bart, and I have never had to perform a coaching and counseling session (PIP-Performance Improvement Plan) with him. As we discussed, I am not aware of any anger issues or impairment problems. I do not recall any shortages in the time Bart has worked for me. Recently, I had asked Bart to help me with a new store opening in Bayou La Batre. He agreed to go work at the store November 19 and 20 for the Soft Grand Opening, as well as go back and train my new PIC November 30-December 3.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-531\">\n   (C. 535.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-532\">\n   On appeal, Johnson alleges that the written statement was not hearsay, but he does not give any explanation as to why the statement was not hearsay. The only argument that Johnson made at trial was that the statement was not hearsay because \"[Maddox] said 'I wrote the letter.' \" Rule 801(c), Ala. R. Evid., provides that \" '[h]earsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Rule 801(a), Ala. R. Evid., provides that \"[a] 'statement' is (1) an oral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an assertion.\" Clearly, the trial court was correct in ruling that an out-of-court statement is not removed from the hearsay rule simply because a witness testifies that he wrote the statement. Further, we recognize that Maddox's letter was an out-of-court written assertion, i.e., a statement, and Johnson has never contended that it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Therefore, we hold that the letter was hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-533\">\n   Furthermore, the letter was not admissible under the business-records exception to the hearsay rule. Rule 803(6), Ala. R. Evid., provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-534\">\n   \"A memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, or by certification that complies with Rule 902(11), Rule 902(12), or a statute permitting certification, unless the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness. The term 'business' as used in this paragraph includes business, institution, association, profession, occupation, and calling of every kind, whether or not conducted for profit.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-535\">\n   In order for evidence to be admissible under this hearsay exception, the proponent must first lay the proper foundation as set forth in the rule.

However, Maddox never testified that it was his regular duty to make reports to the Alabama State Board of Pharmacy. More specifically, he never testified that this particular letter was made in the regular course of his business as a supervisor for Fred's Pharmacy. Therefore, Johnson failed to lay the proper foundation for admission of the letter under the business-records exception to the hearsay rule. Thus, we hold that the trial court did not err in ruling that the letter was inadmissible hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-537\">\n   Moreover, even if the letter was erroneously excluded, the error was harmless. \" '[T]he exclusion of admissible evidence does not constitute reversible error where the evidence \"would have been merely cumulative of other evidence of the same nature, which was admitted.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    Brownfield v.

Maddox testified that he supervised the stores where Johnson worked, that he did not recall any drug shortages in the stores where Johnson worked, that he was not aware of any anger issues with Johnson, that Johnson was a good employee, and that he asked Johnson to help him open a new store in Bayou La Batre. (R. 1555-56.) Therefore, the information in the letter was cumulative of Maddox's testimony.

Defense counsel did not mention intoxication. The State responded that \"there is no evidence for recklessness of any kind, especially considering the fact that the defendant has withdrawn his plea of not guilty.\" (R. 1912.)

First, Johnson cites Dr. Golden's\n   testimony concerning the entire time that Johnson was in Bayou La Batre helping to open the new store. Dr. Golden testified that, during that time, \"[Johnson] was drinking\" and \"taking medications for-his Imitrex for his headaches for migraines.\" (R. 1616.) Dr. Golden further testified that, when he interviewed Johnson, Johnson did not remember how much he drank or how many pills he consumed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8424212\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/930/550/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although not cited by Johnson in his brief, Dr. Golden later testified that, when Johnson left work at around 8 or 9 p.m. on the night of the shooting, \"he went to a McDonald's and bought a Coke and I guess a burger or something, and put rum in the Coke.\" (R. 1625-26.) However, Dr. Golden never testified that voluntary intoxication caused Johnson to act recklessly at the time of the offense. Instead, Dr. Golden testified that, due to a variety of factors, Johnson suffered an acute or brief psychotic episode that rendered him incapable of understanding the wrongfulness of his acts at the time of the offense. Second, Johnson cites Dr. King's testimony that, when he interviewed Johnson, Johnson stated that he \"had a few drinks\" when he was driving home on the night of the shooting. (R. 1869.) During the interview, Dr. King specifically asked Johnson whether he was intoxicated, and he did not respond.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8424212\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/930/550/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-550\">\n   There was no evidence concerning whether Johnson's ingestion of \"a few drinks\" over the course of his drive from Bayou La Batre to Pelham-a distance of about 250 miles-caused a disturbance of his mental or physical capacities at the time the offense was committed. Mere \" ' \"[e]vidence that someone was drinking an alcoholic beverage is not evidence that that person was intoxicated,\" ' \" and \"evidence that the defendant ingested alcohol or drugs, standing alone, does not warrant a charge on intoxication.\"\n   <em>\n    Pilley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8424212\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/930/550/\">\n    930 So.2d at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we hold that there was not sufficient evidence of intoxication for the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt as to the element of intent, and, thus, there was no reasonable theory from the evidence to support a manslaughter charge.

Alabama law requires the existence of only one aggravating circumstance in order for a defendant to be sentenced to death. Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 13A-5-45(f).

Instead, under Alabama's capital-sentencing scheme,\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   require only that the jury unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one aggravating circumstance exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-559\">\n   In the present case, the trial court instructed the jury on the two aggravating circumstances it could consider, and the court repeatedly instructed the jury that it could not even consider recommending the death penalty unless it first unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one of those aggravating circumstances existed. (R. 2210-14, 2217, 2227-28, 2238-39, 2243.) \"It is well settled that jurors are presumed to follow, not disregard, the trial court's instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.

A digital recording showed that Officer Davis stopped Johnson's Acura sedan for\n   speeding and that, during that stop, the driver of the sedan shot Officer Davis in the face with a pistol. The recording also revealed that, before the shooting, the driver informed Officer Davis that his brother was a police officer. The police officers who initially responded to the scene of the shooting discovered Officer Davis's ticket book lying near his body, and the most recent ticket in the book contained information about Johnson. Shortly after the shooting, Johnson's Acura sedan was discovered in a neighborhood in north Birmingham, and a resident of that neighborhood observed someone in a gray Toyota Tundra truck pick up the driver of the Acura sedan. Shortly after that event, Johnson's brother, who was a police officer, stopped his gray Toyota Tundra truck on the side of the interstate near some police officers from the City of Hoover, and he and Johnson exited the truck. A .40 caliber pistol was recovered from the glove compartment of the Toyota Tundra truck. DNA analysis revealed that blood found on that pistol came from Officer Davis. DNA analysis further revealed that blood found on Johnson's Acura sedan and on his clothing came from Officer Davis. Also, a senior state medical examiner testified that Officer Davis \"died from a gunshot wound to the face that injured his spinal column\" and that the gunshot was fired within a few inches of Officer Davis's face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-574\">\n   We hold that this evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict. Based on this evidence, the jury by fair inference could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Johnson murdered Officer Davis while he was on duty and that Johnson murdered Officer Davis by or through the use of a deadly weapon fired within or from a vehicle. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying Johnson's motion for a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-575\">\n   XII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-576\">\n   Finally, we address Johnson's contention that the trial court's written sentencing order does not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 13A-5-47(d), Ala.Code 1975, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-577\">\n   \"Based upon the evidence presented at trial, the evidence presented during the sentence hearing, and the pre-sentence investigation report and any evidence submitted in connection with it, the trial court shall enter specific written findings concerning the existence or nonexistence of each aggravating circumstance enumerated in Section 13A-5-49, each mitigating circumstance enumerated in Section 13A-5-51, and any additional mitigating circumstances offered pursuant to Section 13A-5-52. The trial court shall also enter written findings of facts summarizing the crime and the defendant's participation in it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-578\">\n   In the present case, the trial court issued a written sentencing order for each conviction on June 16, 2011. (C. 427, 429.) Then, on July 15, 2011, the trial court issued a written order titled \"finding of fact in regard to punishment phase of the trial,\" and the court issued another written order in which the trial court made findings of fact concerning the crime and Johnson's participation in it. (C. 438-39, 442-46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-579\">\n   The trial court made written findings that there were two aggravating circumstances: (1) the capital offense was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting an escape from custody, see \u00a7 13A-5-49(5), Ala.Code 1975, and (2) the capital offense was committed to disrupt or hinder the enforcement of laws, see \u00a7 13A-5-49(7), Ala.Code 1975. (C. 438.) However, the trial court did not make specific written findings concerning the existence or nonexistence\n   of the remaining statutory aggravating circumstances, as required by \u00a7 13A-5-47(d). In fact, the other statutory aggravating circumstances were not mentioned in the trial court's orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-580\">\n   Concerning the statutory mitigating circumstances found in \u00a7 13A-5-51, the trial court simply stated: \"Although Defendant had no prior criminal activity and Defendant indicated he was under extreme mental or emotional disturbance, the court having weighed the aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances finds also the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating and the jury's recommendation as to punishment was fully justified by the facts in the case.\" (C. 438.) Thus, it appears that the trial court found the existence of one mitigating circumstance: Johnson had no significant history of prior criminal activity. However, although the trial court recognized that Johnson argued that he was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, the trial court did not make a specific written finding concerning whether that mitigating circumstance existed, and the trial court did not make specific written findings concerning the existence or nonexistence of the remaining statutory mitigating circumstances, as required by \u00a7 13A-5-47(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-581\">\n   Also, contrary to the requirements of \u00a7 13A-5-47(d), the trial court did not make any written findings concerning the existence or nonexistence of nonstatutory mitigating circumstances offered pursuant to \u00a7 13A-5-52, even though Johnson offered such evidence, and, at the sentencing hearing, the trial court appeared to recognize that Johnson had offered such evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-582\">\n   Therefore, because the trial court's sentencing orders do not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 13A-5-47, we must remand this case for the trial court to amend its sentencing orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-583\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-584\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we hold that none of the issues raised by Johnson on appeal form a basis to reverse his convictions. Further, concerning Johnson's convictions, as required by Rule 45A, Ala. R.App. P., we have searched the record for any error that has or probably has adversely affected Johnson's substantial rights and have found no plain error or defect in the proceedings under review. Therefore, we affirm Johnson's convictions for two counts of murder made capital because the victim was a police officer who was on duty and because the murder was committed by or through the use of a deadly weapon fired within or from a vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-585\">\n   Concerning sentencing, we remand this case with instructions that the trial court amend its sentencing orders to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 13A-5-47(d), Ala.Code 1975. On remand, the trial court must \"enter specific written findings concerning the existence or nonexistence of each aggravating circumstance enumerated in Section 13A-5-49, each mitigating circumstance enumerated in Section 13A-5-51, and any additional mitigating circumstances offered pursuant to Section 13A-5-52.\" If necessary, the trial court may reweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and resentence Johnson. On return to remand, we will address any remaining sentencing issues that have not been addressed in this opinion. Due return shall be made to this Court within 42 days from the date of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-586\">\n   AFFIRMED AS TO CONVICTIONS AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS AS TO SENTENCING.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-587\">\n   WINDOM, P.J., and WELCH, J., concur. KELLUM, J., concurs specially, with opinion. JOINER, J., recuses himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-588\">\n   I concur with the main opinion. I write specially as to Part VII of the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-589\">\n   Bart Wayne Johnson argues that the trial court erred in not conducting a colloquy similar to the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   /Rule 14.4\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   colloquy required for guilty pleas to ascertain that his decision to withdraw his plea of not guilty and to proceed to trial solely on his plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect was knowing and voluntary. This Court concludes that Rule 14.4 on its face applies only to pleas of guilty and that \"there is no such rule of law requiring the trial court to conduct a colloquy when the defendant pleads only not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.\" 256 So.3d at 739. Thus, we hold that Johnson's plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect was not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea and that the trial court did not err in not conducting a colloquy with Johnson to ensure that his decision to withdraw his plea of not guilty and to pursue solely a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect was voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-590\">\n   I agree that the trial court in this case did not err in not conducting a colloquy with Johnson to ascertain whether his decision to forgo his not-guilty plea and to pursue solely his plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect was voluntary. The plain language of Rule 14.4, Ala. R.Crim. P., clearly states that the colloquy required by that rule is necessary only when a defendant enters a \"plea of guilty.\" Additionally, there is no federal constitutional requirement that a defendant who withdraws his or her plea of not guilty and proceeds to trial solely on a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect must do so voluntarily. However, I do not believe our opinion today should be read as a blanket holding that in no circumstance would a trial court be required to inquire into the voluntariness of a criminal defendant's decision to forgo a not-guilty plea and to pursue solely a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. In my opinion, our holding today is limited to the specific facts and circumstances of the case before us, facts and circumstances that establish that Johnson's plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect was not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-591\">\n   This is the first time that an Alabama court has had occasion to address the issue whether a defendant who withdraws his or her plea of not guilty and proceeds solely on a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect must be advised by the trial court of the consequences of his or her decision in a fashion similar to the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   /Rule 14.4 colloquy required for guilty pleas. However, other jurisdictions have addressed the issue, and most of those jurisdictions have concluded that in some circumstances due process does require a trial court to engage in a colloquy with a criminal defendant who pleads solely not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to ensure that the plea is knowingly and voluntarily entered.

Initially, I point out that although the main opinion correctly observes that the State in this case was held to its burden of proving to the jury all the essential elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, that fact is not dispositive of whether Johnson's due-process rights were violated because, in Alabama, even when a defendant pleads guilty to a capital offense the State still must prove to a jury all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt \"in cases where the death penalty is to be imposed.\" See \u00a7 13A-5-42, Ala.Code 1975. The fact, then, that the State was held to its burden of proof does not necessarily indicate that Johnson's plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect was not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea. Rather, it is that fact coupled with the other circumstances in this case that leads to the conclusion that Johnson's plea was not the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-604\">\n   The record indicates that although Johnson withdrew his plea of not guilty before trial, the jury was never specifically informed of that fact and Johnson never stipulated to the facts of the crimes nor did he expressly concede guilt. In fact, during trial, defense counsel cross-examined the State's witnesses and presented a witness on Johnson's behalf that was unrelated to the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. Defense counsel also argued that Johnson's mental disease or defect rendered him unable to form the requisite criminal intent necessary to convict Johnson of capital murder. In other words, despite the overwhelming evidence against Johnson, the defense contested the State's case. Likewise, the State vigorously contested Johnson's assertion of mental disease or defect. Both parties presented testimony from multiple expert witnesses, and those witnesses were thoroughly examined and cross-examined. Finally, the record indicates that, despite Johnson's withdrawal of his not-guilty plea, the jury was given the option of finding Johnson not guilty of the capital offenses in addition to the options of finding Johnson not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect or of finding Johnson guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-605\">\n   Based on the adversarial nature of Johnson's trial, I agree that the trial court in this case did not err in not conducting a colloquy with Johnson to ascertain that his decision to withdraw his not-guilty plea and to pursue solely a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect was voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-606\">\n   <em>\n    On Return to Remand\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-607\">\n   Bart Wayne Johnson was convicted of two counts of murder made capital because the victim was a police officer who was on duty, see \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(5), Ala.Code 1975, and because the murder was committed by or through the use of a deadly weapon fired within or from a vehicle, see \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(18), Ala.Code 1975. The jury, by a vote of 10 to 2, recommended that Johnson be sentenced to death. The trial court followed the jury's recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-608\">\n   On May 20, 2014, this Court affirmed Johnson's convictions but remanded the case for the trial court to amend its sentencing orders because the trial court's sentencing orders did not comply with the\n   requirements of \u00a7 13A-5-47(d), Ala.Code 1975.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The trial court specifically found that none of the other aggravating circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 13A-5-49, Ala.Code 1975, existed. The trial court also found the existence of one statutory mitigating circumstance, i.e., that Johnson has no significant history of prior criminal activity, see \u00a7 13A-5-51(1), Ala.Code 1975. The trial court specifically found that none of the other statutory mitigating circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 13A-5-51, Ala.Code 1975, existed. Furthermore, the trial court found that four additional mitigating circumstances offered pursuant to \u00a7 13A-5-52, Ala.Code 1975, existed: (1) Johnson's lack of violence before this incident, (2) Johnson's difficult childhood and family background and his success in life despite those difficulties, (3) Johnson's exemplary character before this incident, including the help he had given to other people, and (4) that Johnson was a good husband and a good father to his two children. The trial court specifically gave \"great weight\" to all the mitigating circumstances. Nevertheless, the trial court found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. Accordingly, the trial court followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced Johnson to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-610\">\n   Pursuant to \u00a7 13A-5-53, Ala.Code 1975, this Court is required to address the propriety of Johnson's sentence of death. Johnson was convicted of two counts of murder made capital because the victim was a police officer who was on duty, see \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(5), Ala.Code 1975, and because the murder was committed by or through the use of a deadly weapon fired within or from a vehicle, see \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(18), Ala.Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-611\">\n   The record does not reflect that Johnson's sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. See \u00a7 13A-5-53(b)(1), Ala.Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-612\">\n   The trial court correctly found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. In its sentencing order, the trial court stated that it found two aggravating circumstances. The trial court then considered each of the statutory mitigating circumstances and found that one statutory mitigating circumstances was applicable. The trial court also found and considered four nonstatutory mitigating circumstances. As described above, the trial court found that each of the mitigating circumstances was entitled to \"great weight.\" The trial court's sentencing order shows that it properly weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and correctly sentenced Johnson to death. The record supports the trial court's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-613\">\n   Section 13A-5-53(b)(2), Ala.Code 1975, requires this Court to independently weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in order to determine whether Johnson's death sentence is proper. After independently weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, this Court finds that Johnson's sentence of death is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-614\">\n   As required by \u00a7 13A-5-53(b)(3), Ala.Code 1975, this Court must now determine whether Johnson's sentence is excessive or disproportionate when compared to the penalty imposed in similar cases. In this case, Johnson was convicted of two counts of murder made capital because the victim was a police officer who was on duty and because the murder was committed by or through the use of a deadly weapon fired within or from a vehicle. Sentences of death have been imposed for similar crimes in this State. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Woodward v.

Therefore, considering both the crime and the defendant, this Court finds that Johnson's death sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-615\">\n   Finally, this Court has searched the entire record for any error that may have adversely affected Johnson's substantial rights and has found none. See Rule 45A, Ala.

In light of the trial court's instructions, the fact that the jury returned a verdict recommending the death penalty by a vote of 10 to 2 indicates that it unanimously found the existence of at least one particular aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-645\">\n   Johnson attempts to distinguish his case from\n   <em>\n    Ex parte McNabb\n   </em>\n   by quoting a short excerpt from the trial court's jury instructions. He concedes that the trial court instructed the jury that it must find at least one aggravating circumstance in order to recommend a sentence of death but then asserts that the judge \"also instructed the jury that it could recommend death based on '\n   <em>\n    one or fewer\n   </em>\n   aggravating circumstances.' \" (Johnson's supplemental brief, at 10, quoting R. 2219, 2244.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, he says, the trial court \"directed the\n   jury to recommend death even if it did not find the existence of an aggravating circumstance.\" (Johnson's supplemental brief, at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-646\">\n   However, the quoted excerpt Johnson uses to support his argument is taken out of context and presented in a way that is misleading. A review of the entirety of the jury instructions reveals that the quoted passage appeared\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the trial court clearly explained to the jurors that they must unanimously find the existence of an aggravating circumstance before considering whether to recommend death. The trial court then proceeded to explain that, if the jury found that one or more aggravating circumstances existed, it was to then proceed to weigh those circumstances against any mitigating factors it found. In explaining the weighing process, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-647\">\n   \"The process of weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances against each other in each case in order to determine the proper punishment in each case is not a mechanical process. Your weighing all the circumstances against each other should not consist of merely adding up the number of aggravating circumstances or mitigating circumstances [and] comparing that number to the total number of mitigating circumstances or aggravating circumstances. That would be improper.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-648\">\n   \"The law in this state recognizes that's possible in at least some situations that one or fewer aggravating circumstances might outweigh a large number of mitigating circumstances. The law of this state also recognizes as possible, at least in some situations, that a large number of aggravating circumstances might be outweighed by one or a few mitigating circumstances.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-649\">\n   (R. 2219.) Contrary to Johnson's argument, this instruction did not suggest that the jury could recommend death even if it did not find any aggravating circumstances to exist. Rather, it explained that the weighing process was not a mere tallying system and that various aggravating or mitigating circumstances might have different weights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-650\">\n   Because the trial court instructed the jury that it could not proceed to consider recommending the death penalty unless it first found a particular aggravating circumstance to exist, the fact that the jury proceeded to the weighing process and voted on whether to impose the death penalty or a sentence of life imprisonment without parole demonstrates that it found at least one particular aggravating circumstance to exist in each case. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   was satisfied because the jury made the finding necessary to make Johnson eligible for the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Bohannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12368479\" index=\"484\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/222/525/#p531\">\n    222 So.3d at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because in Alabama a jury, not a judge, makes the finding of the existence of an aggravating circumstance that makes a capital defendant eligible for a sentence of death, Alabama's capital-sentencing scheme is not unconstitutional on this basis.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-651\">\n   We note that the Alabama Supreme Court has authorized the use of verdict forms with special interrogatories during the penalty-phase deliberations in capital-murder trials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte McGriff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8945677\" index=\"485\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/908/1024/\">\n    908 So.2d at 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such forms would instruct jurors to record which, if any, aggravating circumstances were unanimously found to exist. The Court gave the following example of a special verdict form in\n   <em>\n    McGriff\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-652\">\n   \" '\n   <em>\n    State of Alabama v. Dennis Demetrius McGriff\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-653\">\n   \" 'The first question before the jury is whether the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that, in committing the capital offense charged in the indictment,\n   the defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-654\">\n   \" 'The number of jurors who answer and vote \"yes\" to the first question is ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-655\">\n   \" 'The number of jurors who answer and vote \"no\" to the first question is ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-656\">\n   \" '____________________\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-657\">\n   \" 'Foreperson's signature.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-658\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8945677\" index=\"486\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/908/1024/\">\n    908 So.2d at 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The use of such forms in the future would remove any ambiguity regarding a jury's penalty-phase findings. However, as explained above, the trial court properly and clearly instructed Johnson's jury as to its responsibilities during the penalty-phase deliberations. Accordingly, there was no ambiguity in the present case. The jury, not the trial court, made the findings that were necessary to make Johnson eligible for the death penalty. Accordingly, his sentences do not violate\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Billups\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-659\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-660\">\n   Next, Johnson argues that the jury's \" 'advisory only' \" role during the penalty phase did not satisfy the requirements of the Sixth Amendment. (Johnson's supplemental brief, at 11.) Johnson contends that, because the jury's sentencing recommendation is not binding on the trial court, the judge, as opposed to the jury, \"must make all of the penalty-phase findings necessary for\" a death sentence to be imposed. (Johnson's supplemental brief, at 12.) However, the Alabama Supreme Court addressed this issue in\n   <em>\n    Bohannon\n   </em>\n   and decided it adversely to Johnson. In\n   <em>\n    Bohannon\n   </em>\n   , the Alabama Supreme Court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-661\">\n   \"Bohannon contends that an instruction to the jury that its sentence is merely advisory conflicts with\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   because, he says,\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   establishes that an 'advisory recommendation' by the jury is insufficient as the 'necessary factual finding that\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   requires.'\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   , 577 U.S. ----, 136 S.Ct. at 622 (holding that the 'advisory' recommendation by the jury in Florida's capital-sentencing scheme was inadequate as the 'necessary factual finding that\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   requires'). Bohannon ignores the fact that the finding required by\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   to be made by the jury, i.e., the existence of the aggravating factor that makes a defendant death-eligible, is indeed made by the jury, not the judge, in Alabama. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   suggests that, once the jury finds the existence of the aggravating circumstance that establishes the range of punishment to include death, the jury cannot make a recommendation for the judge to consider in determining the appropriate sentence or that the judge cannot evaluate the jury's sentencing recommendation to determine the appropriate sentence within the statutory range. Therefore, the making of a sentencing recommendation by the jury and the judge's use of the jury's recommendation to determine the appropriate sentence does not conflict with\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-662\">\n   <em>\n    Bohannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12368479\" index=\"487\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/222/525/#p531\">\n    222 So.3d at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-663\">\n   Thus, contrary to Johnson's assertion, the jury, and not the trial court, made the only penalty-phase finding necessary to expose Johnson to the death penalty, i.e., that at least one aggravating circumstance existed beyond a reasonable doubt. The fact that the jury's sentencing recommendation was not binding on the trial court is of no consequence. Accordingly, Johnson is not entitled to relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-664\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-665\">\n   Finally, Johnson contends that the result of the process of weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating circumstances is a \"fact\" that must be made by a jury, not a judge. Johnson argues that, because the jury's sentencing recommendation in his case was not unanimous, the trial court made the findings necessary to impose the death penalty, i.e., that certain aggravating circumstances existed\n   and that those circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances that may have existed. Therefore, Johnson says, his death sentence violates\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   . However, this argument was rejected in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Bohannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12368479\" index=\"488\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/222/525/#p531\">\n    222 So.3d at 532-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the Alabama Supreme Court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-666\">\n   \"Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   does not address the process of weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances or suggest that the jury must conduct the weighing process to satisfy the Sixth Amendment. This Court rejected that argument in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Waldrop\n   </em>\n   , holding that the Sixth Amendment 'do[es] not require that a jury weigh the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating circumstances' because, rather than being 'a factual determination,' the weighing process is 'a moral or legal judgment that takes into account a theoretically limitless set of facts.'\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9058437\" index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/859/1181/#p1190\">\n    859 So.2d at 1190, 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   focuses on the jury's factual finding of the existence of an aggravating circumstance to make a defendant death-eligible; it does not mention the jury's weighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The United States Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   was based on an application, not an expansion, of\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   ; consequently, no reason exists to disturb our decision in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Waldrop\n   </em>\n   with regard to the weighing process. Furthermore, nothing in our review of\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   leads us to conclude that in\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   the United States Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment requires that a jury impose a capital sentence.\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   expressly stated that trial courts may 'exercise discretion-taking into consideration various factors relating both to offense and offender-in imposing a judgment within the range prescribed by statute.'\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"490\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"491\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   does not disturb this holding.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-667\">\n   Johnson further argues that \"regardless of whether the weighing process is deemed 'a moral or legal judgment' or an 'element of an offense,' it results in a finding that is required for imposition of the death penalty, and therefore must be made by a jury.\" (Johnson's supplemental brief, at 17; internal citations omitted). However, this argument misses the distinction between a defendant's eligibility for the death penalty and the appropriateness of the death penalty for that particular defendant. A trial court's independent weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and its resulting determination does not increase the authorized punishment for a capital defendant. Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   , that determination does not have to be made by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-668\">\n   In Johnson's case, the jury made the determination that at least one aggravating circumstance existed as evidenced by the fact that it considered and subsequently recommended the death penalty. That is all\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   requires. The fact that the trial court also found the existence of aggravating circumstances and independently weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not run afoul of\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-669\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Johnson's death sentences do not violate\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   .
