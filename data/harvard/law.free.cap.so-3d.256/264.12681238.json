We declined to exercise our supervisory jurisdiction in this case because relator has an adequate remedy on appeal. Once the district court rendered a final judgment, any interlocutory judgments, including the rulings on relator's pauper status, were merged into the final judgment and are reviewable on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. Code Civ. P. art. 1915(B)(2).\n  </author>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
