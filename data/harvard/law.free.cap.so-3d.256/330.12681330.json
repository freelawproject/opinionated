Belsome, Judge Sandra Cabrina Jenkins )\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Judge Roland L. Belsome\n   In this construction contract case, the plaintiff, Strategic Planning Associates, LLC (SPA), appeals the Civil District Court's judgment, which confirmed an arbitration award in favor of the defendants, Core Construction Services, LLC (Core) and Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America. For the following reasons, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In November 2014, SPA and Core entered into a subcontract for the fabrication and erection of steel for the Sophie B. Wright High School renovation project. SPA was required to provide performance and labor and material payment bonds, which were issued by United States Specialty Insurance Company (USSIC) and incorporated as a necessary part of the subcontract. SPA had also executed a General Indemnification Agreement (GIA) with USSIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As the project fell behind schedule, disputes arose between Core and SPA. Core subsequently placed SPA in default and terminated the subcontract on December 22, 2015. As a result, USSIC filed an indemnity lawsuit against SPA in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In the same court, Core filed suit against USSIC over the bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2016, Core submitted a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (AAA), to which SPA lodged an objection. Later that month, SPA filed a Petition to Enforce Sworn Statement of Claim and for Damages against Core in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, the case from which this appeal arises. In response, Core filed an Exception of Prematurity and Alternative Motion to Stay State Litigation. In response to the exception, the parties agreed to: (1) stay the state litigation pending the arbitration and (2) stay the arbitration pending mediation. Mediation was unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the pendency of the arbitration proceedings, Core reached a settlement with USSIC, acting on behalf of itself and SPA through its power of attorney set forth in the GIA. Core then moved to dismiss the arbitration with the AAA. SPA objected, disputing the validity and authority of the arbitrator to review the settlement and GIA. After a hearing on the briefs, the arbitrator dismissed the arbitration, finding that the Settlement Agreement disposed of all claims between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   With the dismissal of the arbitration, the parties returned to Civil District Court. Core moved to lift the stay of arbitration, to confirm the arbitration award, and to dismiss the case, while SPA moved to vacate or modify the arbitration award. After a hearing, the trial court confirmed the arbitration award and dismissed the lawsuit. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   An appellate court reviews a district court judgment confirming an arbitration award\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Favalora Constructors, Inc. v.

As evidence, Core submitted the GIA and settlement documents. The GIA was incidental to the bonded subcontract. In addition, the Settlement Agreement arose out of the alleged breach of the subcontract claims. In his decision, the arbitrator determined that the documents at issue were \"ancillary to the issues related to the subcontract;\" therefore, he found that he could review and rely on the documents when ruling on the motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    We agree. The arbitration agreement was broad enough to encompass the consideration of the settlement dispute, as well as the related documents. Therefore, we do not find that the arbitrator exceeded his authority when considering and ruling on these documents in connection with the motion to dismiss.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Accordingly, SPA has not met its burden of demonstrating that these issues were beyond the scope of arbitration as contemplated by the arbitration agreement.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Second, concerning the arbitrator's finding that a settlement existed between\n    the parties, the issue turns on whether the arbitrator correctly interpreted the GIA. There is no dispute that USSIC entered into a settlement with Core on SPA's behalf. The relevant portions of the GIA are as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. ASSIGNMENT\n    </strong>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    A.

The GIA clearly gave USSIC the right to enter into settlement agreements related to the bonded contract. The arbitrator further noted that SPA gave USSIC an irrevocable power of attorney and assignment of rights. Accordingly, he found that a settlement between the parties existed and dismissed the arbitration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Considering that the plain terms of the GIA support the arbitrator's conclusion, there was no manifest disregard of the law that would provide grounds for reversal. Accordingly, the arbitrator did not err in acknowledging the existence of a settlement and dismissing the arbitration. Moreover, errors of fact or law do not invalidate a fair and honest arbitration award.\n    <em>\n     St. Tammany Manor, Inc. v. Spartan Bldg.
