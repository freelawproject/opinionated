At the time of Adkins's election, the Board had set an annual salary of $139,500 for the position of superintendent. During a regularly scheduled Board meeting on\n   July 18, 2013, the Board increased Adkins's salary by 2% effective July 1, 2013. Adkins was reelected on November 4, 2014. On December 11, 2014, the Board entered into an \"employment contract\" with Adkins that would become effective on January 1, 2015. That contract provided a base annual salary of $159,500, and it provided for increases in salary during Adkins's term of office. That contract also provided an in-county travel stipend of $1,000 per month. The Board modified the contract on November 12, 2015, to increase Adkins's compensation. That modification included providing Adkins with a cellular telephone paid for by the Board, allowing Adkins to participate in outside activities that do not interfere with his duties as superintendent and that are approved by the Board, and guaranteeing that, if \"this agreement be permitted to expire,\" Adkins could return to a tenured position with the Walker County School System. Ingle attached three documents to her petition: (1) a copy of the minutes from the Board's July 18, 2013, meeting, (2) a copy of the December 11, 2014, \"employment contract,\" and (3) a copy of the November 12, 2015, modified contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ingle brought this action \"in the name of the State of Alabama on the relation of Sheila Mote Ingle ... in her individual capacity as a resident citizen and taxpayer in Walker County, Alabama.\" Ingle sought a declaration that Adkins's July 2013 salary increase was unconstitutional, illegal, and void; that the December 2014 \"employment contract\" was unconstitutional, illegal, and void; and that the November 2015 modification of the employment contract was unconstitutional, illegal, and void. Ingle sought to compel the Board members \"to vacate and/or rescind\" the \"employment contract.\" Further, Ingle sought to recover for the taxpayers of Walker County the allegedly illegal compensation that had already been paid to Adkins, and she sought to recover on her own behalf attorney fees. Additionally, Ingle alleged that, even if the employment contract was not determined to be unconstitutional and void, the Board had overpaid Adkins's travel stipend, and, thus, Ingle sought to recover that overpayment. Later, Ingle amended her petition to withdraw her claim for attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendants moved to dismiss Ingle's claims. The defendants argued that Ingle failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, that Ingle's claims were barred by the doctrine of immunity, and that Ingle lacked standing to pursue her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 10, 2017, the circuit court issued an order dismissing Ingle's claims, which stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"This cause coming before the Court on the Motion To Dismiss the Defendants individually and in their official capacity and with the same being set for a hearing on April 5, 2017.

The Court having considered the arguments, documents and briefs and law presented, it is the opinion of the Court that the Motion To Dismiss should be granted; therefore, it is ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED by the Court that the Motion To Dismiss is GRANTED as to all defendants, individually and in their official capacity.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Capitalization in original.)

She also admits that she \"may not seek damages or to otherwise impose civil liability on the individual Board members on account of those acts which have already occurred.\" Ingle's brief, at 19. Further, Ingle acknowledges that she may not have standing \"to recover monies which have already been illegally expended,\" and she does not set forth any argument regarding the circuit court's dismissal of her claims concerning recovery of compensation that has already been paid to Adkins.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. However, Ingle continues to seek to enjoin future payments under Adkins's current employment agreement with the Board, which Ingle claims is an illegal contract. Thus, on appeal, the issue is whether Ingle can pursue a claim against the Board members and Adkins in their individual and/or official capacities to declare Adkins's current contract illegal and to enjoin future payments from public funds pursuant to that contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, we hold that the circuit court properly dismissed the claims against Adkins and the Board members in their individual capacities because \"a suit for injunctive relief against a State official in his or her individual capacity would be meaningless. This is so, because State officials act for and represent the State\n   <em>\n    only in their official\n   </em>\n   capacities.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Dickson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7040057\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/46/468/#p474\">\n    46 So.3d 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474 (Ala. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Now, we must decide whether Ingle can pursue claims against the Board members and Adkins in their official capacities to declare that Adkins's current contract is illegal and to enjoin payments under that contract going forward. Specifically, we must decide whether those claims are barred by the doctrine of immunity and whether Ingle has standing to pursue those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Concerning immunity, this Court has stated that, \"[b]ecause county boards of education are local agencies of the State, they are clothed in constitutional immunity from suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Hale Cty.

Ingle has no greater interest than all other members of the public in the terms and conditions of Dr. Adkins' service. Consequently, she lacks standing individually and her claims were properly dismissed.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Adkins and Board members' brief, at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   It is correct that, for over a century, Alabama has followed the general rule that, to have standing to bring an action, the plaintiff must have an interest in the outcome of the action and show that he or she has suffered or imminently will suffer an injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of Cedar Bluff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9027012\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/904/1253/#p1256\">\n    904 So.2d at 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that in 1872 this Court first articulated that, to have standing, a party must demonstrate an injury). However, since Alabama first recognized that rule, this Court has also continually held that taxpayers have standing to seek an injunction against public officials to prevent illegal payments from public funds. This standing is based on the fact that taxpayers have an equitable ownership in the public funds and will be responsible for replenishing the public funds if those funds are misappropriated, and, thus, a taxpayer suffers an injury when public funds are illegally spent. Therefore, Ingle has standing as a taxpayer to seek an injunction against Adkins and the Board members in their official capacities to prevent illegal payments from public funds. Furthermore, because Ingle has standing to pursue this claim as a taxpayer, we need not discuss whether she has public-interest standing to pursue this claim in the name of the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In their briefs on appeal, the parties also set forth arguments concerning the merits of Ingle's claims. However, those arguments are not ripe for consideration at this stage of the litigation, and, thus, we will not consider them at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Based on the foregoing, this Court reverses the circuit court's order dismissing Ingle's claims against the Board members and Adkins in their official capacities alleging that Adkins's current agreement with the Board is illegal and seeking to enjoin payments under that agreement going forward, and we remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion. In all\n   other respects, this Court affirms the circuit court's order of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Stuart, C.J., and Bolin and Bryan, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Murdock, J., concurs in the result.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    It appears that Waid and Reeves are no longer members of the Board. Shortly after the November 2016 election, Waid and Reeves moved to have themselves dismissed from the case in their official capacities because they had ceased to hold office. Ingle conceded that Waid and Reeves should no longer be parties to the case in their official capacities, but she argued that under Rule 25, Ala. R. Civ. P., Waid's and Reeves's successors were automatically substituted as parties. The defendants argued that Ingle must \"file[ ] something to identify [the successors].\" The trial court did not make a specific ruling on this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
