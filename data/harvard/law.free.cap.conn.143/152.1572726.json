The defendant town has appealed from a judgment, rendered for the plaintiffs on both counts, enjoining the defendants from using or permitting the use of the land for a town dump.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The defendant town, hereinafter called the defendant, seeks certain changes in the finding, but as made it sufficiently presents the issues of law. It states the following facts: The selectmen, under direction of a town meeting held on September 25, 1952, were ordered to close an existing town dump on or before January 1, 1953, and to obtain another site. At a town meeting on December 15, 1952, an appropriation for a new site was approved, and on December 30, 1952, a twenty-five-acre tract on the south side of Peddler\u2019s Boad in Guilford was purchased. The dump was established there and has been in continuous operation since January 1, 1953. The site was, under the then existing zoning regula^ tions, in a \u201crural district,\u201d in which incineration or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>dumping of animal or vegetable waste by the town was permitted, provided such a proposed use of the land was first submitted to and approved by the planning and zoning commission. The selectmen did not refer the proposed use of the land to the planning and zoning commission for its approval. The plaintiffs and others petitioned the selectmen to call a town meeting to act on a resolution prohibiting a dump at the location in question. The meeting was held on February 24,1953, and the proposed resolution was defeated. The state forester and fire warden approved the location, subject to certain conditions. The town health officer received no complaints of any health hazard created by it. On March 21, 1953, the town planning and zoning commission approved the use of a fifty-acre tract, located on the north side of Peddler\u2019s Road near the dump, for an automobile junk yard, and that property has been so used since then. The bodies of junked motor vehicles were burned there on open fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The defendant employs a pest control service to control and combat vermin, rodents and pests at the dump. The defendant also periodically covers discarded material with sand and gravel. Rubbish and household garbage are deposited indiscriminately, and there are large accumulations of waste. A town employee works there some part of each day. He directs the discharge of rubbish, burns the combustible matter and has charge of the premises. No other provision for regulating the placing of waste is made. At a town meeting on June 2, 1953, a resolution providing for the setting of hours for the use of the dump was adopted. Open fires, often left unattended, are frequent, and smoke and odors are diffused over a large surrounding area. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Indian hand pump and pails of water are the only equipment provided to prevent the spread of fires. The site is in a heavily wooded area more than half a mile from the nearest residence. Because of its location, the dump creates a forest fire hazard and will continue to do so as long as material is burned there. Dry weather increases this hazard. At times, the odors are offensive and unhealthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The plaintiff Walter W. Norton lives three miles from the dump but owns land adjoining it on the east. The plaintiff B. Walter Bishop resides one and one-half miles from it and owns land located about three-quarters of a mile from it. The home of the plaintiff Arthur J. Everle is about half a mile from the dump, and he owns land adjoining it on the west. The land of the plaintiff Everle located west of the dump and that of the plaintiff Norton located east of it were assessed at $10 per acre on the assessment list of October 1,1952. The presence of the dump depreciates the value of the land in the surrounding area. The best use of land in the general area is development into tracts of several acres each with modest homes built thereon. While there were no sales of real property in the area for several years prior to December 30,1952, there were three within the following year. The dump tract and a large area in the immediate vicinity were in a residence A zone at the time of the trial of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The plaintiffs alleged in their first count that the conditions arising from the manner in which the dump was used and maintained constituted a nuisance. In their second count, they alleged that the defendant had a planning and zoning commission and that the acquisition of the land for use as a dump lacked legality because the matter had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>referred to the commission for its approval, as required by statute. The court found for the plaintiffs on both counts and issued an injunction against the use of the land for a dump.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The defendant contends that the court erred in granting injunctive relief, first, because it did not find that the plaintiffs suffered irreparable damage, and, second, because the conditions arising from the use of town land for a dump did not impose upon the plaintiffs any special damage not suffered by the public in general. Since these claimed errors were not specifically included in the defendant\u2019s assignments of error and since it does not appear that the questions were distinctly raised at the trial, ruled upon and decided by the court adversely to the defendant, it is not necessary to discuss them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Keegan, </em>142 Conn. 229, 236, 113 A.2d 141; <em>American Brass Co. </em>v. <em>Ansonia Brass Workers\u2019 Union, </em>140 Conn. 457, 463, 101 A.2d 291; Practice Book \u00a7 409. The plaintiffs maintained that the dump created, as to them, a private nuisance. See <em>Brainard </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>140 Conn. 631, 636, 103 A.2d 135. This presented a question of fact for the court to determine, and the court was justified in finding that the presence of the dump depreciated the value of the surrounding land and therefore that a private nuisance existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The defendant admits that on May 24, 1949, it adopted chapters 43 and 45 of the General Statutes and created a planning and zoning commission; that thereafter the commission had the powers granted and the duties imposed by the statutes contained in these chapters, including \u00a7 857,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>posed acquisition and use of the land was not referred to the commission for a report. The defendant contends that at the town meeting on December 15, 1952, the appropriation for the purchase of the property and the establishment of the dump at the Peddler\u2019s Road site were approved and that, consequently, there was no legal requirement that the matter be referred to the commission. The defendant also claims that the plaintiffs, by petitioning the selectmen to call the town meeting of February 24, 1953, at which the resolution prohibiting the dump at the location in question was defeated, selected their remedy, affirmed the legality of the proceedings establishing the dump and cannot complain of the failure to refer the matter to the commission for a report. The defendant was authorized to create by ordinance, as it did, a planning and zoning commission, having all of the powers and duties of both a zoning commission and a planning commission. General Statutes \u00a7 840. The commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>was empowered to prepare, adopt and amend plans of development for the community and to set up a comprehensive plan of its own. See <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>141 Conn. 349, 354, 106 A.2d 173. The circumstances and conditions in matters of zone changes and regulations were peculiarly within the knowledge of the commission. <em>Kutcher </em>v. <em>Town Planning Commission, </em>138 Conn. 705, 710, 88 A.2d 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The proposal for the acquisition of the land and the location of the dump could only have been adopted by a majority vote of those present and voting at an annual or special town meeting after it had been referred to and disapproved by the commission. General Statutes \u00a7 857. As the matter had not been referred to and disapproved by the commission, no action taken at any of the town meetings held on September 25,1952, December 15,1952, and February 24, 1953, could legally establish the dump or affirm the legality of its establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The defendant relies also upon the provisions of \u00a7 197c<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the 1953 Cumulative Supplement as a basis for its claim of law that the dump was legally -established under the authority granted by the votes at the town meetings. It contends that \u00a7 197c .granted to it the power to make by-laws and ordinances \u201cto regulate the disposal of garbage, rubbish or waste material,\u201d the performance of a governmental function. This provision of the statute did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>not become effective until October 1, 1953. General Statutes \u00a7 8891. Tbe finding does not indicate that any action pertaining to the dump was taken at any town meeting after the one held on June 2, 1953. Moreover, none of the votes establishing the dnmp enacted a by-law or ordinance with the formalities then required for such an enactment. General Statutes \u00a7 620. This aside, the word \u201cregulate\u201d does not so much imp]y creating a new thing as arranging in proper order and controlling that which already exists. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Village of Highland Park, </em>173 Mich. 201, 216, 139 N.W. 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\"> \u201cSee. 857. municipal improvements.
