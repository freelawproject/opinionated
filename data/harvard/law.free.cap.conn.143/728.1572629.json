The defendant made no requests to charge and took no exception to the charge as given. Consequently, we are not bound to consider any of the assignments of error directed at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>charge. Practice Book \u00a7 153. Moreover, the portions of the charge complained of were essentially correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The defendant contends that the trial court should have refused to accept the verdict, or should have set it aside, because it was excessive. No motion was made to set the verdict aside, and in no way was the claim that it should be set aside made in the trial court. It is fundamental that an appellant is not entitled to raise any question of law on appeal unless it was raised in the trial court and passed upon there. <em>Paley </em>v. <em>Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>142 Conn. 522, 528, 115 A.2d 448; <em>Lavoie </em>v. <em>Antupit, </em>138 Conn. 422, 424, 85 A.2d 900; Practice Book \u00a7 409. The present ease is not one in which we ought to make any exception to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
