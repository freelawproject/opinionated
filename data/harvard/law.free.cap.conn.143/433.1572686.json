Eckert, died on May 11, 1929, a resident of the town of Greenwich. Surviving were his widow, Lonise B. Eckert; a son, John A. Eckert, Jr.; a daughter, Mildred E. Williams; and a grandson, John A. Eckert, III, the son of John A. Eckert, Jr. John A. Eckert, Jr., died on April 21, 1945. John A. Eckert, III, died on May 3, 1945, before attaining the age of thirty years, unmarried and without issue, and Frances S. Houck is the administratrix c.t.a. of his estate. Mildred E. Williams died in 1951, leaving a son, Frank D. Williams, and a daughter, Joan W. Sokoloff, who are now living. Louise B. Eckert, the testator\u2019s widow, died on May 13, 1953. The Probate Court for the district of Greenwich made an order ascertaining that the estate of John A. Eckert, III, is the distributee of the principal of the trust which was created under the provisions of paragraph (b) of article sixth of the testator\u2019s will. The pertinent portions of article sixth are printed in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An appeal was taken to the Superior Court by the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>tiffs, Frank D. Williams and Joan W. Sokoloff. The Superior Court overruled a plea in abatement and to the jurisdiction filed by the defendant Frances S. Houck, administratrix c.t.a. of the estate of John A. Eckert, III, denied her motions to erase and to expunge, granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to expunge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>reversed the decree of the Probate Court and adjudged that the plaintiffs, Frank D. Williams and Joan W. Sokoloff, are the distributees. The defendant Frances S. Houck, hereinafter called the defendant, has appealed from the judgment to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In their motion for appeal, the plaintiffs alleged that \u201c[t]hey are the issue of Mildred E. Williams and remaindermen of the trust created in and by article sixth (b) of the will\u201d of the testator; that the Probate Court made an order ascertaining that \u201cone of the distributees is the estate of John A. Eckert, III,\u201d and that they \u201care aggrieved by so much of said order and decree of this Court which finds and ascertains that the estate of John A. Eckert, III, is a distributee of said trust.\u201d The defendant contends that the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for appeal did not contain the allegations necessary to confer jurisdiction upon the Superior Court and to show that they are aggrieved and that, therefore, the trial court erred in overruling her plea in abatement and to the jurisdiction, in denying her motions to erase and to expunge and in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to expunge.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Section 7071 of the General Statutes provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by any order ... of a court of probate in any matter, unless otherwise specially provided by law, may appeal therefrom to the superior court.\u201d A person to be \u201caggrieved\u201d within the meaning of this statute must have not only a pecuniary interest but a pecuniary interest which has been injuriously affected by the decree appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>from. <em>Kaskel </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>142 Conn. 379, 384, 114 A.2d 853; <em>Weidlich </em>v. <em>First National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>139 Conn. 652, 656, 96 A.2d 547. In determining whether an appellant has a grievance, the question is whether there is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest which he has in the estate has been adversely affected. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>140 Conn. 80, 83, 98 A.2d 660; <em>Buckingham\u2019s Appeal, </em>57 Conn. 544, 545, 18 A. 256; <em>Mallory\u2019s Appeal, </em>62 Conn. 218, 222, 25 A. 109; 1 Locke &amp; Kohn, Conn. Probate Practice, p. 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Section 7075 reads: \u201cIn each appeal from probate . . . the interest of the appellant shall be stated in the motion for appeal, unless such interest shall appear on the face of the proceedings and records of such court of probate.\u201d By reason of \u00a7 7075, the appellant is required as a matter of procedure to set forth in his motion for appeal, either expressly or by reference to specific records in the Probate Court, the interest which he claims has been adversely affected. <em>Ciglar </em>v. <em>Finkelstone, </em>142 Conn. 432, 434, 114 A.2d 925; <em>Feigner </em>v. <em>Gopstein, </em>139 Conn. 738, 742, 97 A.2d 267; <em>Exchange Buffet Corporation </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>139 Conn. 374, 377, 94 A.2d 22. \u201cIn so far as \u00a7 7075 requires that the motion for appeal show the interest of an appellant in the subject matter of the decree appealed from, it is satisfied if the motion for appeal states the basis of the appellant\u2019s claim of such an interest \u2014 that is, if it states the nature of the interest claimed. It is not essential that the motion for appeal allege facts which establish the final validity of the claim.\u201d <em>Feigner </em>v. <em>Gopstein, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The plaintiffs, in alleging that \u201c[t]hey are the . . . remaindermen of the trust created in and by article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>sixth (b) of the will,\u201d stated their pecuniary interests, namely, that they are the sole distributees of the entire principal of that trust. In alleging that the Probate Court found that the estate of John A. Eckert, III, is a distributee of it, they stated that their pecuniary interests were injuriously affected. Consequently, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for appeal shows how their pecuniary interests are affected to their disadvantage and why they are \u201caggrieved.\u201d A discussion of the amendments to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for appeal is not called for. The trial court did not err in overruling the defendant\u2019s plea in abatement and to the jurisdiction, in denying her motions to erase and to expunge and in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to expunge.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The significant question for determination is whether the estate of John A. Eckert, III, the testator\u2019s grandson, is the distributee entitled to the principal of the trust which was created under the provisions of paragraph (b) of article sixth or whether the plaintiffs, Frank D. Williams and Joan W. Sokoloff, the testator\u2019s two living grandchildren, issue of his daughter Mildred, are the distributees entitled to it. If it vested in John A. Eckert, TTT, prior to his death on May 3, 1945, his estate is the distributee entitled to it. The defendant maintains that it did, contending that a fundamental rule of construction in this state is that which favors the early vesting of future estates. She asserts that the provisions of paragraph (b) of article sixth are clear, precise and unambiguous in directing payment of the principal of the trust thereby created to the \u201clawful issue\u201d of John A. Eckert, Jr., \u201chim surviving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">In and by the first paragraph of article sixth of his will, the testator gave, devised and bequeathed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>three-fifths of the remainder of his estate to his executors, in trust, to pay over the net income to his wife, Louise B. Eckert, during her life, \u201cand upon her death to divide such three-fifths of my estate, together with any accumulated income therefrom into four equal shares or portions.\u201d Under the provisions of paragraph (a), two of the four shares were left to his daughter, Mildred E. Williams, or to her surviving issue, and if none, then to his son, John A. Eckert, Jr., if living, and if not, to his children. In and by the provisions of paragraph (b), the testator gave, devised and bequeathed one of the four shares to his executors, in trust, to pay the net income to his son, John A. Eckert, Jr., during his life, and upon his death to pay over the principal \u201cto his lawful issue, him surviving,\u201d and, \u201cin case he shall leave no lawful issue,\u201d to pay it to the children of the testator\u2019s daughter, Mildred E. Williams, in equal shares. By the terms of paragraph (c), the last one-fourth was to be held in trust for the descendants of his son, John A. Eckert, Jr., until John A. Eckert, III, arrived at the age of thirty years, or his prior decease, when the principal was to be divided among the issue of John A. Eckert, Jr., and if there was no issue, then it was to be paid to him, and if he was not living, then to the issue of Mildred E. Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In <em>Budington </em>v. Houck, 134 Conn. 72, 80, 54 A.2d 671, relied upon by the plaintiffs as support for their claim that they are the distributees of the trust created by article sixth (b), we determined that they were the distributees of the trust created by paragraph (a) of article eighth of the will. The concluding sentence of that paragraph is: \u201cUpon the death of my said son, John A. Eckert Jr., I give, devise and bequeath such share or portion, or so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>much thereof as has not been paid, to my Executors, their survivors and successors, in trust nevertheless, during the life of my grandson, John A. Eckert, to hold the same and invest, reinvest and keep the same invested, and collect the rents, issues and profits thereof, and to apply the net income thereof to the use of my grandson, John A. Eckert and any lawful issue of my son, John A. Eckert Jr., in equal shares, per stirpes and not per capita, and upon the arrival of my grandson, John A. Eckert, at- the age of thirty years, or his earlier death, to divide the principal sum, together with any accumulation of income among any descendants of my son, John A. Eckert Jr., in equal shares, per stirpes and not per capita, and if he shall leave no issue, then to the issue of my daughter, Mildred E. Williams, in equal shares, per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d We said (p. 76): \u201cThis case is peculiarly one where the right to receive the fund must be determined at the death of Eckert, III. The testator contemplated that his grandson would be living at and after his death. If the title to the remainder interest vested in him at the testator\u2019s death, the entire provision would exhaust itself in that disposition of the property and the substitutionary gift would be wholly nugatory. It must be presumed that the testator did not make provision for a gift which in no event could become operative.\u201d Consequently, we proceeded to find and effectuate the testator\u2019s intent. \u201cIn seeking that intent, the court looks first to the will itself.... It examines the words and the language used in the light of the circumstances under which they were written. ... It studies the will as an entirety. . . . The quest is to determine the meaning of what the testator said and not to speculate upon what he meant to say.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>Chase National Bank </em>v. <em>Guthrie, </em>139 Conn. 178, 182, 90 A.2d 643; <em>First National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Parish of St. Thomas\u2019 Church, </em>141 Conn. 489, 497, 107 A.2d 246. Our conclusion, from an examination of the plan of the will as a whole, was that the title to the trust fund provided for in article eighth (a) did not vest in John A. Eckert, III, upon the death of his father, John A. Eckert, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The language used in article sixth (b) is entirely different from that in article eighth (a). The class of distributees of the trust under article sixth (b) for John A. Eckert, Jr., is described as \u201chis lawful issue, him surviving.\u201d There is no ambiguity in the description of this class. The testator unequivocally provided that membership in the class is to be determined as of the time of the death of John A. Eckert, Jr. The alternative gift to the issue of Mildred E. Williams is to take effect only \u201cin case he shall leave no lawful issue.\u201d The phrase \u201cin ease he shall leave no lawful issue,\u201d as here used, is obviously intended to take care of the case where the gift to the issue of John A. Eckert, Jr., cannot take effect because there are no \u201clawful issue, him surviving.\u201d John A. Eckert, Jr., left lawful issue, him surviving \u2014 his son, John A. Eckert, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The plaintiffs claim also that, since the trust for John A. Eckert, Jr., could not come into existence until the death of Louise, the testator\u2019s widow, which did not occur until eight years after the death of John A. Eckert, III, the testator did not intend that remainder interests would vest indefeasibly prior to the termination of the preceding life estate. This claim is without merit, since no implication arises, from the creation of a life estate in property, that the testator intended the postponement of the vesting to the date of the termina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>tion of the life estate. <em>Bridgeport City Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>115 Conn. 269, 277, 161 A. 341. The words used denote a postponement in possession and not a gift in fntnro. The testator\u2019s language is that which would naturally be used by one who wished to postpone the time when the right of possession should attach. It neither created a contingency or condition nor operated to delay the vesting in point of right. <em>Bridgeport-City Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Lister, </em>140 Conn. 147, 155, 98 A.2d 811. The law favors the early vesting of estates. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>143 Conn. 328, 334, 122 A.2d 307; <em>Trowbridge </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>112 Conn. 104, 111, 151 A. 345. The principal of the trust for John A. Eckert, Jr., became distributable to John A. Eckert, III. Since this trust was never actually set up because John A. Eckert, Jr., predeceased the beneficiary of the preceding trust, the effect of this holding is that the estate of John A. Eckert, III, is the distributee of one-fourth of the principal of the trust created in and by the first paragraph of article sixth.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\"> \u201cSixth : All the rest, residue and remainder o\u00ed my estate, both real and personal, whatsoever and wheresoever the same may be, I direct my Executors, their survivors and successors to divide into five equal shares or portions; three of such shares or portions, I give, devise and bequeath to my Executors, their survivors and successors, in trust, nevertheless, to invest, reinvest and keep the same invested and to collect the rents, issues and profits thereof, and to pay over the net income therefrom to my wife, Louise B.
