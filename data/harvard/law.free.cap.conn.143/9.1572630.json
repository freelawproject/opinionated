On August 7,1944, a daughter was born to them. On March 6,1945, the parties executed a separation agreement. It provided that the defendant, upon the termination of his military service, would pay $5 weekly for the support and maintenance of the minor child \u201cuntil and unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>otherwise provided by an order of a court with proper jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.\u201d The marriage was dissolved March 16, 1945, by a decree of the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Ohio. The custody of the minor child was awarded to the plaintiff. The divorce decree provided that the \u201cseparation agreement entered into by the parties, a copy of which is attached, is made part hereof, and both parties are subject to the terms thereof, and same is hereby ratified and confirmed.\u201d The decree has never been modified. The defendant lives in Bristol, Connecticut. He is married and has three minor children with whom he lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">On April 15, 1954, the plaintiff filed a petition in the Common Pleas Court in Warren County, Ohio, in a proceeding against the defendant to compel him to support their minor child, alleging that the necessary monthly expenses of the child amounted to $65. The plaintiff appeared in that court on April 20, 1954, and was examined by the presiding judge. The hearing was ex parte and without notice to the defendant. The judge, who examined the petitioner under oath, certified that the proceeding was commenced under the provisions of the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act of Ohio; that according to the testimony of the petitioner \u201cthe needs of the dependent named in the petition for support from the respondent [are] the sum of $60.00 per month\u201d and that in his opinion \u201cthe petition sets forth facts from which it may be determined that the respondent owes a duty of support and that such petition should be dealt with according to law.\u201d He ordered that the certificate, together with certified copies of the petition, be transmitted to the Court of Common Pleas in Hartford County.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>On June 11, 1954, the defendant was summoned to appear before the Court of Common Pleas in Hartford County on June 18, 1954, to show cause why the order for support prayed for in the petition should not be made. A hearing was had upon the petition and, on June 25, 1954, the defendant was ordered and directed to pay $65 each month for the support of the minor child. On July 2, 1954, the defendant appeared by counsel and moved that the order be modified in its entirety, canceled and revoked. On September 24,1954, the trial court modified the decree and ordered the defendant to pay $69 each month for the support of the minor child. It is admitted that the defendant is able to pay that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The problem of enforcing duties of support has always been difficult. In the past, an errant husband could avoid the enforcement of his responsibility to support his dependents by the simple expedient of crossing state lines. Sections 2434c-2462c of the 1953 Cumulative Supplement to the General Statutes, contained in chapter 415b, entitled \u201cUniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support,\u201d were enacted for the purpose of providing an efficacious mode of procedure to compel performance by those who are under a duty to support dependents. Our act, like those passed in many other states, including Ohio, contemplates a uniform two-state reciprocal procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The defendant claims that the Ohio divorce decree ordered him to pay $5 weekly, that it has not been modified and that, consequently, it is determinative of the amount which the trial court could order the defendant to pay. He contends that the judgment directing him to pay $69 per month was beyond the power of the court and void, and that the court could not order him to pay any sum greater than $5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>weekly. As was stated above, the separation agreement, containing the provision that the defendant would pay $5 weekly \u201cuntil and unless otherwise provided by an order of a court with proper jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties,\u201d was incorporated, as it properly could be, in the divorce decree. <em>Koster </em>v. <em>Koster, </em>137 Conn. 707, 711, 81 A.2d 355. By the terms of the agreement and the divorce decree, the amount of the payments to be made by the defendant was subject to change by a court having jurisdiction. A judgment for support rendered in the court of a foreign state may be modified as to future support by a court of competent jurisdiction in this state if the court of the foreign state has the power under the law of that state to make such a modification. <em>Freund </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>131 Conn. 380, 383, 40 A.2d 754; see <em>German </em>v. <em>German, </em>122 Conn. 155, 164, 188 A. 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The defendant maintains that the plaintiff\u2019s petition was not filed in an \u201cinitiating state\u201d as such a state is defined in \u00a7 2434c.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claims that, since under subsection (6) of \u00a7 2434c<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court, in enforcing an order for support made by the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Court of this state, could not require a party to make payments greater in amount than those ordered by the Superior Court, and there is no like provision in the Ohio act, a substantially similar reciprocal law has not been enacted in the state of Ohio. While the word \u201csimilar\u201d has at times been construed as synonymous with \u201csame\u201d or \u201cidentical,\u201d its usual significance is that contained in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.): \u201cNearly corresponding; resembling in many respects; somewhat like; having a general likeness.\u201d The word as ordinarily used implies an allowance for some degree of difference. <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Poucher, </em>127 Conn. 441, 446, 17 A.2d 767. Identity in language is not essential to reciprocal operation of the two acts with which we are concerned. <em>Commonwealths v. Shaffer, </em>175 Pa. Super. 100, 105, 103 A.2d 430. The Ohio statute is substantially similar to and reciprocal with the Connecticut law.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The defendant claims that the sections of the statutes comprised in chapter 415b, entitled \u201cUniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support,\u201d attempt to confer extraterritorial jurisdiction on the Ohio court and are unconstitutional. He asserts that the Ohio court in which the petition was filed made a finding of fact without notice to him that any proceeding was under way; that he has been denied the right of cross-examination; that the finding of fact is in effect a recommendation in the nature of a judicial decree based upon hearing only one side of the case; that the fact that the trial court accepted the amount found to be needed for the support of the minor child indicates the effect which it gave to the finding of the Ohio court in which the petition was filed and that he has been deprived of the due process of law guaranteed by the constitution of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>and the constitution of this state. As was stated above, the judge who examined the petitioner tinder oath certified that according to her testimony \u201cthe needs of the dependent named in the petition for support from the respondent [are] the sum of $60.00 per month\u201d and that in his opinion \u201cthe petition sets forth facts from which it may be determined that the respondent owes a duty of support and that such petition should be dealt with according to law.\u201d He did not make a finding of fact. Section 2448c<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> prescribes the duty of the court of this state as the responding state, and \u00a7 2451c<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> governs the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The defendant was summoned to appear to show cause why the order for support prayed for by the petitioner should not be made. He did not appear until after the time set and then only after an order had been made. Although he had the right to appear on June 18,1954, and show cause why the order for support prayed for should not be granted, to file a verified denial of any of the material allegations of the petition and to examine or cross-examine the plaintiff and her witnesses by means of depositions or written interrogatories, as provided in \u00a7 2451c, he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>125 Cal. App. 2d 154, 270 P.2d 613, the proceeding was commenced by the filing of a petition for the support of a minor child in this state against a California defendant. The court said (p. 156): \u201cThe support law is designed to enable a dependent in one state to secure money for support from a person residing in another state who is legally liable for the support of the dependent. Its purposes are to improve and extend by reciprocal legislation the enforcement of duties of support.\u201d The Court of Appeals of Kentucky con-' sidered the question of the constitutionality of the reciprocal enforcement of support law of that state in <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>262 S.W.2d 373, and stated (p. 377): \u201cActually, the Act does not attempt to confer extraterritorial jurisdiction. The court of the initiating state exercises no jurisdiction over the respondent, but merely serves as a local agency of convenience for the court of the responding state. The latter court acquires jurisdiction of the respondent by virtue of personal service upon him, and exercises its jurisdiction over him solely within the confines of its state. . . . The fact that the petitioner is not required to be physically pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>ent in the responding state is no obstacle . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">The dne process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution does not guarantee to the citizen of a state any particular form or method of state procedure. \u201cIts requirements are satisfied if he has reasonable notice and reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present his claim or defense, due regard being had to the nature of the proceeding and the character of the rights which may be affected by it.\u201d <em>Dohany </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>281 U.S. 362, 369, 50 S. Ct. 299, 74 L. Ed. 904; <em>Missouri ex rel. Hurwitz </em>v. <em>North, </em>271 U.S. 40, 42, 46 S. Ct. 384, 70 L. Ed. 818. \u201cDue process of law . . . means such an exertion of the powers of government as the settled maxims of law permit and sanction, and under such safeguards for the protection of individual rights as those maxims prescribe for the class of cases to which the one in question belongs.\u201d 2 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed.) p. 741; <em>John J. McCarthy Co. </em>v. <em>Alsop, </em>122 Conn. 288, 296, 189 A. 464. Due process of law is \u201cthat law of the land in each State, which derives its authority from the inherent and reserved powers of the State, exerted within the limits of those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions, and the greatest security for which resides in the right of the people to make their own laws, and alter them at their pleasure.\u201d <em>Hurtado </em>v. <em>California, </em>110 U.S. 516, 535, 4 S. Ct. 111, 292, 28 L. Ed. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u201cThe provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, guaranteeing the equal protection of the laws and due process of law, have substantially the same meaning as the corresponding provisions contained in \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 12 of Article First of our constitution and, therefore, im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>posed no new limitation upon the power of the people of this state to determine their civil rights by their fundamental law.\u201d <em>New Haven Metal &amp; Heating Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>128 Conn. 213, 219, 21 A.2d 383; <em>Cyphers </em>v. <em>Allyn, </em>142 Conn. 699, 703, 118 A.2d 318. The defendant has not been deprived of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-7\"> \u201cSeo. 2434c. definitions.
