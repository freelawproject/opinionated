He has sued the private security contractors-MVM, Inc. (\"MVM\") and Paragon Systems, Inc.(\"Paragon\")-allegedly responsible for security at that ICE facility, along with Federal Protective Services (\"FPS\") and one of its employees, Christopher Addams (collectively, \"Federal Defendants\"). Pending before the Court are MVM and the Federal Defendants' motions to dismiss the amended complaint. For the reasons articulated below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   defendants' motions and dismisses Mr. Johnson's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 31, 2012, Mr. Johnson arrived at an ICE facility and entered the building with a loaded handgun in his briefcase. Am. Compl., ECF No. 12 \u00b6 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a retired federal law enforcement officer, Mr. Johnson asserts that he is entitled to carry a firearm on federal property at any time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nonetheless-perhaps because Mr. Johnson inadvertently entered the ICE facility through the visitors' entrance and not the employees' entrance-Mr. Johnson was immediately detained by security guards allegedly employed or supervised by defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-13. According to Mr. Johnson, even though he promptly displayed his law-enforcement badge to the security guards, and even though the security guards were allegedly notified that Mr. Johnson was entitled to bring his weapon into the building, the security guards \"handcuffed Plaintiff for over two hours.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Johnson further alleges that Christopher Addams-a FPS employee who supposedly supervised \"either a Paragon Systems employee or MVM employee\"-threatened to initiate criminal proceedings\n   against Mr. Johnson for his conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. Mr. Addams purportedly continued to threaten Mr. Johnson with legal action for a period of over two months after the incident, through December 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on these allegations, Mr. Johnson filed suit on October 31, 2015 against Paragon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1. In that complaint, Mr. Johnson asserted four causes of action: (1) a \"Civil Rights Violation\" pursuant to section 1983; (2) assault and battery; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (4) common-law negligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 1, 2016, the Court granted Paragon's partial motion to dismiss, dismissing Mr. Johnson's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress after concluding that Mr. Johnson had failed to sufficiently allege that his injury resulted from \"extreme and outrageous conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Compl., ECF No. 12. On September 27, 2017, the Court granted Paragon summary judgment after finding that Mr. Johnson had failed to adduce evidence suggesting that Paragon took any action that caused Mr. Johnson's alleged injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Specifically, MVM argues that the amended complaint should be dismissed for insufficient service of process, because Mr. Johnson's claims are barred by the relevant statutes of limitations, and because Mr. Johnson fails to state a claim for negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MVM Mem. in Supp. Mot. to Dismiss (\"MVM Mot.\"), ECF No. 22-1 at 5-13. The Federal Defendants move to dismiss Mr. Johnson's complaint for insufficient service of process, lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, qualified immunity, lack of personal jurisdiction, and for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Because Rule 12(b)(1) concerns a court's ability to hear a particular claim, \"the court must scrutinize the plaintiff's allegations more closely when considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) than it would under a motion to dismiss\n   pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    Schmidt v.

Compl., ECF No. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11. Mr. Johnson's original complaint refers only to the October 31, 2012 date.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10, 16. Whether the incident occurred on October 24 or October 31 does not change the result, however, because, as explained more fully below, Mr. Johnson filed his lawsuit against MVM\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      more than a year\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    after the latest limitations period had expired.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Although Mr. Johnson does not appear to make this same argument with respect to his negligence claim-which is also subject to a three-year statute of limitations period and which was also alleged in his original complaint-the same analysis applies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Moreover, even if Mr. Johnson's section 1983 claim was not barred by the statute of limitations, dismissal of that claim would still be required because MVM does not act under the color of state law and thus a section 1983 claim cannot be maintained against it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Am.

Mr. Johnson did not, however, file an exhibit with his opposition, and the Court could not locate any relevant exhibit elsewhere on the docket. In any event, because the amended complaint makes clear that Mr. Johnson knew of his injuries by the end of 2012, the additional information would not change the Court's result.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    To the extent Mr. Johnson seeks \"declaratory\" and \"injunctive relief,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Am. Compl., ECF No. 12 \u00b6 35, the amended complaint does not specify the form of declaratory or injunctive relief sought, and Mr. Johnson does not offer any further description of what he seeks in his opposition brief. Accordingly, the Court finds that the amended complaint fails to meet the specificity requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(3) with respect to any claims for specific relief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ward v.
