The primary issues are: (i) whether the Court should dismiss the Complaint (Third Judicial District Court, County of Do\u00f1a Ana, State of New Mexico, filed May 22, 2017), filed in federal court August 15, 2017 (Doc. 1-4), because Plaintiff Naresh Raja\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   d/b/a America's Best Value Inn (\"Value Inn\") failed to meet its contractual conditions precedent for filing suit against Defendants Ohio Security Insurance Company, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, and Jeffery Robinson (\"Liberty Mutual\"); (ii) whether Value Inn states claims upon which the Court can grant relief under rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for breach of contract, insurance bad faith, violations of New Mexico's Unfair Insurance Practices Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 59A-16-1 to -30 (\"UIPA\"), violations of New Mexico's Unfair Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2057-12-1\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 57-12-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to -26 (\"UPA\"), and negligent misrepresentation; (iii) whether the Court should abate the action to allow the parties to complete appraisal on Value Inn's property damage claim; and (iv) whether to award attorneys' fees. The Court concludes that: (i) it will not dismiss the Complaint for Value Inn's failure to meet conditions precedent to filing suit, because there is a substantial likelihood that Value Inn will be time barred from filing a complaint alleging these claims again in the future; (ii) Value Inn states a claim for breach of contract, insurance bad faith, and some UIPA violations; (iii) Value Inn does not state a claim for UPA violations, negligent misrepresentation, or some UIPA violations, because Value Inn does not allege facts supporting those claims; (iii) the Court will not abate the action; and (iv) the Court will not award attorneys' fees because Value Inn's unsuccessful UIPA claims were not groundless and its UPA claims were not groundless. Accordingly, the Court grants in part and denies in part the MTD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Value Inn purchased insurance from Liberty Mutual that covered wind and hail damage to its commercial property in Las Cruces, New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 6, at 2.

In this event, each party will select a competent and impartial appraiser. The two appraisers will select an umpire. If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers will state separately the value of the property and amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will be binding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Contract \u00b6 E(2), at 8 (\"Appraisal Clause\"). The Contract also lists several \"Duties In The Event Of Loss Or Damage\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   a.

Value Inn filed a claim with Liberty Mutual, but Value Inn believed that the damage exceeded the $130,301.56 estimate that Liberty Mutual's adjuster, Jeffery Robinson, provided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 8-9, at 3. Value Inn requested a settlement conference with Liberty Mutual, and Liberty Mutual requested an Examination Under Oath (\"EUO\") of Value Inn.

Value Inn also sought a court order declaring that an EUO \"is not appropriate in this matter and that this claim proceed through the appraisal process in the policy.\" Complaint \u00b6 38(a), at 12. Liberty Mutual removed the case to federal court, asserting that the Court has diversity jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal \u00b6 2, at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In their MTD, Liberty Mutual asserts that, under their Contract, Value Inn may not bring a legal action against Liberty Mutual or request an appraisal unless Value Inn has fully complied with the Contract's terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 7-8. According to Liberty Mutual, Value Inn has not complied with the Contract's terms, because it has refused to give an EUO or provide certain requested documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 7-8. Liberty Mutual concludes that, because Value Inn has not met the \"conditions precedent\" to bringing a legal action or demanding an appraisal, Value Inn has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Next, Liberty Mutual argues that Value Inn's claims for breach of contract and bad faith do not state a plausible claim, because Value Inn makes conclusory allegations that recite UIPA provisions \"without regard to applicability or any factual basis.\" MTD at 13. Liberty Mutual also contends that Value Inn's recitations of UIPA provisions are irrelevant to the breach-of-contract and insurance bad-faith claims, because those claims arise out of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 13-14. Liberty Mutual contends, moreover, that Value Inn's breach-of-contract and bad-faith claims are premature, \"because Plaintiff refuses to allow Liberty Mutual to conduct its investigation.\" MTD at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As for Value Inn's UIPA violation claim, Liberty Mutual argues Value Inn has not stated a claim upon which relief can be granted, because Value Inn does not allege any facts to support its conclusory allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Liberty Mutual next addresses Value Inn's UPA claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 17-21. Liberty Mutual argues that UPA claims require proving deceptive practices in the sale of a product,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MTD at 18-19, but Value Inn does not allege unfair practices relating to the insurance policy's sale,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MTD at 20. Liberty Mutual requests that the Court award Liberty Mutual attorneys' fees and costs for defending Value Inn's allegedly baseless UPA claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next, Liberty Mutual argues that Value Inn does not \"set forth the elements\" of its negligent misrepresentation claim. MTD at 21. Liberty Mutual contends that Value Inn appears to be alleging a simple negligence claim, but, nonetheless, does not allege simple negligence's elements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 21. Moreover, Liberty Mutual contends that the Court previously made an\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   prediction under\n   <em>\n    Erie Railroad Co. v.

July 7, 2016) (Browning, J) ). Liberty Mutual concludes that, because New Mexico does not recognize negligence claims against an insurer, Value Inn's negligence or negligent misrepresentation claim does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Liberty Mutual concludes by asking the Court to declare that Value Inn's legal action and request for appraisal are premature, dismiss Value Inn's Complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and award Liberty Mutual its fees for defending Value Inn's baseless UPA and UIPA claims. See MTD at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss and Plaintiff's Plea in Abatement, filed August 28, 2017 (Doc. 9)(\"Response\"), Value Inn contends that it has agreed to submit to an EUO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   and that the EUO is set for September 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response \u00b6 5, at 2. Value Inn continues that Liberty Mutual's EUO request letter is \"extremely broad and unduly burdensome and appears to be for the purpose of attempting to dissuade him from continuing with his claim,\" but, nonetheless, Value Inn asserts that it has agreed to \"produce certain documents and proceed with the EUO, cooperating in document production to the full extent reasonably possible.\" Response \u00b6 5, at 2-3. Value Inn also contends that its appraisal demand is valid under the policy provisions, but that Liberty Mutual has \"refused to engage in appraisal pending the EUO.\" Response \u00b6 5, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Value Inn notes that the policy has a limitations provision barring legal action against Liberty Mutual after two years from the loss or damage date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response \u00b6 8, at 4. Consequently, Value Inn contends, it had \"no choice\" but to file suit when it did. Response \u00b6 8, at 4. Value Inn asserts that many courts have refused to uphold limitations provisions that are tied to the date of occurrence and not to the date on which the cause of action accrues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response \u00b6 9, at 4. Value Inn concludes that the \"limitations clause in the subject policy should be held void as against public policy.\" Response \u00b6 10, at 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Spicewood Summit Office Condominiums Ass'n, Inc. v.

Value Inn contends that allowing the EUO and appraisal processes to proceed will likely resolve many of the points of dispute in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response \u00b6 12, at 5. Value Inn asserts that dismissing the case would \"deprive Plaintiff to his right to Due Process and expose Plaintiff to a potential limitations argument\" for its claims. Response \u00b6 13, at 5. Value Inn next argues that awarding Liberty Mutual its attorneys' fees is not appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response \u00b6 15, at 5-6. Value Inn argues that, given the \"wide disparity\" between their damage estimates, there is a good-faith basis that Liberty Mutual violated the UIPA and the UPA. Response \u00b6 15 at 6. Value Inn asserts that discovery \"into the training and methods of the adjusters assigned to the claim and all information in their possession will be needed in order to garner evidence of these allegations.\" Response \u00b6 15 at 6. Value Inn also asks that, if the Court dismisses the suit, it do so without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response \u00b6 16(c), at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Liberty Mutual replies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Security Insurance Company and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company's Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss and for Declaratory Judgment (Doc. 6) and Response to Plaintiff's Plea for Abatement (Doc. 9), filed September 11, 2017 (Doc. 12)(\"The Reply\"). Liberty Mutual argues that Value Inn, in the Response, effectively concedes that its Complaint is premature, because Value Inn does not address Liberty Mutual's prematurity arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 3. Liberty Mutual further contends that Value Inn's request for the Court to order Liberty Mutual to conduct an appraisal is moot, because, after Value Inn filed its Response, it submitted to an EUO and provided requested documents, and Liberty Mutual agreed to an appraisal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 4. \"Furthermore, in the absence of any appraisal award and any additional investigation relevant to appraisal, Plaintiff's claims remain premature and fail to state a claim.\" Reply at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Next, Liberty Mutual revisits its argument that the Court should dismiss Value Inn's breach claims for breach of contract, insurance bad faith, and UPA and UIPA violations for failing to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 5. Liberty Mutual adds that Value Inn's contract claims are premature not only because it has not met the conditions precedent for taking this legal action, but because its claims remain premature \"as appraisal is now agreed to [but] has not been completed.\" Reply at 5. Liberty Mutual asserts that Value Inn provides no authority for its argument that Liberty Mutual's refusal to engage in appraisal pending the EUO \"is a violation of policy conditions and Liberty Mutual's duties after loss.\" Reply at 6 (citing Response \u00b6 5, at 2-3; D.N.M.LR-Civ. 7.3(a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Liberty Mutual asserts that Value Inn's UIPA claim remains premature, because Value Inn \"only recently gave his EUO and provided documentation,\" and Liberty Mutual has not yet completed an appraisal. Reply at 7. Liberty Mutual also contends that Value Inn's argument that the disparity in their loss estimates establishes a good-faith basis to assert UIPA and UPA violations lacks support in the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 7.

Black, United States District Judge for the District of New Mexico, concluded that a plaintiff failed to plausibly plead a UIPA claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Dr. Yumukoglu alleges generally that Provident's conduct \"violates one or more of the provisions of Section 59A-16-20 NMSA 1978 (1984),\" the section of the New Mexico Unfair Insurance Practices Act that prohibits unfair claims practices. Dr. Yumukoglu does not specify which of the fifteen provisions of this section he feels Provident has violated, and after a review of the statute, the Court cannot perceive which subsection could have been violated under the fact alleged. At the very least, Dr. Yumukoglu has failed to comply with the pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2). Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a civil complaint set forth \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Here, it is not clear either what Dr. Yumukoglu is claiming or to what relief he is entitled under \u00a7 56A-16-20. Dr. Yumukoglu's claim appears, like his claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, to be based on Provident's alleged bad faith in terminating his disability benefits. As discussed above, the Court finds that Provident's decision to terminate Dr. Yumukoglu's benefits did not amount to bad faith. Provident's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for statutory violation is granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Yumukoglu v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins.

The Court concludes that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would require a showing that the defendant suffered substantial prejudice before it would dismiss a complaint filed before the plaintiff satisfied a contract's conditions precedent to filing suit where there is a substantial probability that dismissing the claim would prevent the plaintiff from ever obtaining relief. Here, if the Court dismissed Value Inn's Complaint, there is a substantial probability that any subsequent case asserting those claims would be untimely; moreover, there is nothing that Court can properly consider when deciding this motion to dismiss indicating that Liberty Mutual suffered substantial prejudice. Value Inn states a claim for relief for breach of contract, insurance bad faith, and some UIPA violations. The Court will, however, dismiss some of Value Inn's UIPA claims, all of its UPA claims, and its negligent misrepresentation claim for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Court will not abate this action. The Court, therefore, grants in part and denies in part the MTD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     THAT VALUE INN FAILED TO SATISFY ITS INSURANCE POLICY'S CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO SUIT DOES NOT BAR VALUE INN'S CLAIMS.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   According to the Complaint, Value Inn has not satisfied the Contract's conditions precedent for bringing action against Liberty Mutual. The Contract states that \"[n]o one may bring legal action against [Liberty Mutual] under this Coverage Part unless ... there has been full compliance with all the terms of this Coverage Part.\" Contract \u00b6 D(1), at 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Contract also\n   states-in its \"Duties In The Event Of Loss Or Damage\" section-that Liberty Mutual \"may examine any insured under oath ... at such times as may be reasonably required, about any matter relating to this insurance or the claim, including an insured's books and records.\" Contract \u00b6 3(b), at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Liberty Mutual argues that \"submitting to an EUO and providing documentation of the alleged loss are conditions precedent to suit.\" MTD at 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court agrees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court does not see a reasonable interpretation of the Contract besides that \"full compliance with all the terms of this Coverage Part,\" Contract \u00b6 D(1), at 10, includes the Contract's provision that, in the event of loss or damage, an insured must submit to an EUO and provide requested documents,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Contract \u00b6 3(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither party requests a\n   <em>\n    Mark V.\n   </em>\n   hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor do they argue that these provisions are ambiguous. No party states that there is evidence that the Court needs to consider to determine whether there is an ambiguity. Moreover, Value Inn does not dispute that submitting to an EUO and providing requested documents is a condition precedent to bringing suit; in its Response, Value Inn contends only that Liberty Mutual is incorrect that Value Inn has \"refused to submit to an EUO,\" because there is an EUO \"set for September 1, 2017 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.\" Response \u00b6 7, at 4. Value Inn references the Contract's provision about bringing a legal action against Liberty Mutual only to argue that it \"had no choice but to file suit\" when it did, because the Contract requires that it bring action within two years form the date that the loss or damage occurs. Response \u00b6 7, at 4 (citing Contract \u00b6 D(2), at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In considering a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept as true all well-pled factual allegations in the complaint, view those allegations in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tellabs, Inc. v.

The Supreme Court of New Mexico most likely does not want its state courts flooded with suits against insurance companies filed before the insurance company has some chance to investigate, evaluate, settle, or resolve its claims. The Court concludes that, in most cases, the Supreme Court of New Mexico would enforce an insurance policy's provisions requiring that the insured submit to an EUO and provide certain documents even if the insurance\n   company does not show substantial prejudice. The Court not believe, however, that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would apply that general rule to the unique facts of this case, because there is a substantial probability that dismissing Value Inn's Complaint would effectively extinguish Value Inn's ability to recover anything from Liberty Mutual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Court bases its prediction on the Supreme Court of New Mexico precedent indicating that an insurance company's obligations under an insurance policy may persist even when an insured breaches a policy's provision.

Here, by contrast, Liberty Mutual does not argue that the Contract is void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 13 (\"Based upon the provisions of the Policy and the preceding case law, Plaintiff's appraisal demand is premature and fails to meet the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   plausibility threshold.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (asking the court to declare Value Inn's \"request for appraisal and this lawsuit are premature\" and to determine that the Complaint's counts \"fail to state a claim\"). Thus\n   <em>\n    Roberts Oil\n   </em>\n   does not consider the need for showing substantial prejudice when it comes to conditions precedent to bringing suit, satisfaction of which can benefit the parties-and the courts-by promoting settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Second, the Court does not think that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would apply\n   <em>\n    Roberts Oil\n   </em>\n   so broadly in this case, because requiring a showing of substantial prejudice every time a plaintiff failed to satisfy the particular conditions precedent to bring suit might get close to gutting the conditions precedent to bring suit altogether, because prejudice, much less substantive prejudice, may be rare. Further, in most situations, strict application of the EUO and production document requirement conditions precedent to bring suit will be highly beneficial and preferred by enabling parties to resolve claims outside the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Nonetheless,\n   <em>\n    Roberts Oil\n   </em>\n   's unwillingness to enforce-absent substantial prejudice to the insurer-a provision to void a policy for the insured's provision violation leads the Court to believe that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would, in this case and under these circumstances, not dismiss the Complaint for Value Inn's failure to satisfy the Contract's conditions precedent to suit. Although Liberty Mutual does not ask the Court to void the Contract nor to bar Value Inn from filing another claim against it in the future, granting Liberty Mutual's motion to dismiss would likely achieve effectively the same result. The Contract's time-to-sue provision states that Value Inn cannot bring legal action against Liberty Mutual unless that action is brought within two years of the damage date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Contract \u00b6 D, at 10. Here, Value Inn allegedly suffered property damage on October 23, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 7, at 2-3. Thus, the two-year window has closed. If the time-to-sue provision is enforceable, dismissing the Complaint-even without prejudice-would mean that Value Inn could not sue on his Contract, in which case there would be nothing stopping Liberty Mutual from not performing. Value Inn's only hope would be to fashion a clever cause of action that, somehow, falls outside the time-to-sue provision's scope, or for Value Inn to convince a court that applying the time-to-sue provision violates public policy. The Court can imagine potential arguments why the time-to-sue provision is not enforceable,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   but their success\n   is not guaranteed. The uncertainty about Value Inn's chances to enforce its contractual rights if the Court dismisses the Complaint leads the Court to conclude that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would not dismiss those claims unless Liberty Mutual suffered substantial prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   An affirmative defense succeeds on a rule 12(b)(6) motion if the complaint has a \"built-in defense and is essentially self-defeating.\" 5B C. Wright &amp; A. Miller,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1357, at 713 (3d. ed. 2004). Here, there is nothing in the Complaint or in the Contract indicating that Liberty Mutual suffered substantial prejudice as a result of Value Inn's failure to satisfy conditions precedent before filing this legal action. Therefore, Liberty Mutual's affirmative defense that Value Inn failed to satisfy conditions precedent before filing suit fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The Court emphasizes the narrowness of its holding. Insureds should not use the Court's holding to justify refusing to submit to an EUO or provide requested documents to the insurance company, and then file suit one week, one month, or even one year after the incident. In those cases, the Court and state courts are likely to dismiss the case and require a second suit. It is only when, for whatever reason, a second suit would mean no benefit of the insurance contract that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would, the Court concludes, require a showing of substantial prejudice to the insurance company to get around the condition precedent. Experienced attorneys should also not delay filing a lawsuit until the last minute to avoid having to submit to an EUO or provide requested documents.

According to Value Inn, the appraisal clause holds that, once Value Inn requests an appraisal, both Value Inn and Liberty Mutual must select \"a competent and impartial appraiser.\" Contract at 8.

Although Value Inn asserts that Liberty Mutual and Robinson acted in bad faith by listing, once again, UIPA's list of unfair insurance practices verbatim,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 20, at 7-8,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   N.M.

If the Court adheres too rigidly to Tenth Circuit case law, ignoring changes undergone by a state's law in the ensuing years, then parties litigating state-law claims will be subject to a different body of substantive law, depending on whether they litigate in state court or federal court. This result frustrates the purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , which held that federal courts must apply state court interpretations of state law, rather than their own, in part so that parties achieve a consistent result regardless of the forum. This consideration pulls the Court toward according Tenth Circuit precedent less weight, and according state court decisions issued in the ensuing years more weight. On the other hand, when the state law is unclear, it is desirable for there to at least be uniformity among federal judges as to its proper interpretation. Otherwise, different federal judges within the same circuit-or even the same district, as district courts' decisions are not binding, even upon themselves-would be free to adopt differing interpretations of a state's law. This consideration pulls the Court towards a stronger respect for vertical stare decisis, because a Tenth Circuit decision on point-regardless whether it accurately reflects state law-at least provides consistency at the federal level, so long as federal district judges are required to follow it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    The Court must decide how to weigh Tenth Circuit case law against more-recent state court decisions, choosing a point on the spectrum between the two extremes: rigidly adhering to Tenth Circuit precedent unless there is intervening case law directly on point from the state's highest court, on one end; and independently interpreting the state law, regarding the Tenth Circuit precedent as no more than persuasive authority, on the other. In striking this balance, the Court notes that it is generally more concerned about systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and the state courts than it is about inconsistency among federal judges. Judges, even those within a jurisdiction with ostensibly identical governing law, sometimes interpret and apply the law differently from one another; this inconsistency is part and parcel of a common-law judicial system. More importantly, litigants seeking to use forum selection to gain a substantive legal advantage cannot easily manipulate such inconsistency: cases are assigned randomly to district judges in this and many federal districts; and, regardless, litigants cannot know for certain how a given judge will interpret the state law, even if they could determine the identity of the judge pre-filing or pre-removal. All litigants know in advance is that whomever federal district judge they are assigned will look to the entirety of the state's common law in making his or her determination-the same as a state judge would. Systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and state courts, on the other hand, not only threatens the principles of federalism, but litigants may more easily manipulate the inconsistency. When the Tenth Circuit issues an opinion interpreting state law, and the state courts subsequently shift away from that interpretation, litigants-if the district courts strictly adhere to the Tenth Circuit opinion-have a definite substantive advantage in choosing the federal forum over the state forum, or vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    The Court further notes that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to be responsive to changes in state law. Tenth Circuit decisions interpreting a particular state's law on a specific issue are further apart in time than the collective district courts' decisions are. More importantly, the Tenth Circuit does not typically address such issues with the frequency that the state's courts themselves do. As such, Tenth Circuit precedent can lag behind state law developments-developments that the district courts may be nimble enough to perceive and adopt. Additionally, much of the benefit of having a consistent Tenth Circuit-wide interpretation of a particular state's law is wasted. Other than Oklahoma, every state encompassed by the Tenth Circuit contains only one federal judicial district, and there is relatively little need for federal judges in Wyoming and Kansas to have a uniform body of New Mexico law to which to look. Last, the Court notes, respectfully, that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to develop expertise on the state law of the state in which they sit. Every federal judicial district in the nation, except the District of Wyoming, covers at most one state. It is perhaps a more workable design for each district court to keep track of legal developments in the state law of its own state(s) than it is for the Tenth Circuit to monitor separate legal developments in eight states. The Tenth Circuit used to follow this rationale in applying a clearly erroneous standard of review to district judge decisions of state law with no controlling state Supreme Court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Weiss v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1560510\" index=\"531\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/787/518/#p525\">\n     787 F.2d 518\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 525 (10th Cir. 1986) ;\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rawson v.

Since the mid-1980s, however, the Tenth Circuit has abandoned that rationale and applied a de novo standard of review to district judge decisions applying state law with no governing state Supreme Court precedent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rawson v.

The Court regrets the Tenth Circuit's retreat from the clearly erroneous standard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    Having outlined the relevant considerations, the Court thinks the proper stance on vertical stare decisis in the context of federal court interpretations of state law is as follows: the Tenth Circuit's cases are binding as to their precise holding-what the state law was on the day the opinion was published-but lack the positive precedential force that its cases interpreting a federal statute or the Constitution of the United States of America possess. A district court considering a state law issue after the publication of a Tenth Circuit opinion on point may not come to a contrary conclusion based\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    on state court cases available to and considered by the Tenth Circuit, but it may come to such a conclusion based on intervening state court cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    When interpreting state law, the Tenth Circuit does not and cannot issue a case holding that\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    is the law in New Mexico; it holds that the\n    <em>\n     proper interpretation\n    </em>\n    of New Mexico law, at the time the opinion is released, is\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    . Its holdings are descriptive, not prescriptive-interpretive, not normative. Because federal judicial opinions lack independent substantive force on state law issues, but possess such force regarding federal law issues, the Court thinks the following is not an unfair summary of the judicial interpretive process: (i) when interpreting federal law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that both reflects and influences the body of law; that holding subsequently becomes a part of the body of law; but (ii) when interpreting state law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that only reflects the body of law; that holding does not subsequently become a part of the body of law. The federal district courts are bound to conclude that the Tenth Circuit's reflection of the then-existing body of law was accurate. The question is whether they should build a doctrine atop the case and use the existence of the Tenth Circuit's case to avoid any responsibility to independently consider the whole body of state law that exists when the time comes that diversity litigants raise the issue in their courtrooms. Giving such effect to the Tenth Circuit's interpretations of state law is at tension with\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , giving independent substantive effect to federal judicial decisions-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , applying federal law-in a case brought in diversity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    The purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    is well-known and simple, and the Court should not complicate it beyond recognition: it is that the same substantive law governs litigants' cases regardless whether they are brought in a federal or state forum. For simplicity's sake, most courts have settled on the formulation that \"the federal court must attempt to predict how the states' highest court would rule if confronted with the issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore's\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 124.22[3] (citing\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

Shadur, United States District Judge, looks to state procedural rules to determine in which state appellate circuit the suit would have been filed were it not in federal court, and then applies the state law as that circuit court interprets it,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbott Laboratories v.

This formulation, built out of ease-of-use, does not relieve courts of their Supreme Court-mandated obligation to consider state appellate and trial court decisions. To the contrary, even non-judicial writings by influential authors, statements by state supreme court justices, the closeness of the vote on a prior case addressing the issue, and personnel changes on the court-considerations that would never inform a federal court's analysis of federal law-may validly come into play. The question is whether the district courts must abdicate, across-the-board, the \"would decide\" aspect of the\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    analysis to their parent appellate courts when the Court of Appeals has declared an interpretation of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    doctrine results in federal cases that interpret state law withering with time. While cases interpreting federal law become more powerful over time-forming the groundwork for doctrines, growing upward from one application (Congress may create a national bank) to many (Congress may set quotas on wheat-growing for personal consumption), expanding outward from the general (states must grant criminal jury trials) to the specific (the jury need not be twelve people, nor must it be unanimous)-federal cases interpreting state law often become stale. New state court cases-even when not directly rebuking the federal court's statement of law-alter the common-law legal landscape with their dicta, their insinuations, and their tone. The Supreme Court, which picks its cases sparingly and for maximum effect, almost never grants certiorari to resolve issues of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    The Court's views on\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , of course, mean little if the Tenth Circuit does not agree.

Thus, when a panel of this Court has rendered a decision interpreting state law, that interpretation is binding on district courts in this circuit, and on subsequent panels of this Court, unless an intervening decision of the state's highest court has resolved the issue.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    <em>\n     Wankier v.

First, a specific statutory regime-the UM/UIM statute-governs an automobile insurance policy, which demonstrates New Mexico's deliberate policy for protecting an insured from financial consequences from an accident with an uninsured or underinsured driver. Second, the UM/UIM statute's purpose is to protect individual drivers who may not be sophisticated insurance customers and may find themselves at the wrong end of a power disparity when purchasing an automobile insurance policy. Business owners who are in the market for insurance coverage for damage to commercial property are more likely to be on roughly equal footing with the insurer when negotiating a policy. In short, the reasons for voiding an unfavorable time-to-sue provision in a UM/UIM policy do not apply to a commercial property insurance contract like Value Inn's policy with Liberty Mutual. In light of the above, the Court concludes that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would enforce the Contract's time-to-sue provision. Moreover, because the\n    <em>\n     Whelan\n    </em>\n    reasoning depends on the statute governing the contract and not the claim's category,\n    <em>\n     Whelan\n    </em>\n    does not support UPA and UIPA claims prevailing over contractual time-to-sue defenses.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ryan v.

Liberty Mutual's argument is sound, but many of Value Inn's claims' merits do not depend on the appraisal's outcome. For instance, its allegations that Liberty Mutual (i) breached its contract and committed insurance bad faith by not agreeing to the appraisal promptly; and (ii) violated the UIPA and UPA, and committed negligent misrepresentation by misleading him about its policy and not settling its claim in good faith, are true regardless what the appraisal concludes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-261\">\n    Liberty Mutual argues that Value Inn's breach-of-contract claim is premature, because the appraisal has not yet been performed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply at 5. Value Inn alleges, however, breach-of-contract damages arising from the time that Liberty Mutual allegedly refused to proceed with the appraisal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Complaint \u00b6 32, at 11 (\"Plaintiff incurred ... costs of delay in performance, costs of mitigation, [and] costs of substitute performance ...\"). Therefore, Value Inn alleges harm not dependent on the appraisal's outcome.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-262\">\n    To the extent that the Court dismisses Value Inn's declaratory and injunctive relief requests as moot based on what the post-Complaint pleadings raise, the Court may do so, because the mootness inquiry implicates the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction under rule 12(b)(1).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Doyle v. Midland Credit Mgmt., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062869\" index=\"740\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/722/78/#p80\">\n     722 F.3d 78\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 80 (2d Cir. 2013) (\"Under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, '[w]hen a case becomes moot, the federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over the action.' \" (quoting\n    <em>\n     Fox v.

Consequently, the Court is not restricted to the complaint, as it is on rule 12(b)(6) challenges for failure to state a claim. When \"resolution of the jurisdiction question is intertwined with the merits of the case,\" however, a court may have to convert the rule 12(b)(1) motion into a summary judgment motion under rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n    <em>\n     Holt v.

The Court can convert part of a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Advanced Optics Elecs., Inc. v.

Liberty Mutual's subject-matter jurisdiction argument-that Value Inn's declaratory and injunctive relief requests are moot-go to the case's merits, because whether Value Inn has submitted to an EUO and Liberty Mutual has agreed to an appraisal determines both whether the Court should grant Value Inn's requests and whether those requests are still Article III controversies. When converting a motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment, courts must be \"given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     GFF Corp. v.

For a motion for summary judgment, the Court may also consider arguments raised in a reply so long as it affords the opposing party a sufficient interval to \"request time to file a surreply.\"\n    <em>\n     Pippin v.

The Court can consider Liberty Mutual's assertion in its reply that it agreed to proceed with the appraisal,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Reply at 3, because Liberty Mutual filed its reply over six months ago and Value Inn has not requested time to file a surreply.
