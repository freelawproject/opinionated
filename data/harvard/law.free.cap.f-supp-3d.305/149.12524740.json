Like many longstanding business relationships, the partnership between Azima and RAKIA has had its ups and downs. Not surprisingly, this lawsuit concerns one of the downs: Azima maintains that RAKIA commissioned the repeated surreptitious hacking of his personal and business laptops from October 2015 to August 2016, and then published disparaging material that was illicitly gleaned from Azima's computers during the hacking. Azima filed the instant lawsuit on September 30, 2016, claiming that RAKIA has violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and that RAKIA has also engaged in common law conversion and unfair competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this Court at present is RAKIA's motion to dismiss Azima's first amended complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 31-2, at 7-9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its motion, RAKIA argues that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case because the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\"the FSIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , confers sovereign immunity upon RAKIA, and because none of the FSIA's limited exceptions apply. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 21-35.) In particular, RAKIA asserts it enjoys immunity because it is an \"agency or instrumentality of a foreign sovereign\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21), and neither the FSIA's commercial activity exception or non-commercial tort exception confers jurisdiction over RAKIA under the instant circumstances (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-35). RAKIA further contends that, even if this Court has jurisdiction under the FSIA, the United Kingdom is the proper forum to hear this lawsuit, not the District of Columbia, given the forum-selection clause that Azima and RAKIA executed as part of a March 2016 Settlement Agreement (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    at 35-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and the fact that the balance of public and private interests favor litigating this matter in London (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    at 37-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons explained fully below, RAKIA's motion to dismiss Azima's complaint will be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . This Court concludes that it has subject matter jurisdiction over this case, because Azima has alleged that RAKIA engaged in foreign commercial activities in connection with an act that had a direct effect within the United States, such that this matter falls within the commercial activity exception to\n   the FSIA. And because RAKIA has failed to demonstrate that the United Kingdom is an adequate and available forum to litigate Azima's claims, the Court also rejects RAKIA's contention that the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   requires that this case be brought in London. A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Azima and RAKIA have worked together on a number of business matters over the past decade (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    \u00b6 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and throughout their association with one another, Azima and RAKIA have repeatedly discussed possible joint ventures in the aviation, hospitality, logistics, munitions, and steel industries (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    \u00b6 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). These discussions have sometimes come to fruition; Azima and RAKIA have engaged in \"multiple business ventures\" through which RAKIA has paid Azima more than seven million dollars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In one such venture, one of Azima's businesses-known as \"HeavyLift International Airline\"-entered into a joint venture with RAK Airways to build and operate a flight training academy in Ras Al Khaimah. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    \u00b6 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) RAKIA became involved with this arrangement as a guarantor, because it agreed to guarantee RAK Airways's performance in the event that RAK Airways failed to meet its contractual obligations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) A subsequent dispute arose with respect to this joint venture, when Azima claimed that RAK Airways owed HeavyLift f or \"investments HeavyLift made[.]\" (Settlement Agreement, Ex. L to Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 31-15, at 3.) HeavyLift eventually turned to RAKIA as RAK Airways's guarantor, and the three principals (RAKIA, HeavyLift, and Azima) entered into a settlement agreement in March of 2016 to resolve that dispute. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Significantly for present purposes, the March 2016 Settlement Agreement contained the following forum-selection clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   This Settlement Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of, or in connection with, it or its subject matter or formation (including, without limitation, any contractual or non-contractual disputes, claims or obligations) is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English law and the Parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Settlement Agreement at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Notably, Azima contends that, in addition to doing business with RAKIA with respect to the HeavyLift joint venture and other business arrangements, he has also served as a mediator for RAKIA, helping it resolve disputes with other commercial entities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 21.) RAKIA purportedly employed Azima in that capacity during the 2015 and 2016 calendar years, as RAKIA attempted to negotiate a\n   settlement with its former CEO. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    \u00b6 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) According to Azima's complaint, RAKIA asked Azima to step in as a mediator for this particular dispute, and Azima fully anticipated that RAKIA would compensate him for his services and expenses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) But Azima alleges that RAKIA never paid him for the services he provided when he mediated between RAKIA and its former CEO, and that RAKIA ultimately terminated his services in July of 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    at \u00b6 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For its part, RAKIA vehemently contends that it never asked Azima to mediate between RAKIA and its former CEO. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of James Buchanan, Attachment to Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 31-21, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) Instead, RAKIA recalls that Azima approached RAKIA and offered to serve as \"an honest broker\"-as distinguished from a neutral mediator-in the dispute between RAKIA and its former CEO. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Furthermore, RAKIA says that it did not offer to pay Azima for these services, nor did it enter into a contract with him for these services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    \u00b6 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Indeed, throughout Azima's time as an \"honest broker,\" RAKIA allegedly perceived him to be acting as an advocate for RAKIA's former CEO. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    \u00b6 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thus, there is a disagreement between the parties regarding whether or not RAKIA actually hired Azima to mediate a conflict in or around 2015. However, it is beyond dispute that the aforementioned March 2016 Settlement Agreement-which both Azima and RAKIA signed-specifically references the fact that Azima had \"recently provided negotiation assistance to RAKIA on an informal basis[,]\" and lists this service as one of the reasons for the payout that Azima received through that settlement. (Settlement Agreement at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Hacking And Its Aftermath\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Azima's complaint alleges that, during the time that Azima was allegedly mediating between RAKIA and its former CEO, computer hackers repeatedly accessed Azima's business and personal computers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 33, 78.) These digital assaults purportedly began on October 14, 2015, when the hackers accessed Azima's computers using two IP addresses; one that was based in Florida, and one that was based in New York. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    \u00b6 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Unbeknownst to Azima, the hackers then repeatedly accessed his computers over the next ten months, monitoring Azima's communications, deleting his data, and sending fake emails from his accounts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    \u00b6 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) And because Azima did not learn that hackers were accessing his computers until August of 2016 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    \u00b6 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), he continued to communicate with RAKIA and its former CEO electronically (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 25, 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and discuss privileged matters with his attorneys concerning his \"commercial interactions with RAKIA\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31). Thus, Azima has alleged that the hackers were watching while Azima engaged in sensitive and important business affairs. The hackers also allegedly left behind malware, which infected Azima's computers (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201604\">\n    \u00b6 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and ultimately damaged Azima's \"U.S.-based business and personal laptops\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75, 78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the same time that the hackers were infiltrating Azima's computers, the negotiations between RAKIA and its former CEO started to break down.

Azima alleges that, in July of 2016, RAKIA threatened him directly, by saying that he would become \"collateral damage\" in the all-out war that RAKIA planned to wage against its former CEO at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Then, a short time later, multiple websites disparaging Azima appeared on the internet.

That demand letter based its claims on information that RAKIA had \"recently obtained ... via publicly available internet sources.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) RAKIA attached several of the documents taken from Azima's computer to this demand letter, and those documents contained confidential information that Azima kept only on his computers.

On December 12, 2016, RAKIA filed a motion to dismiss Azima's action on the grounds that (1) the FSIA deprives this Court of subject matter jurisdiction to hear Azima's case; (2) Azima has failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted; and (3) the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   requires the dismissal of the lawsuit.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In the instant case, the parties have fiercely debated whether RAKIA is immune from suit under the FSIA, primarily because they disagree over whether the FSIA's commercial activity or noncommercial tort exceptions apply. Notably, Azima and RAKIA hotly contest several different aspects of the FSIA's commercial activity exception as applied to the instant record: (1) where the alleged hacking of Azima's computers took place (i.e., inside or outside the United States); (2) whether RAKIA has engaged in a pertinent \"commercial activity\" outside of the United States; (3) whether RAKIA's alleged hacking of Azima's computers was undertaken in connection with that foreign commercial activity; and (4) whether the alleged hacking of Azima's computers had a direct effect within the United States. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 28-35; Pl.'s Opp'n at 29-39; Def.'s Reply at 8-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons explained below, this Court has concluded that Azima has adequately alleged (and proven to the extent that RAKIA makes a factual challenge) that RAKIA's hacking of Azima's computers was undertaken in connection with a foreign commercial activity and caused a direct effect within the United States, and thus that the commercial activity exception provides the Court with subject matter jurisdiction over this case. That holding renders it unnecessary for the Court to further opine as to the applicability of the FSIA's noncommercial tort exception. But the Court has proceeded to reach, and resolve, the parties' additional dispute regarding the prudential doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 35-40; Pl.'s Opp'n at 42-54; Def.'s Reply at 20-23), and it concludes that RAKIA has failed to carry its burden of establishing that England provides an adequate alternative forum. Therefore, both aspects of RAKIA's motion-to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and to dismiss for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   -will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    A. This Court Has Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over Azima's Claims Under The FSIA's Commercial Activity Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As mentioned above, the FSIA's commercial activity exception contains three\n   clauses that provide independent bases for a court to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Two of those clauses are relevant here. They authorize a court to exercise jurisdiction where a plaintiff claims that the sovereign committed an injurious act that was performed either within the United States in connection with commercial activity outside the United States, or outside of the United States in connection with commercial activity outside the United States if the act has a direct effect within the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the instant case, it is undisputed that if RAKIA can be said to have engaged in a commercial activity at all, such activity took place outside the United States. But the parties debate whether RAKIA's extraterritorial commercial activity is pertinent to the instant lawsuit, and whether the alleged hacking (the injurious act) can be said to have been performed in connection with that commercial activity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 28-32; Pl.'s Opp'n at 30-36; Def.'s Reply at 8-13.) The parties are also at odds over whether the alleged hacking had a direct effect within the United States, as well as whether the hacking itself took place inside or outside the United States. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 28, 32-35; Pl.'s Opp'n at 36-39; Def.'s Reply at 14-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Because this Court concludes that Azima has adequately alleged-and, as necessary, has established-that the hacking that is the basis of the instant lawsuit was performed in connection with RAKIA's commercial activity outside of the United States and had a direct effect within the United States, as explained below, the FSIA's commercial activity exception applies without regard to whether the alleged hacking occurred inside or outside the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Record Demonstrates That RAKIA Engaged In Extraterritorial \"Commercial Activity\" For FSIA Purposes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The FSIA defines the phrase \"commercial activity\" as \"either a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201603\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

By contrast, uniquely sovereign activities, such as state-authorized abductions or the nationalization of a business entity through a country's legal or political systems, do not trigger the commercial activity exception, and lawsuits claiming injury for acts undertaken in connection with such activities do not avoid the FSIA's sovereign immunity bar.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rong v.

To deal with this ambiguity, the Supreme Court has emphasized that a court must look to whether \"a foreign government acts ... in the manner of a private player within the [market],\" and the court must look only to the nature of that activity,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the sovereign's reasons for engaging in it.\n   <em>\n    Weltover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730183\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/607/#p610\">\n    504 U.S. at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730183\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/607/#p610\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These two precepts necessarily guide the Court's inquiry here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Azima maintains that the commercial activity aspect of the FSIA exception set forth at section 1605(a)(2) is satisfied because RAKIA is engaged in ongoing business dealings with him outside of the United States as a general matter, and also because RAKIA specifically engaged him to mediate the dispute between RAKIA and its former CEO. RAKIA's motion to dismiss rejects the arguments that pertain to the parties' longstanding relationship because it claims that those activities are not in connection with the acts in this case (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.2,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), and, as a factual matter, RAKIA also challenges Azima's contention that he served as a mediator between RAKIA and its CEO (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 29). In regard to RAKIA's factual challenge, this Court must examine the entire record in order to ascertain whether Azima has \"come[ ] forward with sufficient evidence to carry [his] burden of production\" regarding RAKIA's participation in a commercial activity, and, if he has, the Court must then assess whether RAKIA, who \"shoulder[s] the burden of persuasion[,]\" has demonstrated that no such commercial activity actually occurred.\n   <em>\n    SACE S.p.A\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274602\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/243/21/#p32\">\n    243 F.Supp.3d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The instant record is more than sufficient to persuade this Court that RAKIA has engaged in pertinent commercial activity outside of the United States, within the meaning of the FSIA's commercial activity exception, for several reasons. First of all, the information that the parties have presented makes crystal clear that RAKIA and Azima have had an ongoing and active business relationship for many years. There is no dispute that RAKIA is an investment organ of Ras al Khaimah, and it appears that RAKIA's commercial relationship with Azima began no later than 2007, with the HeavyLift joint venture agreement (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Buchanan Decl. \u00b6 19), and continued until at least the summer of 2016, when Azima and RAKIA discussed investing in a munitions factory (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). Indeed, the record establishes that between October 14, 2015, and August 2016 (i.e., the period in which the alleged hacking occurred), Azima and RAKIA were engaged in several business-related activities; specifically, they engaged in discussions in the fall of 2015 about a possible \"Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance\" joint venture between RAKIA and a company Azima owns (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); undertook discussions in summer of 2016 about RAKIA and Azima investing in a munitions factory (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   ); and continued participating in a joint venture relating to a flight training academy in the United Arab Emirates and between Azima's HeavyLift company and RAK Airways, whose performance RAKIA agreed to guarantee (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 64; Settlement Agreement at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Thus, the question here is whether RAKIA's involvement in these business negotiations constituted commercial activity as\n   defined in\n   <em>\n    Weltover\n   </em>\n   . It is clear to this Court that they do. To begin with, these negotiations were generally commercial in nature, and in fact, by agreeing to serve as a guarantor for RAK Airways's performance with respect to the HeavyLift joint venture agreement, RAKIA undertook the\n   <em>\n    quintessential\n   </em>\n   role of a commercial actor in the context of a new business enterprise. No less an authority than\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   defines a \"joint venture\" as \"[a] business undertaking by two or more persons engaged in a single defined project[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   967 (10th ed. 2014), and in becoming a \"guarantor,\" RAKIA specifically \"ma[de] a guaranty or g[ave] security for a debt [,]\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 821;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   23\n   <em>\n    Williston on Contracts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 61:1 (4th ed. 2017) (describing a 'guaranty' as a contractual promise to compensate the obligee in the event that the principal obligor fails to do so). Contractual promises of this nature are undoubtedly the \"type of action[ ] by which a private party engages in 'trade and traffic or commerce[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Weltover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730183\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/607/#p610\">\n    504 U.S. at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730183\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/607/#p610\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis and citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    De Csepel v.

RAKIA cannot deny that it has been party to various business agreements with Azima-either directly or through other business entities-and the Courts of Appeals have acknowledged that a broad array of contractual agreements constitute commercial activity under the FSIA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    De Csepel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661955,5866351\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/591/\">\n    714 F.3d at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (bailment contract);\n   <em>\n    Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt v.

The parties vehemently disagree as to exactly what role Azima served in the negotiations between RAKIA and its former CEO, and on its face, both parties have provided plausible accounts of the role Azima played. All things considered, this Court finds that Azima has met his burden of production regarding his contention that he worked as a mediator between RAKIA and its CEO between the summer of 2015 and July 2016 and that this activity took place outside the United States, and it finds that RAKIA has not carried its burden of persuasion with respect to this same issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The emails that Azima has submitted clearly demonstrate that he functioned as one of the \"middle men, the messengers\" (7/23/16-7/25/16 Email Chain, Ex. B to Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 33-3, at 4), with respect to the dispute that RAKIA had with its former CEO, and that Azima served in a \"Henry Kissinger role\" (11/28/15-11/30/15 Email Chain, Ex. D to Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 33-5, at 4). He coordinated meetings between RAKIA and its former CEO in Milan and Geneva (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654240\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/1210/#p1218\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; 1/28/16-1/31/2016 Email Chain, Ex. E to Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 33-6, at 2-3), and on at least one occasion, Azima met personally with RAKIA outside the United States (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Buchanan Decl. \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 24 (noting that only \"some\" of Azima's meetings in this matter took place within the United States). Azima has also provided an email from one of RAKIA's attorneys indicating that RAKIA entered into the March 2016 Settlement Agreement, at least in part, \"in recognition of\" Azima's negotiations services. (12/30/15-1/5/2016 Email Chain, Ex. F to Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 33-7, at 2.) Thus, even if Azima did not receive direct compensation for his negotiation assistance, the record shows that RAKIA perceived his services as having value and intended to reward them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12/30/15-1/5/2016 Email Chain at 2 (\"[A]ny settlement is more in recognition of the support and assistance [ ] Azima is offering to RAK in settling matters with KM and SI[,] as well as[ ] potential new business ventures currently under discussion.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nothing that RAKIA has offered undercuts the strong inference that Azima was, in fact, engaged as a mediator with respect to the CEO dispute. RAKIA's primary piece of evidence in this regard-the declaration of James Buchanan, Azima's primary contact with RAKIA during the mediation-emphasizes that RAKIA believed Azima was acting as\n   <em>\n    the CEO's\n   </em>\n   advocate with respect to the negotiations, and also that RAKIA never entered into an agreement to compensate Azima for his assistance (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Buchanan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8), but these assertions do not rebut Azima's clear demonstration that he was actively involved in mediating the dispute. What is more, the other documents that RAKIA has submitted actually provide further confirmation of Azima's mediator role. For example, as noted, the March 2016 Settlement Agreement expressly states that the $2.6 million settlement was tendered to Azima, at least in part, to acknowledge that \"Azima has recently provided negotiation assistance to RAKIA on an informal basis which RAKIA recognises and appreciates.\" (Settlement Agreement at 3.) In addition, the Buchanan Declaration asserts that Azima sought to capitalize on his mediation role by proposing new joint ventures, some of which RAKIA did not immediately dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Buchanan Decl. \u00b6 14.) In this Court's view, whether or not any such venture ultimately materialized is irrelevant because the acknowledgment that Azima was in a position to\n   <em>\n    make\n   </em>\n   such suggestions belies RAKIA's current contention that Azima was merely a biased, uncompensated interloper with respect to the CEO dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Therefore, based on the evidence presented, the Court finds that Azima has established that he served as a mediator in the out-of-country negotiations between RAKIA and its former CEO, and that his work in these negotiations led, in part, to the agreement that RAKIA and Azima reached with respect to the outstanding dispute over the HeavyLift joint venture. Moreover, and significantly, RAKIA's engagement of Azima's services with respect to the negotiations constituted commercial activity for the purpose of the FSIA.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Lydia Nussbaum,\n   <em>\n    Mediation As Regulation: Expanding State Governance Over Private Disputes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Utah%20L.%20Rev.%20361\">\n    2016 Utah L.

Similarly, the Third Circuit has concluded that the mismanagement of a building inside the United States should not automatically be considered to be an act in connection with the extraterritorial execution of the loan transaction that was used to finance the building.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed.

To be specific, the complaint in the instant case alleges that RAKIA \"took the acts alleged herein\n   <em>\n    in order to\n   </em>\n   gain an advantage over Mr. Azima in his commercial dealings with RAKIA and to inflict commercial and financial harm on Mr. Azima.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 68 (emphasis added).) In this way, Azima's complaint draws a direct causal relationship between the hacking and online disparagement of which Azima complains and the commercial activity that RAKIA and Azima had been engaged in overseas. And the complaint goes further: it alleges that the information RAKIA supposedly obtained during the hacking of Azima's computers was actually\n   <em>\n    used\n   </em>\n   in conjunction with the demand letter that RAKIA sent to Azima to accuse him of defrauding RAKIA in past commercial activities, including the HeavyLift joint venture. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 64.) Thus, the complaint draws a direct line between the hacking and the parties' commercial dealings, and in so doing, satisfies the FSIA's in-connection-with requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Azima has also successfully pled a plausible theory that links the alleged hacking to the mediation services that Azima had been providing with respect to the CEO dispute. Azima starts off noting that the hacking of his computer began in October of 2015 and continued through the summer of 2016-a time period that roughly corresponds with the time in which Azima served as a mediator between RAKIA and its former CEO. (\n   <em>\n    Compare id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 29 (identifying the start and end points of the hack)\n   <em>\n    with id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 34 (identifying the start and end points of the mediation).) That alleged overlap alone supports an inference that there was some connection between the two, but RAKIA's alleged actions during the final stretch of the mediation further underscores the alleged link between the hacking and Azima's role as a mediator. According to Azima, when it became clear that RAKIA and its former CEO were unlikely to reach an agreement, RAKIA upped the pressure by threatening to make Azima \"collateral damage\" in the all-out war that RAKIA planned to wage against its former CEO. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35 (internal quotation marks omitted).) The complaint then asserts that it was\n   <em>\n    only after\n   </em>\n   mediation had finally broken down that the hackers published Azima's private information on a number of BitTorrent websites, presumably to punish Azima for his role in the failed mediation in accordance with RAKIA's threat. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   These allegations are sufficient to support a reasonable inference that RAKIA's alleged hacking had \"a substantive connection or a causal link to the commercial activity\" in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641688\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/720/#p726\">\n    107 F.3d at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). That is, Azima has plausibly alleged that RAKIA's engagement in certain commercial activity-using Azima as a mediator and partnering with him in foreign business ventures-caused RAKIA to commit the hacking for the purpose of influencing the ongoing mediation, punishing Azima if anything went wrong with those negotiations, and ultimately \"gain[ing] leverage and coercive influence\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   over Azima.

Azima's complaint contends that it is precisely because Azima often conducts business when he is inside the United States that Azima has a set of \"\n   <em>\n    U.S.-based\n   </em>\n   business and personal laptops\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78) (emphasis added), and according to the complaint, these were the laptops that were hacked in the fall of 2015 and repeatedly thereafter (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Because hacking and the installation of malware affects the targeted computer systems, and the allegations of Azima's complaint pertaining to where he works and resides support an inference that at least one of Azima's U.S.-based personal and business laptops was in the United States when the hacking occurred, this Court confidently concludes that Azima has pled that a direct effect occurred within the United States. To find otherwise, as RAKIA insists that one must, would be to require Azima's complaint to account for the whereabouts of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of his computer equipment at each moment when Azima's computers were hacked, and to infer that if any of his computers could have left the United States with him when he traveled during the nine-month period where these hackings took place, then the complaint fails to allege that the hacking necessarily had a direct effect on his computers inside the United States. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 31:9-32:8.) Not only is such an inference procedurally improper,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408216,3699263\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/294/82/\">\n    294 F.3d at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a facial challenge requires the court to read the allegations in the light most favorable\n   <em>\n    to the plaintiff\n   </em>\n   and take all plausible inferences in the plaintiff's favor), but the Court also finds that the suggestion that a U.S. citizen who lives and works in the United States must pinpoint the dates of an allegedly extensive computer hacking and affirmatively assert that he was inside the United States with all of his computer equipment at the time the hacking occurred in order to be able proceed with an action against a foreign state under the CFAA and the FSIA (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 33-34; Def.'s Reply at 15 &amp; n.7) is, itself, unreasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Thus, this Court finds that Azima's complaint sufficiently alleges that RAKIA's supposed hacking had a direct effect inside the United States. The relevant portions of the CFAA provide that a defendant is liable if it \"intentionally accesses a protected computer without authorization\" and causes the plaintiff to suffer a loss worth at least $5,000.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5), (c)(4)(A)(i)(I), (g). Azima has pointed out that the hackers not only accessed his computerized files, but they also damaged his U.S.-based personal and business computers and installed malware on those machines. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33, 78.) Given the facts alleged in Azima's complaint, it is reasonable to infer that at least some of the damage to his data and to the computers themselves occurred when his computers were inside the United States, and therefore, Azima's plausible allegation of a cognizable injury due to a CFAA violation also establishes a direct effect in the United States. Azima further claims that RAKIA's alleged hacking, as well as the resulting disparagement of him when RAKIA weaponized the information that it had stolen, violated the common law of unfair competition, and these allegations also suffice to establish direct effects in the United States, because the gravamen of the unfair competition claim likewise appears to be that RAKIA's conduct \"interfer[ed] with [Azima's]\n   <em>\n    business\n   </em>\n   computers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Azima's conversion claim presents a more challenging inquiry, but, ultimately, the Court concludes that Azima has alleged sufficient facts that this claim, too, survives RAKIA's motion to dismiss. With respect to torts against property, it is well established that the locus of the tort is typically \"where the force takes effect on the thing[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 377 note 3 (Am.

And it is clear that outright theft is not the only way that a tort-feasor retains (exercises dominion and control over) another's property as a matter of law; property can also be deemed converted under D.C. law if it is damaged or destroyed while in the tortfeasor's possession.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maalouf v.

Azima's complaint helpfully speaks to this point, because it specifically alleges that the harmful hacking activity included the deletion of data from\n   <em>\n    Azima's U.S.-based business and personal laptops\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 90.) Given this Court's previous finding that Azima has plausibly alleged that at least one of the hacked computers was inside the United States when the hacking occurred (\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   ), the hacker's erasure of such data, also plausibly occurred inside the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   To the extent that RAKIA's rebuttal includes the observation that Azima had his computers replaced after the malware attack, and thus is the one who destroyed his computers or data (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 34), RAKIA completely misses the point. Azima maintains that he decided, upon the advice of experts, to replace his computers because those computers\n   <em>\n    had already been damaged\n   </em>\n   by the hackings in this case (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 33), and that threshold damage constitutes a direct effect for the purpose of the FSIA. Therefore, Azima's actions were not an \"intervening element\" between the hacking and the effect felt within the United States.\n   <em>\n    Princz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5707083,10515524\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/1166/\">\n    26 F.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, the Court rejects RAKIA's contention that Azima did not suffer a direct effect in the United States due to the theft of his data. While it is true that \"loss to an American individual and firm resulting from a foreign tort\" is not sufficient to cause a direct effect within the United States (Def.'s Mot. at 34 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Antares Aircraft, LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11950933\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/33/#p34\">\n    999 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   36 ) ), in making that statement, the Second Circuit was referencing a\n   <em>\n    financial\n   </em>\n   loss, and not the theft of a tangible or intangible object,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Antares Aircraft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11950933\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/33/#p34\">\n    999 F.2d at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this Court's view, the alleged destruction of data on Azima's computers while these computers were plausibly inside the United States is a sufficiently significant direct effect inside the United States to support this Court's jurisdiction over Azima's conversion claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    The Court Need Not Decide Whether The Alleged Hacking Occurred Inside Or Outside The United States, Nor Is It Concerned That The Instant Ruling Will Open The Floodgates To A Wave Of Foreign-State Computer Hacking Lawsuits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   This Court's conclusion that Azima has plausibly alleged that RAKIA hacked his personal computers in connection with commercial activity outside of the United States causing a direct effect inside the United States renders unnecessary any assessment of whether the alleged hacking of Azima's personal computers is an act that took place inside the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 18 (maintaining that the location of the hacking is the location of the hackers at the moment they broke into Azima's computers, and arguing that \"there is no allegation that the hackers were in the United States at the time\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 29 &amp; n.9 (asserting that, for the purpose of the commercial activity exception, a hacking occurs at the location of the IP addresses used to hack into the target computer, and the IP addresses used for to hack into Azima's computers were in the United States). While an analysis of the location of the foreign sovereign's allegedly tortious act is ordinarily a threshold consideration when a plaintiff contends that a federal court has jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign under the FSIA's commercial activity exception, the location of the challenged act is obvious in the typical case, and the parties' dispute centers on whether the other elements of the applicable prong of the commercial activity exception have been satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    de Csepel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661955,5866351\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/591/\">\n    714 F.3d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (acknowledging that a Hungarian-based contract \"obviously occurred outside the territory of the United States\");\n   <em>\n    Princz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5707083,10515524\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/1166/\">\n    26 F.3d at 1172-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (taking for granted that the torture of the plaintiff in Germany took place overseas).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Not so with computer hacking.

Read as a whole, this provision authorizes federal courts to entertain a lawsuit against a foreign sovereign for commercial acts that occur either inside the United States (clauses 1 and 2)\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   outside the United States (clause 3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Odhiambo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183378,4111111\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/31/\">\n    764 F.3d at 36-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, far from being a barrier to maintaining a legal action in federal court, the location-of-the-act determination simply determines what a plaintiff must show to establish that a plaintiff's claims have some connection to the United States, as is necessary to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts. If the tortious act took place in the United States or it took place elsewhere yet still has a direct effect in the United States,\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   clause two or three of the commercial activity exception is applicable, and a court need not necessarily decide which circumstance applies, like in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   To conclude otherwise, and thereby require Azima to establish where, exactly, the hacking occurred as a threshold matter,\n   as RAKIA suggests (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 18-19), would be to elevate the form of section 1605(a)(2) over its substance in a manner that contravenes the purpose of that statutory provision. It is difficult to pinpoint the one location where a hacking occurs, as explained above, but it is indisputable that the hacking of Azima's computers took place either inside the United States or outside the United States, and where the statute Congress enacted makes clear that either circumstance can suffice to establish jurisdiction, it simply cannot be the case that the complaint fails even if it contains sufficient allegations to support both. Moreover, because the facts alleged satisfy the more stringent of these two jurisdictional tests (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.3,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (finding that Azima has sufficiently pleaded that RAKIA's hacking had a direct effect inside the United States) ), it is well established that the Court need not decide which legal test is the applicable one.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai World Wide Enterps. v.

This is because Congress has made clear that the effect in the United States has to be direct in order to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement, and in the instant case, Azima has alleged actual damage to his computers as a result of the hack, which makes it significantly easier to find that the effect of the alleged hacking activity here was not \" 'purely trivial.' \"\n   <em>\n    Princz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5707083,10515524\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/1166/\">\n    26 F.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Weltover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730183\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/607/#p610\">\n    504 U.S. at 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730183\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/607/#p610\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718256,4235057\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1175/\">\n    734 F.3d at 1183-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that neither reputational harm nor financial loss constitutes a direct effect in the United States).

The first reason for RAKIA's shortcoming in this regard is the fact that foreign sovereigns typically enjoy a form of state immunity in the United Kingdom (much like in the United States) under Parliament's State Immunity Act of 1978,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   State Immunity Act of 1978, 1978, c. 33 (U.K.),\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   17 I.L.M. 1123 (1978), and similar to the FSIA, that act begins with a general presumption of immunity, then proceeds to carve out narrow exceptions where the courts of the United Kingdom can exercise jurisdiction over a case filed against a foreign sovereign.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274550\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/52/#p74\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1. None of the exceptions that appear in the State Immunity Act apply to the present dispute on their face.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274550\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/52/#p74\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2 (consent); \u00a7 3 (commercial transactions and contracts performed in the United Kingdom); \u00a7 5 (personal injuries and property damage based on an act in the United Kingdom). RAKIA's\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   argument nevertheless suggests that the State Immunity Act's exception for the consent of the foreign sovereign might apply if Azima brings his hacking claims in a London court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 38 (\"The High Court is potentially better-suited to hear this dispute because RAKIA has already agreed to that court's jurisdiction.\").) But the consent to jurisdiction that RAKIA points to as precedent was provided in a lawsuit that RAKIA brought against Azima for fraud regarding the sale of the Sheraton Hotel in Tbilisi, Georgia (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Claim Form &amp; Particulars of Claim, Ex. K. to Def.'s Mot., ECF No. 31-14, at 5-7), and RAKIA is careful to avoid making any representation that it would necessarily consent to the High Court's jurisdiction with respect to the claims that Azima makes in the instant case. This omission is significant, because the State Immunity Act makes clear that a foreign sovereign's waiver of immunity is limited, and does not \"extend[ ] to ... any counter-claim unless it\n   arises out of the same legal relationship or facts as the claim.\" State Immunity Act of 1978, c. 33, \u00a7 2(6). So, perhaps RAKIA is signaling its willing to execute a fresh waiver of immunity that would cover the claims that Azima brings here (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 23), but then again, it is also entirely possible that RAKIA will withhold consent, leaving Azima with \"no forum in which he can litigate this dispute\" (Pl.'s Opp'n at 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Moreover, even if RAKIA did consent to waiving its state immunity for the purposes of this lawsuit and Azima refiled his claims in the United Kingdom, RAKIA has not demonstrated that the United Kingdom offers an adequate remedy for the injuries Azima has complained of in this case. To be sure, \"a foreign forum is not inadequate merely because it has less favorable substantive law,\"\n   <em>\n    El-Fadl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"693,3691621\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/668/\">\n    75 F.3d at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and RAKIA points to the United Kingdom's Data Protection Act of 1998, 1998, c. 29 (U.K.), and cases decided under that act, in an at tempt to show that some remedy is available for computer breaches under English law (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 38, Def.'s Reply at 23). But the U.K. statute's text makes clear that it only regulates (1) \"data controllers\"-i.e., individuals who \"determine[ ] the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are, or are to be processed[,]\" Data Protection Act of 1998, 1998, c. 29, \u00a7 1(1) (U.K.)-and (2) such individuals must be either \"established in the United Kingdom\" or \"use[ ] equipment in the United Kingdom for processing the data otherwise than for the purposes of transit through the United Kingdom,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"693,3691621\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/668/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5(1). RAKIA is an entity based in the United Arab Emirates, not the United Kingdom, and this Court has no evidence that RAKIA uses equipment for processing personal data in the U.K. Thus, the Data Protection Act appears inapposite to Azima's dispute with RAKIA, and this circumstance also renders the case RAKIA cites,\n   <em>\n    Gulati v. MGN Ltd\n   </em>\n   [2015] EWHC 1482 (Ch), irrelevant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 38.) Without any declarations from U.K. law experts, or any other evidence showing that Azima could sue RAKIA in the United Kingdom for the hacking harm that Azima alleges in this case, RAKIA has not carried its heavy burden of demonstrating that the United Kingdom is a forum that would provide Azima with an adequate remedy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nemariam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9375145,3700742\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/315/390/\">\n    315 F.3d at 394-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the defendant was \"unable to substantiate its claim that [the plaintiff] will receive a remedy\" in the proposed alternative forum);\n   <em>\n    Yueh-Lan Wang v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 35 (arguing that \"the Settlement Agreement between RAKIA and Azima contains a valid forum-selection clause, which represents the parties' agreement as to the most proper forum, and should be given controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).) To hear RAKIA tell it, the parties here previously entered into a binding contract that specifically relegates \"any dispute or claim arising out of, or in connection with [the Settlement Agreement] or its subject matter or formation (including, without limitation, any contractual or non-contractual disputes, claims or obligations)\" (Settlement Agreement at 5-6), and as a result, the instant action must be brought in a U.K. court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Of course, to the extent that RAKIA has failed to establish that the United Kingdom's courts provide an adequate remedy, this argument is irrelevant. But even if RAKIA had shown that the United Kingdom provides an forum for Azima's claims, it is clear to this Court that RAKIA has mischaracterized the parties' Settlement Agreement. By its terms, the forum-selection clause in the March 2016 Settlement Agreement expressly pertains to disputes or claims that arise out of or connect to\n   <em>\n    the Settlement Agreement's\n   </em>\n   \"subject matter or formation\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5), and it is indisputable that the \"subject matter\" of the Settlement Agreement was the then-existing dispute between the parties regarding the HeavyLift joint venture agreement (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (\"Each Party ... wishes to resolve all outstanding issues relating to the [HeavyLift] Joint Venture Agreement.\"). RAKIA cannot credibly maintain that the Settlement Agreement addressed or encompassed any and all new claims that might arise in the future based on actions of the signatories-especially those that do not pertain to the formation, execution, or terms of the Settlement Agreement-such as the allegedly egregious and tortious hacking of Azima's computers and dissemination of his Azima's personal information by RAKIA, much less that the parties intended to mandate that any future claims that arose out of acts that were not known to the parties when the HeavyLift joint venture dispute was settled must be litigated in London.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   RAKIA's suggestion that, because Azima's complaint links the alleged hacking that is the subject of the instant action to RAKIA's commercial activity (including the HeavyLift joint venture) for FSIA purposes then this Court must also view the hacking and the HeavyLift joint venture as connected under the language of the Settlement Agreement (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 37; Def.'s Reply at 20-21) only goes so far. That is, it is clear to this Court that the alleged hacking may well have been undertaken in connection with the HeavyLift joint venture as set forth in Azima's complaint (i.e., it was an act that was partly motivated by the parties' disputes in regard to that venture), and yet Azima's\n   <em>\n    claims\n   </em>\n   alleging that the computer hacking violates the CFAA and D.C. common law do not themselves arise from or connect to the \"subject matter or formation\" of the Settlement Agreement, which is what the parties clearly contemplated when they agreed that claims \"arising out of, or in connection with\" the Settlement Agreement must be filed in London. (Settlement Agreement at 5-6.) Stated simply, it is the subject matter\n   <em>\n    of the Settlement Agreement\n   </em>\n   that governs the scope and extent of the parties' forum-selection clause, and RAKIA does not, and cannot, maintain that the hacking conduct of which Azima complains here was addressed in, or was a reasonably foreseeable result of, that agreement, such that the forum-selection clause governs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Without the support of the settlement agreement, RAKIA's\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   motion depends solely on this Court finding that the balance of public and private interests weigh in favor of a London forum, and then dismissing this lawsuit conditioned upon the lawsuit being litigated in that jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MBI Grp., Inc. v. Credit Foncier du Cameroun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660442\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/558/21/#p31\">\n    558 F.Supp.2d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31-32 (D.D.C. 2008) (conditioning dismissal on defendants' submission to Cameroonian jurisdiction). And such an analysis is unnecessary here, because RAKIA has failed to demonstrate the availability of an adequate alternative forum, as explained above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    El-Fadl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"693,3691621\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/668/\">\n    75 F.3d at 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Only if there is an adequate alternative forum must the court then weigh the relative conveniences to the parties against the presumption of the plaintiff's forum selection.\"). But even if the\n   Court was to proceed to the balancing stage, it would find that RAKIA has not demonstrated that the balance of public and private factors ha s \"a strong tilt towards a particular forum[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274550\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/52/#p74\">\n    246 F.Supp.3d at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citation omitted), because RAKIA's primary argument in this regard relies upon the inapposite forum-selection clause that appears in the March 2016 Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For the reasons explained above, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Azima's claims under the commercial activity exception of the FSIA, and RAKIA's\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   argument fails.
