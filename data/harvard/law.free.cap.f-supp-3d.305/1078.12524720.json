Now pending before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"). (Dkt. No. 38.) Having carefully reviewed the parties' briefing and having had the benefit of oral argument on January 11, 2018, the Court GRANTS Defendants' motion with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Lyft App\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Lyft provides technology that operates similar to a taxi company's dispatch system.\" (Dkt. No. 34 \u00b6 3.) \"A rider requests a ride using a software application on his or her phone (the 'Lyft App').\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After a rider logs on to the Lyft App, the App sends a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (\"HTTP\") request to Lyft's servers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) The HTTP request contains the passenger's Lyft ID and GPS coordinates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) Lyft's servers respond to the Lyft App's request with a list of nearby drivers who are logged in and who have affirmatively indicated they are available for work; the list includes the drivers' Lyft IDs and GPS coordinates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) The list is transmitted to riders through Lyft's servers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"The locations of nearby Lyft drivers are displayed to the rider as dots on a map, along with the estimated price and wait time for arrival once the ride request is submitted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Drivers also use the Lyft App.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) \"When a driver is ready to accept work, the driver swipes a switch on the Lyft App, directing the Lyft App to continuously transmit the driver's geolocation data and his or her willingness to accept work to servers maintained by Lyft.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lyft drivers used the Lyft App to communicate with Lyft servers by transmitting and receiving \"packets\" of information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) \"A packet is analogous to a physical letter mailed from one address to the other, and the protocol used to transmit the packet is analogous to the physical envelope that holds the letter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"While traditional envelopes use physical postal addresses, packets use computer Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.) The digital letter transmitted from the driver to Lyft's servers in response to a rider's HTTP request includes (1) the driver's\n   unique identifier, (2) the driver's precise geolocation data, (3) the driver's affirmation that the driver is available to provide rides for Lyft users, and (4) an estimated price for the rider's requested ride. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) Lyft, acting as the driver's agent, forwards a driver's geolocation and willingness to drive to those requesting a ride. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Uber's Hell Spyware\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Uber offers technology that competes with the Lyft App and operates in the same geographic regions as Lyft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6.) Some drivers perform transport services through the two platforms simultaneously. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.) Lyft's and Uber's systems store the location of every driver, whether on duty or off duty, every few seconds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87, 88.) \"[N]either Uber nor Lyft ever delete the geolocation data they collect from drivers, at least in part because they consider it valuable to their respective businesses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Starting in 2014 or earlier and continuing into 2016, Uber secretly used 'Hell spyware' to access servers and smartphones owned and operated by Plaintiff, Class Members, and Lyft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) The \"spyware extracted information from Lyft by posing as Lyft customers in search of rides.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) These fake Lyft riders sent forged requests to Lyft's servers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When Lyft's servers received \"a request from a forged rider account, they believed that the ride requests were coming from actual Lyft riders, not the Hell spyware.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.) As a result, Lyft's servers transmitted a response to Uber's fake Lyft requesters containing the IDs, on duty status, pricing, and exact locations of nearby Lyft drivers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"The data transmitted was provided by Lyft drivers and was only intended to be delivered to actual nearby Lyft riders.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Uber used the fraudulently received geolocation data and driver identifiers \"to create grid-like detection nets over cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) For instance, a forged rider account would transmit a request indicating that the rider was at the Philip Burton Federal Building with specific GPS coordinates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Lyft's servers \"would transmit back information for all nearby Lyft drivers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Hell spyware would simultaneously also send another set of requests indicating that a different fake Lyft rider was a few blocks north on O'Farrell Street with specific geolocation data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This process was repeated with a large number of fake Lyft accounts, \"allowing Uber to obtain complete geographic coverage of entire metropolitan areas, and the exact locations of all Lyft drivers and other information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Uber repeated this process millions of times using the Hell spyware from 2014 through 2016.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Uber used the data collected in conjunction with other databases \"to learn personal details about Lyft drivers including, but not limited to, the drivers' full names, their home addresses, when and where they typically work each day and for how many hours, and where they take breaks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) \"Uber was able to use this data to determine the identities of the drivers' rider customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Uber combined the data harvested by Hell [spyware] with Uber's internal records, including historical location data, to identify Lyft drivers who also worked for Uber.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) \"Uber used the information gleaned from Hell to direct more frequent and more profitable trips to Uber drivers who also used the Lyft App.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.) \"By inundating these drivers [with] Uber rides, Uber was able to discourage drivers from accepting work on the Lyft platform, reducing the effective supply of available Lyft drivers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.) \"With the supply of Lyft drivers reduced, Lyft\n   customers faced longer wait times.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.) As a result, Lyft riders would cancel the ride requested with Lyft and request a new ride from Uber, and Lyft drivers experienced decreased earnings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 102.) \"Over time, this would reduce the effectiveness of the Lyft App, thus harming drivers such as Plaintiff and absent Class Members.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff filed an initial complaint seeking injunctive relief and damages based on four claims: (1) Federal Wiretap Act as amended by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (the \"ECPA\"), (2) the California Invasion of Privacy Act (\"CIPA\"), (3) the California Unfair Competition Law (the \"UCL\"), and (4) common law invasion of privacy. (Dkt. No. 1.) Defendants moved to dismiss all four claims. (Dkt. No. 17.) The Court granted Defendants' motion with leave to amend. (Dkt.

(Dkt. No. 34.) Thereafter, Defendants filed the now pending motion to dismiss. (Dkt.

(FAC \u00b6 72.) With the possible exception of the estimated price, this information does not qualify as the \"contents\" of a communication within the meaning of the Wiretap Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Act defines \"contents\" as \"includ[ing] any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202510\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8). \" '[C]ontents' refers to the intended message conveyed by the communication, and does not include record information regarding the characteristics of the message that is generated in the course of the communication.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Zynga Privacy Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066736,4067662\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/1098/\">\n    750 F.3d 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1106 (9th Cir. 2014).

For example, data about a telephone call, including the number from which it was made, the time it was made, the number called, and the length of the call does not fall within the Wiretap Act because it is not the content of the communication, it is data about the communication.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Similarly, an individual's Facebook ID and the url of the webpage the individual was viewing are not the contents of a communication when that information is automatically generated when the individual clicks an app or game icon.\n   <em>\n    In re Zynga Privacy Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066736,4067662\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/1098/\">\n    750 F.3d at 1107-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It follows, then, that Plaintiff's IP address and unique\n   Lyft driver ID are not the contents of a communication within the meaning of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff's geolocation data is also record information rather than the content of a communication; the data is automatically generated when Plaintiff activates the Lyft App. (FAC \u00b6 4.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re iPhone Application Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3779536\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/844/1040/#p1061\">\n    844 F.Supp.2d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1061 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (\"the allegedly intercepted electronic communications are simply users' geolocation data.

Microsoft Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324886\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/992/1116/#p1127\">\n    992 F.Supp.2d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1127 (W.D. Wash. 2012) (\"contents\" as used in the Wiretap Act is not broad enough to encompass geolocation data). While a text message stating \"I am at 6th and Broadway\" would constitute content, the automatic generation of geolocation data is record information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff insists that the geolocation data is content because Uber used it to \"(1) locate drivers, (2) identify drivers who also drove for Uber, (3) identify which drivers were available for new rides, (4) track prices that Lyft would offer for trips, and (5) identify how many cars were available to pick up riders at a particular location.\" (Dkt. No. 41 at 27.) Assuming as the Court must that these allegations are true, none of that information involves a communication from the Lyft driver, let alone the content of such a communication. Further, nothing in the Wiretap Act suggests that\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   an intercepting party uses a communication determines whether the communication involves \"content\" within the Act's meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The \"content\" analysis may be different as to pricing information; however, there are no allegations in the FAC that suggest that Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   to communicate pricing information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zynga Privacy Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066736,4067662\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/1098/\">\n    750 F.3d at 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress intended the word 'contents' to mean a person's intended message to another\"). Pricing is discussed twice: paragraphs 3 and 72. Paragraph 72 states: \"Lyft drivers who are ready to work send digital letters to Lyft. Each letter has a number of components that are directly analogous to a physical letter\" including \"an estimated price for the ride.\" Simply because Plaintiff sends a \"letter\" to Lyft that includes an estimated price does not mean the Lyft driver\n   <em>\n    intends\n   </em>\n   to communicate that price. There are no allegations that the Lyft driver had the ability to set the price of a Lyft ride or how price is determined or even whether the Lyft driver is aware of the price communicated to Lyft's servers. Indeed, paragraph 3 supports an inference that Lyft sets the price or that it is automatically generated by the Lyft App. When a Lyft rider opens the App, \"[t]he locations of nearby Lyft drivers are displayed to the rider as dots on a map.\" (FAC \u00b6 3.) In other words, the Lyft rider first sees the cars in her area that are willing to provide rides. Then, after the Lyft rider submits her request, she can see \"the estimated price and wait time for arrival.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, the FAC does not allege that the driver intended to communicate an estimated price. Thus, it is not the content of a communication by Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At oral argument Plaintiff also argued that the content of the driver's message is \"the fact they're available to work.\" (Dkt. No. 48 at 7:5-7.) In other words, Plaintiff contends that it can be inferred from the driver's toggling on of the App that the driver is available to work. That is one inference that can be drawn; another is\n   that the driver toggled on whether he wants to work or not. The only communication, then, is that the driver toggled on-a communication more akin to record information than content. In\n   <em>\n    In re Zynga\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Ninth Circuit distinguished between the address of a Facebook webpage a user is viewing and a Google search URL that not only shows that a user is using the search engine but also the specific\n   <em>\n    search terms\n   </em>\n   the user communicated to Google.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066736,4067662\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/1098/\">\n    750 F.3d at 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Under some circumstances a user's request to a search engine for specific information could constitute a communication such that divulging a URL containing that search term to a third party could amount to disclosure of the contents of a communication. But the referer header information at issue here includes only basic identification and address information, not a search term or similar communication made by the user, and therefore does not constitute the contents of a communication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066736,4067662\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/1098/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under Plaintiff's interpretation of \"content,\" the information as to the webpage the user was viewing is \"content\" because it could be inferred that the user was communicating he wanted to view that webpage, just as, according to Plaintiff, from the act of toggling on it can be inferred that driver is available to accept rides. But\n   <em>\n    In re Zynga\n   </em>\n   rejects such a broad reading of content. In other words, simply opening a webpage or mobile application is not a communication with content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to satisfy the \"contents\" prong of the Wiretap Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Intercept\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff also does not allege facts that plausibly suggest that Uber \"intercepted\" any of\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   communications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202520\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (any person whose wire, oral or electronic communications were intercepted may bring a civil action). The Wiretap Act defines \"intercept\" as the \"aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2510(4). The term \"acquisition\" is not defined in the statute, but the Ninth Circuit, looking at the term's \"ordinary meaning,\" has defined it as the \"act of acquiring, or coming into possession of.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Further, to be \"intercepted\" it must have been \"acquired during transmission, not while it is in electronic storage.\"\n   <em>\n    Konop v.

A narrow definition of \"intercept\" which requires acquisition contemporaneous with transmission is most \"consistent with the ordinary meaning of 'intercept,' which is 'to stop, seize, or interrupt in progress or course before arrival.' \"\n   <em>\n    Konop,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11439752\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/302/868/#p878\">\n    302 F.3d at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, the FAC does not allege that Uber intercepted a communication from Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges that his driver ID and geolocation information were sent to Lyft's servers. (FAC \u00b6 56.) Lyft then took the information it received from Plaintiff and other nearby drivers and sent it to Uber (pretending to be an actual Lyft customer). (FAC \u00b6 67.) Thus, the communication Uber acquired is a communication from Lyft and not Plaintiff and therefore Lyft did not intercept Plaintiff's communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff's new \"sniffer\" allegations do not change the outcome.

Here, unlike\n   <em>\n    Szymuszkiewicz\n   </em>\n   , there were no messages between existing Lyft drivers and Lyft riders that were copied contemporaneously by Uber; instead, as alleged, the acquired messages traveled directly and only between Lyft and Uber acting as a Lyft rider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged an \"interception\" under the Wiretap Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In light of Plaintiff's failure to plausibly plead that Uber intercepted the content of a communication from Plaintiff, the Court declines to consider Uber's other arguments.

The Court is unpersuaded that at this stage of the litigation Plaintiff cannot pursue equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   For the reasons described above Uber's motion to dismiss is GRANTED as to all claims except the UCL claim. Plaintiff is granted leave to file an amended complaint as to all claims except the CIPA section 637.7 claim as amendment as to that claim would be futile. Plaintiff is not given leave to add any new claims; leave is only to correct, if possible, deficiencies in the allegations of the claims already pled. The second amended complaint shall be by May 18, 2018. Uber's request for judicial notice of Lyft's terms of service is GRANTED given the document is referenced in the FAC and its accuracy is not reasonably questioned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2). Plaintiff's request for judicial notice is DENIED given the Jacobs letter from the\n   <em>\n    Waymo\n   </em>\n   litigation is not discussed in the FAC nor relevant to this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   This Order disposes of Docket No. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
