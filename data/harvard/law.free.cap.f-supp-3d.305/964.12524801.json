Third, an implied certification of compliance is fraud under the FCA where, \"first, the claim does not merely request payment, but also makes specific representations about the goods or services provided; and second, the defendant's failure to disclose noncompliance with material statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirements makes those representations misleading half-truths.\"\n    <em>\n     Univ'l Health Servs., Inc. v.

The first is that Hospital radiologists would perform, and bill the government for, two full diagnostic scans on oncology patients, though the second scan was \"improper and unnecessary.\" SAC \u00b6 23. The second is that the Hospital paid for, and presumably billed the government for, \"fiducial markers\" implanted by contractor urologists, a kind of kickback to the urologists.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 49.

The fifth is that radiation therapy was performed without direct supervision by a physician, contrary to federal rules.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 56.

Kietzman has not pleaded with particularity a single actionable express or implied certification made by the Hospital. The \"general statement\" about certifying compliance with the whole body of applicable federal regulations contained in paragraph 20 of the second amended complaint \"is not sufficient to satisfy Rule 8, let alone Rule 9(b).\"\n    <em>\n     United States ex rel.

In short, there is no allegation at all that the Hospital\n    <em>\n     concealed\n    </em>\n    what it was doing (for example, by use of false or misleading billing codes) from the government. Apparently, the Hospital would simply send Medicare two bills for two radiological scans for the same patient within two weeks, and the government would pay them. Kietzman may quibble with the government's payment decisions as being an unwise use of taxpayer funds, but she has nowhere alleged the fraudulent procurement of such funds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    These same flaws are not cured with respect to any other of Kietzman's allegations of impropriety. She alleges repeatedly that federal regulations were violated at the Hospital, and that the government would not have paid out claims for treatment where such violations had occurred at some stage of the treatment process, but nowhere alleges how, or even whether, the Hospital concealed or falsely represented what it was doing to the government. Accordingly, Kietzman's complaint fails to state a claim for actionable fraud under the FCA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <em>\n     B.

Kietzman either alleges baldly that a certain alleged act of noncompliance was \"material,\" or, restating the concept, that the government \"would not have paid\" had it known of the Hospital's alleged noncompliance.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    SAC \u00b6\u00b6 25, 35, 49, 50, 52, 73, 77, 78, 83.

Further raising such inference is the temporal proximity between Kietzman's September 15, 2015, e-mail on the Hospital's billing policy with respect to the radiological scans, and her October 5, 2015, firing. Finally, drawing (as we must) all reasonable inferences in Kietzman's favor, Dozier's reaction to Kietzman's September 15, 2015, e-mail (which merely communicated what Kietzman, relying on Dozier's own prior statements, understood to be an accurate statement of the Hospital's billing practice), was suspiciously overreactive.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 58 (\"Why would you copy all these people on this question?
