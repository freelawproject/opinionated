Presently before the Court are (1) defendant's motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and (2) defendant's motion to preclude evidence submitted in opposition to summary judgment which plaintiff failed to produce in discovery. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants defendant's motion for summary judgment with respect to ADEA claim, and declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the New York Labor Law claim. Because the Court grants defendant's motion for summary judgment as to the federal claim and declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim, defendant's motion to preclude evidence is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court takes the facts set forth below from the parties' depositions, affidavits, and exhibits, and from the parties' respective Rule 56.1 Statements of Facts. Upon consideration of a motion for summary judgment, the Court shall construe the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capobianco v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8927814\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/47/\">\n    422 F.3d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50 n.1 (2d Cir. 2005). Unless otherwise noted, where a party's 56.1 Statement is cited, that fact is undisputed or the opposing party has pointed to no evidence in the record to contradict it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Plaintiff's Hiring as Regional Sales Manager of Carefusion's Northeast Region\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From 2006 to 2009, plaintiff worked as a Regional Sales Manager at Cardinal Health, a predecessor company of CareFusion. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In or about November 2009, plaintiff was laid off from his position at Cardinal Health. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) In January 2013, while employed by Teleflex, a medical device company, Matthew Stuckert (\"Stuckert\"), Area Vice President of Sales at CareFusion, reached out to plaintiff regarding an available position as a Regional Sales Manager at CareFusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17.) Plaintiff interviewed with Stuckert, his direct manager, Scott Boucher (\"Boucher\"), and Boucher's manager, James Paloyan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) During his interview, plaintiff was informed that the position would be similar to his prior position with Cardinal Health: plaintiff would oversee a team of sales representatives selling vascular and surgical products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Plaintiff accepted an offer of employment as Regional Sales Manager-Surgical/Vascular and commenced employment on or about February 11, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26.) Plaintiff was fifty-two years of age at the time he was hired, and his base salary was $120,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) Throughout his employment at CareFusion, plaintiff reported directly to Stuckert. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) According to plaintiff's deposition testimony, he believed that Stuckert was in his early forties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aranyos Declaration (\"Aranyos Decl.\") Ex. C, Deposition of Stephen Testa (\"Testa Dep.\") at 255.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   2. Plaintiff's Job Performance and Termination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The articulated basis for plaintiff's termination was his alleged poor job performance over the course of his time at CareFusion. The following evidence is contained in the record concerning plaintiff's performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In July 2013, CareFusion's surgical and vascular sales teams were restructured into two separate groups. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 37.) Plaintiff assumed the responsibilities of Vascular Sales, Northeast Region. His duties and responsibilities comported with his job expectations, but now he was only responsible for vascular sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-41; Testa Dep. at 112.) Plaintiff claims that his job became more analytical after the restructuring, and he concedes that he was not good at that part of the job. (Testa Dep. at 126-28, 231-32.) The restructuring affected every sales employee in Surgical and Vascular at CareFusion, not just Testa. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 38.) As a result of the restructuring, Stuckert's supervisor became Ronald Vavala (\"Vavala\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Vavala was forty-nine years of age. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As Regional Sales Manager, plaintiff had primary responsibility for a sales team to develop and execute a sales strategy and to reach or exceed target sales goals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) To that end, plaintiff needed to monitor each sales representative to ensure that he or she was meeting quota and that each sales representative's issues were addressed efficiently through regularly scheduled sales calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff was required to provide Stuckert, his supervisor, with notes from sales calls with his representatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) His position also required that he review and update CareFusion's sales tracking system and ensure that his team provided complete updates, and that he go into the field to assist sales representatives with client issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Plaintiff was also responsible for contract renewals and contract compliance as it related to Premier contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) This involved reviewing contracts for compliance, proactively contacting customers, advising customers of their deficiencies, and resolving issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On or about August 26, 2013, Stuckert provided plaintiff with a written and verbal performance evaluation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 63.) Though plaintiff received a score of \"3-On Target\" on a scale from 1 through 5, he was counseled by Stuckert for his failure to keep him apprised of the status of his territory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.) Stuckert also expressed his concern about how plaintiff was using and managing his time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Plaintiff failed to provide Stuckert with notes from sales calls with his sales representatives, as he admittedly failed to hold regular sales calls with his team. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61, 64.) To assist plaintiff in meeting his job expectations, Stuckert instructed plaintiff to utilize Outlook for calendaring his sales calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At plaintiff's deposition, he asserted that in August 2013, around the time of his evaluation, Stuckert stated, \"you know, the job is changing\" and \"a person from your era wouldn't have the type of analytical skills that we require.\" (Testa Dep. at 251-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff testified that he understood this comment to relate to his lack of computer-based skills. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 253.) He admitted that he knew he was not good at that part of his job, and had expressed to Stuckert that he wanted to become better at his job and that he was willing to learn. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 231-32, 252.) Although plaintiff alleges that no training was offered for the analytical part of his job (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 232-33), defendant maintains that it offered online training modules and held conferences with training programs, including one that required plaintiff's attendance in September 2013 (Def's. 56.1 \u00b6 48). In that same conversation with plaintiff, Stuckert allegedly stated, \"things are different today,\" \"the skills needed today are typically of a younger sales manager.\" (Testa Dep. at 261.) Plaintiff testified that he believed Stuckert was referring to how the job had changed since plaintiff had previously worked for CareFusion's predecessor-that is, how the job had become more analytical. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant denies that Stuckert made these statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def.'s Reply Mem. at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Despite Stuckert's efforts, plaintiff's performance failed to improve. Stuckert received calls from members of plaintiff's sales team inquiring about plaintiff's whereabouts and informing him that plaintiff continuously failed to hold regular sales calls. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.) In October 2013, CareFusion's Human Resources Director, Danielle Strazzo (\"Strazzo\"), held a conference call with plaintiff's sales team to evaluate the effectiveness of plaintiff's managerial skills. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) The team indicated that plaintiff needed to be more involved, hold more consistent team calls, and schedule more field visits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) On October 11, 2013, Strazzo provided plaintiff with a summary of his team's feedback and instructed him to email, to his team, his commitments as their leader. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Strazzo reminded plaintiff to contact his team on October 18, 2013, plaintiff reached out to his team members via email on October 21. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.) In his email, plaintiff agreed to be more involved in the field, have more team calls and communications, meet with team members in person, and help the team become more proficient in utilizing SFDC to track and monitor sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On or about October 28, 2013, Stuckert contacted Employee Relations to express concerns about plaintiff's job performance and seek advice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.) As a result, Stuckert prepared a Performance Improvement Memorandum (\"PIM\") for plaintiff, outlining deficiencies in his performance and Stuckert's expectations going forward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-84.) The PIM was reviewed by Human Resources and Vavala prior to its submission to plaintiff on November 8, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.) The PIM addressed Stuckert's specific concerns about plaintiff, including: his failure to hold regularly scheduled team conference calls, his failure to effectively use Outlook as a primary scheduling tool, his failure to update the software system completely and accurately, his failure to schedule regular\n   sales calls, and his failure to engage in key CareFusion priorities, including renewing any of his thirty-eight Premier contracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88-89 90-91, 94.) The PIM also required that plaintiff spend three days a week in the field with sales representatives and customers, complete his thirty-eight Premier targets by January 1, 2014, schedule regular team and sales calls in Outlook, copy Stuckert on all notes from team calls he conducted, and submit weekly advisory reports. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.) The PIM also stated that \"[f]ailure to meet these expectations could lead to more serious action steps up to and including termination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.) At the time he received the PIM, plaintiff acknowledged his deficiencies and conceded that he did not have the analytical skills needed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff acknowledges that Stuckert continuously followed up with him each week following the issuance of the PIM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-100.) However, plaintiff admittedly continued to struggle and his performance deteriorated as he provided late and incomplete sales updates, missed deadlines, and failed to spend time in the field with his sales representatives or provide weekly reports to Stuckert. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-04.) Stuckert also failed to renew any Premier contracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) Because of plaintiff's deficiencies, Stuckert was required to spend time completing plaintiff's assignments and assigning work to other team members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) In December 2013, both Vavala and Stuckert spoke with plaintiff about his continued poor performance, failure to move forward on any Premier contracts, and his inability to successfully complete the PIM by January. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.) As a result of his failures, on December 13, 2013, ten months after hiring plaintiff, Stuckert, with Vavala's approval, terminated plaintiff's employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.) At the time of plaintiff's termination, he was fifty-three years old. (Am. Compl. at 1.) A member of plaintiff's sales team, Tina Vogt (\"Vogt\"), replaced plaintiff as Regional Sales Manager on or about January 6, 2014. (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 110.) Vogt was forty-one years of age when she was promoted, and was provided a salary of $105,597.95. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110; Pl.'s Mem. at 24.) Plaintiff testified that he believes CareFusion terminated his employment not only because of his age but, in part, to save money, as he was hired from outside the company and his salary was \"in the upper part of what people were making for that position.\" (Testa Dep. at 255-57.) CareFusion paid plaintiff his final wages and commission payment on December 20, 2013 (Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6 112), though plaintiff alleges that he is still owed commission payments (Am. Compl. at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B. Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff filed his Amended Complaint on August 10, 2015. Defendant moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim on October 9, 2015. On August 2, 2016, this Court denied in part and granted in part defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiff's Amended Complaint. Specifically, this Court found that plaintiff had plausibly pled claims for violations of the ADEA and Labor Law \u00a7 191(3), but failed to sufficiently allege a claim for violation of Labor Law \u00a7 191(1)(c). Plaintiff was permitted to replead the \u00a7 191(1)(c) claim, but did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 2, 2017, defendant moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims. Plaintiff opposed the motion on October 31, 2017, and defendant replied on November 16, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On December 5, 2017, defendant filed a motion to preclude new evidence submitted by plaintiff in support of his opposition to summary judgment that was not produced\n   during discovery. Plaintiff opposed the motion on December 5, 2017, and defendant replied on December 27, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court has fully considered the parties' submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To prevail on summary judgment, the moving party must \"show[ ] that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).

Application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant argues that plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case of age discrimination in connection with his termination because, based upon his own admissions, and as evidenced in plaintiff's performance evaluations, he was not performing in his position satisfactorily. (Def.'s Mem. at 12-21.) Defendant thus argues that plaintiff was not terminated under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   As set forth below, defendant has demonstrated that it is entitled to summary judgment as to plaintiff's ADEA claim because no reasonable jury could find age discrimination even construing the facts most favorably to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the purpose of this motion, the Court assumes that plaintiff has satisfied the minimal burden required by\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   to make out a prima facie case of age discrimination. In response, defendant has established a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his dismissal, namely, plaintiff's failure to perform his job adequately during his time at CareFusion. Hence, the Court proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find age discrimination by examining each party's evidence individually and then proceeding to evaluate the evidence as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stern v.

Thus, the Court first evaluates the plaintiff's evidence, then the defendant's evidence, and, finally, the evidence as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   a. Plaintiff's Evidence of Age Discrimination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff submits the following as evidence of defendant's discrimination based on his age:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, plaintiff was fifty-three years of age when he was fired. Second, plaintiff was replaced by a forty-one-year-old individual who made significantly less money than him. Third, plaintiff alleges that his supervisor commented about his inability to perform the analytical part of his job in relation to plaintiff being from a different \"era\" and how \"things are different today.\" (Testa Dep. at 251-52, 261.) Finally, plaintiff argues that the reason defendant gives for his termination, namely, his poor job performance, is a mere pretext for age discrimination-that he performed his job\n   satisfactorily and requested help and training that was not provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   b. Defendant's Evidence of Non-Discriminatory Animus\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant submits the following undisputed facts as evidence of nondiscriminatory animus:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, there is uncontroverted evidence that plaintiff was having trouble performing his job for the entire ten-month period he worked at CareFusion prior to his termination. The record reflects that plaintiff's job performance was suffering and that plaintiff acknowledged that he wanted to do better. Second, the alleged statement made by Stuckert to plaintiff was a stray remark made four months before his termination. Third, CareFusion affirmatively sought plaintiff out, and hired him at the age of fifty-two, when he was already a member of the protected class. Fourth, both Stuckert and Vavala, the decision-makers with regard to plaintiff's termination, were in their forties, and thus members of the same protected class as plaintiff. Finally, plaintiff's replacement was forty-one years of age, and therefore in the same protected class as plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   c. Evidence as a Whole\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Considering the evidence as a whole, the Court concludes that no reasonable jury could find that plaintiff was fired based on his age. Indeed, the undisputed evidence indicates that plaintiff had performance issues for the entirety of his employment at CareFusion. Further, defendant advised plaintiff of these performance issues through its formal review process, and again following a conference call with plaintiff's sales team members, and, finally, through the issuance of a PIM. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   115-21, 156-74, 194-212.) There is also uncontroverted evidence that, even after the issuance of the PIM, plaintiff continued to mismanage his sales team and territory and failed to meet the objectives set forth therein. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 224-27.) Plaintiff even admitted that he struggled with the requirements of his position and was not performing satisfactorily. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 231-32, 237 (\"Q. Isn't it fair to say also that you didn't like the analytical parts of the job? A. Not-not necessarily that I didn't like it, I could have been better at it. Q. Well, you knew that you weren't good at it; right? A. True. Q. You were struggling in certain respects in your position at that time; right? A. I'll answer the question yes.\").) He also failed to renew any of the thirty-eight Premier accounts for which he was responsible and, despite PIM requirements, continuously failed to spend time in the field with his sales representatives or provide weekly reports to his supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 216-27; Def.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 100-05.) Thus, based upon the uncontroverted evidence, a rational jury could draw only one conclusion: plaintiff was terminated due to his poor performance; not his age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff contends that he has \"superior management skills for the medical device field.\" (Pl.'s Mem. at 5.) However, plaintiff merely points to his own subjective belief that he was good at his job, and a single witness statement made by a former CareFusion sales representative about his performance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-24.) An employee's subjective disagreement with his manager's evaluation of his performance is not a viable basis for a discrimination claim.\n   <em>\n    Valentine v.

Such beliefs cannot preclude summary judgement for \" 'it is the perception of the decision-maker, and not that of plaintiff, which is relevant.'

The undisputed evidence supports defendant's claims that plaintiff's performance was lacking.
