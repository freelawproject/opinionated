In response, Ally concedes that the Court does not have original jurisdiction over the Counterclaim, but contends that the Court does have supplemental jurisdiction and may not decline to exercise it.

Ammons argues that the evidence relevant to her TCPA claim is separate and distinct from the evidence that bears upon Ally's fraudulent inducement Counterclaim. The success of the TCPA claim, Ammons argues, does not depend upon whether Ammons fraudulently induced Ally to enter a contract with Ammons. Rather, regardless of whether Ammons fraudulently induced Ally, Ammons will prevail on the TCPA claim if she shows that Ally violated the statutory provisions of the TCPA. Similarly, Ammons contends that Ally's state law Counterclaim can be resolved without any consideration of whether Ally violated the TCPA-i.e., that the determination of whether Ammons fraudulently induced Ally in no way depends upon whether Ally violated the TCPA in attempting to collect on that debt. Ally essentially argues that the Court has supplemental jurisdiction over its Counterclaim because the allegedly illegal phone calls that form the basis for Ammons's TCPA claim arose from Ammons's contractual relationship with Ally under agreements that form the basis of Ally's state law Counterclaim. In other words, Ally maintains that the \"context\" of the Complaint necessarily involves the same debt as the Counterclaim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 80 at 3-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Former District Judge Todd J. Campbell considered a similar question in\n   <em>\n    Ramsey v. Gen. Motors Fin. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3-15-cv-0827,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206396000\">\n    2015 WL 6396000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Tenn. Oct. 22, 2015). In\n   <em>\n    Ramsey\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff also sued for alleged violations of the TCPA, and the defendant filed a counterclaim alleging that the plaintiff breached her contractual obligations under a sales agreement she entered into with the defendant by failing to make payments when due.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *1. Just as here, the defendant sought the deficiency balance purportedly owed on an underlying retail credit agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Judge Campbell held that the defendant's counterclaim did not arise from the same case or controversy as the plaintiff's TCPA claim.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *2. He explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Although Plaintiff's claim, from a broad perspective, arose from the underlying debt upon which Defendant sues, a closer look reveals that the operative facts from which Plaintiff's federal claim arose are separate and different from the operative facts from which Defendant's state law claim arose. The proof needed to establish Defendant's violation of the TCPA (e.g., calls made, without express consent, with an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice) is different from the\n   proof needed to establish Plaintiff's breach of the [c]ontract (e.g., existence of a valid contract, default, damages).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, Judge Campbell relied upon\n   <em>\n    Salei v.

Mich. 1996), which reached the same conclusion in a slightly different context. In\n   <em>\n    Salei\n   </em>\n   , the court held that, although the entire relationship between the parties consisted of the defendant's attempts to collect on the plaintiff's debt, the state and federal claims did not share the same \"operative\" facts.\n   <em>\n    Salei\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7814459\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/913/993/#p999\">\n    913 F.Supp. at 998-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More specifically, the Court held that the evidence relevant to the plaintiff's Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\") claim was completely separate and distinct from the evidence relevant to the plaintiff's state law claim for breach of a settlement agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7814459\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/913/993/#p999\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7814459\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/913/993/#p999\">\n    . at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]rrespective of whether the settlement agreement was breached, [p]laintiff will prevail in his federal claim only if he can prove his allegation that [d]efendant obtained a credit report for an impermissible purpose....

As in\n   <em>\n    Salei\n   </em>\n   , Judge Campbell found that two separate factual inquiries were required to litigate the federal versus the state claims in\n   <em>\n    Ramsey\n   </em>\n   so the defendant's state law counterclaim did not arise out of the same case or controversy or the same operative facts as the plaintiff's federal TCPA claim.\n   <em>\n    Ramsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206396000\">\n    2015 WL 6396000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2.

To be clear, under the TCPA, Ammons must adduce evidence to prove (1) that Ally called Ammons using an automatic telephone dialing system (including a predictive dialer) or artificial or pre-recorded voice, (2) that the calls were placed to Ammons's cellular telephone, (3) that the calls were not made for \"emergency purposes,\" and (4) that the calls were made without Ammons's prior express consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii).

Specifically, under Tennessee law, Ally must adduce evidence to prove (1) the existence of a false statement concerning a fact material to the transaction; (2) knowledge of the statement's falsity or utter disregard for its truth; (3) intent to induce reliance on the statement; (4) reliance under circumstances manifesting a reasonable right to rely on the statements, and; (5) an injury resulting from the reliance.\n   <em>\n    Lamb v.

The Court acknowledges that there are some out-of-circuit district court cases that hold, especially in the context of the FDCPA, that claims and counterclaims for underlying debt do share a common nucleus of facts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Graf\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20632180\">\n     2015 WL 632180\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5 (collecting cases).

With all due respect, the Court is more persuaded by logic of the authority discussed herein. As for\n    <em>\n     Edwards\n    </em>\n    , it lacks serious analysis and contains only a conclusory statement that \"[t]he common factual connection between the claims is the underlying debt and the numerous phone calls placed by [the defendant].\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at *4. The Court finds that\n    <em>\n     Edwards\n    </em>\n    does not control here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    There is little practical difference between what Ally has labeled a \"fraudulent inducement\" Counterclaim and the Counterclaim for \"breach of contract\" in\n    <em>\n     Ramsey\n    </em>\n    (and other cases) or claim for \"breach of settlement agreement\" in\n    <em>\n     Salei\n    </em>\n    . First, at times Ally's Counterclaim actually reads more like a breach of contract claim. Second, the causes of action are simply two different ways under state law to redress a perceived slight relative to a contractual agreement for a small purchase. Finally, both fraudulent inducement and breach of contract have clearly identifiable evidentiary requirements under state law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The amount of Ammons's underlying debt (less than $20,000) may be small compared to the amount of damages she seeks under the TCPA ($1,500 for willful violations of the TCPA, with over 500 alleged unlawful telephone calls), but, as stated by the court in\n    <em>\n     Graf\n    </em>\n    (in the context of an FDCPA action):\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    [W]hether the amount owed on an underlying debt is significant enough to deter a potential ... plaintiff if [her] debt collector is permitted to assert a claim for the debt, or so \"small\" that a plaintiff will move forward with his ... action regardless of whether it will provide a federal forum for his debt collector is entirely subjective. Exercising jurisdiction over [the defendant's] counterclaims on the ground that the amount of the alleged underlying debt is minimal in the eyes of [the defendant], or the Court for that matter, plainly undermines the remedial purpose of the FDCPA and its goal of \"protect[ing] individuals from unfair debt collection practices regardless of whether the individual actually owes a debt.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20632180\">\n     2015 WL 632180\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6 (citations omitted).
