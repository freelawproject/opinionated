History of the '725 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Wright's Well Control Services, LLC (WWCS) and defendant Oceaneering International, Inc. (Oceaneering) both provide hydrate remediation services for the oil and gas industry. A hydrate is an ice-like solid that forms when water becomes mixed with oil and/or gas at high pressure and low temperature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hydrates can cause a pipeline to become blocked by \"hydrate plugs,\" resulting in a loss of production.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   WWCS alleges that in 2008, Oceaneering tried and failed to remove hydrates from a pipeline for ATP Oil and Gas Corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ATP then asked WWCS to review Oceaneering's work, prompting WWCS to spend 18 months researching, testing, and developing a new system for preventing and removing hydrates in deepwater environments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to WWCS, its remediation system successfully cleared hydrates from ATP's pipeline by overcoming many of the design challenges that plagued earlier systems.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   WWCS's hydrate remediation system utilizes a pump to reduce the pressure in the pipeline. By reducing this pressure, WWCS's system can cause solid hydrate plugs to dissociate,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , melt, into liquid and gas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   But if too much gas enters the system, the gas could reduce the pumping ability of the pump or even cause the pump to implode.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The separator described in the '725 Patent solves this problem by separating gas from liquid and discharging the gas to the surface.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '725 Patent at 4:47-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   David Wright, who founded WWCS, and Jeffrey Dufrene filed Provisional Application No. 61/290,168 for their hydrate remediation system in December 2009, shortly after signing a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with Oceaneering.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This application specifically included the subsea separator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wright and Dufrene filed non-provisional Patent Application No. 12/978,486 for the separator on December 24, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   They later assigned their interests in the patents to WWCS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The '725 Patent for the separator issued on April 9, 2013, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C435%2C185\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 9,435,185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ('185 Patent) for the hydrate remediation system issued on September 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   WWCS alleges that Oceaneering used information provided by WWCS under a nondisclosure agreement to create a subsea\n   separator for its own Flowline Remediation System (FRS).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oceaneering has performed hydrate remediation using the FRS on multiple jobs since terminating its business relationship with WWCS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to WWCS, Oceaneering's FRS and separator relies on the technologies described in the '725 and '185 Patents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court granted these motions in part on August 23, 2017, dismissing WWCS's LUTSA claim and its claims for Texas common law misappropriation, Texas common law misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of confidential relationship, and business disparagement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also dismissed WWCS's claim for unfair competition to the extent the claim is based on misappropriation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Oceaneering moved for summary judgment against WWCS on its claim for infringement of the '185 Patent, arguing that Oceaneering had not used its FRS since the '185 Patent issued.

WWCS asserts infringement of independent Claim 1 and dependent Claims 11 and 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claim 1 is set forth below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A subsea separator, comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   a housing having an inlet for receiving a fluid mixture, a non-gaseous fluid outlet located along the housing at a point lower than the inlet, and a gas outlet located along the housing at a point higher than the inlet;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   baffle type members located within the housing for acting on fluid entering the housing; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ball valve assembly located within the housing and in communication with the gas outlet for preventing non-gaseous fluid from exiting the housing through the gas outlet, the ball valve assembly being operationally configured to open and seal the gas outlet based on the volume of non-gaseous fluid within the separator;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   wherein the separator is operationally configured to operate under vacuum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   '725 Patent at 9:10-10:64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dependent Claims 11 and 12 disclose specific variations of the separator described in independent Claim 1. Claim 11 discloses: \"The separator of claim 1 further including an external frame attached thereto.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:52-53. Claim 12 discloses: \"The separator of claim 1 wherein the separator is operationally configured to be fluidly connected to a subsea pump via the non-gaseous fluid outlet.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:54-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Figure 1 of the '725 Patent, showing a simplified embodiment of the separator, is reproduced below.

WWCS further argues that the Court's use of technical dictionaries was improper, both because the dictionaries contradict the intrinsic evidence, and because \"baffle type members\" is not ambiguous in light of the intrinsic evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   These arguments do not reveal a manifest error of law committed by the Court in construing baffle type members. First, the Court did not import a limitation from the specification. Instead, the Court read the claim language in light of the specification. This was not only proper under Federal Circuit precedent-it was required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. AWH Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948489\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1303/#p1315\">\n    415 F.3d 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc) (\"[C]laims 'must be read in view of the specification, of which they are a part.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414970\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/52/967/#p979\">\n    52 F.3d 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 979 (Fed.

The specification refers to baffle type members only once, stating that \"a suitable deflector means may include a\n   <em>\n    baffle type member or other plate type member\n   </em>\n   extending from the inner surface of the separator.\" '725 Patent at 8:7-9 (emphasis added). As a matter of ordinary English usage, this language clearly suggests that baffle type members are a subset of plate type members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, the technical dictionaries do not contradict the intrinsic evidence. To the contrary, both technical dictionaries cited by the Court define baffles in separators as plates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norman J. Hyne,\n   <em>\n    Dictionary of Petroleum Exploration, Drilling &amp; Production\n   </em>\n   31 (2d ed. 2014); George E. King Eng'g,\n   <em>\n    5000 Oilfield Terms: A Glossary of Petroleum Engineering Terms, Abbreviations and Acronyms\n   </em>\n   (2010). Third, the Court did not err in consulting the technical dictionaries. The Federal Circuit has approved of consideration of such evidence \"if the court deems it helpful in determining 'the true meaning of language used in the patent claims.' \"\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948489\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1303/#p1315\">\n    415 F.3d at 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414970\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/52/967/#p979\">\n    52 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   980 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   WWCS next challenges the Court's conclusion that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the ball valve assembly as operating without external intervention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   WWCS argues that the Court improperly imported this \"negative limitation\" from an unknown source. WWCS further argues that if the Court imported this limitation from the primary embodiment in the specification, that too was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   WWCS's arguments do not reveal a manifest error of law by the Court in construing ball valve assembly. The Court first notes that its construction is not a \"negative limitation,\" as WWCS argues. Instead, the Court construed the ball valve assembly as\n   <em>\n    operating\n   </em>\n   without external intervention,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , mechanically or automatically. The Court based its construction on the claim language itself. Claim 1 describes\n   the ball valve assembly as \"being operationally configured to open and seal the gas outlet\n   <em>\n    based on the volume of non-gaseous fluid within the separator.\n   </em>\n   \" '725 Patent at 9:20-22 (emphasis added). A component that required external intervention to open and close the gas outlet would render superfluous the \"based on\" limitation. Federal Circuit precedent disfavors \"interpretations that render some portion of the claim language superfluous.\"\n   <em>\n    SimpleAir, Inc. v. Sony Ericsson Mobile Commc'ns AB\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4254781\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/419/#p429\">\n    820 F.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 429 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Moreover, the Court cited the specification in this context only to confirm that the primary embodiment of the separator features a ball valve assembly that operates mechanically. For these reasons, the Court declines to reconsider its claim construction order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Drawings submitted by the parties show that the main body of Oceaneering's separator comprises five vertical tubes\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n   that are connected, at each end, by two horizontal tubes\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The tubes appear to be welded together.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is an inlet located on one of the vertical tubes, a liquid outlet on the lower horizontal tube, and a gas outlet\n   <strong>\n    3/4\n   </strong>\n   on the higher horizontal tube.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   The gas outlet is connected to a duct\n   <strong>\n    5\n   </strong>\n   , or pipe, that appears to be several feet in length. The duct leads to a chamber enclosing a ball valve\n   <strong>\n    6/7\n   </strong>\n   . Oceaneering's ball valve is a traditional ball valve, defined by a technical dictionary as \"a valve that opens with a quarter turn by rotating a ball with a hole through it located in a spherical container.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hyne,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 33. When the ball valve is open, gas is vented out of the separator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Additionally, one of the vertical tubes is connected to a transducer, which Oceaneering employee Troy Mills describes as \"a volume gauge comprising an electronic float that moves up and down on a sensor rod based on the volume of liquid in the separator. The transducer sends a signal topside to an operator who monitors the volume of fluid in the separator.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the liquid rises to a certain level, the topside operator directs a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to close the ball valve through the ROV interface\n   <strong>\n    8\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. Within the housing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court now turns to the specific limitations that are not present in Oceaneering's separator. First, there is no genuine dispute that Oceaneering's ball valve assembly is located outside the separator\n   housing. The ball valve itself is not located in any of the tubes that comprise the main body of Oceaneering's separator. Instead, the ball valve is connected to the higher horizontal tube by a duct that is several feet long. Thus, no reasonable juror would find that the ball valve is located inside the tubes that comprise the main body of Oceaneering's separator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   To resist the conclusion that Oceaneering's ball valve is not located inside the housing, WWCS argues that the housing actually extends beyond the tubes that comprise the main body of the separator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument is inconsistent with the Court's construction of \"housing\" as an enclosed vessel, or an enclosed structure with an interior chamber. The tubes in Oceaneering's separator are welded together and create an enclosed structure. This structure includes the inlet and the gas and liquid outlets, which are flanges attached to the tubes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Transmatic, Inc. v.

Cir. 1995) (holding that the housing of a light fixture included flanges). But the chamber enclosing the ball valve is a separate structure, connected by a duct to the higher horizontal tube.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Schematics of Oceaneering's separator do not even depict the ball valve.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, no reasonable juror would find that the main body of the separator and the ball valve chamber together form one enclosed vessel, or an enclosed structure with an interior chamber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Further, the inventors disclaimed WWCS's broader construction before the PTO. \"[W]here the patentee has unequivocally disavowed a certain meaning to obtain his patent, the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer attaches and narrows the ordinary meaning of the claim congruent with the scope of the surrender.\"\n   <em>\n    Omega Eng'g, Inc. v.

The inventors' initial application described a sealing means in communication with the gas outlet and operationally configured to open and seal the gas outlet based on the volume of liquid within the separator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   The PTO rejected this limitation as disclosed by prior art-specifically,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C082%2C556%2C\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 5,082,556,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   which the prosecution history refers to by the name of the inventor, Reese.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   As shown below, the chamber enclosing the ball valve assembly\n   <strong>\n    36\n   </strong>\n   in Reese is located completely outside the housing\n   <strong>\n    10\n   </strong>\n   , and the two components are connected by a duct\n   <strong>\n    24\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The inventors distinguished their separator from prior art by placing the ball valve assembly within the housing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   WWCS cannot now expand the scope of its patent to cover what it earlier disclaimed-namely, a separator in which the ball valve assembly is connected by a duct to the main body of the separator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   WWCS relies on the opinion of its expert, Benton Baugh, who states that the housing includes all components that are pressure tested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, WWCS essentially seeks to reconstrue \"housing.\" WWCS did not offer this argument in its claim construction brief. Moreover, Baugh does not provide any basis for his opinion that Oceaneering's ball valve is pressure tested. Nor does he explain why the ball valve chamber is included in the housing, but other components in Oceaneering's FRS-such as the pump-are not. Baugh's expert report therefore fails to raise a genuine dispute as to whether Oceaneering's ball valve assembly is located within the housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   WWCS also argues that the transducer is both part of the ball valve assembly and located within the housing. But the transducer is not even connected to the ball valve.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if it were, no reasonable juror would find that it is inside the housing as construed by the Court. Like the ball valve chamber, the transducer is structurally distinct from the tubes that comprise the main body of Oceaneering's separator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   The drawing below depicts the transducer as a smaller vertical tube, connected to one of the larger vertical tubes by flanges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Because the transducer and the main body of the separator are distinct structures, no reasonable juror would find that the transducer is located inside the housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Operationally configured to open and seal the gas outlet based on the volume of non-gaseous fluid within the separator\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The second limitation not present in Oceaneering's ball valve assembly is the capability to operate without external intervention. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to WWCS, there is evidence that Oceaneering's ball valve assembly operates without human intervention. Specifically, former Oceaneering employee Wayne Huddleston stated in a deposition that if the liquid rose to certain level in the transducer, the transducer would send a signal to a computer, which was programmed to close the ball valve.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   But there no evidence that the computer itself is part of the separator. To the contrary, Oceaneering employee Troy Mills states in an affidavit that a topside operator controls the ball valve.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mills further states that the transducer is not connected, either mechanically or electronically, to the ball valve.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, there is no genuine dispute that Oceaneering's ball valve requires external intervention-namely, a topside computer-to open or seal the gas outlet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because Oceaneering's separator does not satisfy each limitation of Claim 1 of the '725 Patent, and because Claims 11 and 12 depend on Claim 1, Oceaneering's separator does not literally infringe on the '725 Patent, and Oceaneering is entitled summary judgment on the issue of literal infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Doctrine of Equivalents\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The doctrine of equivalents permits a patentee to establish infringement \"if there is equivalence between the elements of the accused product or process and the claimed elements of the patented invention.\"\n   <em>\n    Intendis GMBH v.

They made this narrowing amendment to distinguish their separator from Reese, in which the ball valve assembly was connected by a duct to the main body of the separator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   This narrowing amendment gives rise to the presumption that the inventors relinquished the territory between the original claim,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the location of the ball valve assembly as described in Reese, and the amended claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duramed Pharm., Inc. v. Paddock Labs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5649047\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/1376/#p1380\">\n    644 F.3d 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (noting that \"a presumption of prosecution history estoppel applies\" to a narrowing amendment made \"in response to a prior art rejection\"). WWCS does not attempt to rebut this presumption. There is no genuine dispute, therefore, that prosecution history estoppel bars WWCS from asserting equivalence with respect to Claim 1's limitation that the ball valve assembly be located within the housing. Accordingly, Oceaneering is entitled summary judgment on the issue of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Oceaneering's motion for summary judgment on WWCS's patent infringement claim, and DENIES WWCS's motion for reconsideration and its cross-motion for summary judgment. WWCS's claim for infringement of the '725 Patent is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    R.
