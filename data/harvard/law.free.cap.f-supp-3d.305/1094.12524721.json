ENGLAND, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On March 23, 2016, this Court issued its Memorandum and Order (ECF No. 156) granting the Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 85) filed by Plaintiff American States Insurance Company (\"American States\" or \"American\") on grounds that Defendant Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania (\"ICSOP\") had a primary duty to defend its insured, Sierra Pacific Industries (\"Sierra\"), in various lawsuits arising from the so-called \"Moonlight Fire.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court concurrently denied ICSOP's correspondingly heard Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 99).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having established ICSOP's primary\n   duty to defend, American States moved for summary judgment on its remaining equitable contribution claim, arguing that ICSOP should pay the fees and costs it incurred in defending Sierra based on the respective policy limits of the ICSOP and American policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   By Memorandum and Order filed May 23, 2017 (ECF No. 177), this Court denied American's motion on grounds that the policy limits approach advocated by American was not the most equitable way to apportion defense costs between American and ICSOP. The Court further noted that apportioning contribution based on the alleged relative fault of American and ICSOP's respective insureds was not proper, either. Nonetheless, the Court invited the parties to file an additional summary judgment motion based on \"another recognized equitable apportionment method\" for allocating the fees and costs borne by American States in defending Sierra. Now before the Court are additional motions in that regard filed on behalf of both American and ICSOP, which have been fully briefed by the parties. For the reasons that follow, American's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 182) is GRANTED to the extent that the court awards $6,613,957.28 in equitable contribution in American's favor, but DENIED with respect to American's request for prejudgment interest. ICSOP's corresponding Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 184) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The underlying facts of this matter have already been outlined in the Court's previous Orders. Sierra was a named defendant in various lawsuits arising from a September 2007 wildfire in Plumas County, California, commonly referred to as the \"Moonlight Fire.\" American States agreed to defend Sierra in those lawsuits, beginning in September of 2009, pursuant to a Commercial General Liability (\"CGL\") policy it had issued to Howell's Forest Harvesting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By way of background, after Sierra obtained rights to harvest timber on a Plumas County parcel of land, Sierra hired Howell to perform certain operations on that land under the terms of a logging agreement. The logging agreement required Howell to obtain CGL insurance and to name Sierra as an additional insured under the resulting policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By July 2007, American States had issued CGL insurance to Howell with a $1 million coverage limit. Plaintiff American's Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"PUF\"), No. 22. In accordance with the logging agreement, Sierra was included as an additional insured under a \"Liability Plus Endorsement\" page stating that an insured under the CGL policy includes \"[a]ny person or organization ... for whom you are required by written contract, agreement[,] or permit to provide insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at No. 30. The insurance coverage for Sierra as an additional insured, however, applied \"only to the extent [Howell] [is] held liable due to: ... [Howell's] ongoing operations for [Sierra].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, while there is no dispute that Plaintiff's coverage for Sierra was primary in nature, it was limited to Sierra's vicarious liability as to Howell, and Sierra's independent liability was not covered under Plaintiff's CGL Policy with Howell. In addition to its primary CGL policy, American also issued a $1 million commercial umbrella policy, with its primary policy being the scheduled underlying\n   insurance for the umbrella coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Nos. 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 2006, ICSOP issued a commercial umbrella insurance policy to Sierra that provided both primary and excess coverage in the amount of $10 million. ICSOP's policy for Sierra delineated its duty to defend as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [ICSOP] shall have the right and duty to defend any claim or suit ... when:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (a) The applicable limits of insurance of ... any ... underlying insurance...[have] been exhausted by payment of claims or suits to which this Policy applies; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (b) Damages are sought for ... property damage ... covered by this Policy but not covered by ... any other underlying insurance providing coverage to [Sierra].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at No. 20\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Consequently, under clause (a), ICSOP's umbrella policy provided excess insurance when Sierra was vicariously liable with Howell and Plaintiff's policy limits were exhausted by payment of claims. Additionally, ICSOP's umbrella policy provided primary coverage under clause (b) for property damage arising from Sierra's non-vicarious liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In September 2007, \"Howell employees were allegedly operating bulldozers ... pursuant to the [l]ogging [a]greement [with Sierra],\" when a fire ignited nearby that \"eventually burn[ed] approximately 65,000 acres in the area.\" Pl.'s Third Am. Compl., \u00b6 8. Sparks caused by Howell's bulldozers allegedly caused the conflagration and the resulting Moonlight Fire. Multiple lawsuits were filed against both Sierra and Howell as a result of the fire, all of which Sierra tendered to both American States and ICSOP. American accepted Sierra's defense in all of the fire-related lawsuits \"without a reservation of rights to deny coverage for any damages awarded against Sierra, subject to available policy limits and California law ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. Thus, American agreed to defend and indemnify Sierra for not only suits where Sierra was vicariously liable with Howell-which was covered under Plaintiff's CGL policy-but also where Sierra was independently liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because American State's CGL policy only covered Sierra for vicarious liability with Howell, however, Sierra took the position that American States had a conflict of interest in defending Sierra despite its agreement to provide a defense without reservation. As a result of this conflict, Sierra argued it was entitled to independent counsel pursuant to California Civil Code \u00a7 2860. Sierra maintained this stance throughout the lifetime of the fire-related lawsuits-despite the fact that Plaintiff accepted defense of the lawsuits without reservation-and Sierra obtained outside counsel, the law firm of Downey Brand, for its defense. While American States agreed to pay Downey Brand at the rates it was prepared to pay counsel it had selected to defend Sierra, American declined to pay anything in addition to those prevailing rates. At no time did ICSOP defend or attempt to defend Sierra in any of the fire-related lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On or about July 17, 2012, the fire-related suits against Sierra settled, exhausting both American States' and ICSOP's respective policy limits. ICSOP also ultimately settled Sierra's claim that it wrongfully refused to provide Sierra with a defense by contributing some $3,444,260.84 towards the cost of Sierra's independent counsel, over and above the sums that American States already paid Downey Brand for Sierra's defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PUF No. 52. American States and Sierra also settled any remaining claims against each other, with Sierra acknowledging that American had paid some $5,380,365.75 in legal fees and expert costs of $7,847,548.81\n   for total fees paid of $13,227,914.56.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at No. 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As indicated above, American States made its own claim against ICSOP for equitable contribution towards the defense costs American States had assumed and filed the present lawsuit on June 1, 2012. Once this Court determined that ICSOP had a primary duty to defend Sierra by Memorandum and Order filed March 23, 2016, the only claim remaining is for equitable contribution in determining the extent of ICSOP's indebtedness for Sierra's defense. American's initial motion for summary judgment, which argued for an allocation based on policy limits that would attribute some 90 percent of its fees and costs to ICSOP, was denied. In addition, ICSOP's argument in opposition, that allocation be based on the relative fault of the parties, was also rejected as both unworkable and contrary to sound public policy. The proper method for effectuating equitable contribution continues to be the subject of the motions now before the Court, which it authorized after having denied American's previous motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide for summary judgment when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Principles Underlying Equitable Contribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As indicated above, American States seeks equitable contribution from ICSOP, as sought in its Fourth Claim for Relief, on grounds that ICSOP shared a primary duty to defend Sierra in the Moonlight Fire lawsuits, yet failed to assume that duty at any time prior to the settlement reached in July of 2012 whereby both carriers paid their respective policy limits in order to resolve those lawsuits. By previous Memorandum and Order filed May 23, 2017, the Court rejected ICSOP's various defenses to equitable contribution, having determined that 1) American States was not a party to the logging agreement between Sierra and Howell in which Howell agreed to indemnify ICSOP's insured, Sierra; 2) the terms of American's policy do not govern the potential sharing of defense costs; and 3) satisfaction of the ICSOP policy's self-insured retention has no bearing on contribution. Consequently, the Court found that principles of equitable contribution do apply in apportioning Sierra's defense costs between American and ICSOP, both of whom owed a primary duty to defend their mutual insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The right to equitable contribution arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim, and one insurer has either paid more than its share of the claim in question or defended the action without participation from the other carrier or carriers obligated to do so. Equitable contribution permits reimbursement to the carrier paying in excess of its proportionate share of the obligation in question, and serves the equitable objective of equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers and preventing one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale Ins.

In any event, American scrutinized the invoices it received from Sierra's independent counsel, Downey Brand, and paid only those costs that it determined were reasonable and necessary to Sierra's defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PUF No. 57. Significantly, too, when ICSOP negotiated a release of Sierra's bad faith failure to defend the case by paying an additional $3.4 million of Downey Brand's fees over and above those fees already paid by American States, it relied on American's evaluation as to the propriety of the Downey Brand invoices, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Nos. 52-53), a factor which also weighs against any further scrutiny as to those expenses. It follows that the starting point for calculating contribution would appear to be the total expenditure of $13,227,914.56 incurred by American in defending Sierra.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Reduction of Sierra's Defense Costs as Benefitting Howell\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   ICSOP now argues that amounts expended by American should be reduced by as much as 75 percent on grounds that American's payments to Downey Brand for Sierra's defense were, at least in part, directed to the defense of Howell and its employees who were not ICSOP insureds. According to ICSOP, Downey Brand entered into a \"joint defense agreement\" with the Howell defendants' counsel, as a result of which Downey Brand undertook the vast majority of work necessary for Howell's defense. ICSOP argues that holding it responsible for any such additional expense would be inequitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court disagrees. The evidence shows that Sierra controlled its own defense in this matter, having hired Downey Brand after refusing to relinquish such control to American. PUF No. 45;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   American's Additional Undisputed Fact (\"AUF\") (ECF No. 189), No. 138. While the parties did enter into a joint defense agreement, that agreement said nothing about Sierra taking any \"lead\" in the defense, or about joint retention of experts or cost sharing, and was designed to protect communications between the co-defendants' counsel and their clients under the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work product doctrine. AUF Nos. 129-134.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   American was accordingly not responsible for the manner in which Downey conducted the litigation. Moreover, in addition to retaining Downey Brand, Sierra hired its own experts, consultants, and other vendors. ICSOP has not cited to any authorization by Howell, or its counsel, that Downey Brand appear for, or otherwise represent, Howell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Absent such authorization,\n   there is no entitlement to payment for attorney fees allegedly incurred by counsel for another, allegedly benefitting, party.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Preston v.

Additionally, given the fact that Sierra faced independent liability exposure on its own apart from any vicarious liability it had for Howell's actions, Downey Brand could not represent both Sierra and Howell and did not do so. AUF No. 139. Speculation as to the extent that Howell may have benefitted from the work of Sierra's defense counsel and experts cannot serve as a basis for reducing ICSOP's contribution towards costs incurred in defending Sierra as its joint insured, particularly since American hired separate defense counsel to represent Howell, who, in turn, hired separate consultants and experts\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   on Howell's behalf. AUF Nos. 120, 136.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, and most significantly, having refused to defend Sierra, the Court has already determined that ICSOP has waived the right to challenge the reasonableness of the more than $13 million American paid in defense costs.

Reducing Sierra's Defense Costs Based on Causes of Action Pled\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Having determined that ICSOP is not entitled to an off-the-top reduction to the defense costs incurred by American in Sierra's defense based on an argument that Howell somehow benefitted from a portion of those costs, the Court next turns to ICSOP's claim that its share of American's defense costs for Sierra should also be reduced based on the relative ratio of the total causes of action pled against Sierra in the underlying Moonlight Fire lawsuits versus those claims which included vicarious liability components.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   According to ICSOP, because only 12 of 44 causes of action were based exclusively on Sierra's potential independent liability, a proration of 12 to 44 (or 27.27 percent) should be applied prior to allocating any defense costs between ICSOP and American. In attempting to quantify potential liability in this manner, however, ICSOP tries to revisit its previous argument concerning relative fault, and this Court already rejected that approach in its previous May 23, 2017 Memorandum and\n   Order. As the Court noted in that Order, 1) \"relative fault\" is not a recognized allocation method; 2) it runs contrary to the principles underlying equitable contribution and sound public policy; and 3) it would, as a practical matter, impose an undue burden on the Court in either being forced to essentially try the underlying claims, or at a minimum guess as to the likely outcomes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 177, pp. 13-14. ICSOP's present attempt to apportion defense costs based on the numbers of causes of action asserted against Sierra simply repackages the previously dismissed \"relative fault\" approach, and must be rejected on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In addition, no case law recognizes ICSOP's proposed equitable allocation method based on \"cumulative\" causes of action. To the contrary, as the Court has already noted, any approach based on comparative fault runs counter to relevant California law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fire Ins. Exch. v. Am.

Duty to Defend Under American's Umbrella Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   ICSOP next argues that if an \"equal shares\" apportionment of defense costs is considered by the Court, the total sum to be split should be divided by three\n   ways. According to ICSOP, American's umbrella policy must be deemed a third policy providing a defense obligation, and that therefore it would be improper to split the costs equally between American and Sierra should the equal shares method be employed. Again, the Court concludes ICSOP's argument is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   According to ICSOP, America's umbrella policy was co-primary with the ICSOP policy for claims asserted against Sierra based on its independent liability. The fact that the American umbrella policy ultimately provided coverage for Sierra, whether for independent or vicarious liability, however, does not mean that its provisions triggered a defense obligation. This is because under its express terms, the American umbrella policy provides for a defense only \"against a claim that alleges damages arising out of an 'occurrence,' which is not covered, in whole or in part, under 'scheduled underlying insurance' or 'unscheduled underlying insurance' ... which seeks damages arising out of an 'occurrence' otherwise covered under this policy.\" Defendant ICSOP's Statement of Undisputed Facts. ECF No. 184-1 (\"SUF\"), No. 31. The limiting phrase \"in whole or in part\" is determinative since American's primary policy does provide \"scheduled underlying insurance\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at No. 28) that undisputedly covered Sierra's potential liability \"in part\" by covering Sierra's vicarious liability for Howell's conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fundamental principles of insurance policy construction require that policy terms cannot be read \"in such a way that would render some of its words meaningless.\"\n   <em>\n    Collin v.

Applying those principles here means that the American umbrella policy provides no duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   ICSOP's \"other insurance\" clause, on the other hand, is silent as to the duty to defend, except to the extent it provides no such duty where its coverage is excess.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PUF No. 20; AUF No. 115. In the present case, however, the ICSOP policy was not issued as excess over a primary policy or self-insured retention. Absent such underlying insurance, as the Court has already determined, American's umbrella policy became for all practical purposes a primary policy that had to \"drop down\" and provide a defense to Sierra for claims that alleged Sierra's independent liability. Additionally, the ICSOP policy contains no limitation on the duty to defend like that set forth in the American umbrella policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, American's umbrella policy is irrelevant in assessing the defense obligations at play in the instant matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Application of \"Equal Shares\" Approach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Having rejected ICSOP's arguments as to why an \"equal shares\" approach between it and American should not be employed in this instance, the Court now looks to whether that approach should be applied here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a co-primary insurer with American States under the circumstances of this case, ICSOP had an independent, concurrent obligation together with American to afford Sierra a complete defense in the Moonlight Fire lawsuits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buss v.

As already recognized by the Court, other equitable approaches authorized by the case law would result in ICSOP paying more than 90 percent of the defense costs incurred by American in Sierra's defense. While the Court determined that a ratio skewed to that extent was not equitable under the circumstances, the same cannot be said for an equal shares approach which simply splits the costs incurred down the middle. The latter approach acknowledges the fact that there is no basis, beyond speculation, for doing otherwise given the fact that no conclusive determination of liability was made, or ever will be ascertained. Moreover, assigning ICSOP anything less than a full equal share of costs incurred would, in essence, reward the company for its recalcitrance in not providing a defense earlier despite the fact that it operated as the functional equivalent of a $10 million primary CGL policy for Sierra's domestic operations at issue in the Moonlight Fire actions. Even if, as ICSOP argues, a typical umbrella insurer provides greater coverage limits towards settlement or judgment along with a reduced expectation of defense costs, ICSOP was not a typical umbrella carrier here since its policy dropped down and provided primary coverage given the lack of any underlying insurance. Under those circumstances it is not reasonable for ICSOP to argue it had a reduced expectation for bearing defense costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Northern District's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    First Mercury Ins. v.

In\n   <em>\n    First Mercury\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs, who were injured in a physical assault that occurred as they waited in a restroom line at a football stadium, sued both the stadium security company, a number of San Francisco Forty-Niners entities, and the City of Santa Clara. First Mercury, the CGL carrier for the stadium security company, defended all the defendants, to the extent they qualified as additional insureds under Elite's policy, but only to the extent their injuries were \"caused, in whole or in part\" by acts or omissions of Elite or those acting on its behalf.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267808\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/1028/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267808\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/241/1028/\">\n    at 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Despite the fact that apportionment of the defense costs between Mountain West and St. Paul was not made until after trial, the trial court ordered Mountain West to pay prejudgment interest on the 43 percent of defense costs ultimately awarded to St. Paul.
