Plaintiff may have only missed the filing deadline by a relatively short period, but his failure was not the result of any extraordinary external circumstances that stood in his way. The Court rejects Plaintiff's efforts to blame his failure on delays caused by \"the manner by which U.S. mail flows through the U.S. Postal system and the Court's screening and intake procedures.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 3. Such \"delays\" are merely the routine consequences of Plaintiff's chosen filing method: international mail. In reality, Plaintiff's failure to ensure that the Court received his Complaint on time was solely the result of Plaintiff not pursuing his rights diligently. It was Plaintiff's responsibility to ensure that his pleading was received in a timely manner. Plaintiff appears to have been fully aware of the filing deadline and simply missed it because he waited until the last day of the statutory filing period to attempt to begin the process of submitting his papers from abroad. The Court accepts Plaintiff's explanation that he waited until the last minute because the decision to file a lawsuit was an emotional one. But if the Court were to ignore Section 4140(a)'s filing deadline under the commonplace circumstances of this case, it would effectively render that deadline a nullity.

Plaintiff's e-mail does not constitute a request for judicial review because it does not satisfy the most basic requirements of the federal pleading standards.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Latson v. Sessions\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273424\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/36/#p42\">\n     256 F.Supp.3d 36\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 42 (D.D.C. 2017) (holding that\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    plaintiff had not satisfied statute of limitations by filing civil cover sheet that did not, by itself, satisfy notice pleading standards). Plaintiff appears to acknowledge as much.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 6 (\"Surely Defendants are not claiming that [Plaintiff] should have filed his case in his email to the help desk.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Plaintiff complains that Defendants did not address the merits of his claims in their Motion to Dismiss, and argues that by failing to do so, Defendants have \"concede[d]\" the merits of those claims. Pl.'s Opp'n at 2-3. This is incorrect. Defendants were not required to address the merits of Plaintiff's claims in a motion to dismiss for failure to comply with a statutory filing deadline. Because the Court has decided to dismiss Plaintiff's claims as untimely, it too does not address the substance of Plaintiff's claims. By doing so, the Court makes no comment on the merits of those claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
