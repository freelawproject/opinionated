To extend\n   <em>\n    Martini\n   </em>\n   to block Thomas's lawsuit would cut his statutory right out of the statute.

The D.C. Circuit has foreclosed this argument.

But addressing a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge to an employment discrimination claim involves an extra wrinkle. Employment discrimination claims for a failure to hire or promote follow the familiar burden-shifting framework from\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas v.

Under that framework, the plaintiff ultimately bears the burden of establishing the specific requirements of a prima facie case of employment discrimination,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but that burden does not apply with full force at the motion to dismiss stage. Indeed, the Supreme Court \"has never indicated that the requirements\n   for establishing a prima facie case under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   also apply to the pleading standard that plaintiffs must satisfy in order to survive a motion to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    Swierkiewicz v.

But at this stage, the Court accepts Thomas's factual allegations as true and concludes that the complaint at least raises a plausible inference of discrimination.

Aug. 31, 2016) (\"As a general rule, WMATA's sovereign immunity bars claims against it for punitive damages.\"). Thomas does not identify any statutory basis for a punitive damages award against WMATA, nor does he cite to any supportive case law. Instead, Thomas repeats the arguments he raised against WMATA's general assertion of sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 21-22. Those arguments are beside the point and, at any rate, rejected for the same reasons articulated in Section III.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, the Court's own inquiry does not reveal any statutory authorization for punitive damages against WMATA for the remaining Title VII claims. In Title VII cases involving intentional discrimination in employment, punitive damages are not recoverable against \"a government, government agency or political subdivision,\" such as WMATA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Further, the signatories to WMATA's governing compact did not waive WMATA's immunity with respect to punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%209-1107.01\">\n    D.C.
