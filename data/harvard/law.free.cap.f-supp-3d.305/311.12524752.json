Their claims include counts for breach of contract; breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; breach of an express warranty; breach of an implied warranty of merchantability; unjust enrichment; violations of the consumer protection statutes of Oregon, Colorado, Texas, Massachusetts, and North Carolina; and a violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202310\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). For the reasons discussed below, the Court ALLOWS the motion to dismiss with respect to Count I (Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices Act), Count II (Colorado Consumer Protection Act), Count III (Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Consumer Protection Act), Count V (North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act) and Count VII (breach of implied warranty of merchantability) and DENIES the motion with respect to the remaining counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court accepts all non-conclusory facts alleged in the complaint, D. 1, as true,\n   <em>\n    Ocasio-Hernandez v.

Certain models of these cars, identified as the \"Class Vehicles,\" contain a defective Timing Chain Tensioning System (\"TCTS\"). \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2. As alleged, the defect in the TCTS causes the engine of the car to become damaged, necessitating expensive repairs, and potentially also posing a safety risk to the occupants of the car. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 59, 62, 101. The Defendants allegedly knew and should have known, at the time of sale or lease of the Class Vehicles, that the TCTS was defective. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 61, 71. However, instead of disclosing the defect in the TCTS, the Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants\n   concealed information regarding the defect in the TCTS from consumers, while disclosing information to dealerships via Technical Service Bulletins (\"TSBs\"), regular publications to dealerships that are authorized to perform repairs on the Defendants' cars. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 61-62, 84-90. According to a mechanic at an authorized dealership, the defect in the TCTS stems from the fact that a particular component of the TCTS is made of an inferior plastic component, which may be worn away, even the part is supposed to last the lifetime of the car. \u00b6 75. The Defendants subsequently improved the material of this particular component to remedy the defect in subsequent models of its cars. \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendants offer two warranty products on the Class Vehicles: first, the \"Basic Warranty,\" which covered repairs during the first 36,000 miles or 36 months (whichever occurs first), and second, the \"Powertrain Warranty,\" which covered repairs during the first 60,000 miles or 60 months (whichever occurs first). \u00b6 6. The warranty covers repairs for defects in \"materials and/or workmanship.\" \u00b6 127. The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants intentionally set these warranty limits so that the warranty coverage would expire before the defect in the TCTS would manifest itself. \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The named Plaintiffs all purchased or leased Class Vehicles manufactured by the Defendants from various dealerships. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 40, 45. Plaintiff Sarah Duncan is a citizen of Massachusetts who purchased a 2007 Nissan Maxima in Massachusetts in 2010. 114. In 2016, when her vehicle had approximately 127,000 miles, she was informed by a technician at a Nissan dealership that the TCTS needed to be replaced at a cost of approximately $1,500. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. She was also informed that Nissan would not cover the cost of the repair. \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff Richard Silver is a citizen of Massachusetts who purchased a 2007 Nissan Maxima in Massachusetts in 2007. \u00b6 19.

He spent $1,641.45 replacing the TCTS. \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs Anthony and Judy Weissenburger are citizens of Oregon who purchased a 2004 Nissan Maxima in Oregon in 2004. \u00b6 24. In 2011, when their vehicle had approximately 39,666 miles, they were informed by a technician at a Nissan dealership that the TCTS needed to be replaced and that Nissan would not cover the cost of the repair. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. They spent approximately $1,400 replacing the TCTS. \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff Kevin Fry is a citizen of Colorado who purchased a 2009 Nissan Frontier in Colorado on or about April 18, 2009. \u00b6 29. On or about June 15, 2015, when his vehicle had approximately 58,100 miles, he was informed by a technician at a Nissan\n   dealership that the TCTS needed to be replaced and that Nissan would not cover the cost of the repair. \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. He spent approximately $1,388.42 replacing the TCTS. \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff Shaun Cooney is a citizen of Colorado who purchased a 2007 Nissan Xterra in 2016 in Colorado. \u00b6 34. Later in 2016, when his vehicle had approximately 78,000 miles, he was informed by a technician at a Nissan dealership that the TCTS needed to be replaced and that Nissan would not cover the cost of the repair. \u00b6\u00b6 38-39. He spent approximately $928.01 replacing the TCTS. \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff Clifton Stewart is a citizen of Texas who purchased a 2006 Nissan Frontier in 2006 in Texas. \u00b6 40. In 2016, when his vehicle had approximately 87,333 miles, he was informed by a technician at a Nissan dealership that the TCTS needed to be replaced and that Nissan would not cover the cost of the repair. \u00b6\u00b6 43-44. He spent approximately $1,625.77 replacing the TCTS. \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff Michelle Lim Stewart is a citizen of North Carolina who purchased a 2007 Nissan Pathfinder in North Carolina. \u00b6 45. In 2015, when her vehicle had approximately 51,000 miles, she was informed by a technician at a car repair shop that the TCTS needed to be replaced. \u00b6\u00b6 48-49. She paid approximately $1,910 replacing the TCTS. \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The Plaintiffs do not contest this position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Breach of Express Warranty (Count VI)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the complaint, the Plaintiffs allege that they entered into either the Basic Warranty or Powertrain Warranty with the Defendants and that the Defendants breached that warranty by failing to cover the cost of repairing the defective TCTSs. \u00b6\u00b6 170, 171.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Defendants first contend that the complaint fails to state a claim for relief because the warranty only covers \"repairs needed to correct defects in the materials or workmanship,\" D. 15-1 at 8; D. 15-2 at 10; D. 15-3 at 8; D. 15-4 at 8,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   whereas the complaint only alleges a design defect. In support of this contention, they cite\n   <em>\n    Bruce Martin Constr., Inc., v. CTB, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722494\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/750/#p753\">\n    735 F.3d 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753-54 (8th Cir. 2013). In that case, the court interpreted an express warranty against \"defects in material and workmanship\" to exclude claims based on design defects.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722494\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/750/#p753\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court reasoned that \"defects in material and workmanship refer to departures from a product's intended design while design defects refer to the inadequacy of the design itself ... where a product is manufactured correctly but designed inappropriately, the defect is one of design and not 'material or workmanship.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722494\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/750/#p753\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722494\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/750/#p753\">\n    at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Defendants contend that both the structure of the TCTS and\n   the material used in the TCTS constitute the \"design\" and not the \"material or workmanship\" of the TCTS, and, therefore, the complaint only alleges defects in the design rather than in the material or workmanship. D. 15 at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In response, the Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants mischaracterize the allegations in the complaint. D. 20 at 25. The complaint alleges that the \"Defendants failed to adequately ensure proper materials selection, research, design, testing and/or manufacture of the [TCTS].\" \u00b6 82. Thus, even under the Defendants' interpretation of the phrase \"material or workmanship,\" the complaint pleads facts sufficient to state a claim for breach of the express warranty because a failure in the \"manufacture\" of the TCTS does refer to a departure of the product from its intended design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Defendants next contend that none of the Plaintiffs' repairs were made during the period of warranty coverage and thus that the Defendants were not obligated to reimburse Plaintiffs for those repairs under the terms of the warranty. D. 15 at 21-22. The Plaintiffs counter by arguing that the TCTS malfunctioned during the warranty period and thus that the repairs were covered under the terms of the warranty. D. 20 at 18-19. Moreover, the Plaintiffs contend that the warranty limits are not enforceable because the warranty limits were unconscionable, due to the Defendants' concealment of the defect from the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The Terms of the Warranty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The terms of the warranty do not support the Plaintiffs' position. The text of the warranty agreement, for each relevant model year, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The basic coverage period is 36 months or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first. This warranty covers any repairs needed to correct defects in materials or workmanship of all parts and components of each new Nissan vehicle supplied by Nissan except for the exclusions or items listed.... The Powertrain coverage period is 60 months or 60,000 miles, whichever comes first. This warranty covers any repairs needed to correct defects in materials or workmanship.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   D. 15-1 at 8; D. 15-2 at 10; D. 15-3 at 8; D. 15-4 at 8. As the Defendants point out, the warranty agreement is thus an agreement to provide repairs within certain time and mileage restrictions; not to remedy problems that become manifest within certain time and mileage restrictions, as the Plaintiffs contend. As the First Circuit observed, citing law from multiple jurisdictions, \"case law almost uniformly holds that time-limited warranties do not protect buyers against hidden defects-defects that may exist before, but typically are not discovered until after, the expiration of the warranty period.\"\n   <em>\n    Canal Elec. Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518403\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/973/988/#p993\">\n    973 F.2d 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 993 (1st Cir. 1992). The Plaintiffs do not make any argument based on the terms of the warranty to support their contention that the warranty explicitly covers problems made manifest within the warranty period. Thus, their contention that the repairs were covered expressly under the terms of the warranty fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Unconscionability of the Warranty Limits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Plaintiffs contend that, because of the gross disparity in bargaining power between them and the Defendants, the lack of meaningful choice on the part of the Plaintiffs in determining those time limits, and the Defendants' knowledge and active concealment of the defect, the warranty limits are unconscionable. D. 20 at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although the substantive laws of five different states are at issue, all five have\n   adopted the same U.C.C. provision regarding unconscionability. Col.

However, as the court also pointed out, agencies like NHTSA typically do not compensate individuals for losses resulting from personal injury or property damage that comes from a car's failure to meet safety standards, so there may be good reason for Chapter 93A to cover such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The complaint establishes that NHTSA has a process for reviewing complaints from consumers, investigating the complaints where warranted, and issuing a recall where justified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.

Instead, such claims are governed by contract law-in this case, the UCC. The courts have construed the term \"economic losses\" to include damages to the product itself. The rationale for the economic loss rule is that the sale of goods is accomplished by contract and the parties are free to include, or exclude, provisions as to the parties' respective rights and remedies, should the product prove to be defective. To give a party a remedy in tort, where the defect in the product damages the actual product, would permit the party to ignore and avoid the rights and remedies granted or imposed by the parties' contract.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Defendants' motion to dismiss, D. 14, is ALLOWED with respect to Count I (Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices Act), Count II (Colorado Consumer Protection Act), Count III (Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Consumer Protection Act), Count V (North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act), Count VII (Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability), and DENIED with respect to the remaining counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    So Ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    All paragraph references are to the complaint, D. 1, unless otherwise stated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Although the warranty agreements were not attached to the complaint, they were attached to the Defendants' motion to dismiss and the Plaintiffs do not challenge the authenticity of those warranty agreements. Accordingly, the Court may properly consider them in adjudicating the motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     Beddall v. State St. Bank and Tr.

D. 15 at 26. The Plaintiffs respond that the statute of limitations was tolled by a nationwide class action lawsuit that was later narrowed to exclude the Oregon plaintiffs. D. 20 at 23-24. The Defendants make no response to this argument in their reply brief, D. 22, so the Court declines to dismiss the Oregon claim on statute of limitations grounds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The Plaintiffs cite, as supplemental authority,\n    <em>\n     Hays v.
