BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Darrell Prince, Amtrak Police's motto \"Protecting America in Transit\" must ring hollow. After his bag and laptop were stolen while he was sleeping at Union Station, his attempts to enlist\n   the aid of Amtrak Police officers to find his belongings and apprehend a suspect were repeatedly rebuffed. Frustrated by their unwillingness to assist him, Prince is suing Eleanor Acheson (General Counsel for Amtrak), Amtrak Police, and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) for \"gross negligence of duty, and theft of honest government services.\" Defendants, believing Prince has failed to state a viable claim, now move to dismiss the Complaint. Notwithstanding their motto, Amtrak Police officers-like other law-enforcement officers in all but a few scenarios-have no affirmative duty to protect, and Prince cannot hold them liable for failing to do so here. As such, this Court will grant Defendants' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the Complaint, which the Court must presume true at this stage, this case arises from the January 8, 2017, theft of a laptop and bag from Plaintiff after he fell asleep in the District of Columbia's Union Station.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1; Opp. at 6. Immediately following the incident, Prince attempted to report the theft to several Amtrak Police officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1. After assistance was twice refused, he was finally allowed to file a report but was denied access to the station's security-camera footage, as the cameras were allegedly not operating.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff then proceeded to search the station and located an individual using what appeared to be his laptop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. After filming the likely culprit, Prince attempted to turn in \"said evidence\" but was rebuffed by Amtrak Police officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Adding insult to injury, the report he allegedly filed was later lost, leaving Plaintiff deeply unsatisfied with the officers' response to his predicament.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Seeking replacement costs for his bag and laptop, damages for pain and suffering, and several million dollars in punitives, Prince filed this suit against General Counsel Acheson, Amtrak Police, and Amtrak itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1, 2.

Reading his Complaint generously, Plaintiff might be asserting a negligence claim under D.C. law as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1.
