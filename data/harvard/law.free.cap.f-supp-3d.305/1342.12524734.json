Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants first facially attack Plaintiff's standing to sue under the TCPA. (Doc. 28, pp. 6-8.) To establish constitutional standing, a plaintiff must plausibly allege: (1) injury-in-fact; (2) causation; and (3) redressability.\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

Defendants challenge the first element.

In the TCPA context, a plaintiff sufficiently pleads a concrete, particularized, and personal injury where facts allege that \"the plaintiff's fax machine is occupied while the unsolicited fax is being sent and the plaintiff must shoulder the cost of printing the unsolicited\n   fax.\"\n   <em>\n    Florence Endocrine Clinic, PLLC v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants argue that the Complaint should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) because Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to state a cognizable TCPA claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 22, pp. 9-13.) Defendants' arguments miss the mark. To state a claim for violation of the Fax Provision of TCPA, courts require a plaintiff to allege that: (1) the defendant sent the fax to a telephone facsimile machine using a telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device; (2) the fax was an advertisement;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) the fax was unsolicited.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daisy, Inc. v.

(Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 12, 21, 30, 31, 35;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-2). The Complaint also alleges that the Fax advertises products, goods, and services from which Defendants' derive revenue. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-2). Finally, Plaintiff maintains that Defendants sent the Fax to it and the putative class without permission or without requisite opt-out language. (Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15, 21, 30, 35). Accepting these allegations as true, Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to survive dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant also urges the Court to dismiss Plaintiff's \"class allegations\" under Rule 12(b)(6) because they fail to support a putative class action. (Doc. 22, pp. 13.) Such an argument is premature. Dismissing class allegations at the pleading stage is the functional equivalent of denying class certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herrera v. JFK Med. Ctr.
