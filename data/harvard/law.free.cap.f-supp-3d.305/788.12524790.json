First, the Supreme Court explicitly stated it was not deciding that issue. Second,\n   <em>\n    Petrella\n   </em>\n   was a case about laches, and the holding is limited to that issue. Third, the comment's placement in a footnote demonstrates it was intended as dicta. Finally, this Court cannot find that a comment in a footnote overrules the standard in nearly every circuit in the country. Accordingly, the discovery rule still applies to determine whether Plaintiff's claims are barred by the three-year statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Grant Heilman Photography, Inc. v.

Because copyright holders can avail themselves of the \"separate-accrual rule,\" FWH seems to argue, there is no reason copyright holders should also be able to invoke the discovery rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Because each new, discrete wrong is remediable when the infringement occurs, and because continuing harms (like the construction of houses based on an infringing architectural plan) multiply\n   available damages, a ... copyright infringement plaintiff already has a full panoply of remedies that obviates the need for the extra time that the discovery rule affords.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Whatever the merits of this policy argument, there is simply no plausible way to read\n   <em>\n    Allied Erecting\n   </em>\n   as repudiating the Sixth Circuit's cases adopting and applying the discovery rule.

(Doc. 81 at 13-17).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is so, FWH maintains, because \"the current ownership of DB acquired their interest in the company expressly because of the potential for copyright infringement cases that 'have become a principal revenue stream for [DB].\" (Doc. 81 at 14-15) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Design Basics, LLC v.

In this vein, FWH observes that DB uses a \"bounty program\" whereby it encourages its employees to look for potential copyright infringements on the Internet and pays them a finder's fee if the employee's research leads to a successful infringement suit.\n   <em>\n    Lexington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276651\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1093/#p1096\">\n    858 F.3d at 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Doc. 58 at \u00b6 7; Doc. 83-3 at \u00b6 29). As DB observes, \"[d]efendants appeared to be law-abiding customers, following the licensing requirements spelled-out on DB's plan catalogs.\" (Doc. 111 at 11).
