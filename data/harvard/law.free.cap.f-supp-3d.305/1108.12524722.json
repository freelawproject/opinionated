Pl.'s Fact (\"PF\") 1, ECF No. 117. Plaintiff has special education needs and a noticeable speech impediment. Defs.' Fact (\"DF\") 3, ECF No. 103. Plaintiff started school on August 20, 2014, along with 15 to 24 classmates. PF 1, 5. This was H.W.'s first school experience. PF 2. Before school began, plaintiff's parents told the school about his disability. Yeager Decl. \u00b6 7, ECF No. 102-3. Within the first week, plaintiff's teacher, Ms. Haun, noticed A.S. acting aggressive towards his classmates, particularly towards plaintiff. PF 9, 10.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Alfert Decl. Ex. B (\"Haun Dep.\"), ECF No. 131-2, at\n   26:8-14. She immediately told the school principal, Mr. Yeager, about A.S.'s aggression. DF 19; Haun Dep. 26:9-14. Then, on August 26, 2014, Ms. Haun told Principal Yeager that plaintiff and A.S. should be assessed for special education services. PF 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Two weeks later, on September 11, 2014, plaintiff's parents met with the student study team (\"SST\"), which consisted of Principal Yeager, Ms. Haun and the District's speech and language pathologist Ms. Dawn Ibbs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to discuss plaintiff's potential special education needs. PF 24. Mrs. Adriana Wormuth, plaintiff's mother, contends she also discussed behavioral changes plaintiff had exhibited at home since school started, and she asked if anything at school could be causing these changes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PF 24-25 (citing A. Wormuth Dep., ECF No. 131-15, at 19:12-19, 25:7-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Around this time, A.S.'s behavior escalated: He started habitually kicking his classmates and spitting on them. DF 21; PF 6-7. A.S. targeted H.W. the most and, at least once, made fun of plaintiff's teeth. DF 7; PF 6; A. Wormuth Dep. 271:9-24. Ms. Haun reported this behavior to Principal Yeager. DF 20, 24-25, 46. Principal Yeager met with A.S.'s mother to discuss A.S.'s behavior: A.S's mother assured Principal Yeager she was disciplining A.S. at home and working with Ms. Haun to correct A.S.'s behavior. DF 21. During class, Ms. Haun tried to do just that: She supervised A.S. more closely, counseled him, used motivational behavior charts, and separated him from other students. DF 16. She also asked Principal Yeager for more help supervising A.S., but received none; she became upset when a fellow teacher was supposed to help, but never did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Haun Dep. 72:25-73:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.S.'s behavior worsened. On September 17, 2014, he pushed plaintiff off a play structure and kicked him in the head, leaving a red bump. DF 22; PF 32. Mrs. Wormuth noticed the bump and then emailed Ms. Haun. PF 34. A.S. also threw plaintiff's lunch over the fence and continued to push, kick and spit on him and other children. DF 27, 29. Ms. Haun immediately reported these incidents to Principal Yeager. DF 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By October, Ms. Haun's concerns about A.S. charted new territory. Ms. Haun testified A.S. was following 60 to 80 percent of his classmates into the bathroom and either watching or touching them inappropriately.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PF 12; Haun Dep. 71:1-12. She emailed Principal Yeager a report about this behavior \"immediately.\" PF 12; Haun Dep. 71:1-15. The bathroom at issue, directly accessible to two classrooms, has no bathroom doors; only curtains shield the stalls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DF 36-37. Principal Yeager had never before received reports or complaints from \"any students, staff, or parents\" about inappropriate student behavior in any campus bathroom. DF 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   But that changed on October 2, 2014. Two parents complained to Ms. Haun by e-mail about inappropriate bathroom contact: (1) the mother of G.W., a female student, said A.S. had opened the curtain and watched G.W. use the restroom; and (2) that morning, Mrs. Wormuth vaguely mentioned that her son was \"expressing concern\" about the bathroom, though he would not tell her what happened; only that something happened. DFs 32-33. Ms. Haun forwarded the emails to Principal Yeager. PF 31. Later that day Ms. Haun heard a student scream in the bathroom: She found a girl standing at the sink with A.S. behind her, and the girl said A.S. had pulled down her dress and panties. DF 34. After learning about these incidents, Principal Yeager immediately suspended A.S. DF 35. On October 5, 2014, three days\n   after this suspension, Mrs. Wormuth emailed Ms. Haun, revealing the details plaintiff told her about his bathroom incident. DF 40. Ms. Haun forwarded the email to Principal Yeager the next day. DF 40. But Ms. Haun had already known these details: On September 30, 2014, Ms. Haun had documented that A.S. touched plaintiff's bare bottom while plaintiff was urinating, but the record contains no evidence that she reported this information to Principal Yeager. Haun Dep. 108:22-2, 137:3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During A.S.'s suspension, school officials met with A.S.'s parents and proposed transferring A.S. to a different elementary school. DF 41. His parents had previously asked to remove A.S. from Ms. Haun's class, but for unrelated reasons. Specifically, they had asked in mid-September if A.S. could be moved to a class that met earlier so he could go to school with his older brother; Principal Yeager denied the request because the class was full and in his view the change would disrupt A.S.'s routine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DF 26. The SST team met with A.S.'s parents and agreed to transfer A.S., however, effective October 8, 2014. DF 42. That same day, plaintiff was taken to Stanford Children's Health and diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. PF 85; Schwarzberg Decl., ECF No. 118, \u00b6 51; Ponton Decl., ECF No. 119, \u00b6 3. Mrs. Wormuth then homeschooled plaintiff throughout kindergarten. PF 85; Schwarzberg Decl. \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At all relevant times, defendant Kirk Nicholas was the District Superintendent and defendant Khushwinder Gill was the Assistant Superintendent. Nicholas Decl., ECF No. 102-4, \u00b6 2; Gill Decl., ECF 102-2, \u00b6 2. Nicholas's responsibilities as Superintendent include general management, oversight, budgeting and strategic direction. Nicholas Decl. \u00b6 2. Gill was responsible, in part, for managing and overseeing employee, parent and community complaints. Gill Decl. \u00b6 2. Principal Yeager met with Gill at least twice to discuss A.S.'s behavior, first in early September and again immediately after A.s.' suspension on October 3, 2014. Hansen Decl. Ex. C (\"Yeager Dep.\"), ECF No. 114, at 47:2-8, 49:14-24, 157:14-16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The job descriptions for Gill and for Nicholas each encompassed high-level school policy decisions; neither of them were responsible for daily supervision, evaluation or disciplining of students, teachers or administrators.

(\"FAC\"), ECF No. 14 (filed December 2015); Stipulations, ECF Nos. 122, 129 (filed August 2017). The stipulations had the effect of leaving one plaintiff, H.W., six claims and four defendants. ECF No. 129. The six remaining claims are as follows: An equal protection and substantive due process claim against Principal Yeager under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (claim one); a Title II Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") disability discrimination claim against the Lammersville Union School District (\"District\"), in which the Altamont School is located (claim 2); another disability discrimination claim against the District, under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation\n   Act (claim 3); a negligence claim against the District, Superintendent Kirk Nicholas, Assistant Superintendent Khushwinder Gill, and Principal Yeager (claim four); an Unruh Act disability discrimination claim against the District and Principal Yeager (claim five); and a California Education Code section 220 claim against the District (claim six).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants have moved for summary judgment on all claims. Plaintiff has opposed. Defendants filed a reply brief, ECF No. 140 (filed Sept. 5, 2017), and evidence to support their reply brief, ECF No. 143 (filed Sept. 15, 2017). Plaintiff has moved to strike this belated, piecemeal filing. ECF No. 141. Defendants have not responded to the motion to strike nor provided any justification for its belated filing, and the deadline to do so has now lapsed. Pl.'s Notice of Non-Opp'n, ECF No. 146. Accordingly, the court will not consider any evidence filed in support of defendants' reply brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Yu Decl., EC No. 143.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A court will grant summary judgment \"if ... there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The evidence shows, beyond dispute, that Principal Yeager's more vigilant response to A.S.'s harassment of two female students was based on the nature of their complaints. No facts or evidence indicate Yeager's response was driven by gender in any respect. Before October, Principal Yeager had heard only that A.S. kicked, pushed, hit and spat on virtually every student in the class, boys and girls alike, albeit plaintiff more than others. He had not heard about any inappropriate touching of any student in the bathroom. DFs 20-25. But on October 2, 2014, Ms. Haun told Principal Yeager that A.S. followed two female students into the bathroom and may have touched them inappropriately. DF 31-35. Because the bathroom conduct was a new and entirely different form of harassment than had previously been reported, the victims of those incidents were not similarly situated to plaintiff.

Although pled under a new Fourteenth Amendment vehicle (due process, not equal protection), the complaint's overall theme makes this claim predictable. The crux of plaintiff's lawsuit is that defendants inadequately responded to A.S.'s misbehavior and by doing so failed to protect plaintiff from being bullied. The complaint alleges a \"deprivation of constitutional rights of H.W. by [defendants'] failure to act in response to notifications of bullying and harassment on the campus[,]\" and explains defendants \"repeatedly exposed H.W. to the risk of abuse, harassment, and ultimately, sexual attacks that left him with severe psychological injuries[.]\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 40, 44.

Although these decisions arose at the pleading stage, their conclusions are sensible to apply here: A nexus between the alleged disability and the alleged bullying is a prerequisite to a disability-based bullying claim.

For instance, A.S. appeared indiscriminate: He kicked and spat on virtually every classmate, disabilities aside, and included his own teacher as a target.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DFs 11, 14-15; Haun Dep. 72:4-7. His violent behavior was triggered by conflict and frustration, not by anything plaintiff did or said.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Haun Dep. 72:4-7. He also followed 60 to 80 percent of his classmates into the bathroom, not only plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PF 12; Haun Dep. 71:1-12. Ms. Haun, who witnessed the bullying daily, had no reason to believe the bullying was linked to plaintiff's disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DFs 11-13. Even plaintiff's parents, when asked about A.S.'s possible motives for bullying, did not cite plaintiff's disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.
