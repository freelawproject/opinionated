It is brought pursuant to EFTA, CUTPA, and common law tenets concerning breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant has filed the within motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting that counts one through six of the complaint fail to state claims upon which relief may be granted. The issues presented are: 1) whether the complaint states a cause of action for breach of the \"Account Agreement\"; 2) whether the complaint states a cause of action for breach of the \"Opt-In Contract\"; 3) whether the complaint states a cause of action for a violation of Regulation E of the EFTA; 4) whether the plaintiff's non-contract state law claims are preempted; 5) whether the complaint sufficiently alleges a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; 6) whether the complaint sufficiently alleges a claim of unjust enrichment; 7) whether the complaint sufficiently alleges a claim of money had and received; and 8) whether the complaint states a cause of action for a violation of CUTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, the motion to dismiss counts one through six (document no. 18) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The complaint alleges the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff, Terriann Walker (hereinafter \"Walker\"), was a customer of the defendant, People's United Bank (hereinafter \"PUB\") at all relevant times to this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   PUB is a federally chartered stock savings bank. PUB's headquarters are located in Bridgeport, Connecticut. PUB operates over ten branches in the state of Connecticut. Defendants Does 1 through 100 include\n   agents, partners, joint ventures, subsidiaries, and affiliates of PUB. Does 1 through 100 own and/or operate PUB branch locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Walker brings this class action to assert claims in her own right, and in her capacity as the class representative of all other persons similarly situated. The \"class\" is composed of two separate classes. The \"Account Balance Class\" includes \"[a]ll United States residents who have or have had accounts with PUB who incurred an overdraft fee or overdraft fees when the balance in the checking account was sufficient to cover the transaction or transactions at issue during the period beginning six years preceding the filing of this Complaint and ending on November 1, 2016.\" The \"Regulation E Class\" includes \"[a]ll United States residents who have or have had accounts with PUB who incurred an overdraft fee or overdraft fees for ATM or nonrecurring debit card transaction(s) during the period beginning August 15, 2010 and through the present.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The complaint alleges that PUB maintained a policy and practice of assessing an overdraft fee on transactions when there was enough money in the checking account to pay for the transactions presented for payment, and that these charges for overdraft fees breach PUB's contracts with its customers, including Walker and other members of the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   PUB offers its consumer banking customers a checking account. One of the features of a PUB account is a debit card. Other features of a PUB checking account include the ability to write checks, withdraw money from ATMs, schedule recurring payments, and conduct other types of transactions that debit from a checking account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In connection with its processing of debit transactions, PUB assesses overdraft fees to customer accounts when it determines that a customer has overdrawn his or her account. The complaint alleges that at all relevant times, PUB had an overdraft program that was contrary to the express terms of its contract with customers, contrary to PUB's representations about its overdraft program to its customers, and contrary to its customers' expectations regarding the assessment of overdraft fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   PUB entered into a contract with Walker and its other customers known as the \"Opt-In Contract.\" This contract governs the terms under which PUB may assess overdraft fees for ATM and non-recurring debit card transactions. The \"Opt-In Contract\" states, \"[a]n overdraft occurs when you do not have enough money in your account to cover a transaction, but we pay it anyway.\" The complaint alleges that the \"Opt-In Contract\" does not describe PUB's actual overdraft practice, and, therefore, that it fails to comply with the requirements of Regulation E of EFTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   PUB entered into a second contract with Walker and its other customers known at the \"Account Agreement.\" The \"Account Agreement\" contains a promise that PUB will not charge overdraft fees for any type of transaction where there is enough money in the account to pay for the transaction. The terms of the version of the \"Account Agreement\" dated March 2016 state, \"[a]n Overdraft Fee will be charged against your account if there are insufficient funds in your account to pay an Item drawn against your account.\" The \"Account Agreement\" also states, \"[a]n overdraft takes place on an account when an Item is presented for payment on the account and there are insufficient funds or insufficient available funds to pay the Item in full.\" The complaint alleges that these two sections are \"potentially in contradiction... creating a possible ambiguity in this second contract within its own terms.\" Furthermore, the complaint alleges that\n   nowhere in the \"Account Agreement\" does it state that, for purposes of an overdraft fee, that PUB would deduct the funds in the account holds for pending debit card transactions, or that pending debit card transactions would be subtracted from the balance to create a \"lower artificial balance\" different from the \"real balance\" for purposes of assessing an overdraft fee. The complaint alleges that PUB did not include such a clause in the \"Account Agreement\" until November 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In November 2016, PUB changed its \"Account Agreement,\" and stated that PUB would place holds on pending debit card transactions and thereby reduce the balance available for purposes of assessing when an overdraft would occur. PUB defined \"available balance\" to account for holds on pending debit card transactions. The complaint alleges that only after the November 2016 Account Agreement went into effect was there consideration of placing holds on pending debit card transactions and deducting those holds from the funds in a customer's account to determine whether an overdraft fee may be assessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The complaint alleges that PUB's policy and practice was to assess overdraft fees based on an \"artificial internal calculation by which it deducts holds it has placed on either pending debit card transactions or deposits, rather than use the actual money in the account... or the funds in the account... without deduction for pending debit card transactions to determine whether an overdraft has occurred.\" Furthermore, the complaint alleges that PUB charged Walker and its other customers overdraft fees for ATM and non-recurring card purchases without obtaining consent to do so. The complaint alleges that Walker was harmed by PUB's policy and practice of charging overdraft fees when there was money in her account to cover the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In count one, the complaint alleges that PUB breached the \"Opt-In Contract.\" Specifically, the complaint alleges that, in the \"Opt-In Contract,\" PUB promised that it would assess overdraft fees \"only when there was not enough money in the account to cover the transaction,\" and that PUB breached the express terms of the contract by \"assessing overdraft fees when there was money in the account to cover the transaction or transactions at issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In count two, the complaint alleges that PUB breached the \"Account Agreement Contract.\" Specifically, the complaint alleges that, in the \"Account Agreement Contract,\" PUB promised that it would assess overdraft fees \"when there were 'insufficient funds' in the account to cover the transaction,\" and that \"[n]owhere did the Account Agreement contract state it would deduct pending debit card transactions for purposes of determining 'sufficient funds' when assessing an overdraft fee.\" The complaint alleges that PUB breached the express terms of the \"Account Agreement Contract\" by \"assessing overdraft fees when there were sufficient funds in the account to cover the transaction or transactions at issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In count three, the complaint alleges that PUB breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Specifically, the complaint alleges that PUB breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \"based on its practices of assessing fees when there was enough money in the account to cover the transaction, failing to provide an accurate description of its overdraft program in its Account Agreement contract, and failing to provide an accurate description of its overdraft program for non-recurring debit and ATM transactions in its Opt-In Contract.\" The complaint alleges that PUB \"executed a contractual obligation in bad faith, depriving [the] [p]laintiff and the [c]lass members of the\n   full benefit of the contract.\" In count three, the complaint also alleges that \"[a]s a result of the wrongful misconduct... [the] [d]efendant unjustly received millions of dollars in overdraft fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In count four, the complaint alleges that PUB \"has obtained money from [the] [p]laintiff and the [c]lass members by the exercise of undue influence, menace or threat, compulsion or duress, and/or mistake of law and/or fact,\" and that, as a result, PUB \"has in its possession money which, inequity, belongs to [the] [p]laintiff and the [c]lass members.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In count five, the complaint alleges that \"[b]y charging overdraft fees on ATM and nonrecurring transactions, PUB violated Regulation E... whose 'primary objective' is 'the protection of consumers' and which 'carries out the purposes of [EFTA]...' whose 'primary objective' is also 'the provision of individual consumer rights.' \" Specifically, the complaint alleges that PUB \"failed to comply with Regulation E... which requires affirmative consent before a financial institution is permitted to assess overdraft fees against customers' accounts through an overdraft program for ATM and non-recurring debit card transactions,\" and that PUB \"failed to comply with the... opt-in requirements, including failing to provide its customers with a valid description of the overdraft program,\" in that \"it states that an overdraft occurs when there is not enough money in the account to cover a transaction but PUB pays it anyway, when in fact PUB assesses overdraft fees when there is enough money in the account to pay for the transaction at issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In count six, the complaint alleges that PUB \"has engaged in unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices against [the] [p]laintiff and the [c]lass members in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act,\" in that PUB \"promised [the] [p]laintiff and the [c]lass members in its contracts and in other representations, including marketing materials, that it would only assess fees for overdrafts where the transaction at issue exceeded the amount of money in the customer's account.\" The complaint alleges that \"[t]hose promises were intended to induce [the] [p]laintiff to engage in an obligation, signing up for an account with [the] [d]efendant, and/or entry into [the] [d]efendant's overdraft program, and they were untrue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court must grant a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if a plaintiff fails to establish a claim upon which relief may be granted.

The complaint alleges that the \"Account Agreement\" does not state that it would \"deduct pending debit card transactions for purposes of determining 'sufficient funds' when assessing an overdraft fee. The court concludes that, as alleged in the complaint, there is a reasonable basis for a difference of opinion concerning the language of the \"Account Agreement.\" Because the complaint alleges sufficient facts that PUB breached the \"Account Agreement,\" PUB's motion to\n   dismiss count two for failure to state a cause of action is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
