Plaintiff filed a five-count Complaint against Defendants, including claims for: (1) violation of her First Amendment freedom of speech and association rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Michigan Constitution (Counts I and II); (2) conspiracy to intimidate a witness, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count III); (3) violation of the Michigan Whistleblowers' Protection Act, M.C.L. \u00a7 15.361\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"WPA\") (Count IV); and (4) wrongful discharge in violation of Michigan public policy (Count V). Defendants have filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, and the Motion has been fully briefed. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants in part and denies in part the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff began working for the District in 1986 as a teacher. In the 2012/2013 school year, after 26 years as a teacher, she became a \"Special Assistant to the Superintendent.\" The Superintendent of the District was Deborah Wahlstrom (\"Wahlstrom\"). For the 2013/2014 school year, Plaintiff was hired as one of the two Assistant Superintendents for the District, a position she also held for the 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 school years. As Assistant Superintendent, Plaintiff's duties included being in charge of the homeless student population, staffing, curriculum, professional development, school improvement interventions, School Improvement Grants (\"SIG\"), and applying for other grants and awards to obtain funds for the District acting as the clerk for the Board of Trustees of the District (the \"Board\"). Plaintiff represents that she was the ultimate supervisor of the special education department (30-40% of students in the District), which was the source of a significant amount of funding for the District from the State of Michigan. According to District documents, 40% of Plaintiff's duties were attributable to curriculum and instruction, 35% to development coordinator, and 25% to school improvement interventions coordinator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or about April 13, 2015, Wahlstrom (\"Wahlstrom\") received an anonymous letter jointly addressed to her, the Board, the \"Mount Clemens High School Administration,\" and Mitch Hotts (\"Hotts\"), a reporter for the Macomb Daily newspaper. That letter sought to \"expose some unethical and illegal practices that are taking place at Mount Clemens High School,\" which allegedly included Defendant Jason Monk's management of the Mount Clemens Athletic Booster Club (\"Booster Club\"), his selling of food from his own restaurant at sporting events under the guise of raising money for the Booster Club, his lack of a permit or license from the City of Mount Clemens or its Health Department to sell such food, and various other allegations of conflicts of interest and nepotism related to Defendant Monk's coaching the high school girls' volleyball and basketball teams (collectively, the \"Anonymous Allegations\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A sealed copy of the Anonymous Allegations was placed on each Board member's chair prior to the start of the April 15, 2015 Board meeting. None of the Defendants (or other non-Defendant Board members) looked into the Anonymous Allegations. On May 12, 2015, Wahlstrom met with Defendant Board members Bruley,\n   Monk, and Voorhess and discussed, among other things, the Board goals on which Wahlstrom was to be evaluated. At the May 20, 2015 Board meeting, Defendant Monk thanked a number of people, including Wahlstrom. The Anonymous Allegations were not mentioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 16, 2015, Wahlstrom participated in a conference call with Plaintiff, Teresa Davis (the other Assistant Superintendent in the District at that time), and Defendant Monk. The call pertained to the Anonymous Allegations, and during this conversation, Defendant Monk indicated that he felt that \"it was a personal attack because [he] was a public figure.\" Dkt. No. 61-6, PgID 1484 (Page 121:19-21). The same day (June 16, 2015), Wahlstrom, Plaintiff, and Teresa Davis contacted the Macomb County Sheriff's Department (\"Sheriff's Department\") and the State of Michigan Attorney General's Office (\"Attorney General\") about the Anonymous Allegations for the first time. They reported to the Sheriff's Department a complaint of embezzlement and a deputy came to the high school to take a statement, which was forwarded to Detective Sergeant Stacy O'Brien to investigate. Plaintiff subsequently spoke on the phone to Detective O'Brien about the investigation on at least two occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At a Board meeting on June 17, 2015, Defendant Monk stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Final note: I was elected not to be a rubber stamp. To assure this district gets it right. Being uncomfortable is good. I will support what is right. I will challenge what needs fixing. Outside of attacks on myself, I will maintain professionalism.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dkt. No. 61-18, PgID 1719. On June 18, 2015, Wahlstrom and Defendant Earl Rickman, III (the President of the Board) sent a letter to Defendant Monk, advising him that they had begun the investigations with the Sheriff's Department and the Attorney General, as well as advising him that the Board had not authorized him to fundraise on behalf of the District and to cease any such efforts, including the use of the District's name, logo, symbols or likenesses in fundraising. In response, Defendant Monk denied any wrongdoing and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">\n   Let me conclude by stating that the approach taken with this inquiry is troubling, as it is an apparent personal attack. I have always been readily accessible and would have been willing and able to allay any concerns without need for the threatening undertone of your correspondence which, to me, borders on defamation. It questions my integrity and generates unwarranted \"water cooler\" discussions about a respected member of the School Board and a longstanding supporter of Mount Clemens Schools.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dkt. No. 61-20, PgID 1725-26. On June 29, 2015, Defendant Monk, in conjunction with a letter of reprimand related to a period when he was the head coach of the high school girls basketball team, sent Defendant Rickman an email that stated, in part: \"Since I am dealing with the conflict between me and the superintendent,...\" Dkt. No. 61-21, PgID 1728.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 28, 2015, Hotts contacted Wahlstrom with questions related to the Anonymous Allegations and the June 2015 Board meeting. On June 30, 2015, Wahlstrom and Plaintiff drafted a press release to address Hotts' inquiries and circulated it to all Board members approximately seven hours before the Board met and evaluated Wahlstrom's performance as Superintendent. The press release included statements that: (a) the District had \"received several recent inquiries about the MCB Parent Group, an organization purportedly raising funds on the District's behalf\"; and (b) \"the District directed MCB Parent Group to immediately cease\n   all fundraising efforts that suggest or imply the District's or Board's approval and further directed MCB Parent Group to immediately cease using the District's name, logo, and symbols.\" Dkt. No. 61-23, PgID 1734. On June 30, 2015, the Board held a special meeting for the purpose of discussing Wahlstrom's performance as Superintendent. Dkt. No. 61-26, PgID 1750-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 5, 2015, an investigative article written by Hotts was published in the Macomb Daily. It was titled \"Questions arise over Mount Clemens booster club headed by school board trustee.\" Dkt. No. 61-37, PgID 1842-44. The article published the text of the June 30, 2015 press release drafted by Wahlstrom and Plaintiff and quoted Wahlstrom as follows, \"There are a number of citizens and people working with the booster club who have expressed some serious concerns about the club and we are legally obligated to look into these matters.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When Hotts asked Defendant Monk about the Anonymous Allegations, Defendant Monk responded \"talk to my attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant Rickman and Defendant Bruley testified that Defendant Monk was very upset when the July 5, 2015 article was published. Dkt. No. 61-10, PgID 1618; Dkt. No. 61-7, PgID 1557. At a special meeting of the Board on July 6, 2015 to vote on whether to renew the Agreement, 4 of the 7 Board members voted against the renewal of the Agreement. Wahlstrom's employment with the District terminated the first week of October 2015 (but her physical presence at the District offices concluded in early August 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Sheriff's Department investigation of Defendant Monk for embezzlement resulted in Detective O'Brien \"claiming that there was insufficient evidence presented to [him] at the time of [his] investigation to charge [Defendant Monk] with that charge,\" Dkt. No. 61-12, PgID 1674. Plaintiff suggests this was because there were no finances or manpower to complete the investigation. Dkt. No. 61, PgID 1201. The Attorney General's office was only given Defendant Monk's own accounting records, including a profit and loss statement and a \"Transaction Detail by Account.\" Detective O'Brien testified that he did not know if that reflected \"a correct statement of the finances of the organization.\" Dkt. No. 61-12, PgID 1671. No bank records from the Booster Club's bank were requested.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Detective O'Brien testified that Wahlstrom and Plaintiff had \"reasonable suspicions\" to think there was embezzlement and to ask the Sheriff's Department to investigate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PgID 1679.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In an undated response to a July 22, 2015 letter from the Attorney General's office, Defendant Monk reiterated that he thought that \"the Superintendent and [an unnamed] citizen previously mentioned, have conspired to defame me, my wife and my company.\" Dkt. No. 60-22, PgID 2374-76. Defendant Monk admitted that all of Wahlstrom's \"defamatory\" and \"conspiratorial\" conduct occurred prior to the Board's vote regarding the renewal of Wahlstrom's employment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    at 2375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Teresa Davis began working for the District in the fall of 2014, approximately 10 months before Defendant William Pearson did. On or before August 3, 2015, Plaintiff and Wahlstrom had complained to Defendant Rickman (as Board President) that Teresa Davis had given herself (and her team) an unauthorized raise immediately prior to a Board business committee meeting so that Teresa Davis could slip the signed contracts into the business committee's packet of documents to review and approve. Dkt. No. 60-3, PgID 1986-88. Defendant Rickman later asked Wahlstrom for copies of all salary information for employees and contracted persons in the District because of apparent \"HUGE salary\n   increases/adjustments over the past couple years.\" Dkt. No. 60, PGID 2495. When Plaintiff sought to fulfill this request, Teresa Davis emailed Plaintiff (and copied Wahlstrom and Defendant Rickman), stating \"This is a FRIENDLY REMINDER. Stay in your lane....You will not receive this information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    at 2493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff continued to complain to Wahlstrom and Defendant Rickman about the raises given to Teresa Davis and her employees and about Davis' threatening response. Wahlstrom took no action, as her employment ended in early October 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant Pearson began working for the District as Interim Superintendent on or about August 10, 2015. He previously had worked as a superintendent in the South Lyon school district for 20 years. Defendant Pearson also had worked as an Assistant Superintendent for Instructional Services for four years before that in South Lyon. He was a teacher for 11 years and last taught in a classroom in 1986. As a Superintendent, he had experience with budgets, having presented budgets to the finance committee and attended finance committee meetings for 22 years. Defendant Pearson was the treasurer of the Metro Bureau of Directors, and the Board was aware that Defendant Pearson had a wealth of experience as a superintendent, including putting together a budget.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff began complaining to Defendant Pearson about the raises in Teresa Davis' department within the first two days of Pearson's employment. Pearson quickly learned of the disparity in pay between Plaintiff and Davis-and the disparity in pay between four principals-and he was angry about the differences. At a meeting in August or September 2015 where the pay disparity issues were discussed, he said \"we can't do anything about this right now\" and slammed the door shut, even as Plaintiff was holding the door, and he told Plaintiff to keep her mouth shut about the salary differences. Dkt. No. 60-3, PgID 1988. Defendant Pearson told Plaintiff that he was not going to look into the reasons for the differences but that he would be sure the discrepancies were addressed in the next year-and he did offer to raise Plaintiff's salary commensurate with Teresa Davis' salary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    at 1987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff rejected the salary offer because \"it wasn't about me not making what she made, it was about not being able to staff and resource our classrooms,\" especially as the District had been facing large deficits that they were trying to reduce.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 23, 2015, Wahlstrom (and her company, Successline, Inc.) filed a lawsuit against the Board and the individual Board members who voted against renewing an Agreement between the District and Successline, Inc. (pursuant to which Wahlstrom was the Superintendent for the District) (the \"Wahlstrom Litigation\"). Hotts called Plaintiff that day to ask about the Wahlstrom Litigation, and Plaintiff gave Hotts Defendant Pearson's cell phone number. Defendant Pearson talked to Hotts but did not comment because the District had not been served, and Defendant Pearson then wrote an email to the Board members, notifying them that the Wahlstrom Litigation was filed. The next week, Defendant Pearson asked Plaintiff if she was \"still friends with...[or] talking to\" Wahlstrom.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    at 2008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants represent that the decisions were based on: (1) the District's need to lay off administrators to reduce the District's budget deficit; and (2) the fact that Plaintiff, like Defendant Pearson, had a curriculum background, essentially the same skill set.

There is no evidence that any other person took any action to deprive of her right to testify truthfully in that case.

No other person was identified by Defendant Pearson (in his alleged statements regarding the Board's feelings toward Plaintiff) or Plaintiff as having discussed the matter with Defendant Pearson. Plaintiff's argument is reduced to trying to use Defendant Pearson's statements to establish that he and the Board (or members of it) conspired to threaten Plaintiff's job-and terminate her-because of her relationship with Wahlstrom and alleged involvement in the Wahlstrom Litigation.

Dkt. No. 60-10, PgID 2266-67.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    As Plaintiff states, the Anonymous Allegations issue was revived in November 2015 when the Wahlstrom Litigation was filed, which was only two months before Defendant Pearson told her that she would be laid off. During those two months, he made numerous comments to her about her role in the Wahlstrom Litigation and her relationship with Wahlstrom, and he recommended her termination to the Board at its first meeting after the Wahlstrom Litigation had been served.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Defendants close their argument regarding the WPA claim by noting that they have a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Plaintiff, as discussed in Section III.B.1.C. Defendants state that it was a simple decision: \"the administration was overstaffed, an assistant superintendent position needed to be eliminated, Defendant Pearson could perform the duties that Plaintiff was performing, as a result, Plaintiff's position was eliminated and she was laid off.\" Dkt. No. 49, PgID 552-53.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Plaintiff responds that the \"curriculum\"-focused argument (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , that curriculum was all she did and that Defendant Pearson's skill set was duplicative of hers) is erroneous. Plaintiff states that there is evidence that Defendant Pearson is skilled in the financial aspects of running a school district, even more so than \"planning curriculum\" over the last 25 years. Plaintiff notes that Defendant Pearson admitted having experience with budgets, apparently even putting the budget together in South Lyon, before coming to the District and also participated in drafting the budget for the District. Dkt. No. 60-5. PgID 2085. Defendant Pearson was the treasurer of the Metro Bureau of Directors and Defendant Rickman (the Board President) testified that he knew Pearson had a wealth of knowledge as a superintendent, including putting together a budget. Dkt. No. 60-10, PgID 2269. Conversely, the last time Pearson was \"managing\" or changing curriculum for a district was between 1991-95, and he has not been in a classroom since 1985. As he admits, those four years, plus a degree from 1985, constitute the extent of his \"background in curriculum.\" Dkt. No. 60-5, PgID 2086-87; Dkt. No. 60-43, PgID 2515-18.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    As Plaintiff argues, there is evidence that Defendant Pearson could perform both Plaintiff's duties and Davis' duties, so there is a genuine issue of material fact that Defendants' proffered reason did not actually motivate the termination of Plaintiff. The Court finds that genuine issues of material fact exist whether the proffered reason for Plaintiff's termination-that Plaintiff was terminated because \"Dr. Pearson could perform the duties that [Plaintiff] was performing\"-was pretext for retaliation. The Court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss the WPA claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <strong>\n     F. Michigan Public Policy Claim\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    A public policy claim cannot be sustained where there is an applicable statutory prohibition against discharge in retaliation for the conduct at issue.\n    <em>\n     Dudewicz v.

As Defendant argues, Plaintiff's public policy discharge claim is based on the allegation that she \"failed to and refused to violate or acquiesce in, or reported, violations of laws governing fraud, embezzlement, conversion and health code violations, as well as other civil and criminal laws...\" and that her termination was in retaliation for her \"failure and refusal to violate or acquiesce in, or report, violations of law and her protected internal reporting of violations of law and regulations.\" Dkt. No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 96-98.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The Court finds that Plaintiff's public policy discharge allegations are based on the same facts and circumstances as those she cites in support of her WPA claim: (a) her participation in the investigation of the Anonymous Allegations; (b) her relationship with Wahlstrom; and (c) her complaints regarding the pay raises given to Davis and her team. Plaintiff apparently agrees with this analysis, as her response does not address her public policy discharge\n    claim. Accordingly, the Court dismisses Plaintiff's public policy discharge claim as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    <strong>\n     V.
