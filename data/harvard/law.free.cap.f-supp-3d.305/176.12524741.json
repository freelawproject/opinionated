Before the court are Defendant's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 34 (Def. Mem.) ) and Plaintiff Jeffrey Stein's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 40 (Pl. Mem. &amp; Opp'n) ). Upon consideration of the parties' filings, and for the reasons stated herein, the court will GRANT Defendant's motion and DENY Plaintiff Stein's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of this case are set forth in more detail in the court's February 18, 2015 Memorandum Opinion regarding Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Discovery. ECF No. 27 (Mem. Op.). In that opinion, this court granted Defendant's motion, denied Plaintiffs' motion, and dismissed Plaintiffs' four-count Complaint in its entirety. Mem. Op. at 25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 28 (Order, Feb. 18, 2015). Most relevant to the parties' current cross-motions, the court found that \"the law and the undisputed facts\" entitled Defendant to summary judgment on Count III of Plaintiffs' Complaint. Mem. Op. at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In Count III, Plaintiffs challenged the FBI's interim release policy, which requires the electronic production of medium to large FOIA document requests on multiple CD-ROMs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Compl.) \u00b6\u00b6 41-67. Plaintiffs alleged that the FBI's practice of producing electronic documents in increments of 500 pages per CD, and at a cost of $15 per CD, results in excessive fees for FOIA requesters in violation of FOIA's fee provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 64. In its February 18 opinion, this court found that the FBI's interim release policy, including its fee structure, was \"consistent with its obligations under FOIA and applicable regulations.\" Mem. Op. at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Stein appealed this court's decision on Count III, and the D.C. Circuit found that the FBI's interim release policy did \"not result in a violation of FOIA's mandate that agencies recover only 'reasonable standard charges.' \"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Sec.

The Circuit stated that it did not \"question the possibility that the agency will adequately demonstrate on remand that the FBI's labor (or other direct) costs under the interim release policy in fact equal or exceed $15 per CD,\" and noted that \"the agency might be able to do so in short order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277526\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/467/#p472\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This court finds that it has.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In support of its Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendant submitted a detailed, eight-page declaration from David M. Hardy, Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section in the FBI's Records Management Division. ECF No. 34-2 (Third Hardy Decl.). In his declaration, Hardy explains that the Integrity program enables the FBI to move records \"from its FOIA Document Processing System ('FDPS'), which is a classified computer network on which records responsive to FOIA requests are processed, to a non-classified computer network from which a CD can be prepared for release.\" Third Hardy Decl. \u00b6 6. He further explains that the three major steps of the Integrity program process-document conversion, Integrity scan, and resolution of issues-all require employee engagement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277526\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/467/#p472\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At the document conversion step, for example, FBI employees are solely responsible for converting documents released from FDPS into single-page text documents in preparation for the Integrity program's security scan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Such a conversion requires FBI employees to (1) export the released documents as multi-page TIF files, (2) rename the released documents and save them to a common shared drive, (3) convert each page of the released documents into a single-page text document, and (4) save each converted page onto the shared drive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This level of employee engagement, Hardy explains, continues for the duration of the 50-minute Integrity program process.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-10 (providing a detailed account of employee engagement at the Integrity scan and issue resolution steps of the process). Hardy asserts that it this level of engagement that justifies and \"underpin[s] the $15 assessed fee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Hardy Declaration sufficiently demonstrates that FBI employees are actively engaged for the duration of the Integrity program process, and in turn that the FBI justifiably calculates its direct costs for CD production based on the labor costs associated with conducting the 50-minute program. The FBI calculates its direct labor costs to be between $24.50 and $46.00 per CD,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14, which certainly exceeds the $15 it charges per CD. Accordingly, the court finds that the FBI's interim release policy, as implemented through the Integrity program, does not violate FOIA's requirement that an agency recover \"only the direct costs of search, duplication, or review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff Stein's arguments do not convince the court otherwise.

Thus, the only question before this court on remand is whether the FBI's fees exceed its direct costs. The Circuit confirmed this limited scope on August 11, 2017, when it denied Plaintiff Stein's motion to recall and modify its mandate. ECF No. 40-1 (Circuit Order, Aug. 11, 2017).

The Circuit declined to do so, and therefore this court is prohibited from considering the reasonableness of the FBI's direct costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Even if the issue of reasonableness was appropriately before this court, Stein has failed to demonstrate that the FBI's procedures, and therefore its direct costs, are unreasonable. Stein has not submitted an affidavit or declaration supporting his argument that the FBI's CD production process, and any direct costs associated with the process, are \"unreasonable\" and \"bizarre.\" Pl.

Given Plaintiff Stein's concession that a sufficient factual basis exists, the court finds that there are no disputed issues of material fact and that Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court will grant Defendant's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment and deny Plaintiff Stein's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A corresponding order will issue separately.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    In addition to vacating and remanding this court's decision as to Plaintiff Stein, the Circuit affirmed this court's grant of summary judgment to Defendant on Plaintiff NSC's claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Sec. Counselors\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277526\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/467/#p472\">\n     848 F.3d at 475\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Given the Circuit's decision, and the fact that Plaintiff Truthout declined to join in the appeal, Stein is the only plaintiff remaining in this case. Stein maintains that Plaintiff NSC alleged claims under Count III as well, and therefore remains a plaintiff in this case. Pl. Mem. &amp; Opp'n at 9 n.8. But this court has already dismissed as moot Plaintiff NSC's claims under Count III. Mem. Op. at 8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    In support of his unreasonableness argument, Stein also references a transcript from a proceeding in\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Sec. Counselors v. Central Intelligence Agency\n    </em>\n    , No. 11-443-BAH (D.D.C. Dec. 16, 2011).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl. Mem. &amp; Opp'n at 5. The court finds the discussion in the transcript inapposite. The transcribed proceeding concerned the\n    <em>\n     Central Intelligence Agency's\n    </em>\n    inability to produce electronic documents due to its production process. Here, Stein asks the court to find that the\n    <em>\n     FBI's\n    </em>\n    CD production process results in unreasonable direct costs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
