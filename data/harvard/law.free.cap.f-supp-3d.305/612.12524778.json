Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Charleston's Petition presents five claims for relief. First, he contends that the Pennsylvania courts acted contrary to clearly established federal law, under\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , in allowing the admission at trial\n   of a statement he made to a detective while in custody. Second, he contends that the admission of evidence of his tattoo deprived him of a fundamentally fair trial. Charleston's third, fourth, and fifth claims each assert the ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Specifically, he claims he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel when his counsel (1) failed to request a proper instruction to the jury regarding the hearsay testimony of a witness; (2) failed to object when, in the course of the trial judge's closing instructions to the jury, the judge advised the jury that Charleston's \"reputation for telling the truth is bad\"; and (3) failed to ask that the jury be instructed as to the possible verdict of involuntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Magistrate Judge, in her R &amp; R, recommended denying relief on each of these five claims. Charleston's Statement of Objections to the R &amp; R presents five objections, or sets of objections, to the Magistrate Judge's analysis of each claim. The Court addresses Charleston's objections in turn. As explained below, although the Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge that Charleston is not entitled to relief on any of the five grounds presented in his Petition, the Court departs from the R &amp; R's analysis in some respects and, accordingly, adopts the R &amp; R in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Objection One, concerning the admission of Charleston's statement, is overruled.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Charleston's first objection to the R &amp; R concerns the admissibility of a statement he made to Homicide Detective Greg Singleton. As explained in detail below, Charleston was taken into police custody the evening of July 16, 2009, and was questioned by Detective Singleton the following morning. After obtaining some biographical information from Charleston, the detective asked Charleston about the circumstances of Stanton's death, and Charleston \"described his involvement in the incident.\" The detective then provided the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings to Charleston and took a formal statement from him, which the detective transcribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In a pretrial motion, Charleston moved to suppress his formal post-warning statement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that it was coerced in violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda.\n   </em>\n   After a suppression hearing, the motion was denied, and the post-warning statement was read into the record during the trial. The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the statement was admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his present Petition, Charleston contends that Detective Singleton deliberately withheld the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings until after he had obtained a confession (i.e., the initial, pre-warning statement) and that the formal, post-warning statement was therefore inadmissible under the rule established by the United States Supreme Court in the case of\n   <em>\n    Missouri v. Seibert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    542 U.S. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). The Magistrate Judge, in the R &amp; R, found that Charleston's statement was admissible under\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   and that Charleston was not entitled to relief on this claim. Charleston objects to this analysis and contends that\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   , properly understood, renders his formal, post-warning statement inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Factual and procedural background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The factual background of Charleston's statement is as follows. Around 9:00 p.m. on July 16, 2008, approximately one month after William Stanton's death, Philadelphia\n   Police Officer Anthony Soliman and his partner, responding to a 911 call concerning the presence of a homicide suspect in the area, drove to 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and Hagert Streets, where they encountered Charleston, who matched the description of the suspect. Suppression Hearing, N.T., Aug. 17, 2009, at 8-34 (hereinafter \"Suppr. N.T.\"). The officers told Charleston that they needed to ask him some questions but that he was not under arrest, and they asked him to sit in their police car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 30. Charleston agreed to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 30. While Charleston was sitting in the car, Clara Stanton, the mother of the victim, approached the officers and told them that she was the one who had called 911 and that Charleston had murdered her son, William Stanton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. Officer Soliman asked Charleston what he knew about William Stanton, and Charleston stated that he knew nothing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, 39, 43-44. Officer Soliman then called the Homicide Unit, and Detective Singleton, who had been investigating the Stanton murder, told Officer Soliman to handcuff Charleston and bring him to the station.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, 80; Trial N.T., Aug. 24, at 5-12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Soliman told Charleston that some detectives wanted to talk to him, and the officers brought Charleston to the Homicide Unit of the police station, where they arrived at about 9:35 p.m. Suppr. N.T. at 33, 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After Charleston was brought to the station, Officer Soliman, along with Detective Singleton, took Charleston into an \"interview room.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35, 52, 79. Officer Soliman did not know if the door was locked, but both Officer Soliman and Detective Singleton acknowledged that Charleston was not free to leave at that point.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35, 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Detective Singleton testified that after he helped place Charleston in the interview room that evening, he briefly spoke with Charleston but declined to interview him at that time because he appeared to be \"under the influence of either alcohol or some narcotics substance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-53. Detective Singleton did not mention to Charleston anything about the Stanton killing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54. The detective left Charleston alone in the room at about 10:00 p.m. and did not see him again until 10:00 a.m. the next morning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78-79, 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At 10:00 a.m. the next morning, Detective Singleton, along with another detective, returned to the interview room where Charleston had been placed. Detective Singleton observed that Charleston \"appeared to be sober and more coherent,\" and he gave him a cheese sandwich and water.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54, 90. He began asking Charleston biographical questions in order to fill out a biographical form.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54. Charleston was cooperative in answering these questions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55. After Detective Singleton completed the biographical form, he \"asked [Charleston] about the circumstances surrounding the murder of William Stanton, and [Charleston] explained in\n   some detail what occurred in the house.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. Detective Singleton testified that when he first started speaking to Charleston about the incident, Charleston \"was immediately receptive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Detective Singleton testified that, after Charleston explained what occurred in the house, \"[a]t some point, I stopped [Charleston] and read him his rights and prepared the memorandum form for...the sheets, the warnings for his rights, and he signed off on them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Detective Singleton used a \"75-331 form,\" which \"reflects the warnings and the information on who's being interviewed, the date, time, location, who's interviewing and who's present at the time of the interview.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57. Detective Singleton testified that, as reflected on the form, he read a series of warnings to Charleston concerning his rights to remain silent and to have an attorney, and Charleston provided his signature or initials under each warning, signifying that he understood his rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Detective Singleton testified that he provided the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings to Charleston at approximately 10:20 a.m.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial N.T., Aug. 21, at 160.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Charleston signed the forms waiving his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, Detective Singleton \"then proceeded to take a statement from [Charleston], a formal statement.\" Suppr. N.T. at 56. In so doing, Detective Singleton asked Charleston a series of questions about the shooting, and the detective transcribed the questions and answers onto the above-mentioned 75-331 form, after which Charleston reviewed and signed the form, as well a \"statement adoption attestation form.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-70. The interview was completed at 12:20 p.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69. Detective Singleton testified that Charleston \"seemed very cooperative and eager to tell his portion of the story\" during the course of making his statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70. The interview was completed at 12:20 p.m., about two hours and twenty minutes after it had begun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Later that day, Charleston was formally arrested for Stanton's murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In Charleston's formal statement, which Detective Singleton read into the record during the suppression hearing and at trial, Charleston stated that on June 15, the day of the shooting, he and Stanton were standing outside on the street \"talking about the Xanies\" (Xanax pills) that Charleston wanted to buy from Stanton, when they decided to enter the residence on 2428 North 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street to conduct the transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62, 65, 66. After they entered the residence, they began to argue about the pills, at which point, according to Charleston's statement, \"[Stanton] pulled out the gun and I started rustling with him over the gun. While I was rustling with him, the gun went off about three times. I took the gun and left the house threw it\n   into the sewer right on the corner of [25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ] Street.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63. Charleston stated that the gun was \"in both of our hands\" when the shots were fired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He added that \"[i]t was self-defense\" and \"[i]t's not like I pointed it at him and shot him or nothing like that.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Before trial, Charleston moved to suppress his formal, post-warning statement, arguing that, among other things, he was subjected to coercive conditions when he was kept in the interview room overnight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105. The trial judge held a suppression hearing, at the conclusion of which he denied the motion, finding that the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings were properly given, that there was \"no evidence of coercion,\" and that, on the contrary, there was evidence of a lack of coercion, \"given the provisions of food and the ability to sleep to ward off the effects of substances which caused the intoxication.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   3 On direct appeal, the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the trial court's denial of Charleston's motion to suppress his statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Com. v. Charleston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7281732\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/16/505/\">\n    16 A.3d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Super.

In his present Petition, Charleston contends that the Pennsylvania courts' determination that his statement was admissible at trial was contrary to clearly established federal law, particularly as set forth by the United States Supreme Court in the case of\n   <em>\n    Missouri v. Seibert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    542 U.S. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. United States Supreme Court case law on \"two-step interrogations\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The interrogation at issue in this case is an example of what is known as a \"two-step interrogation\" (or \"two-stage interview\" or \"question-first procedure\"), in which officers first elicit a custodial statement without providing\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and then, after providing the warnings, elicit a second statement. In this case, as detailed above, Detective Singleton initially elicited a statement from Charleston about his involvement in the Stanton murder and then, after obtaining this initial statement, read Charleston his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and obtained a formal statement, which the detective transcribed and which was introduced at trial. In cases involving two-step interrogations, generally the initial, pre-warning statement is clearly inadmissible. Here, as noted above, there was no attempt to introduce Charleston's initial statement at trial. But often a contested issue in such cases, as here, is whether the second, post-warning statement is admissible. As the Magistrate Judge observed, an overview of the relevant United States Supreme Court case law on this issue is helpful in order to understand the parties' arguments concerning what constitutes \"clearly established Federal law\" in this area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Two-step interrogations were first specifically addressed by the Supreme Court\n   in the case of\n   <em>\n    Oregon v. Elstad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n    470 U.S. 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n    84 L.Ed.2d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985), in which an officer inadvertently elicited a custodial statement prior to administering\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and then, after providing the warnings, obtained a more complete statement. Reversing the state court's determination that the second statement must be suppressed, the Supreme Court held that \"absent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement, the mere fact that a suspect has made an unwarned admission does not warrant a presumption of compulsion\" with respect to the second statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 314,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, \"[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, in fact, the second statement was also voluntarily made\" and, \"[a]s in any such inquiry, the finder of fact must examine the surrounding circumstances and the entire course of police conduct with respect to the suspect in evaluating the voluntariness of his statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 318,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299279\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/298/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court begins by observing that the record lacks any subjective evidence of Detective Singleton's intent. As set forth above, Detective Singleton testified that, prior to administering the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, he asked Charleston \"about the circumstances surrounding the murder of William Stanton,\" in response to which Charleston \"explained in some detail what occurred in the house,\" and that \"at some point\" thereafter the detective provided the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings to Charleston. But Detective Singleton did not testify as to\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   he did not provide the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings before asking Charleston about the circumstances of Stanton's murder, nor did he testify as to why he chose to administer the warnings when he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Turning to the objective evidence, the first\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   factor considers the \"completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation.\" In particular, courts have found that where the pre-warning questioning is \"systematic, exhaustive, and managed with psychological skill,\" as in\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   , it is more likely that the omission of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings was deliberate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Similarly, where the pre-warning questioning is non-confrontational, it is more likely that the omission of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings was not deliberate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Within that twenty-minute period, Detective Singleton gave Charleston water and a cheese sandwich, asked Charleston a series of biographical questions, and then asked Charleston about his involvement in the shooting. Moreover, within this brief span of time, there is no evidence that Detective Singleton's questioning of Charleston was in any respect systematic or \"managed with psychological skill.\" Rather, according to Detective Singleton's testimony, he simply \"asked [Charleston] about the circumstances surrounding the murder of William Stanton,\" and Charleston, in response, \"seemed eager to tell his portion of the story\" and \"explained in some detail what happened in the house.\" Likewise, as indicated above, the trial judge found that there was no evidence of coercion before or during the questioning. The brief and non-confrontational pre-warning questioning in this case, then, is in sharp contrast with the intensive and extended pre-warning interview in\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   , a factor that weighs in favor of finding that Detective Singleton's omission of the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings was not deliberate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The fifth\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   factor-concerning the degree to which the interrogator's questions treated the second round as continuous with the first-also weighs in favor of a finding of non-deliberateness in this case. In\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   , as Justice Kennedy observed, the officer's intent to subvert\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   was evidenced by the fact that the post-warning questioning \"resembled a cross-examination\" in which the officer \"confronted the defendant with her inadmissible prewarning statements and pushed her to acknowledge them.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    542 U.S. at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861325\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/600/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, by contrast, Detective Singleton's post-warning questions were open-ended in nature; the detective did not pressure Charleston to conform his answers to his earlier statement, nor did the detective even refer back to that statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In addition to the first and fifth\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   factors, there are other considerations weighing in favor of a finding of non-deliberateness in this case. As Respondents point out, Detective Singleton had declined to interview Charleston the previous night because he believed Charleston was not sober. Arguably, if Detective Singleton had been intent on subverting\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , he would have seized the opportunity to question Charleston when his judgment was possibly impaired. Further, as detailed above, on the night Charleston was taken into custody he told Officer Soliman that he knew nothing about the Stanton killing. Although the record does not reflect whether Detective Singleton and Officer Soliman discussed Charleston's answer, it is a fair assumption that they had done so, given that they worked together on the evening that Charleston was brought to the station. Accordingly, Detective Singleton might well have expected that Charleston, in response to a neutrally-worded question about \"the circumstances surrounding the murder of William Stanton,\" would continue to claim that he knew nothing about the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On the other hand, several of the\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in the opposite direction. In particular, under the third and fourth\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   factors, the two interrogations occurred at the same place and time and the same police personnel were present at each interrogation, considerations that weigh in favor of a finding of deliberateness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   On balance, however, the Court finds that there is a preponderance of evidence that Detective Singleton's initial omission of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings was not a deliberate attempt to subvert\n   <em>\n    Miranda.\n   </em>\n   Particularly in view of the brief and non-confrontational nature of the initial questioning and the open-ended and similarly non-confrontational nature of the second questioning, the Court finds the detective's initial failure to read Charleston his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, \"though unfortunate and unexplained, seems much more likely to\n   have been a simple failure to administer the warnings rather than an intentional withholding that was part of a larger, nefarious plot.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reinert v.

Accordingly, the two-step interrogation in this case does not present the Court with \"the infrequent case...in which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   789 Finally, the Court finds that even if Charleston's statement was erroneously admitted, the admission did not have \"[a] substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict,\" under the standard set for by\n   <em>\n    Brecht v.

Charleston further testified that the gun fired several times and Stanton fell to the ground, facedown.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-43, 109-119. As Stanton was lying on his stomach, Charleston asked Stanton if he was ok, but Stanton did not respond, and Charleston was not sure if Stanton had been shot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112-118. After Stanton failed to respond to him, Charleston took the gun out of Stanton's hand, exited the home with the gun concealed under his shirt, and then threw the gun into a sewer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44, 120-124. He testified that he threw the gun in a sewer because he was concerned that one of the neighborhood children might come across it if he left it in the house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122-123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As the prosecutor contended in her closing argument, common sense and the evidence presented at trial contradicted every aspect of this story. First, with respect to the shooting itself, forensic evidence showed that Stanton had been shot three times, in the chest, lower abdomen, and right thigh, and that the gunshot to his chest was fired from two to six inches away and traveled horizontally straight through Stanton's heart and lungs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.T., Aug. 21, at 62-114. The evidence also showed that the gun from which the shots were fired requires that the trigger must be pulled for each shot fired, with a force of six to seven pounds. Trial N.T., Aug. 21, at 124-30. Given these facts, it is nearly impossible to imagine that the shooting occurred as Charleston testified that it did. That is, it is not credible that Charleston, who was smaller than Stanton, controlled Stanton's forearm and wrist in such a way that he caused Stanton to shoot himself three times-including one shot straight through the chest, from two to six inches away-applying six to seven pounds of pressure on the trigger each time. In short, as the prosecutor argued, Charleston's testimony that Stanton \"shoots himself and then continues to shoot himself\" does not make sense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial N.T., Aug. 24, at 176.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Charleston's testimony concerning his conduct after the shooting is similarly incredible. As the prosecutor emphasized in her closing argument, the notion that Charleston did not realize that Stanton had been shot when, by Charleston's own account, Stanton was lying on the ground in an unresponsive state, is not believable. Moreover, according to Charleston's testimony, Stanton was his friend. But, as the prosecutor pointed out, after the shooting, Charleston made no effort to call 911 or otherwise seek help. Likewise, Charleston's account of his decision to dispose of the gun also makes little sense when, if Charleston's testimony about the circumstances of the shooting were true, the gun would have had only Stanton's fingerprints on it, which would have been powerful evidence in support of Charleston's account. Finally, the jury heard evidence that Stanton's body was found with only a set of keys, a cell phone, and $3 on his person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial N.T., Aug. 20, at 96. But according to Stanton's mother, Stanton had over $500 on him earlier in the day, and Charleston testified that Stanton had Xanax pills. As the prosecutor argued, the fact that Stanton was found without the money and pills supports the prosecution's theory that Charleston robbed Stanton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The jury also heard testimony that, in the hours after the shooting, Charleston denied to several persons that he had been at 2428 North 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street or that he knew what had happened to Stanton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial N.T., Aug. 19, at 88-89, 168-70.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, Stanton's mother testified that on the afternoon of the shooting, after trying unsuccessfully to reach her son by phone, she saw Charleston walk by her house, coming from the direction of 2428 North 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street. Trial N.T., Aug. 21, at 48-61. She asked Charleston if he had seen her son, as the two were good friends and she considered Charleston to be like a son to her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-52, 60-61. Charleston replied \"no\" and kept walking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In short, even in the absence of Charleston's statement, there was overwhelming evidence of Charleston's guilt and lack of credibility, and the prosecutor drew upon all of this evidence in making her closing argument. In particular, the prosecutor closely examined the account of the shooting that Charleston presented in his testimony and showed that even if one takes that account on its own terms-setting aside its contradictions with Charleston's statement-it is not believable. Accordingly, the Court finds that the admission of Charleston's statement did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict under\n   <em>\n    Brecht.\n   </em>\n   Even without Charleston's statement,\n   there was overwhelming evidence that Charleston murdered Stanton. Charleston's first objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Objection Two, concerning the admission of tattoo evidence, is overruled.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   10 Charleston's second objection concerns his claim that his due process rights were violated by the admission of evidence that he had a tattoo of the words \"By any means necessary, f--- it, s--- happens.\" He contends that the admission of this evidence deprived him of a fundamentally fair trial because the prosecutor used this evidence to improperly launch an attack on his character.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Magistrate Judge determined that Charleston procedurally defaulted on this claim because he failed to present this claim to the state courts. Rather, at the state level, Charleston challenged the admission of the tattoo evidence as being an error only in state evidentiary rulings, not a federal due process violation. The Magistrate Judge acknowledged that Charleston's brief in support of his direct appeal at the state level cited a federal case, namely,\n   <em>\n    Boliek v. Delo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7824819\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/912/1199/\">\n    912 F.Supp. 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Mo. 1995), but the Magistrate Judge determined that Charleston's citation to\n   <em>\n    Boliek\n   </em>\n   , by itself, did not serve to notify the state courts that he was challenging the admission of the tattoo evidence on due process grounds. This is because the relevant finding in\n   <em>\n    Boliek\n   </em>\n   was that counsel's failure to object to the admission of irrelevant tattoo evidence violated the defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel, not that the admission of such evidence violated the defendant's due process rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Charleston objects that the\n   <em>\n    Boliek\n   </em>\n   opinion \"went beyond the question of effective assistance of counsel in order to determine whether or not the underlying claim of the [defendant's] had arguable merit.\" Pet'r's Objections 17. But the\n   <em>\n    Boliek\n   </em>\n   opinion was clear that the issue on which it was ruling was the ineffectiveness of counsel: \"This Court finds that trial counsel was ineffective. His performance and the prejudice petitioner suffered as a result of his performance undermine this Court's confidence in the outcome of the trial and of the penalty phase.\"\n   <em>\n    Boliek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7824819\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/912/1199/\">\n    912 F.Supp. at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Boliek\n   </em>\n   court made no determination as to whether admission of the tattoo evidence violated the defendant's due process rights. Accordingly, Charleston's citation to\n   <em>\n    Boliek\n   </em>\n   alone did not alert the state court that he was challenging the tattoo evidence on due process grounds, and Charleston's objection on this point is overruled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Objections Three through Five, concerning the ineffective assistance of counsel, are overruled.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Charleston's final three objections concern claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Objection Three, concerning counsel's failure to object to the trial court's limiting instruction for Clara Stanton's testimony, is overruled in part.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Charleston's first ineffectiveness of counsel objection concerns trial counsel's failure to object to a limiting instruction the trial court gave concerning the testimony of Clara Stanton, the mother of the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   During the trial, the prosecution called to the stand a witness named Nashua Sanders, a friend of Charleston and an acquaintance of the victim and the victim's mother, Clara Stanton. The prosecutor asked Ms. Sanders whether she had told Ms. Stanton that she (Sanders) had a conversation with Charleston in which Charleston stated that he planned to rob the victim. Trial N.T., Aug. 20, at 36. Sanders denied that she said this to Ms. Stanton, and she also denied that Charleston had ever told her such a thing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7824819\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/912/1199/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Following Nashua Sanders's testimony, the prosecutor called Ms. Stanton as a witness. When the prosecutor began to ask Ms. Stanton about whether she had a conversation with Nashua Sanders about what had happened to her son, defense counsel objected and a sidebar discussion was held concerning whether Ms. Stanton could testify about what Ms. Sanders had purportedly said to her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63. The trial judge deferred issuing a definitive ruling on the matter and later that same afternoon heard further argument from the parties. The prosecutor argued that Ms. Stanton's testimony would be admissible under Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 613(b), which permits the admission of extrinsic evidence of a witness's prior inconsistent statement under certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 103. The prosecutor argued that this testimony was \"classic impeachment,\" i.e., she would be impeaching Nashua Sanders by providing evidence of a prior inconsistent statement that she made to Ms. Sanders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105. The trial court ruled that the testimony was admissible as extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement, but advised the attorneys that because the statement was hearsay, he would \"give a limiting instruction because just [sic] the statement was said does not mean it's true.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108. The prosecutor then stated that she was not \"asking for it to come in substantively. It's for impeachment purposes,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 108, to which the trial court responded, \"I'll allow it under that limited circumstances and I'll give a limited instruction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109. Defense counsel stated, \"Yes, your Honor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7824819\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/912/1199/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Ms. Stanton was then recalled to the stand, where she testified that about three weeks after her son's death, Ms. Sanders told her about a conversation that she (Sanders) had with Charleston about a week before the shooting, in which Charleston said that he planned to rob the victim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111-12. Following Ms. Stanton's testimony, the trial court gave the following limiting instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the testimony that you just heard, I'm just going to give you an instruction and that evidence is not necessarily to be accepted for the truth of the statements made by Ms. Sanders to Ms. Stanton, okay. It doesn't-they were statements and you will be given additional instructions at the appropriate time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116. There were no objections made to this instruction. No further instruction regarding this testimony was included in the closing instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The parties agree that Ms. Stanton's testimony was admissible solely for the purpose of impeaching Ms. Sanders under Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 613. Charleston contends that the trial court's instruction that Ms. Stanton's statements were \"not necessarily\" to be accepted for\n   the truth of the matter asserted was erroneous and prejudicial, and that trial counsel's failure to request a proper instruction deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In its review of Charleston's appeal under Pennsylvania's Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), the Superior Court determined that Charleston had waived this claim for two reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Com. v. Charleston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6935247\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/94/1012/#p1021\">\n    94 A.3d 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1021 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2014). First, the Superior Court determined that Charleston had failed to adequately develop an argument under\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1806001,1806092\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/515/153/\">\n    515 Pa. 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1806092\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/515/153/1806092/\">\n    527 A.2d 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), which requires that, in order to prove counsel ineffective, the petitioner must show that: (1) his underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) counsel had no reasonable basis for his action or inaction; and (3) the petitioner suffered actual prejudice as a result. The Superior Court determined that Charleston's briefing (1) \"fail[ed] to develop an argument or present\n   <strong>\n    pertinent\n   </strong>\n   authority that the court's use of the colloquial expression 'not necessarily' rendered its instruction fatally equivocal\"; (2) \"fail[ed] to develop an argument that counsel had no reasonable basis not to request an additional instruction,\"; and (3) failed to develop an argument that there exists a \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's alleged unprofessional error in not requesting a second instruction, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    Charleston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6935247\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/94/1012/#p1021\">\n    94 A.3d at 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the Superior Court indicated that Charleston waived this claim under Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 2119(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is because Charleston \"merely assume[d] that the statement at issue was introduced by the Commonwealth as substantive evidence of [his] intent to commit 'murder and robbery,' rather than as evidence of an inconsistent statement\" and because he merely \"relie[d] on a lengthy quotation from the prosecutor's closing argument\" in support of this claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1022.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In addition to its waiver analysis, the Superior Court also determined that Charleston's \"challenge to the jury instruction which the trial court actually gave does not have merit,\" in view of the broad discretion that trial courts have in phrasing their instructions under Pennsylvania law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1021. Moreover, the court found that \"trial counsel had an obvious reasonable basis not to seek an additional instruction, which would have necessarily reminded the jury of the underlying statement that [Charleston] planned to rob the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6935247\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/94/1012/#p1021\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the court concluded that Charleston's claim \"is waived and would not merit relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6935247\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/94/1012/#p1021\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In reviewing this claim as presented in Charleston's habeas corpus Petition, the Magistrate Judge initially considered the question of whether the Court has an independent duty to review the Superior Court's determination that Charleston waived this claim under Pennsylvania law. As the Magistrate Judge observed, several\n   courts in this Circuit have determined that the question of whether a habeas corpus petitioner complied with state appellate rules \"is a matter of state law, beyond [the federal court's] review.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klein v.

Nevertheless, relying on\n   <em>\n    Rolan v. Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3881475\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/311/\">\n    680 F.3d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2012), the Magistrate Judge determined that the Court has a duty to independently review the Superior Court's analysis of the waiver issue. R &amp; R at 21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Applying that analysis, the Magistrate Judge reached the same conclusion as the Superior Court, namely that Charleston waived this claim by failing to adequately develop his\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   argument in his state court briefing. Specifically, the Magistrate Judge determined that Charleston failed to adequately present an argument that he had suffered actual prejudice, as his sole argument on this point in his state court briefing was that \"[s]ince intent was the key issue for the jury to resolve, he was surely prejudiced.\" R &amp; R at 53 (quoting Appellant's Brief at 12-13). Because Charleston \"offered no argument or pertinent caselaw to establish that the admission of such hearsay evidence regarding motive could result in a different result,\" the Magistrate Judge concluded that he failed to substantially comply with Pennsylvania's appellate rules. R &amp; R at 35-36.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Charleston objects that his PCRA briefing did, in fact, fairly present his argument on this issue. In particular, he directs this Court's attention to the dissenting opinion of the Honorable Judith Olson of the Superior Court, who disagreed with the conclusion of Superior Court majority's opinion that Charleston had waived this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   1112 Reviewing this issue de novo, first, with respect to the waiver issue, the Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge that, in light of the Third Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Rolan\n   </em>\n   , the Court has a responsibility to independently review the Superior Court's determination that Charleston waived this claim. Having reviewed Charleston's PCRA briefing, the Court finds that although Charleston's argument on this issue was somewhat lacking in legal citations and analysis, his argument was sufficiently clear to avoid waiver of the claim. As\n   Judge Olson observed, Charleston's brief \"devoted over 1600 words, filling six and one-half pages, of his argument section to addressing this single issue,\" providing thirteen citations to trial testimony and four case citations.\n   <em>\n    Charleston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6935247\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/94/1012/#p1021\">\n    94 A.3d at 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Olson, J., concurring and dissenting). In particular, with respect to the prejudice element of his claim, Charleston's argument that \"intent was the key issue to resolve\" was sufficiently clear where it was evident that one of the issues in this case was whether (as Charleston testified) the shooting occurred as the result of a struggle over Stanton's gun or whether (as the prosecutor argued) the shooting occurred as the result of Charleston's attempt to obtain Stanton's Xanax and money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   13 Second, with respect to the merits of Charleston's claim, this Court must defer to the Superior Court's determination that Charleston's \"challenge to the jury instruction which the trial court actually gave does not have merit\" under Pennsylvania law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Priester v.

You should not disbelieve the defendant's testimony merely because he is the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   There was evidence tending to prove that the defendant has prior criminal convictions. And I'm speaking of the record introduced by the Commonwealth by stipulation.\n   <em>\n    The assistant district attorney introduced evidence tending to show that the defendant's reputation for telling the truth is bad.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   This evidence is not evidence of the defendant's guilt. You must not infer guilt from the evidence of prior convictions. This evidence may be considered by you for one purpose only, that is, to help you judge the credibility and weight of the testimony given by the defendant as a witness in this trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In considering the evidence of prior convictions, you may consider the types of crimes committed, how long ago they were committed, and how it may affect the likelihood that the defendant has testified truthfully in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 226-27 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In his Petition, Charleston contends that the trial judge conflated\n   <em>\n    crimen falsi\n   </em>\n   evidence and credibility evidence, and that there was, in fact, no evidence presented at trial that his \"reputation for telling the truth is bad.\" He claims that his counsel's failure to object to the judge's instruction on this point deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   1516 Applying the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard, the Magistrate Judge determined that counsel's failure to object was not objectively unreasonable in the context of the case. As the Magistrate Judge points out, the trial court's reference to Charleston's reputation was \"sandwiched between sentences referring to Charleston's prior convictions.\" R &amp; R at 42. Accordingly, \"[r]ather than objecting and having the court focus its attention even further on Charleston's prior convictions, perhaps even repeating that he had two theft convictions and one conviction for unauthorized use of a vehicle, counsel may have strategically chosen to remain silent on the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to the prejudice element of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , the Magistrate Judge concluded that \"it is unlikely that the jury was well-versed in Pennsylvania evidentiary law or that it appreciated the distinction between Charleston's prior convictions and a reputation for untruthfulness\" and, furthermore, \"the jury had other reasons to question Charleston's credibility,\" including the\n   <em>\n    crimen falsi\n   </em>\n   evidence\n   and the discrepancies between his version of events and the physical evidence set forth at trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge concluded that Charleston \"has failed to establish a reasonable probability that counsel's failure to object to the judge's use of the term reputation during the charge affected the outcome of the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   After de novo review of this matter, the Court adopts the R &amp; R's analysis of this issue and the objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Objection Five, concerning counsel's failure to request an involuntary manslaughter instruction, is overruled in part.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In his final objection, Charleston argues that his trial counsel was ineffective when he failed to request a jury instruction for involuntary manslaughter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Superior Court determined that, like Charleston's claim concerning Ms. Stanton's testimony, this claim was waived because Charleston failed to develop an argument for his claim under the\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   test. Further, the court determined that Charleston's claim would not merit relief because, among other things, involuntary manslaughter was not \"at issue in the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Charleston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6935247\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/94/1012/#p1021\">\n    94 A.3d at 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the court's \"independent review of the pertinent authority confirm[ed] that there is no arguable merit to [Charleston's] claims\" on this issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1027. Accordingly, the Superior Court concluded that \"[t]rial counsel's strategic decision not to pursue [the] competing theor[y] of ... involuntary manslaughter with requested instructions had a reasonable basis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6935247\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/94/1012/#p1021\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Superior Court stated that it \"discern[ed] no basis to find trial counsel ineffective, based on the information supplied by [Charleston], for pursuing his claim of self-defense and presenting the jury with a consistent theme and strategy of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6935247\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/94/1012/#p1021\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Magistrate Judge agreed with the Superior Court that Charleston waived this claim by failing to adequately brief it, concluding that Charleston failed to provide any support in his state court briefing for his contention that trial counsel \"could have no reasonable basis\" for failing to request this instruction. R &amp; R at 37. Likewise, the Magistrate Judge determined that Charleston's assertion that \"the outcome of this trial may well have been different\" had counsel requested the instruction was insufficient to support an argument for prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Strickland.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   17 Beginning with the waiver issue, although it is true that Charleston's PCRA briefing did not include significant analysis for each aspect of this claim, this Court finds that he sufficiently presented the\n   claim. As Judge Olson observed in her dissent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   [Charleston] allotted over 900 words, approximately four pages, to the portion of his argument addressing counsel's alleged dereliction in failing to seek a jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter and/or homicide by misadventure.... He cited to the notes of testimony six times. He cited approximately ten cases from this Commonwealth addressing relevant legal issues. He discussed how these cases were applicable to the case at bar and why he was entitled to relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    Charleston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6935247\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/94/1012/#p1021\">\n    94 A.3d at 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Olson, J., dissenting and concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   1819 With respect to the merits of this claim, the Superior Court's majority opinion determined-despite a dissent from Judge Olson on this point-that an involuntary manslaughter instruction was not appropriate in this case under Pennsylvania law. As Respondents indicate, this Court is \"[b]ound by the state court's determination\" on this issue of state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Priester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2190422\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/382/394/#p402\">\n    382 F.3d at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court must defer to the Superior Court's ruling that Charleston was not entitled to an involuntary manslaughter conviction under Pennsylvania law. Further, the Court finds that the Superior Court reasonably concluded that Charleston's counsel was not ineffective when he presented \"a consistent theme and strategy of the case\" of self-defense, rather than seek an involuntary manslaughter instruction. As the Superior Court observed, in Charleston's statement to Detective Singleton and in his testimony, Charleston maintained that he acted in self-defense. As the Superior Court reasonably concluded, an involuntary manslaughter charge might have obscured this consistent theme. Charleston's objection is therefore overruled in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    V. The Court will not issue a certificate of appealability.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   20212223 When a district court issues a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition, the court must also decide whether to issue a certificate of appealability (COA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3d Cir.

As noted above, William Stanton was shot and killed inside 2428 North 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street on June 15, 2008. The Commonwealth's theory was that Charleston shot Mr. Stanton \"over drugs and money.\"\n   <em>\n    N.T.\n   </em>\n   8/18/09 at 178.

Their next door neighbor David Taylor testified that he was in his kitchen on the late morning, early afternoon of June 15, 2008, when he heard three or four noises that sounded like a car backfiring, fire crackers, or gunshots.\n   <em>\n    N.T.\n   </em>\n   8/19/09 at 74, 79-80. A few seconds later he came outside, and twenty or thirty seconds after that he saw Charleston come out of 2428 North 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street and jog across the street and down Hagert Street.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83-85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Travis Leslie testified that he and his brother Tracey Leslie lived at 2428 North 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street. Travis testified that he left the house for work at about 11:30 a.m.\n   <em>\n    N.T.\n   </em>\n   8/19/09 at 154, 157-58, 164. Between 1:30 and 2:00, Travis received a call telling him that something had happened at his house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 165. Travis then called his brother, Tracey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tracey Leslie testified that when he arrived back home he saw Mr. Stanton lying unresponsive on the floor between the living room and dining room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-22, 26-27. Tracey saw a blood stain and hole towards the back of Mr. Stanton's shirt, and he could not find a pulse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29. He went outside and called 911.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22, 29. Travis Leslie testified that when he arrived at the house, he saw paramedics taking Mr. Stanton out on a stretcher.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 166. He also saw Charleston that night. When Travis asked Charleston if he knew what happened in the house, Charleston replied that he was not there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 169, 172.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The victim's mother, Clara Stanton, testified that her son had between $600 and $650 with him when she last saw him between 10:00 and 11:00 in the morning of June 15, 2008.\n   <em>\n    N.T.\n   </em>\n   8/20/09 at 45-46, 89-90.

When she left to go shopping at 2:15 or 2:30, she saw Charleston coming from the direction of 2428 North 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street and asked if he had seen William, and Charleston replied that he had not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48, 51. Neither the money nor Mr. Stanton's wallet or identification card was ever recovered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47, 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   After her son's death, Ms. Stanton had a conversation with Nashua Sanders, who frequently visited family next door to Ms. Stanton.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Ms. Stanton, three weeks after her son's death, Ms. Sanders told her about a conversation that she (Ms. Sanders) had with Charleston about a week before the shooting, in which Charleston said that he planned to rob Mr. Stanton.\n   <em>\n    N.T.\n   </em>\n   8/20/09 at 109, 111-12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Stanton also testified that she did not see Charleston in the days following the incident, which was unusual because he was normally at her house every morning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-57. The day after the murder, people in the neighborhood told her that Charleston was involved in her son's death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   On July 16, 2008, nearly a month after Mr. Stanton's death, Officer Anthony Soliman and his partner received information regarding a suspect in a gang-related homicide.\n   <em>\n    N.T.\n   </em>\n   8/20/09 at 166-67. The officer observed Charleston on the street near 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and Hagert Streets and believed that he matched the description.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 168. After Charleston entered a house at 2432 North 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street, the officer knocked on the door and asked to speak to Charleston. Charleston came out, was patted down for weapons, and was placed in the back of the patrol car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 169-70. Charleston denied any knowledge of the homicide the officers were investigating.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 171. However, Ms. Stanton approached them and told Officer Soliman that the person in the back of the car killed her son.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172. Officer Solliman transported Charleston to the police station where homicide detectives eventually interviewed him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 173, 175.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Homicide Detective Greg Singleton spoke with Charleston when he was brought to the station, but believed he was under the influence of alcohol.\n   <em>\n    N.T.\n   </em>\n   8/21/09 at 150.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   At about 10:00 a.m. the next day, Detective Singleton began questioning Charleston, starting with routine biographical information (birthdate, height, weight, nickname, etc.).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 151. The detective then \"asked him about the incident involving the murder of William Stanton. And he described his involvement in the incident. And at some point I stopped him and ... read him his rights and ... proceeded to take a formal interview ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 154.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the detective, Charleston \"seemed eager to speak with me. He was calm and cooperative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The interview was conducted in question-and-answer form, and Detective Singleton read the interview into the trial record.\n   <em>\n    N.T.\n   </em>\n   8/21/09 at 162-68. Charleston implicated himself in the shooting, but maintained that the victim pulled the gun and the shots were fired while the two were wrestling over the gun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 162-64, 168.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Charleston, who took the stand in his own defense, testified to the same effect,\n   but in greater detail.\n   <em>\n    N.T\n   </em>\n   8/24/09 at 40-43. He described himself and Mr. Stanton as \"close friends\" who were \"always together.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. Charleston stated that on the day in question, he and Mr. Stanton were smoking marijuana together on the corner and each purchased Xanax from a dealer passing by, and each took two Xanax pills (4 miligrams each).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-56, 58. They entered the corner house to avoid being harassed by police, and a disagreement ensued because Charleston wanted to buy some of Mr. Stanton's Xanax but Mr. Stanton believed Charleston should have just purchased more from the dealer on the street.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39, 85-87. Mr. Stanton pulled a gun from his waistband, pointed it in Charleston's face, and snatched the sunglasses off Charleston's face.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40, 42, 92-95, 99. Mr. Stanton threatened to shoot Charleston for disrespecting him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40, 96. Charleston grabbed the wrist of the hand holding the gun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42. While they were wrestling, the gun went off, three shots in a row.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42, 109-11. After the shots, Charleston let go of Mr. Stanton's arm and they both fell to the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43, 113. Charleston testified, as he had reported in his statement to Detective Singleton, that he took the gun and threw it in the sewer at the corner of Hagert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-45, 120;\n   <em>\n    N.T.\n   </em>\n   8/21/09 at 163.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Dr. Sam Gulino, the Chief Medical Examiner, testified that Mr. Stanton died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds.\n   <em>\n    N.T.\n   </em>\n   8/21/09 at 69. Dr. Gulino described three gunshot wounds which resulted in six visible wounds as each bullet traveled through Mr. Stanton's body.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   One shot entered the left chest area, traveled horizontally through both lungs and the heart, and exited the right side of Mr. Stanton's back.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74-75, 80-81.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another shot entered Mr. Stanton's right lower abdomen just above the groin and exited the lower part of the right buttock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75. A third shot entered the lower right thigh and exited thought the outer part of the right knee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76. Based on the gun powder residue or soot on the entrance wounds and clothing, Dr. Gulino testified that the chest wound was not a contact wound, but was within eight inches of the gun's muzzle when it was fired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77-78. Markings around the wound to the pelvic area showed the weapon was fired from less than three feet away, and the absence of markings around the thigh wound indicated that the weapon was fired from at least two feet away.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78-79. According to the toxicology report, the only drug in Mr. Stanton's system was Zanax (Alprazolam ).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The Commonwealth also called Officer Louis Grandizio as a firearms expert.\n   <em>\n    N.T.\n   </em>\n   8/21/09 at 116. Officer Grandizio examined two fired cartridge casings that were retrieved from the scene and a bullet retrieved from Mr. Stanton, all of which were .45 caliber.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 123-25. Markings on the casings showed they were fired by the same weapon, but there was no way to determine whether the bullet was fired from the same gun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125-26. The officer explained how a .45 caliber semi-automatic handgun works and explained that one must pull the trigger each and every time for the gun to fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127-28. Any obstruction to the slide on the exterior of the gun will jam the gun and it will not respond to further pulls of the trigger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Claim One-Admission of Charleston's Confession\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   In his first claim, Charleston argues that the Pennsylvania courts unreasonably applied the rule of\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   in allowing the admission of his confession which was obtained after he was interrogated without\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Doc. 9 at 3-6; Doc. 20 at 2-8. As will be discussed, there was no majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   , and the District Attorney argues that there is no clearly established federal law under\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   . Doc. 18 at 18 &amp; n.3. In the alternative the District Attorney argues that Charleston is not entitled to relief under\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   even if it is clearly established.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   In order to understand the parties' arguments, a brief analysis of the landscape regarding the admission of so called two-step confessions and a more lengthy discussion of the\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   opinions are necessary. The foundation for this discussion is\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , which requires that \"the accused must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights [against self-incrimination] and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored.\"\n   <em>\n    Miranda v.

After reciting the relevant facts, quoting a portion of the prosecutor's closing argument in which she focused on Ms. Stanton's testimony regarding Ms. Sanders' statement, and reciting the contemporaneous instruction given by the court, Charleston cited two direct appellate cases and argued that the instruction given failed to eliminate the possibility that the jury could consider the statement as substantive evidence of intent.

He concluded by arguing \"[s]ince [Charleston's] intent was the key issue for the jury to resolve, he was surely prejudiced,\" citing\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . Appellant's Brief at 12-13. Even if Charleston's citation to the two state cases involving admission of hearsay were sufficient to establish that the underlying claim had merit, the only discussion of prejudice was to assert that \"[s]ince [Charleston's] intent was the key issue for the jury to resolve, he was surely prejudiced\" with a citation to\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . He offered no argument or pertinent caselaw to establish that the admission of such hearsay evidence regarding motive could result in a different result, and I am not able to say that he substantially complied with the governing state rules. I therefore conclude that Charleston has defaulted this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Ineffectiveness of Counsel-Jury Charges for Involuntary Manslaughter and Homicide by Misadventure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   In his next ineffectiveness claim, Charleston complains that his trial counsel failed to request instructions on involuntary manslaughter and homicide by misadventure. Again, the Superior Court found the claim waived under state law because he had not developed the claim in his brief.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-241\">\n   Once again, [Charleston] fails to develop an argument for his claim in light of the well-settled three pronged\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   test for ineffectiveness analysis. Instead, citing cases involving direct appeals, [Charleston] merely asserts that he was entitled to an instruction on homicide by misadventure and involuntary manslaughter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Brief, at 19). Accordingly, [Charleston's] claim is waived.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Superior Ct. PCRA Op. at 1025 (internal footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   After reviewing Charleston's appellate brief, I agree with the Superior Court's conclusion that this claim is waived. Although Charleston specifically argued that he was entitled to the jury instructions at issue (homicide by misadventure and involuntary manslaughter) and cited cases in which such charges were found appropriate,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Brief at 17-19, he failed to provide any support for his contention that trial counsel \"could have no reasonable basis for failing\" to request these instructions, and cited only\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   in arguing that counsel's failure to request the instructions resulted in prejudice, arguing that \"the outcome of this trial may well have been different\" had counsel done so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Ineffectiveness of Counsel-Court's Comment on Credibility\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Finally, Charleston argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object when, \"in the course of his closing instructions to the jury, the trial judge advised the jurors that [Charleston] had 'a bad reputation for telling the truth,' where there was no such evidence presented at trial.\" Doc. 1 at 17. The District Attorney argues that the claim is procedurally defaulted and, in the alternative, meritless. Doc. 18 at 33-35, 45-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Beginning with the District Attorney's default argument, I disagree that this claim is defaulted. A careful reading of the Superior Court decision establishes that, although the Superior Court found the remainder of Charleston's ineffective counsel claims waived (numbered 1, 2, and 4 in the appellate opinion), the court ruled on this claim (numbered 3 in the appellate opinion) without finding any waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superior Ct. PCRA Op. at 1037 (rejecting claim on merits without reference to waiver). Thus, it is not procedurally defaulted in the federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   During the trial, the prosecution read a stipulation to the jury that Charleston had three prior convictions, namely that he had been found guilty of theft on September 1, 2004, unauthorized use of an automobile on December 17, 2004, and theft on July 26, 2005.\n   <em>\n    N.T.\n   </em>\n   8/24/09 at 146.

Rather than objecting and having the court focus its attention even further on Charleston's prior convictions, perhaps even repeating that he had two theft convictions and one conviction for unauthorized use of a vehicle, counsel may have strategically chosen to remain silent on the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   With respect to the prejudice prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   analysis, Charleston argues that counsel's failure to object to this charge was prejudicial because \"his trial testimony denying an intentional killing was crucial to his defense.\" Doc. 9 at 16. However, Charleston has failed to establish that there is a reasonable probability of a different result if his counsel had objected to the charge. First, it is unlikely that the jury was well-versed in Pennsylvania evidentiary law or that it appreciated the distinction between Charleston's prior convictions and a reputation for untruthfulness. Moreover, as has been previously discussed, Charleston's version of the events was inconsistent with the physical evidence adduced at trial. Between the\n   <em>\n    crimen\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    falsi\n   </em>\n   convictions and these discrepancies, the jury had other reasons to question Charleston's credibility. Charleston has failed to establish a reasonable probability that counsel's failure to object to the judge's use of the term reputation during the charge affected the outcome of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Charleston is not entitled to relief on his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   claim whether the court applies Justice Kennedy's opinion in the\n   <em>\n    Seibert\n   </em>\n   case or under the\n   <em>\n    Elstad\n   </em>\n   decision. Justice Kennedy's opinion is applicable if the authorities purposely undermined\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , of which there is no evidence.

Charleston's due process/tattoo claim is procedurally defaulted because he claimed only an error of state law in his state court appeal.

Additionally, Charleston's defense was undermined by his initial denial of any knowledge of the incident,\n    <em>\n     N.T.\n    </em>\n    8/19/09 at 169, 172, and his failure to seek help for the victim after the shooting, maintaining that he did not know Mr. Stanton had been shot, despite the fact that he was lying motionless and unresponsive on the floor.\n    <em>\n     N.T.\n    </em>\n    8/24/09 at 114-16.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-343\">\n    Charleston would not be entitled to relief on this claim in any event. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that \"a trial court shall only instruct on an offense where the offense has been made an issue in the case and where the trial evidence reasonably would support such a verdict.\"\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Browdie\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"461603\" index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/543/337/\">\n     543 Pa. 337\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"461603,7862539\" index=\"433\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/671/668/\">\n     671 A.2d 668\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 674 (1996). Here, the Superior Court noted in an alternative holding that the facts did not support a charge for misadventure. Superior Ct. PCRA Op at 1042-43. Homicide by misadventure is defined as \"the accidental killing of another, where the slayer is doing a lawful act, unaccompanied by any criminally careless or reckless conduct.\" Superior Ct. PCRA Op. at 1025 n.16 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Considering Charleston's testimony that the shooting occurred during an argument about illegal drugs, and the forensic and ballistics evidence calling Charleston's account of the events into question, homicide by misadventure is inapplicable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Superior Ct. PCRA Op. at 1025 n.18 (\"the proposition that an instruction on homicide by misadventure would have likely resulted in a different verdict is remote to the extreme\"). Likewise, the Superior Court found no basis for an involuntary manslaughter charge \"absent evidence that tended to show Charleston acted recklessly or with gross negligence in causing death.\" Superior Ct. PCRA Op. at 1027 (citing 18 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 2504(a) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-344\">\n    Finally, the Superior Court noted that \"[t]rial counsel's strategic decision not to pursue competing theories of homicide by misadventure or involuntary manslaughter with requested instructions had a reasonable basis.\" Superior Ct.
