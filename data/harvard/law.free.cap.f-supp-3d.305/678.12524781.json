Plaintiff Brette Tingle opposes the\n   motion. (Doc. 137.) Defendants have filed a reply. (Doc. 145.) Oral argument is not necessary. For the following reasons, the Defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is a former employee of the ATC. Plaintiff was terminated from his job by Troy Hebert, who at one time served as head of the ATC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently filed this suit against the ATC and Hebert asserting a number of causes of action. These include (1) retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1983 (Doc. 62 at 3, 13); (2) invasion of privacy under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 5 of the Louisiana Constitution (Doc. 62 at 14-15); and (3) defamation under Louisiana state law (Doc. 62 at 15-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants have filed a couple of motions to dismiss (Docs. 10, 68), and the Court has granted these motions in part and denied them in part (Docs. 32, 90). After these rulings, the following claims have survived: (1) against Troy Hebert, Plaintiff's claims for (a) retaliation under \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983 (Doc. 32 at 2); (b) invasion of privacy under the federal and state constitutions (Doc. 32 at 2-4); and (c) defamation (Doc. 32 at 4-6); and (2) against the ATC, Plaintiff's claim for retaliation under Title VII (Doc. 62 at 13-14; Doc. 90 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants have filed the instant motion seeking the dismissal of three discrete sets of claims. First, Defendants ask the Court to dismiss Plaintiff's claim that he was retaliated against \"because he participated as a witness in the\n   <em>\n    Randall Kling\n   </em>\n   litigation presently pending in the 19\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District Court.\" (Doc. 116-1 at 2; Doc. 62 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that the Court should dismiss Plaintiff's claim that Defendants retaliated against him by way of certain investigations the ATC conducted. (Doc. 116-1.) Specifically, Defendants maintain that the Plaintiff cannot show a prima facie case of retaliation because the following are not adverse employment actions: (1) investigating Plaintiff for the ATC's alleged lack of compliance with the DEA and for purportedly missing money; (2) investigating Plaintiff for allegations that he placed Agent Lorre Claiborne in danger; and (3) investigating Plaintiff's wife, Traci Tingle, for \"allegedly falsifying state documents\" related to an ATC office in Vidalia, Louisiana. (Doc. 116-1 at 5; Doc. 62 at 8-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   And third, Defendants contend that one of Plaintiff's defamation claims should be dismissed. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges in his Amended Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Contemporaneous with the termination of the Plaintiff, Troy Hebert released statements to the press and to agents with the ATC that his vehicle had been set on fire. In an interview with a New Orleans news outlet, WVUE, on August 19, 2015, Troy Hebert maliciously stated that if a person was to \"connect the dots\" it would be clear who vandalized the vehicle, as a way of implicating the Plaintiff without saying the Plaintiff's name. While it is apparently true that Troy's vehicle had been set on fire, Troy Hebert had no evidence that the Plaintiff had committed this crime. Troy Hebert did know, or certainly should have known, that the temporal proximity of his statements and the termination of the Plaintiff carried false and defamatory implications. These implied accusations are false and defamatory\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. 62 at 16.) Defendants argue in the instant motion that Hebert never said \"connect the dots\" and made no such defamatory suggestion. (Doc. 116-1 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Having carefully considered the law, facts in the record, and arguments and submissions of the parties, the Court will grant summary judgment on the first and third issues but deny on the second. As to the first (the\n   <em>\n    Randall Kling\n   </em>\n   litigation), Plaintiff concedes that this claim should be dismissed (Doc. 137 at 1-3), so it need not be discussed further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As to the second issue (retaliatory investigations), to demonstrate retaliation under Title VII, \"a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have 'dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.' \"\n   <em>\n    Burlington N. and Santa Fe R.R. Co. v. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    548 U.S. 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2415,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    165 L.Ed. 2d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) (internal citations omitted). Relying on Fifth Circuit precedent, this Court has twice held that mere job scrutiny does not rise to the level of an adverse employment action. Plaintiff urges that these facts are unique. The Court agrees. Cases in other jurisdictions have indicated that investigations can, under certain circumstances, constitute adverse employment actions. The same finding is appropriate here. As a result, the Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated a question of fact as to whether the investigations in this case constitute adverse employment actions, and summary judgment on these claims is thus denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As to the third issue (defamation related to the vandalism and destruction of ATC vehicles), the Louisiana Supreme Court has recognized that \"[a] pure statement of opinion, which is based totally on the speaker's subjective view and which does not expressly state or imply the existence of underlying facts, usually will not be actionable in defamation[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Bussie v. Lowenthal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7544998\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/535/378/#p381\">\n    535 So.2d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 381 (La. 1988) (citation omitted). \"That is because falsity is an indispensable element of any defamation claim, and a purely subjective statement can be neither true nor false.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7544998\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/535/378/#p381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \" '[T]he crucial difference between statement of fact and opinion depends upon whether ordinary persons hearing or reading the matter complained of would be likely to understand it as an expression of the speaker's or writer's opinion, or as a statement of existing fact.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7544998\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/535/378/#p381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). \"In order for a statement of opinion to be actionable in defamation on the ground that it gives rise to a defamatory factual inference, the factual inference created by the statement must be ascertainable by a reasonable person with some degree of certainty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7544998\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/535/378/#p381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7544998\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/535/378/#p381\">\n    at 382-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here, all of the statements Hebert actually made that Plaintiff complains of-both in Hebert's television interview and in other media-constitute mere opinion. No reasonable jury would conclude that Hebert's statements (which do not include the \"connect the dots\" language) express or imply the existence of underlying facts, and his words are too unspecific and general to be actionable defamation under the\n   <em>\n    Bussie\n   </em>\n   standard. Consequently, Plaintiff's defamation claim related to the vandalism, shooting, and torching of ATC vehicles is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Relevant Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Retaliation Claims Related to Defendants' Investigations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Troy Hebert initiated an investigation to take action to obtain any money that ATC should have collected from the DEA. (Defendants' Statement of Material, Undisputed Facts In Support of the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (\"DSMUF\"), Doc. 116-12 at 2; Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' [SMUF] (\"PRDSMUF\"), Doc. 137-1 at 1.) Specifically, Hebert testified that Tingle came to him and \"said that\n   there was $100,000 in money that ... could be gotten to ATC.\" (Doc. 116-6 at 2-3.) Hebert purportedly said, \"Okay, well, then go get the money[.] ... But it never happened.... [Hebert didn't] think [they] ever got the money[.]\" (Doc. 116-6 at 3.) Hebert testified that he did not \"recall telling Mr. Louis Thompson to go get the money.... [He] recall[ed] telling Mr. Brette Tingle to go get the money; and if that included getting Mr. Louis Thompson involved, then that's the way it should be. But ... Tingle knew where the last money was.\" (Doc. 116-6 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hebert was asked if he followed up on the collection of the money, and he replied: \"I asked about it along the way, but like so many other things that you give them, these assignments, and they don't do them.\" (Doc. 116-6 at 5.) Hebert stated that he would ask Tingle about the project, and Hebert would reply, \" 'He's is [sic] working on it,' or something like that.\" (Doc. 116-6 at 6.) But, ultimately, Hebert said his only actions to collect the money were \"[a]ssigning it [to Tingle] and following up with him[.]\" (Doc. 116-6 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Additionally, Hebert testified that Plaintiff's wife, Traci Tingle, did inventory for the ATC every year. (Doc. 116-6 at 12.) When she left the ATC, someone \"did an inventory list and found out that there was some discrepancies about some ... office furniture located in Vidalia.\" (Doc. 116-6 at 12.) Hebert said he asked Director Larry Hingle to \"look into it.\" (Doc. 116-6 at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Troy Hebert also initiated an investigation into allegations made by Lorre Claiborne that she felt endangered by being assigned to work in uniform at convenience stores and other Alcohol Beverage Outlets (ABOs) where she previously worked undercover. (DSMUF, Doc. 116-12 at 2; PRDSMUF, Doc. 137-1 at 1.) Frank Perez, an outside attorney hired by the ATC, conducted the investigation and reported his findings. (DSMUF, Doc. 116-12 at 2; PRDSMUF, Doc. 137-1 at 1.) There was no finding of any wrongdoing by Brette Tingle. (DSMUF, Doc. 116-12 at 2; PRDSMUF, Doc. 137-1 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Meanwhile, Plaintiff testified as to the number of ways he believed he was retaliated against with respect to the investigations. He stated that, first, there were \"[n]o proper investigations. No interviews. [He] was never given the opportunity to answer questions.\" (Doc. 137-4 at 63.) Second, Plaintiff stated that \"things were withheld so that the report wouldn't be an accurate reflection of [his] time.\" (Doc. 137-4 at 63.) That is, the report was not, in his opinion, accurate. (Doc. 137-4 at 63.) Third, Plaintiff maintains that \"Hebert asked for an investigation in October about threats made ... about Lorre Claiborne.\" (Doc. 137-4 at 63.) Plaintiff says that \"nothing came, no disciplinary action was taken against him for\" this. (Doc. 137-4 at 63.) Of this Claiborne investigation, Tingle testified: \"The result of that, nothing happened to Brette Tingle.\" (Doc. 116-5 at 3.) As to the fourth and fifth items, Plaintiff testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   That the OIG's office conducted an investigation and found that I did nothing wrong. The results were not taken from Troy Hebert positively and he went to the Louisiana State Police and demanded that they do an investigation. They contacted the OIG's office and was satisfied with the report and that still did not satisfy Troy Hebert and he went through with the second termination after I was - after the - we were sequestered and then put under sequestration from the hearing officer not to discuss anything rescinded that and then move with the second termination in the public release of everything to the public to law -\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (sic) (Doc. 137-4 at 63-64.) When asked about the investigation brought to the OIG and Louisiana State Police, Plaintiff said it was retaliatory \"that [Hebert] would not accept the OIG's report by a legit investigative agency and went to state police and demanded they do something when they agreed [with] the OIG's report and didn't pursue anything, it was rescinded and more things were piled on.\" (Doc. 137-4 at 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiff testified that he was retaliated against by Hebert \"calling him and telling him we're going to investigate [Tingle's] wife for falsifying public documents and get[ ] the legislative auditor involved because she falsified public documents that there was an office in Vidalia with equipment.\" (Doc. 116-5 at 5.) Tingle admitted, however, that his wife was not terminated and received no pre-termination notice, but he said this was \"because she didn't give [Hebert] a chance. She retired.\" (Doc. 116-5 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to the disciplinary letters submitted by the Defendants, Plaintiff was not terminated for the violations concerning the DEA money, Lorre Claiborne's complaints, or the office furniture at the ATC's office in Vidalia. (Docs. 116-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Defamation Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Hebert gave an interview to WVUE on August 19, 2015. (Doc. 116-9.) Before providing a transcript of that interview, two facts referenced in the interview are worth noting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, Plaintiff and Jedd Faulk, Plaintiff's subordinate employee, exchanged text messages on May 18, 2012, concerning a former ATC Agent named Daniel Abdella. (Doc. 116-5 at 10.) After discussing how Abdella resigned, Plaintiff said, in response to the question of where Abdella was going, \"Not in law enforcement. Said something spiritual. Probably joining the Jihad.\" (Doc. 116-10 at 3.) Faulk then said, \"yikes, maybe he will suicide bomb maniac's office.\" (Doc. 116-5 at 11.) Plaintiff replied, \"I'm hoping,\" though Plaintiff testified that he did so \"in gest.\" (Doc. 116-5 at 10-11.) Faulk responded, \"Wasn't expecting him as our Manchurian candidate but he'll do.\" (Doc. 116-5 at 10-11, Doc. 116-10 at 3.) Plaintiff then said: \"I take him ... I'll even accept any collateral damage.... I will just stay away from that side of the office.\" (Doc. 116-5 at 11.) Faulk said, \"a few sticks of dynamite ain't going to reach our office,\" and Plaintiff responded: \"nope. We would be good.\" (Doc. 116-5 at 11.) Plaintiff again testified that he did so \"in gest.\" (Doc. 116-5 at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, Defendants submit a copy of a Facebook post in which individuals were discussing seeing Hebert at a restaurant. (Doc. 116-11.) One of the individuals (whom Defendants represent is a former ATC employee) said: \"That's enough to make me lose my lunch! Oh oh shoot him!!! That will make the world happier and a better place!!!!\" (Doc. 116-11 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Returning to the key issue, the following is a transcript of the WVUE interview:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Anchor, on camera:\n   </em>\n   ] \"Threatening texts and payroll fraud-some of the reasons why the ATC says one of its supervisors lost his job.

First, an August 25, 2015, article by WWL entitled \"ATC agent fired over vulgar/threatening text messages\" discusses the various grounds for Tingle's firing. (Doc. 137-3) The article then states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Hebert's state vehicle was stolen at his home over the weekend and somebody apparently tried to set it on fire. He says it will be up to the investigators to determine if the incident is connected to Tingle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"We've given them all of this information so that will be up to investigators to determine if there's a connection,\" said Hebert.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Doc. 137-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Second, a former attorney of the ATC named Brian DeJean testified about certain press releases that Hebert posted on the ATC website. (Doc. 137-5 at 156.) DeJean stated: \"One I know in particular had to do with the theft of his vehicle and ... I don't recall whether he named him by name, but there was a heavy inference that Brette Tingle was the culprit. I believe he may have used Brette Tingle's picture in that.\" (Doc. 137-5 at 156.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Relevant Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Defendants contend that there is no question of fact that (1) Hebert never followed through on the DEA investigation; (2) there was no finding of wrongdoing by Plaintiff in the Lorre Claiborne-related investigation; and (3) \"there was no disciplinary action, termination or other adverse employment action taken against [Tingle and his wife] as a result of the investigations.\" (Doc. 116-1 at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendants correctly note that the key question under Title VII and \u00a7 1981 retaliation claims is whether the action was \"materially adverse\" such that it might \"have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination (Doc. 116-1 at 6 (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington N.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    548 U.S. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    126 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2415 ).) Defendants argue that the Fifth Circuit has \"repeatedly held run-of-the-mill employment actions do not constitute a materially adverse action under the\n   <em>\n    Burlington Northern\n   </em>\n   standard\" (Doc. 116-1 at 7 (citations omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Following a lengthy string cite (Doc. 116-1 at 7-9), Defendants assert that \"[t]here do not appear to be any cases holding an employer's requesting or conducting a workplace investigation-especially without any resulting employment consequences such a[s] [a] demotion, termination or transfer - constitutes a materially adverse employment action.\" (Doc. 116-1 at 9.) Defendants state that \"the jurisprudence indicates that, standing alone, a workplace investigation would not constitute a materially adverse employment action.\" (Doc. 116-1 at 9.) Defendants then discuss case law from this Court saying that job scrutiny is not actionable. Defendants conclude: \"Thus, because no detrimental job action, such as demotion, transfer, suspension or termination, was taken against Tingle as a result of any of the three detailed investigations above ..., the investigations into these matters were not in and of themselves materially adverse employment actions.\" (Doc. 116-1 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

If \"all\" ATC employees were subjected to this form of treatment, then no reasonable person would choose to work there.

As a result, according to Plaintiff, the above investigations constitute adverse employment actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Defendants' Reply (Doc. 145)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendants respond that Plaintiff has cited to no court \"holding an internal investigation alone constitutes a materially adverse employment action.\" (Doc. 145 at 2.) Defendants also argue that Plaintiff misstates the\n   <em>\n    Burlington Northern\n   </em>\n   standard. According to Defendants, the question is not whether the employment action would be \"perceived as negative by a reasonable person in the individual's circumstances and has more than a trivial effect on that individual\". (Doc. 145 at 2 (quoting Doc. 137 at 5).). Rather, the question is whether the action is \"materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker form (sic) making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\" (Doc. 145 at 2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Burlington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    548 U.S. at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).) The Supreme Court said that it spoke \"of material adversity because [the Court] believe[d] it [was] important to separate significant from trivial harms.\" (Doc. 145 at 2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Burlington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    548 U.S. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500335\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/53/#p68\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).) The standard is objective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendants do not dispute that the\n   <em>\n    results\n   </em>\n   of an investigation can be an adverse employment action; here, Defendants concede that there's a jury question as to whether the result of the investigation-Plaintiff's termination-was retaliation. But Defendants argue that \"the ATC's investigations into other alleged wrongdoing by Plaintiff (and his wife who was also employed by the ATC) which did not result in termination, demotion, suspension, etc., do not constitute a 'materially adverse employment action' because there was no resulting action taken against Plaintiff (or his wife) on these matters.\" (Doc 145 at 3.) Defendants state: \"Therefore, the underlying investigation-whether Plaintiff felt it was fair, unfair, one-sided, incomplete, baseless and/or inept-is not the adverse employment action sufficient to state and maintain its own independent claim of retaliation.\" (Doc. 145 at 3.) Defendants conclude by urging a policy reason-the danger of tying employer hands from conducting investigations \"for fear that the investigation alone could result in a retaliation claim.\" (Doc. 145 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that, in an interview with WVUE in New Orleans, Hebert \"maliciously stated that if a person was to 'connect the dots' it would be clear who vandalized the vehicle, as a way of implicating [Tingle] without saying [Tingle's] name.\" (Doc. 116-1 at 10 (quoting Doc. 62 \u00b6 52).) Defendants argue that \"Hebert did not make any such statement on WVUE (or any other news outlet ...)\" and that \"Hebert did not use the term 'connect the dots' in his interview with WVUE.\" (Doc. 116-1 at 10.) Defendants maintain his statements did not implicate Tingle in the crimes or \"insinuate that Tingle had anything to do with the crimes[.]\" (Doc. 116-1 at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Bussie v.

Defendants argue that, during the interview, \"Hebert referred to certain underlying, undisputed facts\" but that \"Hebert did not in any way suggest Brett Tingle committed the acts of vandalism on the ATC vehicles.\" (Doc. 116-1 at 13.) Defendants conclude:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Instead, Hebert merely expressed his concern for himself and his family over all of the recent events and comments made by Tingle and other ATC employees. No reasonable juror would find this news interview defamatory toward Tingle, and, thus, this portion of Tingle's defamation claim should be dismissed as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   (Doc. 116-1 at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Plaintiff's Opposition (Doc. 137)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Plaintiff urges that his defamation claim for the vandalism, shooting, and torching of ATC vehicles is viable. Plaintiff argues that, even if Hebert did not use the exact words \"connect the dots\", he should still be liable for defamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiff specifically points to the following language from Hebert's interview: \"That's gonna be something for the investigators to determine. But I'll tell you this: that there's a numerous number of text messages ... When you add all those things up together, if you're smart, you're gonna be concerned.\" (Doc. 137 at 7 (quoting Doc. 116-1 at 13).) Plaintiff asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   The straightforward, common-sense interpretation of these statements is that Mr. Hebert was expressing his opinion that Mr. Tingle was involved in the crimes. The statements give rise to the inference that Mr. Hebert was aware of facts that would tend to implicate Mr. Tingle. The fact that Mr. Hebert said \"that he's hoping there's no connection between the recent happenings,\" and stopped short of saying \"Brette Tingle set my car on fire,\" does not negate this implication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   (Doc. 137 at 7.) Plaintiff rejects Defendants' contention that Hebert merely made his comments in response to reporters and says that this is essentially irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiff also points to other comments made by Hebert with respect to these incidents. Specifically, Plaintiff states that Hebert's comments in the WWL article and postings on the ATC's website (according to DeJean's testimony) constitute defamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Based on all of this, Plaintiff contends that there are questions of fact concerning this defamation claim, regardless of whether Hebert actually used the phrase \"connect the dots.\" Plaintiff makes an alternative argument based on the release of his text messages using the theory of \"false light invasion of privacy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

Defendants note that the Court previously found that Plaintiff had stated a cause of action based on his allegation that Hebert made the \"connect the dots\" statement. Defendants urge that the undisputed facts show that Hebert did not make this statement to any member of the press. Defendants conclude: \"Plaintiff's allegations have no factual support whatsoever. Therefore, this portion of Plaintiff's defamation claim should be dismissed.\" (Doc. 145 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The key part of the interview\n   that Plaintiff focuses on, in full, is the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Reporter, off camera, with soundless video of reporter and Hebert displayed:\n   </em>\n   ] \"Hebert says he is hoping there is no connection between the recent happenings, but he isn't taking any chances.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Hebert, on camera:\n   </em>\n   ] \"That's gonna be something for the investigators to determine, but I will tell you this, that there is numerous number of text messages.

Looking at the television interview through the lens of\n   <em>\n    Bussie\n   </em>\n   , the Court agrees with Defendants that ordinary persons hearing this would conclude that it is mere opinion. Hebert never implies defamatory facts; he asserts certain true facts (involving the text messages and Facebook posts) and says that these facts are cause for \"concern\". But \"concern\" is not a definitive statement or implication that Tingle is responsible for the vandalism; such a statement lacks the \"express or implied factual assertion which was defamatory\" and the \"read[y] ascertainab[ility]\" required by\n   <em>\n    Bussie\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bussie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7544998\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/535/378/#p381\">\n    535 So.2d at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In sum, analyzing this exchange (and the interview as a whole) as the Louisiana Supreme Court would, the Court finds that summary judgment is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   For similar reasons, the Plaintiff's other bases for defamation-the WWL news article and DeJean's testimony-also fail to establish a question of fact precluding summary judgment. Again, the key part of the WWL article is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   Hebert's state vehicle was stolen at his home over the weekend and somebody apparently tried to set it on fire. He says it will be up to the investigators to determine if the incident is connected to Tingle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   \"We've given them all of this information so that will be up to investigators to determine if there's a connection,\" said Hebert.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   (Doc. 137-3.) Hebert says or implies nothing defamatory in these statements; indeed, he expressly says that it is the investigators' job to determine if there is a connection. DeJean's testimony (\"One I know in particular had to do with the theft of his vehicle and ... I don't recall whether he named him by name, but there was a heavy inference that Brette Tingle was the culprit. I believe he may have used Brette Tingle's picture in that.\" (Doc. 137-5 at 156) ) is too vague, unspecific, and conclusory to satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Bussie\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Like\n   <em>\n    Bussie\n   </em>\n   , numerous Louisiana appellate court cases have rejected a plaintiff's defamation claims on the grounds that the statements were opinions, in seemly worse situations.

Although difficult to state in abstract terms, as a practical matter, the crucial difference between statement of fact and opinion depends upon whether ordinary persons hearing or reading the matter complained of would be likely to understand it as an expression of the speaker's or writer's opinion, or as a statement of existing fact. The opinion may be ostensibly in the form of a factual statement if it is clear from the context that the maker did not intend to assert another objective fact but only his personal comment on the facts which he had stated. An expression of opinion occurs when the maker of the comment states the facts on which his opinion of the plaintiff is based and then expresses a comment as to the plaintiff's conduct, qualifications or character; or when both parties to the communication know the facts or assume their existence and the comment is clearly based on the known or assumed facts in order to justify the comment. Criticism is privileged as fair comment only when the facts on which it is based are truly stated or privileged or otherwise known either because the facts are common knowledge or readily accessible.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n    In determining whether an expression is a statement of fact or opinion under the common law, words must be read in their context. Words which, taken by themselves, would appear to be a positive allegation of fact, may be shown by the context to be a mere expression of opinion or argumentative influence. On the other hand, if a statement, ostensibly in the form of an opinion, is apparently based on facts regarding the plaintiff or his conduct that have not been stated by the defendant or assumed to exist by the parties to the communication, the expression gives rise to the inference there are undisclosed facts that justify the opinion. In such a case the expression, although in the form of an opinion, in reality implies a statement of fact, which is not usually protected by the common law privilege. In order for a statement to be defended as fair comment it must be recognizable by the ordinary reasonable person as opinion and not as a statement of fact.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p270\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9732445\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/355/879/#p885\">\n     355 So. 2d at 885-86\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
