BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This action centers on the death of William Howard (\"Mr. Howard\"). Mr. Howard died from injuries sustained while in the custody of correctional officers at the Orange County Jail (or the \"Jail\"), who broke Mr. Howard's neck while relocating him to a different cell within the Jail. His injuries went untreated for more than twenty-four hours, and at 9:10 a.m. on November 20, 2016, Mr. Howard was pronounced dead. His family brought this action, claiming wrongful death and \u00a7 1983 claims for Fourteenth Amendment violations, against Orange County, Florida, and various Jail employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants deny any responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The events leading to Mr. Howard's death began on November 16, 2016. On that day, Mr. Howard suffered a mental breakdown, when he returned home from an out-of-state funeral for his niece and her three children, who were brutally murdered. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 17.) A domestic dispute unfolded and Mr. Howard was arrested for domestic violence and taken to the Orange County Jail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Howard was seventy-five years old at the time, and his initial medical screening at the Jail revealed that he had glaucoma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) He was first placed in a standard cell for detainees, but was moved to a suicide prevention cell on November 18, 2016, after nurses observed him in an \"agitated\" state wandering around his cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) At 12:20 p.m., a licensed psychologist assessed Mr. Howard, and documented that he was disoriented, had an incoherent thought process, and was suffering from memory problems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Specifically, the psychologist described him as \"very confused, and unable to answer questions in a reality based manner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Jail staff decided to return Mr. Howard to a psychological observation cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At 10:50 p.m., the Officer Defendants arrived to transport Mr. Howard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) Gathering outside the cell, one officer mentioned to the others that Mr. Howard was \"blind.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) After ordering him to approach the cell door to be handcuffed, the Officer Defendants banged loudly on the cell door to alert Mr. Howard as to the door's location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.) Mr. Howard failed to approach the door in response, so Defendant Padilla determined that force was necessary to remove him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) They summoned Defendant Nelson to film the use of force. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before entering the cell, Defendant Padilla ordered Defendant Wilson to spray Mr. Howard with Oleoresin Capsicum (\"pepper spray\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Defendant Wilson complied, pepper spraying Mr. Howard in the face through an opening in\n   the cell door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Coupled with his glaucoma, the pepper spray blinded Mr. Howard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Mr. Howard initially began to approach the cell door, but retreated amid the confusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) The Officers then entered the cell, where Mr. Howard was cowering in the corner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) The officers then bombarded Mr. Howard with commands, one yelling \"Don't move!\" while another ordered, \"put your hands behind your back!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Next, the Officers grabbed Mr. Howard and pinned him against the wall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34-35.) They did not handcuff him. Instead, the Officers then ripped Mr. Howard from the wall and slammed him down head first into the concrete floor, breaking his neck. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) They handcuffed him while he lay prostrate on the ground, and four Officers then grabbed and carried Mr. Howard to the psychological observation cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.) While the Officers lugged his body, they let his head dangle beneath his shoulders without support. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) He could not hold it up on his own. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After arriving at the new cell, the Officers stripped Mr. Howard and left him naked on the floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Upon completing the operation, Defendant Padilla congratulated the other officers on their work, telling them \"good job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Medical personnel at the Jail did not perform a medical assessment or treat Mr. Howard's injuries for more than twenty-four hours following the use of force, despite being on notice of the use of force, numerous pain complaints, and behavior indicating Mr. Howard was injured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) The Nurse Defendants did, however, view and make perfunctory assessments of Mr. Howard in the hours following his injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Defendant Martin was the registered nurse on duty at the Jail on the night of the use of force event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) She was aware of the use of force, but did not perform or order a medical assessment of, or treatment for, Mr. Howard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Mendoza visited Mr. Howard's cell twice in the immediate aftermath and noted that he was restless and allegedly pacing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) The following morning, Defendant Mendoza observed Mr. Howard rolling side to side on the cell floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Defendant Mendoza took no substantive action. Later that morning, Defendant Gray visited Mr. Howard's cell three times, observing him laying prone on the floor, complaining of neck and back pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) Defendant Gray returned in the late afternoon, documented Mr. Howard's continued neck and back pain complaints, and noted that he could move his extremities and turn his head. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Again, no further action was taken. That evening, Defendant Distin-Campbell visited Mr. Howard's cell and observed him laying supine in his bunk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At 9:52 p.m., a correctional officer found Mr. Howard unresponsive in his cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) He was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center in critical condition, and pronounced the dead the following morning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.) An autopsy determined that Mr. Howard's cause of death was blunt force impact resulting in neck fracture with cervical spinal cord trauma and hypoxic encephalopathy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) The medical examiner ruled Mr. Howard's death a homicide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Following this ruling, Plaintiff brought this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Complaint proceeds in thirteen Counts.

Count V brings a \u00a7 1983 excessive force claim against Defendant Nelson-who filmed the use of force incident-premised on Defendant Nelson's deliberate indifference to the excessive\n   use of force. Counts VI through IX assert \u00a7 1983 claims against the Nurse Defendants for their deliberate indifference to Mr. Howard's serious medical needs. Count X alleges a municipal liability claim against Orange County, Florida, for delegating final policymaking authority to the Nurse Defendants. Counts XI through XIII aver wrongful death claims against Orange County premised on (XI) battery, (XII) negligent hiring and retention, and (XIII) negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   All Defendants have separately moved to dismiss.

Orange County, Florida's, Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant Orange County, Florida (\"Orange County\" or the \"County\"), moves to dismiss Count X of the Complaint. (Doc. 23.) Count X alleges a \u00a7 1983 municipal liability claim against Orange County premised on the Nurse Defendants' deliberate indifference to Mr. Howard's serious medical needs. (Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 54-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Orange County makes two arguments for dismissal: (1) the Complaint fails to allege that Mr. Howard experienced a serious medical need, a prerequisite to a colorable deliberate indifference claim, and (2) the Complaint fails to allege that the Nurse Defendants were acting pursuant to an official policy or custom. (Doc. 23, pp. 4-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    1.

To state a claim, a pretrial detainee must allege (1) that she experienced a \"serious medical need,\" (2) that a jail official acted with \"deliberate indifference to her serious medical need,\" and (3) that the deliberate indifference caused the plaintiff's injury.\n   <em>\n    Goebert v.

The third prong requires a defendant be causally connected to the constitutional harm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Orange County challenges the second prong. (Doc. 23, pp. 4-5.) They contend that it was clear from the Nurses' observations that Mr. Howard could move his extremities and turn his head after the use of force. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The County characterizes Mr. Howard as \"walking and talking\" in the aftermath of the use of force. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At p. 5.) Therefore, Orange County submits that Mr. Howard did not display a serious medical need to which County employees could have been deliberately indifferent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This argument defies reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Complaint plainly alleges a plausible deliberate indifference claim. It alleges that guards pepper sprayed and then slammed Mr. Howard-a seventy-five year old man-face first into a concrete floor and carried his limp body to a new cell. (Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 34-35.) The next day, the Nurse Defendants observed Mr. Howard in varying degrees of agony, yet they took no action to treat Mr. Howard or give him more than a cursory inspection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-49.) From these, the Complaint sufficiently alleges that Mr. Howard suffered a serious medical need.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goebert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047335\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/1312/#p1326\">\n    510 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1326 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

(Doc. 44, pp. 4-8.) The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   First, the amount of force used grossly exceeded the need. Defendants' characterization of Mr. Howard as unstable and unpredictable thus necessitating considerable force overlooks critical facts: Mr. Howard was a seventy-five year old man afflicted with glaucoma, and by the time Mr. Howard was seized and slammed to the ground, he had been blinded by pepper spray. These facts were known by the Officer Defendants. Further, the Officers who slammed Mr. Howard to the ground were all large men, weighing more than two hundred pounds, while Mr. Howard was considerably smaller. Defendants' contention that the facts and circumstances justified the Defendants in slamming Mr. Howard to the ground with enough force to break the seventy-five year old's neck is appalling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Second, the extent of Mr. Howard's injury is \"obviously significant,\" (Doc. 44, p. 7), and militates heavily in favor of finding that the force used was objectively unreasonable. The Officer Defendants' assertion that \"a broken bone is not an objectively unreasonable result from noncompliance with official directives\" is stunning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sure, broken bones can result from forceful interactions with law enforcement, but not all broken bones are alike. A broken neck is a debilitating, life-threatening injury to anyone, even an able-bodied man, but especially to seventy-five-year-old Mr. Howard. Furthermore, the Complaint alleges that Mr. Howard was unable to understand or obey the initial commands to come to the door. At bottom, the position espoused by the Officer Defendants on this factor is that Mr. Howard's confused noncompliance\n   justified a death sentence. The Court rejects this callous contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Third, in light of the circumstances, attempts to limit force weighs against the Officer Defendants. Though the Officer Defendants verbally commanded Mr. Howard to walk to the door to be moved, their commands went unheeded because of Mr. Howard's disoriented state and glaucoma. The Officer Defendants' subsequent actions showed less restraint. They pepper sprayed Mr. Howard, then four large officers rushed and pinned him against the wall. Then, instead of cuffing him immediately, they slammed him face first into the concrete floor. Considering all the facts and circumstances, this factor also weighs against the Officer Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The remaining three factors weigh in favor of finding the force used objectively unreasonable. The security problem at issue, a disoriented and partially blinded seventy-five year old man acting erratically, cannot fairly be characterized as \"severe.\" For similar reasons, it strains common sense to believe that four large Officers perceived a significant threat from Mr. Howard, as he was cowering in the corner when the Officers entered his cell. Finally, the Complaint does not allege that Mr. Howard was actively resisting; instead it paints a picture of a blind, confused detainee who was incapable of complying with the Officers' commands because of his mental state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Unquestionably, the Complaint establishes that the Officer Defendants violated Mr. Howard's Fourteenth Amendment rights based on the excessive use of force against him. The Court now turns to the question of whether the right violated was \"clearly established.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Officer Defendants Violated a Clearly Established Right\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Officer Defendants next argue that there \"was no clearly established law proscribing a takedown of a resisting detainee.\" (Doc. 44, p. 8.) They insist that, in the aftermath of the\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   decision clarifying the elements of a Fourteenth Amendment excessive force claim, there was \"a dearth of on-point factual law in the pretrial detainee context\" informing officers of what they can and cannot do. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). That is, in the absence of opinions applying\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   in factually similar cases, there was no \"clearly established\" use of force law the Officer Defendants could have violated. This argument is, of course, absurd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"For a constitutional right to be clearly established, its contours 'must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hope v.

At the time of the incident, the Eleventh Circuit had firmly established the right of a non-resisting individual to (i) be free from being pepper sprayed gratuitously, and (ii) not be slammed head first into a hard floor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

(Doc. 44, p. 8.) That case merely eliminated the requirement\n   imposed by several Circuit Courts-including the Eleventh-that plaintiffs prove an officer's subjective awareness that their use of force was unreasonable to make out an excessive force claim.\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/#p2473\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2472-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It did not otherwise abrogate the decisional excessive force law in this Circuit. In light of the continued viability of excessive force cases pre-dating\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   , a reasonable official occupying the Officer Defendants' position would understand that their actions violated Mr. Howard's Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707035\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/1288/#p1312\">\n    614 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1312 ;\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

(Doc. 50, p. 4.) Defendants would do well to remember the present stage of proceedings. In weighing a motion to dismiss, the Court is obliged to accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, and read the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Requests by the Officer Defendants that the Court read the Complaint in a light favorable to the defendant, while making numerous inferences adverse to the plaintiff based on self-serving statements by the defendants, are not well-taken. The Plaintiffs have met their burden of establishing that the Officer Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Although the Complaint does not allege how long the use of force against Mr. Howard lasted, the Complaint plausibly shows that the incident lasted long enough for Defendant Nelson to intervene. That is because the use of force complained of is not solely the slam of Mr. Howard into the concrete. Rather the Officer Defendants began by pepper spraying Mr. Howard after he failed to come to the door to be handcuffed. Next, they rushed Mr. Howard and pinned him against the wall. The Officers then pulled him from the wall and slammed him to the ground. Finally, Mr. Howard was handcuffed and carried out of the cell, his neck dangling from his shoulders without support. As in\n   <em>\n    Priester\n   </em>\n   , \"the events happened very quickly,\" however the use of force here lasted long enough for Defendant Nelson to intervene. By instead filming, Defendant Nelson allowed the unconstitutional actions to take place.
