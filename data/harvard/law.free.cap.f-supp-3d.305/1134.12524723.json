Defendants (collectively, \"UPM\") formerly provided mobile telecommunication services to Haiti for profit. Digicel Haiti alleges that UPM provided these services by using certain practices and technologies to fraudulently access Digicel Haiti's telecommunications network. Digicel Haiti asserts claims against UPM alleging common law fraud, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) - (d), common law conversion, and common law unjust enrichment. Digicel Haiti filed a complaint against UPM on February 2, 2015. Since that time, Digicel Haiti has amended its complaint several times, UPM has answered and asserted counterclaims, and each party has moved to dismiss the other's claims. On October 18, 2016, Digicel Haiti filed its second amended complaint (\"the Complaint\" or \"SAC\"). On September 11, 2017, UPM filed an amended answer to the SAC, asserting seven affirmative defenses and seven counterclaims. UPM's first and seventh counterclaims include allegations that Digicel Haiti is in violation of the Communications Act\n   of 1934 and \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act, respectively. Digicel Haiti now moves to strike UPM's first, second, fifth, sixth and seventh affirmative defenses and dismiss UPM's first and seventh counterclaims. For the following reasons, Digicel Haiti's motion to strike and motion to dismiss are each granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Certain allegations from Plaintiff's amended complaint also are included as background. In deciding Digicel Haiti's motion to dismiss, the Court gives no presumption of truth to Digicel Haiti's allegations in the amended complaint, except where UPM's argument or counterclaims endorse or rely on Digicel Haiti's allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Digicel Haiti's Operations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Digicel Haiti is a wholly owned subsidiary of Digicel Holdings, Ltd., which also owns Digicel USA, Inc. (\"Digicel USA\") and Digicel Jamaica, Ltd. (\"Digicel Jamaica\"). Digicel Haiti is the leading provider of telecommunications services in Haiti, where it solely operates and has an estimated 75% market share of local telephone services. Digicel USA operates a set of international telephone switching systems-equipment with the capacity to transmit a call from the United States to an overseas telecommunications network-located in Miami, Florida and New York City, New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Digicel Haiti tracks and charges its local customers in Haiti through the use of pre-paid Subscriber Identity Module (\"SIM\") cards. A SIM card acts as a small circuit board: when the card is placed inside a cellular telephone, the card identifies the device as associated with an individual customer's unique telephone number and account. SIM cards allow customers to access Digicel Haiti's cellular network and, in turn, allow Digicel to charge for communications made from cellular devices containing specific SIM cards. Digicel Haiti's customers can use SIM cards for voice, data, and messaging services on the Digicel Haiti network. Customers can add credits, in the form of minutes, to SIM cards by using, among other methods, vouchers and online \"top-ups.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When a user of a Digicel Haiti SIM card makes a local call within Haiti, that user incurs charges of approximately $0.09 per minute of wireless service. If a Digicel Haiti customer travels to the United States and uses his or her Digicel Haiti SIM card to make calls back to Haiti, the user of that SIM card incurs charges of at least $1.99 for each minute of wireless service used. Digicel also offers a Roam-Like-You're-Home (\"RLYH\") plan. For\n   an access fee of approximately $20 to $25, the RLYH plan allows registered Digicel Haiti customers to call back to Haiti while traveling in the United States at rates similar to the local rate during the authorized and pre-paid period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When someone in the United States originates a call to one of Digicel Haiti's subscribers in Haiti, the \"third-party carrier\"-a United States telecommunications carrier, which does not have the internal capacity to transport a call to Haiti, also sometimes referred to as a \"wholesaler\"-picks up that phone call from the United States-based originating caller and transports it to one of the Digicel USA switching gateways. From that switching gateway, Digicel USA further transports the call to Haiti, where Digicel Haiti \"terminates\" the call on its network. The terminating end of a call is the party being called by the party originating the call. On Digicel Haiti's behalf, Digicel Jamaica bills the third-party carrier a rate of $0.23 per minute for all international calls that terminate on Digicel Haiti's network. That fee includes the cost of terminating the call on Digicel Haiti's network and the cost of switching services performed by Digicel USA. Digicel Haiti then pays Digicel USA a fee for its services through intercompany transfer. Digicel Haiti does not authorize international or domestic telephone traffic to enter its telecommunications network in Haiti by any other route or under any other form of agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. UPM's Operations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   UPM is an Oregon corporation that facilitated international calls from the United States to people in Haiti on behalf of third-party carriers, at rates lower than what Digicel Haiti charged. UPM asserts that it essentially resold Digicel Haiti's local and RLYH services within the United States at a discount from approximately April 2014 to November 2014. Due to Digicel Haiti's effective efforts to prevent UPM from reselling Digicel Haiti's services, as described below, UPM no longer facilitates calls to Haiti. UPM business operations involved paying full retail price to acquire large quantities of Digicel Haiti SIM cards from authorized dealers, and then using those cards to facilitate calls to Haiti through two technically distinct platforms: the resale of the RLYH plan and the resale of Digicel Haiti's local wireless services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The first and most common way that UPM facilitated calls to Haiti was to enroll its Digicel Haiti SIM cards in the RLYH plan for the full retail price. UPM would then assemble the RLYH-enrolled SIM cards into a SIM server. The SIM server was connected to the internet and capable of accessing the wireless networks of AT &amp; T and T-Mobile, the third-party carriers that have roaming arrangements with Digicel Haiti in the United States. Ordinarily, when a third-party carrier's customers called Haiti, the third-party carrier, and ultimately the customer, would have to pay the standard amount-a minimum of $0.23 per minute-for Digicel Haiti to connect the international call to its local network. UPM offered a cheaper way to connect the calls to third-party carriers on the open wholesale \"spot\" market in the United States. A third-party carrier that elected to use UPM's services would switch a call bound for a Digicel Haiti customer to UPM instead of through Digicel USA's gateway. The third-party carrier's switch would convert the call into an Internet-based protocol packet that carries the call (including the destination number in Haiti) over the internet to one of UPM's SIM servers located in Oregon. UPM's SIM server would then initiate the call to Haiti on the third-party carrier's wireless network. Simultaneously, UPM's SIM server would convert the call into the appropriate format for wireless transmission and essentially program the call to appear to\n   come from a telephone number associated with one of the RLYH-enrolled Digicel Haiti SIM cards. After the call was made to look like a call on the RLYH plan, it would follow the typical route for calls switched directly to Digicel Haiti: the third-party carrier would route the newly-reformatted call to one of Digicel USA's switches in New York or Miami, Digicel USA would carry the call to Haiti, and Digicel Haiti would terminate the call on its network, charging the associated SIM card at the discounted RLYH rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A second, although less common, way in which UPM facilitated international calls to Haiti was by transporting the calls to Digicel Haiti's local Haitian network through Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (\"VoIP\"). Again, the customer of a third-party carrier would call Haiti, and the third-party carrier's switch would select UPM to handle the call. The call would be sent to a UPM SIM server in Oregon in the same manner described above. Instead of initiating a wireless call to Haiti and converting the call for wireless transmission, however, UPM would leave the call as an Internet-based protocol packet (VoIP format). UPM would use the internet to transmit the call to a receiver in Haiti, known as a Global System for Mobile communications (\"GSM\") Gateway. The GSM Gateway would format the call for wireless transmission and initiate a wireless call on Digicel Haiti's network in Haiti using the account information associated with a SIM card located in Oregon. Digicel Haiti would then terminate (or complete) the call on its network as a local call, charging the associated SIM card at the local rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Digicel Haiti undertook an investigation into the international \"resale\" of its services. During the investigation, Digicel Haiti discovered that the calling and usage patterns of particular SIM cards were inconsistent with use by individual customers. Digicel Haiti \"de-authorized\" these SIM cards so that calls associated with these cards could no longer be completed. Because Digicel Haiti de-authorized many of the SIM cards that UPM used to conduct its business, UPM is no longer able to facilitate international calls to Haiti through either RLYH plans or VoIP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Failure to State a Claim and Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Digicel Haiti moves to strike UPM's first affirmative defense, failure to state a claim, and second affirmative defense, lack of standing, on the basis that such defenses merely resurrect disputes that this Court has already decided. After full briefing by the parties, this Court previously ruled that Digicel Haiti has standing to bring the claims alleged in the Second Amended Complaint, and that Digicel Haiti has sufficiently stated those claims. Those rulings, however, were in response to UPM's motion to dismiss, which required this Court to accept all allegations in Digicel Haiti's pleading as true. As the case proceeds, however, it may become clear that those factual allegations were imprecise or incorrect. Thus, the fact that the same arguments did not prevail on an earlier motion under a different standard is not a sufficient basis to justify striking them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A defense that does no more than point out a defect in a plaintiff's prima facie case, however, is a \"negative defense\" that can be set up by a denial, not an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    Zivkovic v. Southern Calif.

Digicel Haiti bills United States-based third-party carriers a flat rate of $0.23 per minute for every international call that terminates on Digicel Haiti's network. That rate includes the cost of transmitting the call from the United States to Haiti through Digicel USA's gateway. Digicel USA does not bill the third-party carrier for this service.

As discussed above, Digicel operates as a single enterprise. As a single enterprise Digicel USA and Digicel Haiti's functions combine to offer a single product that includes the transportation of calls from the United States to Haiti and the termination of those calls on Digicel Haiti's network. UPM has not clearly alleged, however, that it offers a product that is interchangeable with a product offered by Digicel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As a preliminary matter, UPM does not compete with Digicel to the extent that it resells Digicel's RLYH program, in which it is only a reseller and provides no service that is an interchangeable alternate to that of Digicel. The RLYH resale \"market\" looks like the \"market\" of a person who purchases a season pass to a ski resort, and then rents that season pass out to customers for daily use at a rate below the daily rate charged by a ski resort. No matter what technological innovations the reseller innovated to facilitate his resale model, the person who rents out the season pass cannot be said to be competing in the same market as the ski resort, even though both sell daily ski passes. In reselling the RLYH plan, UPM essentially functions as a distributor, and cancelled distributors do not have antitrust standing.\n   <em>\n    Glen.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9097887\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/1000/#p1005\">\n    343 F.3d at 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the rule that canceled distributors do not have antitrust standing, but finding that the plaintiff at issue was not a distributor).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The other service that UPM offers-using the internet to get calls to Haiti-does appear to be interchangeable with Digicel USA's international switching service as an alternate means to conduct \"international transport services.\" As an FCC opinion illustrates, international transport services are one \"input\" among others necessary to complete an international call:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   In order to complete a U.S. international call, a U.S. carrier must obtain as inputs various call termination services from foreign carriers in the destination country of the U.S. call, including\n   <em>\n    international transport services\n   </em>\n   , inter-city services within the destination country, and\n   <em>\n    terminating access services within the local exchange of the called party.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Eastlink international (USA) Inc.; Petition to Modify Regulatory Classification from Dominant to Non-Dominant on the U.S.-Bermuda Route\n   </em>\n   , Memorandum Opinion and Order, 28 F.C.C.R. 8364 (Int'l) at \u00b6 2 (emphasis added, footnotes omitted). Thus, the completion of an international call requires, at least, both transportation \"inputs\" and termination \"inputs.\" UPM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   argues that it \"competed directly, head-to-head, for wholesale carriers' business\" when it used the internet to get calls to Haiti. UPM defines this market as \"the market for getting calls to Haiti for termination there.\" UPM thus argues that it competed with Digicel in providing only\n   <em>\n    international transport services\n   </em>\n   to third-party carriers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   UPM has not clearly alleged, however, that Digicel actually offers that service to third-party carriers, or that a market for \"international transport services\" from the U.S. to Haiti as a standalone service actually exists. Digicel's complaint alleges, and UPM seems to accept, that Digicel charges U.S. wholesalers who need to get a call to Haiti a flat rate of $0.23 per minute for calls that terminate on its network, and that flat rate includes the cost of the international transport service that was performed by Digicel USA and the cost of termination on Digicel Haiti's local network. Thus, Digicel offers to third-party carriers all of the inputs necessary to complete an international call as a single, bundled product for which it charges a flat fee. UPM, on the other hand, only competes with Digicel to the extent that it offers an international transport service, which is only one input required to complete an international call. It is not clear from UPM's allegations that there is a market for this single input. More importantly for standing purposes, UPM's standalone transportation service is not interchangeable with Digicel's transportation-termination service, because its transportation service would only partially meet a third-party carrier's needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

UPM appears to assert a leveraging theory of monopolization, by which Digicel is using its monopoly in the first market, local telephone services in Haiti, to illegally extend its monopoly into a second market, the transportation of calls from the United States to Haiti. Such a theory of monopolization suggests that the second market-the market being unlawfully monopolized-is the market for only transportation, and not termination. In its response brief, UPM reinforced the conclusion that its alleged product market is limited to transportation services when it wrote that Digicel has monopolized \"the market for getting calls to Haiti for termination there.\" This phrasing indicates that the market is for the service of \"getting calls to Haiti\" and not for the service of \"termination there.\" In its complaint, however, UPM defines the primary relevant product market as the market for transporting all calls from the United States to all telephones in Haiti and the secondary product market as the market for transporting all calls from the United States to all Digicel subscribers in Haiti. By defining the market as including the transportation of calls from the United States \"to telephones\" or \"to all Digicel subscribers,\" UPM indicates that the product market includes termination services. Thus, the first substantive flaw in UPM's antitrust claim is its failure clearly to define the scope of the relevant product market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To the extent that UPM alleges that the relevant product market is only the transportation service, UPM has not sufficiently alleged that there is a market for that service. If a hotdog stand includes free condiments and garnishes for any customer who purchased a hotdog, and an entrepreneur set up a condiment and garnish stand across the street, the entrepreneur could not claim to be competing with the hotdog stand in the condiment and garnish market. UPM appears to be attempting something similar here. Digicel includes the cost of transportation, which for purposes of antitrust analysis it performs in-house, in the flat fee that it charges wholesalers that terminate calls on its network in Haiti. UPM does not allege that Digicel offers the switching services performed by Digicel USA on a standalone basis-for example, to transport a third-party carrier's to Haiti for termination on a non-Digicel local Haitian network. Moreover, UPM does not allege that there are customers interested in transportation services alone, or what the cost of such a service is or should be. UPM alleges neither what Digicel nor UPM itself charges to customers just for the transportation service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on UPM's counterclaims,\n   and the portions of Digicel's complaint that UPM endorses, the appropriate customers for pure transportation services might be enterprises like Digicel itself, which can pay for the transportation service provided by UPM or a similar service provider, and then pass that cost along to the third-party carrier paying to terminate on Digicel's local network.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Monopoly Power\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Even if UPM had sufficiently defined the relevant product market, UPM has not sufficiently alleged that Digicel has monopoly power in that market. To state a claim for a Sherman Act \u00a7 2 violation, UPM must allege monopoly power\n   <em>\n    in the relevant product market.\n   </em>\n   UPM alleges that \"Digicel has acted to illegally extend its local service monopoly to the\" market for transporting calls from the United States to Haiti. UPM thus pleads a \u00a7 2 claim under a \"monopoly leveraging\" theory, by which a company that has a monopoly in one product market-which may be legitimately obtained-uses its monopoly power in the first market to secure an unlawful monopoly in a second, distinct market. In order to state a claim under a leveraging theory, a plaintiff must sufficiently allege that the defendant either has obtained monopoly power in the second market or, in the case of an attempted monopoly claim, has a \"dangerous probability of success\" in monopolizing a second market.\n   <em>\n    Verizon Commc'ns Inc. v.

UPM has thus sufficiently alleged that Digicel has monopoly power in the local telephone service market in Haiti, the legitimacy of which UPM does not challenge. UPM makes no allegations, however, about Digicel's market power in the United States-to-Haiti call transportation market. Digicel's market share in local network services does not necessarily translate into an equivalent market share in international transportation services.

Cir. 2001) (emphasis in original). UPM alleges five ways in which Digicel Haiti has engaged in anticompetitive conduct to protect and extend its local service monopoly and monopoly of the transporting of calls from the United States to Haiti. First, Digicel requires that all international calls destined for a Digicel Haiti subscriber in Haiti be switched though the Digicel USA gateway. Second, Digicel charges $0.23 per minute for calls terminated on its network Haiti, regardless of whether they switched through Digicel USA. Third, Digicel prevents internet-based telephone services from terminating on its wireless network. Fourth, Digicel prevents the resale of Digicel Haiti's RLYH service. Fifth, Digicel failed to report its status as the dominant local carrier in Haiti to the FCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   UPM's first allegation of anticompetitive behavior, that Digicel requires that all international calls terminated on its local network be switched through its own gateway might constitute an improper tying arrangement. UPM essentially alleges that Digicel will not sell its termination services unless a wholesaler also purchases its transportation services. As explained above, however, UPM has not sufficiently alleged that there is independent consumer demand for international call transportation services as a standalone product. \"[N]o tying arrangement can exist unless there is sufficient demand for the purchase of [the tied product] separate from [the tying product] to identify a distinct product market in which it is efficient to offer [the tied product] separately from [the tying product.]\"\n   <em>\n    Jefferson Parish Hosp.

In this case, the tied product is the switching through Digicel USA's gateway, and the tying product is Digicel's local Haiti network service. Because UPM has not alleged that there is a distinct product market for international call transportation services such that transportation services can be efficiently offered separately from call termination services, Digicel's requirement that calls terminating on its network be switched through its own gateway is not anticompetitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   UPM's second allegation of anticompetitive conduct falls short for similar reasons. Because Digicel charges $0.23 per minute to all U.S. wholesale carriers, regardless of whether they use the Digicel USA switches to transport the call to Haiti or a transport service like UPM's, UPM argues, no wholesale carrier will elect to use a different transport service because the carrier would then be charged twice\n   for the transport function-once in Digicel's bundled price and once by the independent transport service. Thus, Digicel argues, those who use Digicel's transport service receive it \"for free\" while those who use alternative transport services are charged. Like UPM's first allegation of anticompetitive conduct, this billing scheme could be seen as unlawful tying or bundling. \"Bundling is the practice of offering, for a single price, two or more goods or services that could be sold separately.\"\n   <em>\n    Cascade Health Sols. v. PeaceHealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645086\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/883/#p894\">\n    515 F.3d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 894 (9th Cir. 2008). Predatory bundling occurs when, \"after allocating the discount given by the defendant on the entire bundle of products to the competitive product or products, the defendant sold the competitive product or products below its average variable cost of producing them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 910. Thus, as with a theory of anticompetitive tying, a plaintiff must sufficiently allege that a defendant is offering two distinct goods for a single price in order to state an antitrust claim under a theory of anticompetitive bundling. UPM has not sufficiently alleged that there is a market for standalone international call transportation services for Digicel's billing scheme to be considered improper bundling. Moreover, UPM has made no allegation that Digicel sold the transportation service-the competitive product-below the cost of performing or delivering that service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   UPM's third and fourth allegations of anticompetitive conduct can be considered together. A firm's refusal to deal with a competitor is not anticompetitive unless it involves \"[t]he unilateral termination of a voluntary\n   <em>\n    (and thus presumably profitable)\n   </em>\n   course of dealing suggest[ing] a willingness to forsake short-term profits to achieve an anticompetitive end.\"\n   <em>\n    Trinko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897225\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/398/\">\n    540 U.S. at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897225\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/398/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

Digicel might expect, for example, that an average individual who purchases a RLYH SIM card will make ten calls per week to Haiti, and sells it at a price that reflects that anticipated use. When in the hands of an organization with a business model like UPM's, however, the RLYH card may be used to make hundreds or even thousands of calls to Haiti per week. Such a resale scheme\n   does not resemble the market-value dealing denied to the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Aspen Skiing\n   </em>\n   , which was attempting to buy a single-use product-a daily ski pass-at the price fixed by the defendant to reflect the value of that single-use product. Rather, the scheme is more akin to the would-be competitor who buys an unlimited season pass for a ski resort, and then rents that pass out to customers for daily use at less than the cost of a day pass. If the ski resort refused to honor the rented out season passes, such action would be a rational attempt to protect itself from lost profits and hardly anticompetitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   By refusing to honor its RLYH program with UPM, and thus preventing UPM's resale of the RLYH benefits, Digicel is acting competitively by forsaking an unprofitable deal. Whether the RLYH contract explicitly forbids this form of resale is disputed, and Digicel's refusal to honor UPM's resold RLYH calls may well be in violation of its contract if there were no restrictions on resale. Not all breaches of contract are anticompetitive, however, and when a breach is efficient, meaning that a party chooses to breach to avoid economic loss, it is particularly unlikely that the breach is anticompetitive. For similar reasons, Digicel's refusal to permit UPM or any other internet-based telephone service terminate on its network by reselling access to Digicel's network at the local rate for what is in fact an international call is a competitive business decision. By refusing to deal with UPM, or any other internet-based telephone service, Digicel is not forsaking near-term profits, but rather protecting itself from an unprofitable deal. UPM implicitly concedes as much in its response brief when it argues that, because Digicel was ultimately able to identify the SIM card being used by UPM, \"there is no reason that it could not have charged higher per-minute rates for calls made using those services.\" Perhaps Digicel could have, but it was under no obligation to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Digicel raises no argument that UPM's fifth allegation of anticompetitive conduct-that Digicel Haiti concealed its status as a dominant carrier on the U.S.-Haiti route from the FCC in violation of \u00a7 214 of the Communications Act of 1934-is not anticompetitive. Rather, Digicel argues that all of UPM's claims against Digicel under the Communications Act do not apply to Digicel Haiti because Digicel Haiti is not an international common carrier. For reasons explained below, UPM has sufficiently alleged that Digicel Haiti is an international common carrier, and thus subject to the requirements of the Communications Act. Because Digicel raises no argument that this allegedly exclusionary conduct is not anticompetitive, and because UPM's \u00a7 2 claim fails on other grounds explained above, the Court declines to address whether Digicel's failure to register as an international common carrier is anticompetitive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Ruling on the same issue in an earlier motion to dismiss in this case, this Court held that Digicel's own allegations indicated that Digicel Haiti owned and operated the switches in New York and Miami, and was thus properly considered an international carrier. Plaintiff has since amended its complaint to distinguish between the Digicel USA entity, which Digicel Haiti agrees is an international carrier and which has a Section 214 authorization, and Digicel Haiti itself, which Digicel Haiti maintains operates only in Haiti. Digicel argues that, because Digicel USA and not Digicel Haiti performs the transmission of calls from the United States to Haiti, it is not required to hold a Section 214 license and is therefore not an international common carrier. Digicel Haiti's own allegations nevertheless indicate that it provides international \"telecommunications for a fee ... to the public.\" The definition of telecommunications service in the Act does not limit that definition to include only those entities that\n   <em>\n    perform the transmission\n   </em>\n   of calls, as Digicel argues. Rather, the Act defines telecommunications services as \"the\n   <em>\n    offering\n   </em>\n   of telecommunications ...\n   <em>\n    regardless of the facilities used.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20153\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (53) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Digicel Haiti's own allegations continue to show that Digicel Haiti offers the service of transmitting calls from the United States to Haiti. Digicel Haiti charges third-party carriers in the United States $0.23 per minute for calls from the United States that terminate on Digicel Haiti's network in Haiti. Digicel Haiti alleges that \"[t]here is no separate charge to third-party carriers for the use of the Digicel Group's telecommunications capacity between the United States and Haiti, the minimum 23 cents per minute charge for terminating calls on the Digicel Haiti network is considered to cover that transport function as well.\" Thus, Digicel Haiti offers what can be described as a package of services that includes the transmission of the call data from the United States to Haiti and the termination of the call on Digicel Haiti's network. That Digicel Haiti appears to sub-contract the transmission function to its sister corporation, which it then pays through intercompany transfer, does not change the fact that Digicel Haiti offers the transmission for a fee. Indeed, to the extent that Digicel USA offers a service at all, as alleged in Digicel Haiti's complaint, it offers that service to Digicel Haiti. The inclusion of the phrase \"regardless of the facilities used\" in the definition of telecommunications service emphasizes that a telecommunications carrier is defined as such by the transmission service it offers, and not how or by whom the transmission is performed. Moreover, Digicel Haiti's RLYH program is specifically designed for customers in the United States to place calls to Haiti at a discounted rate. Regardless of how the transmission function is performed, in offering the RLYH program, Digicel Haiti offers the transmission of a call from the United States to Haiti for a fee and, as such, is an international telecommunications carrier. Digicel Haiti is therefore subject to the Communications Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Digicel Haiti's Motion to Strike Affirmative Defenses (ECF 132) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. UPM's first and second affirmative defenses are stricken and the motion is denied in all other respects. Digicel Haiti's Motion to Dismiss Counterclaims (ECF 133) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. UPM's seventh counterclaim is dismissed and the motion is denied in all other respects. The Court grants UPM leave to file a second amended answer within 21 days of the entry of this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Going forward, this opinion uses the term \"Digicel\" to refer to the common enterprise, and \"Digicel USA\" and \"Digicel Haiti\" when necessary or appropriate to refer to the distinct corporate bodies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The question of antitrust standing, and the requirement that an antitrust plaintiff participate in the same market as the defendant, is an outgrowth of the requirement that the plaintiff experienced antitrust injury. The remaining elements of antitrust injury are discussed later in this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    To the extent that UPM alleges that Digicel charges $0.23 per minute just for the transportation function-it is not clear from UPM's complaint what services UPM alleges the $0.23 to include-that allegation appears to be based on Digicel's allegations in its own complaint. Digicel alleges, however, that the $0.23 per minute fee is a flat fee charged to wholesalers that is considered to\n    <em>\n     include\n    </em>\n    the cost of the transportation function that Digicel provides, in addition to the fee for terminating a call on Digicel's network. Neither Digicel nor UPM allege what amount Digicel Haiti pays to Digicel USA for performing the transportation function.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Seen this way, the market for pure international transportation services may resemble a two-sided market. A two-sided platform is one that acts as an intermediary that \"caters to two or more distinct 'sides' of users that derive value from interacting with one another; but the firm's service will not attract one side unless there are participating users on the other.\" Erik Hovenkamp,\n    <em>\n     Antitrust Policy for Two-Sided Markets\n    </em>\n    (February 9, 2018), available at SSRN:\n    <em>\n     https://ssrn.com/abstract=3121481\n    </em>\n    . A firm that offers only the international transportation function of international telecommunications requires the participation of two sets of customers: wholesalers with a need to get their calls to a different country, and local service providers who charge the wholesalers to terminate that call in the local country. A new area of antitrust law appears to be emerging for two-sided markets. This new area, however, does not appear to be applicable here because Digicel is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    a two-sided platform. It performs its transportation function in-house, for purposes of antitrust law. Because it offers both transportation and termination, it needs only one set of customers-the wholesalers. That UPM appears to offer a two-sided platform, while Digicel offers a single-sided platform reinforces the inference that UPM and Digicel do not compete in the same market.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    UPM's allegations resemble a claim brought under the essential facilities doctrine.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     MCI Commc'ns v.

During oral argument, however, counsel for UPM expressly stated that UPM is not pleading its case under the essential facilities doctrine. ECF 150 at 31. The Court thus does not analyze UPM's claims of anticompetitive activity under the essential facilities doctrine.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
