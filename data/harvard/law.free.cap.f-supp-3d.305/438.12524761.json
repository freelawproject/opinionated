Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant has failed to articulate a \"fair and just reason\" for withdrawing his guilty plea, as required by Rule 11. As this Court understands Defendant's letter, Defendant argues he should be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea because (i) he did not fully understand his plea agreement and the consequences of pleading guilty, and (ii) he pled guilty because he felt coerced. Both of these claims are belied by Defendant's sworn statements during the plea hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During the plea hearing, Defendant stated to this Court on multiple occasions that he understood the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty and the consequences of his guilty plea. Specifically, Defendant stated he understood he had a right to\n   plead not guilty and proceed to trial, and by pleading guilty, he was giving up all of the associated rights he would otherwise have, including the presumption of innocence, his right to call witnesses, and his right to testify on his behalf if he chose to so testify. March 16, 2018 Hearing Transcript (\"Tr.\") 11:18-13:19. Defendant stated he understood he was giving up his right to appeal even if he were sentenced to up to 360 months of imprisonment. Tr. 13:12-14:5. The Court advised Defendant of the statutory penalties he faces for Counts One and Two of the Third Superseding Indictment, and Defendant affirmed he understood each of those penalties, including that he could be deported and removed from this country. Tr. 15:7-17:8. Defendant confirmed that his attorney, Mr. Dratel, had discussed the sentencing guidelines with him, and after being asked if he had any questions for the Court, Defendant said no. Tr. 17:16-18:13. An Uzbek interpreter was present for the proceeding \"essentially on standby\" because, according to Mr. Dratel, \"Mr. Zakirov's English is very good, but we just wanted to make sure he was fully comfortable with all the concepts that the Court would present in the course of an allocution.\" Tr. 2:22-3:1. At no point during the plea hearing did Defendant in any way indicate that he needed the services of the interpreter to understand what was happening. Furthermore, this Court specifically asked Defendant if he was satisfied with the assistance of his counsel, and Defendant stated he was satisfied and believed he had received the effective assistance of counsel in his case. Tr. 10:25-11:6. Mr. Dratel also advised the Court that he had discussed the question of a guilty plea with Defendant and, in Mr. Dratel's view, Defendant understood the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty. Tr. 10:15-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After pleading guilty to Counts One and Two of the Third Superseding Indictment, in response to this Court's questions, Defendant affirmed he was pleading guilty voluntarily and of his own free will with respect to each count. Tr. 20:8-17. This Court asked Defendant if anyone had threatened or forced him to plead guilty, and Defendant stated no one had forced or threatened him to plead guilty. Tr. 20:18-23. Defendant allocuted to agreeing with others and attempting to provide funding for persons to travel to Syria to join and fight for ISIS, which Defendant knew to be a foreign terrorist organization. Tr. 21:6-21. Finding Defendant was acting voluntarily and with a full understanding of the charges, his rights, and the consequences of his plea, and finding a factual basis for the plea, this Court accepted Defendant's guilty plea to Counts One and Two of the Third Superseding Indictment. Tr. 22:7-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Where, as here, a defendant's allegations in support of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea after acceptance by the Court \"merely contradict the record ... or are simply conclusory,\" a district court may deny a motion to withdraw a guilty plea without a hearing.\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11898301\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/710/#p715\">\n    129 F.3d at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, Defendant has not asserted any claim of innocence in his letter, and a defendant's \"change of heart prompted by his reevaluation of either the Government's case against him or the penalty that might be imposed is not a sufficient reason to permit withdrawal of a plea.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Furthermore, although Defendant sent his letter within a short amount of time after the guilty plea-approximately one week-that factor alone is not controlling and warrants neither withdrawal of the plea nor a hearing.
