[1]. Defendant asserts counterclaims seeking cancellation of Plaintiff's Capsule mark for genericness and descriptiveness. [47]. Before this Court are Plaintiff's motion to strike Defendant's expert report [104]; Defendant's motion to strike Plaintiff's expert report [107]; Plaintiff's motion to strike an affidavit from Defendant's nontestifying expert [177]; Defendant's motion to withdraw answers to Plaintiff's requests for admission [180]; and the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment [123, 147].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As explained below, this Court denies the parties' motions to strike; partially grants and partially denies Defendant's motion to withdraw answers; and partially grants and partially denies the parties' motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In most responses Defendant admits the statement in part and disputes the remainder either by citing to the record or re-citing the portion of the record relied upon by Plaintiff. In some responses, Defendant limited its reply because it objected to the form of Plaintiff's statement as containing improper legal argument or as unsupported by the evidence. This Court considers this to be the case with respect to Defendant's responses to paragraphs 1-3, 5, 7-10, 15, 16-18, 20, 21, 26, 29-37, and 39-42, and declines to strike those responses. In a few instances, however, Defendant failed to cite to any record evidence: this is true of its responses to paragraphs 6, 14, 23, 25, 28, and 38 of Plaintiff's statement of facts. This Court disregards those denials and considers Plaintiff's corresponding statements admitted.\n   <em>\n    Malec\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"99296\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/191/581/#p584\">\n    191 F.R.D. at 583-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. This Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties make and sell cell phone cases. PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6.

DSOF \u00b6 32; PSOF \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When Plaintiff registered its mark, it appears that another company, Vatra, Inc., had registered \"Capsule\" as a trademark for \"bags and cases\" for \"holding or carrying\" cell phones, cameras, glasses, and other accessories. [124-8] at 6. Vatra, however, never followed up on its initial registration by providing a certificate of \"continued use or excusable non-use,\" which must be submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between the fifth and sixth year after registration to maintain a valid trademark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%204%2C338%2C254%2C\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%204%2C338%2C254%2C\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In any event, the USPTO cancelled Vatra's Capsule mark in February 2015 for lack of that certificate,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%204%2C338%2C254%2C\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%204%2C338%2C254%2C\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and it did not flag Vatra's mark as a potential source of confusion when Plaintiff applied for its Capsule mark, DSOF \u00b6 13; [149-3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   There are, however, additional third-party suppliers that sell cases whose names contain the term \"Capsule,\" including Accez, iPhone TPU, Jammylizard, Catalyst, and others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [124-10]. Plaintiff's own exhibit of online search results for \"capsule,\" submitted with its Complaint, shows that case producers (other than the parties here) use the term. [1-6]; [124-9] at 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such third-party use of Capsule, even in relation to cell phone cases, did not affect Plaintiff's registration of its mark with the USPTO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Around 2010, Defendant also began selling cell phone cases with the name \"Capsule.\" PSOF \u00b6 6. These cases sometimes, but not always, used capsule with other modifiers; for example, Defendant's products include \"Air Capsule,\" \"Capsule Solid,\" and \"Capsule Capella.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%204%2C338%2C254%2C\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%204%2C338%2C254%2C\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 53, 54. By November 2014, Defendant had submitted registration applications to the USPTO to trademark these \"Capsule family\" product names. PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 6, 12. At least one of these marks-Capsule Capella-was approved and registered with the USPTO in May 2017. [124-4] at 4; CAPSULE CAPELLA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%205%2C297%2C564\">\n    Registration No. 5,297,564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Capsule\n   Capella mark was originally rejected by the USPTO for likelihood of confusion, the objection was withdrawn upon review. [124-4] at 6. The registration for Capsule Capella includes the disclaimer that Defendant makes no claim to the \"exclusive right to use 'Capsule' apart from\" its appearance in the mark as shown. CAPSULE CAPELLA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%205%2C297%2C564\">\n    Registration No. 5,297,564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant's \"Rugged Capsule\" mark was also initially rejected, both for likelihood of confusion and because the USPTO determined that the mark was \"merely descriptive\" of an attribute of the Defendant's case. [124-6] at 16-17. Defendant still sells its \"Capsule family\" cases, on its website and through online retailers such as Amazon and eBay. PSOF \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant also claims that it sold a \"Capsule\" cell phone accessory in June 2009, predating Plaintiff's first use of the Capsule mark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. DSOF \u00b6 22; [124-11]. This product was the \"SGP Metal Advance Light,\" which came in a variety of styles, including \"Capsule Nickel\" and \"Capsule Gold.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSOF \u00b6 25; [124-11]. The SGP Metal Advance, however, was a cell phone \"skin,\" a decorative sticker for the front of a phone. PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 26-28; [150-5]. It was not a cell phone case. In any event, this use of \"capsule\" merely described one of the designs in which the sticker was available-specifically, the option to have the sticker in a gold or nickel color with a pattern of repeating medicine capsules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [124-11, 149-26]. Thus, \"capsule\" as Defendant used it in 2009 described a decorative pattern by naming the objects in the pattern, and was not a product identifier. It has little relevance here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thus, the disputed products consist of Plaintiff's Capsule cell phone cases and Defendant's \"Capsule family\" cases. Both parties sell their Capsule cases online, through their websites and online retailers. PSOF \u00b6 14; [1-6]; [124-28]; [124-34]. Both have a national market. PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14. Both parties use the trademarked term alone and in conjunction with the word \"case.\" [149-11]; [149-19]; [124-12]; [124-28]; R. DSOF \u00b6 20; DSAF \u00b6 4. Defendant, as noted, also uses the term with other descriptors, and has trademarked at least one of the resulting phrases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [124-4]; DSAF \u00b6 6. The Capsule marks for which Defendant has sought or is seeking registration have first-use dates no earlier than February 2015. DSAF \u00b6 6. Defendant briefly ceased selling its Capsule family cases during the pendency of this litigation but has resumed its sales. PSOF \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although both parties currently sell Capsule cases, Plaintiff does not sell its Capsule models for iPhones after the 5/5s generation, with the exception of the iPhone SE. PSOF \u00b6 5; R. DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 43, 44. The trademarked Capsule models are limited to cases for the iPhone 5/5s, iPhone SE, iPhone 4/4s, and the fourth generation iPod Touch. R. DSOF \u00b6 43. Plaintiff's cases for these goods can be customized by consumers\n   or bought with ready-made prints.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%205%2C297%2C564\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff did not produce Capsule cases for later generations because it was more difficult to print customized designs-generally supplied by consumers-on the cases that fit those generations. R. DSOF \u00b6 44. Defendant's challenged cases, by contrast, are not customizable, and appear to be sold primarily in solid colors. DSOF \u00b6 50;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [149-19] (Capsule products on Defendant's website). Also, Defendant sells Capsule family cases for phones other than the iPhone, such as the Samsung Galaxy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [149-19], while Plaintiff's Capsule models only fit iPhones,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PSOF \u00b6 5; R. DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 43, 44; [124-2, 124-12, 124-23]. Plaintiff admits that it has no evidence of actual confusion between its Capsule cases and Defendant's cases. R. DSOF \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In December 2015, Plaintiff sued Defendant for federal trademark infringement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; unfair competition and false designation of origin under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; and Illinois common law unfair competition. [1]. Defendant asserted a counterclaim and numerous affirmative defenses. [31, 47]. Defendant later voluntarily dismissed Counts I and VI of its counterclaim, and this Court dismissed Counts II and V. [54, 61]. Thus, Defendant's remaining counterclaims are Counts III and IV, seeking cancellation of Plaintiff's mark for genericness and descriptiveness, respectively. [47].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The parties engaged in extensive discovery in the course of this litigation, and each consulted experts. In December 2016, Defendant disclosed its experts to Plaintiff. [183-2, 183-5]. It listed Doug Bania as an expert who \"may be called to testify regarding the lack of consumer confusion\" as to the parties' marks; whether Plaintiff's mark \"is descriptive and has acquired distinctiveness\"; and damages calculations. [183-5]. Defendant noted that Bania would provide a formal report.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant's designation of experts also listed Kirk Martensen as a \"non-testifying expert who will conduct a consumer survey\" to provide evidence of consumer perspectives on the Capsule mark and the parties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant noted Martensen's association with Goldmarks-his survey firm-and said that although no \"formal report\" was forthcoming, Martensen might \"be called to testify on the methodology of the survey if needed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Upon Plaintiff's request, Defendant provided a two-page summary of Martensen's credentials that same month. [157-18, 157-20]. Defendant sent Plaintiff a copy of the survey report, including information about its methodology and findings, with Defendant's expert disclosures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [124-19] at 3-5, 15-24; [180-1] \u00b6 2. Although Plaintiff never sought to depose Martensen, it asked Bania about Martensen and his methodology in a January 2017 deposition. [180-1] \u00b6 9; [180-6]. In response, Bania admitted that he is not a survey expert but said that he accepted the reliability of the survey report, in part because it aligned with his own research.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [183-6] at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In January 2017, this Court extended the initial expert discovery cut-off from February 2017 to March 14, 2017. [102]. On March 13, after Plaintiff's expert rebuttal report had been submitted and a day before the close of expert discovery, Bania submitted a \"Supplemental Expert Report.\" [104-3]. Ultimately, this Court again extended expert discovery until June 1, 2017. [114].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties cross-filed for summary judgment in June 2017. [123, 147]. Defendant included Bania's expert report and Martensen's consumer survey as exhibits in support of its motion. [124-9, 124-19]. In response, Plaintiff challenged the admissibility of the consumer survey.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. DSOF \u00b6 28; [158] at 8. As a result, Defendant submitted a sworn declaration from\n   Martensen in support of the consumer survey with its responses to Plaintiff's statement of additional facts. [171-8]. The affidavit described the work that Martensen and his firm Goldmarks conducted to produce the survey, and attested to the truth and validity of the consumer survey report previously disclosed to Plaintiff and submitted with Defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The first half of the supplemental report corrects the scope of Bania's previous damages calculations but does not alter his underlying methodology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [104-3] at 2-4.

Bania previously addressed Spigen's costs in his initial report, [124-8] at 14-15, and here merely applies his analysis to Plaintiff's expert report.

Not only was the supplementary report provided to Plaintiff before the initial close of expert discovery (albeit on the last day) [102], this Court then extended the close of expert discovery another two and a half months, [144], largely to give Plaintiff time to address the supplementary report, as stated in open court. Finally, Defendant's production of the supplement does not venture into new territory, minimizing any potential prejudice to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bone Care\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203894444\">\n    2010 WL 3894444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16.

Plaintiff also challenges the reliability and admissibility of the consumer survey on which Bania relied for some of his opinions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [148] at 14; [158] at 8-10. This Court first considers Plaintiff's primary challenges to Bania's report before turning to the consumer survey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff's objections to Bania's report rest solely upon a challenge to Bania's qualifications and methodology with respect to calculating damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [104] at 8-16; [148] at 25. For the reasons explained below, this Court does not reach the question of damages because it finds that Defendant did not infringe on Plaintiff's mark. Plaintiff's motion to strike Bania's report is, therefore, denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As noted above, however, Bania's opinions extend beyond the issue of damages. His report also addresses the interaction of the parties' products in the marketplace.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [124-8] at 3, 13. Among other conclusions, Bania states that: (1) the parties'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   products are dissimilar; (2) a number of cell phone case suppliers use the term \"Capsule\" in the names of their cases; (3) consumers do not identify the Capsule mark with Uncommon; and (4) Defendant's use of \"Capsule\" likely did not interfere with Plaintiff's business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-12, 13. These opinions relate to Plaintiff's infringement claims and Defendant's counterclaim for cancellation of Plaintiff's mark for descriptiveness.

Because this case turns primarily on consumer perception of the parties' products and marks, Bania conducted a variety of internet searches to examine how the products and marks appear to consumers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-12.

Although experts like Bania may generally rely upon studies conducted by other experts in forming their opinions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 703, this is not the case when such studies involve discretionary expertise that the testifying expert lacks,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dura Auto. Sys. of Ind. v. CTS Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n    285 F.3d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 614 (7th Cir. 2002). As explained below, because Bania admits that he is not a survey expert, and because the consumer survey offered here involves discretion, the survey requires Martensen's testimony to\n   be admissible at trial and his sworn support to be considered at summary judgment. Thus, this Court next considers Plaintiff's motion to strike Martensen's affidavit. [177].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant submitted Martensen's affidavit with its responses to Plaintiff's statement of additional facts; it attests to the validity of the consumer survey conducted by Martensen's firm. [171-8]. Plaintiff objects to Martensen's declaration on three grounds: (1) Martensen cannot submit a testimonial affidavit because Defendant designated him as a nontestifying expert; (2) if Martensen is a testifying expert, Defendant failed to provide the expert report required by Rule 26 ; and (3) Plaintiff suffered harm from this undisclosed use of Martensen's testimony. [177] at 2, 5. Plaintiff therefore seeks to strike Martensen's affidavit and bar his opinions and testimony from consideration now and at trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because this Court finds no basis to exclude Martensen's declaration, and because Defendant's failure to adhere precisely to the letter of Rule 26 was harmless, the motion to strike Martensen's declaration is denied. Since Martensen's declaration constitutes the requisite support for the admission of Defendant's consumer survey, this Court sets out in detail the reason for this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff's first argues that as a designated nontestifying expert, Martensen cannot offer any testimonial evidence, including a sworn declaration. [177] at 2. Plaintiff's sole support for this exclusionary rule is\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n    285 F.3d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The defendants used that admission to challenge the inclusion of the expert's testimony, and the plaintiffs responded with affidavits from the employees at the expert's firm who created the models, attesting to their validity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n    at 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The mathematical modeling involved such specialized, discretionary expertise that it could not be summarily relied upon by someone lacking that expertise, and required its own expert support.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n    at 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so ruling, the Seventh Circuit did not reject the clear meaning of FRE 703, which allows \"an expert to base an opinion in part on what a different expert believes on the basis of expert knowledge not possessed by the first expert,\" without imposing any \"\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   requirement that the other expert testify as well.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n    at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Seventh Circuit was concerned, however, with a situation in which the \"soundness of the underlying expert judgment is in issue,\" and held that where an underlying study is \"not cut and dried\" but involves \"professional discretion,\" the person who produced the study must testify to its adequacy,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n    at 613-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The models at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   were sufficiently discretionary to require testimony from their creators.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Since the employees who wrote them were not previously identified, but were necessary to establish the validity of the study, the district court reasonably treated them as previously undisclosed experts, whose new reports as to their models were untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n    at 612, 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). The plaintiffs should have known that the modeling was beyond their original expert's expertise; discovery had closed by the time the employees were finally named in the suit; and the withholding of the employees' names may have been strategic.\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n    285 F.3d at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As should be clear from this discussion,\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   affects Bania's ability to offer opinions based upon the consumer survey absent supporting testimony from Martensen, who created the survey.\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   does not, however, demand that Martensen's declaration be excluded. The Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court's exclusion of the supplementary affidavits because: (1) the district court reasonably treated the newly revealed employees' affidavits as untimely \"experts' reports\"; and (2) the district court reasonably found the late disclosure harmful.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446178\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/609/#p614\">\n    at 612-13, 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, this Court must determine whether Martensen's declaration constitutes an expert report, and if so, whether its untimely production was harmful or unjustified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On the first point, consumer surveys involve sufficiently discretionary expertise that they require the testimonial support of someone with expertise in that field.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spraying Sys. Co. v. Delavan, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514335\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/975/387/#p394\">\n    975 F.2d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 394 (7th Cir. 1992) (discussing potential bias and discretionary choices in conducting consumer surveys);\n   <em>\n    Simon Property Grp.

Ind. 2000) (\"Consumer survey results must be presented through expert witnesses.\"). Bania has admitted that he is not a survey expert and has not conducted \"a lot of surveys.\" [183-6] at 2. Thus, the survey requires Martensen's testimony to support its admission. But the need for Martensen's testimony does not necessarily mean that his affidavit constitutes an untimely expert report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendant's situation is similar to that of the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   in one key respect: both erroneously assumed that their experts could permissibly rely upon another's expertise, according to the general rule of FRE 703. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   , Defendant should have planned to have the original expert testify, and that expert should have provided a formal report as required by FRCP 26(a)(2)(B). But Defendant never provided such a report and it seems that Martensen's affidavit was not intended to be one: in large part it merely restates the summary of findings disclosed to Plaintiff in December 2016.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   [171-8] \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 4, 5-8, 10, 11,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   [124-19] at 3-5, 15-24. Unlike the affidavits in\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   , Martensen's affidavit bolsters previously provided information by including it in a sworn statement rather than merely offering it as an unsworn attachment; it does not significantly expand the record on the survey's methodology. Indeed, Defendant continues to argue that Martensen need not provide an expert report because of his designation as a nontestifying expert. [183] at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In these circumstances, the affidavit does not constitute an expert report. It is, however, a testimonial statement from a witness who was (erroneously) designated a nontestifying expert. Contrary to Plaintiff's contention, there is no rule barring such statements from nontestifying experts.\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   did not address this issue, and\n   the few cases to do so have not held that the statement is barred, but rather that the privilege normally accorded to nontestifying experts under FRCP 26(b)(4)(D) is waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Positive Techs., Inc. v. Sony Elecs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-CV-2226 SI (KAW),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201402337\">\n    2013 WL 1402337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D.

Mo. 1993). Thus, were Martensen properly considered a nontestifying expert, he would have opened himself up to discovery by submitting the affidavit. But the parties do not address the rescission of Martensen's privilege; the question they pose is whether any rule bars Martensen's affidavit, and this Court finds none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Instead, the situation is this: Defendant erroneously designated Martensen as a nontestifying expert when, in fact, it needs his testimony to introduce the consumer survey report. Because Martensen must testify, but Defendant never provided an expert report regarding his testimony, Defendant failed to comply with FRCP 26. Thus, the final question is whether Rule 37 excuses that failure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Rule 37(c)(1) provides that where a party fails to provide information about a witness as required by Rule 26, courts should exclude that information and witness from consideration \"unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\" Whether a failure to comply with Rule 26(a) may be excused under Rule 37 is \"left to the broad discretion of the district court,\"\n   <em>\n    Dynegy Mktg. &amp; Trade v. Multiut Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3741010\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/506/#p514\">\n    648 F.3d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 514 (7th Cir. 2011), which may tailor any sanctions to the omission,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salgado by Salgado v. Gen. Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540719\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/735/\">\n    150 F.3d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 741 n.6 (7th Cir. 1998). When applying Rule 37, courts consider: \"(1) the prejudice or surprise to the party against whom the evidence is offered; (2) the ability of the party to cure the prejudice; (3) the likelihood of disruption to the trial; and (4) the bad faith or willfulness involved in not disclosing the evidence at an earlier date.\"\n   <em>\n    David v. Caterpillar, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160795\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/851/#p857\">\n    324 F.3d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 857 (7th Cir. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Here, Defendant's failure to provide an expert report was harmless, mainly because Defendant made substantial, timely disclosures about both Martensen and the survey. Defendant included Martensen in its expert disclosure to Plaintiff in December 2016, stating that he would conduct a consumer survey that would inform Bania's opinions, and noting that although Martensen was considered a nontestifying expert, he might \"be called to testify on the methodology of the survey if needed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [183-5] at 2-3; [183-2]. Although this statement should have signaled to Defendant that Martensen needed to produce an expert report, it still gave Plaintiff clear notice of Martensen's potential testimony well before the close of expert discovery, let alone trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [114]. Moreover, Defendant included substantial detail about the survey's design and methodology in the findings report disclosed to Plaintiff in December 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [124-19] at 3-5, 15-24. Finally, although Defendant did not provide as detailed a resume for Martensen as for Bania, Defendant gave Plaintiff a two-page summary of his credentials at that time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [157-18] (indicating receipt by December 7, 2016); [157-20].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In light of these disclosures, this Court finds no likelihood of surprise to Plaintiff as to the nature or substance of Martensen's testimony, or of the consumer survey. This minimizes the prejudice to Plaintiff, who, in any event, had ample opportunity to depose Martensen and did not do so. Designating Martensen a nontestifying expert did not shield him from discovery: where a nontestifying expert's report forms the basis for an expert's\n   opinion, the nontestifying expert may be deposed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

As discussed above, however, the survey findings disclosed to Plaintiff in December 2016 contained significant information on the methodology of the survey. [124-19]. Martensen's affidavit, which this Court has admitted, provides sworn support for that information. [171-8]. No categorical bar prevents admitting the consumer survey under these circumstances, nor does Plaintiff point to any. Rather, the admissibility of the survey turns on its reliability, which this Court will now consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Seventh Circuit has said that for a consumer survey to be admissible, it \"must comply with the principles of professional survey research,\"\n   <em>\n    Evory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5857675\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/505/769/#p776\">\n    505 F.3d at 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and should not rely upon \"leading or suggestive\" questions,\n   <em>\n    Muha v.

The fact that the survey does not appear to have included images of the products somewhat weakens its value, given the relevance of the mark's appearance to consumer confusion, but\n   does not seriously undermine it since the \"Capsule\" mark has no particular visual content.

This Court has little information on this point, other than the fact that Goldmarks conducted the survey online through the third-party platform SurveyMonkey, [124-19] at 4, and \"complied with the general principles of professional survey research,\" per Martensen's sworn statement, [171-8] \u00b6 5. Despite the meagerness of the record on this point, it is difficult to see how an online survey suffers the risk of bias presented by human interviewers, which is what this factor seeks to identify.

RFA 18 asked Defendant to admit that the \"term 'CAPSULE' as used by Spigen and Uncommon's CAPSULE mark are identical in appearance.\" [149-8] at 6.

This Court has already discussed why the use of the cell phone sticker is largely irrelevant to the merits of this case.

Further, Plaintiff has, at best, used the term for under eight years; even though it is not impossible that secondary meaning could arise in that time, this case falls closer on the spectrum to five years (which casts \"serious doubt upon the very possibility\" of establishing a \"strong secondary meaning\") than fifty years (which is better proof of an established brand).\n   <em>\n    Gimix, Inc. v.

Moreover, if the period of Plaintiff's exclusive use is less than a year (as evidenced by Plaintiff's first use in 2009 and Defendant's 2010 introduction of Capsule products), that fact provides a significant reason to doubt that the mark achieved secondary meaning,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1510548\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/699/901/#p907\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , particularly in a market replete with similar products,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Custom Vehicles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3763712\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/476/481/#p485\">\n    476 F.3d at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the difficulty of establishing secondary meaning in a competitive market for similar products).

[125] at 11. As to advertising, it is far from clear that Plaintiff's efforts were minimal. The record shows that Plaintiff hired a marketing firm, used Google ads, ran traditional ads, and sought celebrity placements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 24-25; [124-14].

Defendant offers evidence of Plaintiff's sales from July 2010 to March 2011, [128], but this hardly covers the full period of Plaintiff's Capsule sales, and in any event Defendant provides no evidence allowing this Court to assess the relative strength of such sales in the cell phone case market. Thus, these factors do not serve to rebut the presumption of secondary meaning accorded to Plaintiff's mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The foregoing factors are \"circumstantial\" evidence of secondary meaning.\n   <em>\n    Int'l Kennel Club of Chi., Inc. v.

[124-19]. The survey shows that among consumers of cell phones and cell phone cases-excluding employees in the industry-only 6 percent of respondents were familiar with \"Capsule\" as a brand name (compared with over 60 percent familiar with the competing case brand \"OtterBox\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Only 14 percent of respondents could connect \"Capsule\" to cell phone cases when prompted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. As such, the survey indicates that, far from \"Capsule\" having \"come to mean\" a cell phone case in the minds of consumers, it has barely registered with consumers.

Despite this, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant has admitted the likelihood of consumer confusion, which it argues is dispositive of the entire confusion inquiry. [148] at 15. However, the paragraphs in Defendant's Answer that Plaintiff points to pertain to Count II of Defendant's counterclaim asserting\n   prior use of the mark, [47] \u00b6\u00b6 38-40, which this Court dismissed, [62] at 15, and in any event contain no direct admission of confusion. Nor do Defendant's admissions elsewhere clearly admit consumer confusion. Instead, Defendant's responses to Plaintiff's requests for admission (RFAs) merely preserve its defense that Defendant is the senior user of the mark, [149-19] (RFA Nos. 55, 57), and in one instance argues-presumably in service of its since-abandoned counterclaim-that Plaintiff's mark is subject to cancellation because of Defendant's senior use of the mark,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514731\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/6/1225/#p1231\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (RFA No. 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In no way do these responses resemble the circumstances of the cases cited by Plaintiff, which either do not support Plaintiff's position, are confined to specific factual circumstances, are out-of-circuit opinions that fail to persuade this Court, or some combination of the above.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Days Inns Worldwide, Inc. v.
