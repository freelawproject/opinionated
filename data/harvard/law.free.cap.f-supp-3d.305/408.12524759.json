The Underlying Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On June 21, 2010, Mohamed Turay, then-employed as a truck driver by Watkins, was injured while making a carpet delivery to Valley Stream. (Defs.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; Pls.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 2.) On January 10, 2012, Turay and his wife commenced a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Nassau against Valley Stream seeking recovery for Turay's injuries (the \"Underlying Action\"). (Defs.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11; Pls.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 1.) Peerless assigned counsel to defend Valley Stream in the Underlying Action. (Defs.' Resp. 56. Statement \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   By letter dated October 17, 2012, Peerless tendered a claim to Watkins for the defense and indemnification of Valley Stream in the Underlying Action. (Defs.' Resp.56. Statement \u00b6 14; Pls.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 7.) Peerless reasoned in that letter that because Turay's \"injury occurred while loading/unloading a motor vehicle,\" as Turay's employer, \"we turn to [ATTIC] for defense and indemnification of Valley Stream House of Carpets under [ATTIC's] Commercial Automobile Policy.\" (Defs.' Resp. 56. Statement \u00b6 14; Pls.' Ex. C, ECF No. 78-5; Pls.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 7; Cossairt Dec. Ex. 5, ECF No. 81-7.) On November 9, 2012, Mr. Elison, corporation counsel at Watkins, responded to Peerless by letter stating that he was \"not aware of any contractual obligation requiring Watkins and Shepard to pick up the defense,\" and denied Peerless' request to defend Valley Stream.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pls.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 8; Coissart Decl. Ex. 6, ECF No. 81-8.) On August 27, 2014, Liberty Mutual renewed the tender request to Watkins. (Defs.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 17; Pls.' Ex. E, ECF No. 78-7.) Watkins then forwarded the request to ATTIC. (Defs.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 18.) On October 3, 2014, coverage counsel for ATTIC, James R. Callan, informed Peerless that ATTIC would assume the defense of Valley Stream, subject to a reservation of rights. (Defs.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 21; Pls.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 9; Coissart Decl. Ex. 7, at 2, ECF No. 81-9.) Additionally, ATTIC informed Peerless that ATTIC's liability, if any, would \"be limited to only those defense costs incurred subsequent to [the] August 26, 2014, tender to ATTIC's insured.\" (Coissart Decl. Ex. 7, at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On February 3, 2015, the Underlying Action was settled for $375,000 (the \"Settlement\"), which amount was paid by Peerless. (Defs.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 23; Pls.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 10.) The Settlement was subject to the execution of a separate written agreement among ATTIC, Peerless, and Valley Stream, wherein the parties agreed that the Settlement would not prejudice any party's claims concerning coverage in the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (Pls.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 10; Coissart Decl. Ex. 9, ECF No. 81-11.)

Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 11; Coissart Decl. Ex. 10, ECF No. 81-12.) ATTIC reimbursed Peerless in the amount of $30,106.37 for defense costs incurred after ATTIC assumed Valley Stream's defense on October 3, 2014, subject to a reservation of rights. (Defs.'

For example, the Appellate Division of the Second Department has held that a similar type of conformance provision required an insurer to provide coverage consistent with minimum requirements set forth in the Financial Security Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gen.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, these facts do not obviate Plaintiffs' obligation to provide coverage consistent with that required for an owner's policy as contemplated by the contract. There can be no question that the parties at all times intended coverage pursuant to the Coverage Conformance Provision to conform to the requirements of an owner's policy of insurance. On this, the Court need look no further than the testimony of Plaintiffs' Executive Vice President. Indeed, when asked, he admitted that the ATTIC Policy was drafted to \"provide the required coverages of owner's policies of insurance in New York.\" (Pls.'

On October 17, 2012, Peerless tendered a claim for the defense and indemnification of Valley Stream to Watkins. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Resp. 56. Statement \u00b6 14; Pls.' Ex. C; Pls.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 7; Cossairt Dec. Ex. 5.) In that letter, Peerless stated that \"[s]ince the injury occurred while loading/unloading a motor vehicle, we turn to you for defense and indemnification of Valley Stream House of Carpets under your Commercial Automobile Policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Resp. 56. Statement \u00b6 14; Pls.' Ex. C; Pls.' Resp. 56.1 Statement \u00b6 7; Cossairt Dec. Ex. 5.). The Court finds that this statement in the letter to Watkins triggered ATTIC's duty to defend the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of the ATTIC Policy's Notice Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   ATTIC also argues it had no duty to defend because it received late notice of the Underlying Action, which was in violation of the notice provision in the ATTIC Policy. (Pls.' Mot. 18-19.) ATTIC alleges that its interests were \"severely prejudiced\" because it did not learn of the claim until August 27, 2014, more than four years after the accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) The ATTIC Policy provides the following with respect to notice provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   In the event of a claim or suit being made or served on any insured, the Named Insured(s) must:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Immediately deliver to ATTIC, RRG a copy of such claim or suit including any demand, request, notice, order, summons or other legal paper received by any insured....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (Pls.' Ex. A, at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Generally, coverage under a policy is dependent on whether notice is provided to the insurer, as required by the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steadele v. Colony Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748235\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/361/459/#p463\">\n    361 Mont. 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 465,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748235\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/361/459/#p463\">\n    260 P.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mont. 2011). Under Montana law, a refusal to provide coverage because of a delay in notification requires the insurance company to demonstrate prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Steadele\n   </em>\n   , 361 Mont. At 466-67 (\"In this case, because Colony did not receive notice of the claim, Colony was prejudiced in that it was deprived of the ability to investigate, to locate witnesses, to appoint counsel, to engage in discovery, to negotiate a settlement, and to develop a trial strategy.\"). ATTIC's claim to have suffered prejudice from an alleged \"breach\" of the ATTIC Policy is without merit. In the ATTIC Policy, Mr. Elison is listed as \"Claims Counsel\" for ATTIC. (Pls.' Ex. A, at 5.) It is more than reasonable that Peerless chose to notify the employee listed in ATTIC's own policy as being responsible for claims management. ATTIC's argument, raised at oral argument, that Mr. Elison no longer worked at ATTIC, does not advance its position. It is unreasonable, however, to expect an additional insured to investigate the accuracy of information provided by an insurer in its policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Finally, the Court rejects arguments of any alleged \"breach,\" because the ATTIC Policy obligates the \"Named Insured\" to inform ATTIC of a claim. It contains no provision requiring an additional insured to provide notice of a claim or suit. Any late notice to ATTIC was the result of Watkins' failure to notify ATTIC of a claim; no fault can be attributed to Peerless for any delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   ATTIC failed to assume defense of the action until October 2014, more than two\n   years after receiving notice of a duty to defend. Because ATTIC unjustifiably refused to defend Valley Stream's claim, it is obligated to pay for the costs of defending the claim, as well as the stipulated settlement agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9236776\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/320/174/#p179\">\n    320 Mont. 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9236776\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/320/174/#p179\">\n    86 P.3d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mont. 2004) (noting that an insurance company that unjustifiably refuses to defend a claim will be held liable for the cost of defending the claim as well as any resulting judgments);\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

Mont. 2015) (finding insurer liable to pay total amount of settlement agreement, in addition to defense costs, where it unjustifiably refused to defend action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendants also seek the attorneys' fees associated with the defense of the current action. (Defs.' Mot. 24-25.) Montana typically follows the \"American Rule,\" that each party is required to assume the costs of litigation absent a specific contractual or statutory provision.\n   <em>\n    Mountain W. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Brewer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"181859\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/315/231/#p235\">\n    315 Mont. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235, 245,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"181859\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/315/231/#p235\">\n    69 P.3d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mont. 2003) (stating American Rule and finding insurance exception to American Rule inapplicable to third-parties to an insurance contract). The Court finds no legal basis upon which to deviate from this long standing rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Primary Versus Excess Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   ATTIC argues that should the Court find that it must provide coverage to Valley Stream, any coverage under the ATTIC Policy is in excess of any available coverage under the Peerless Policy. (Pls.' Opp. 22.) In making this argument, ATTIC turns to an additional limitation in the ATTIC Policy which provides that \"[i]f the cargo moving equipment used by an insured during the loading or unloading process is not owned, leased or under the control of the Named Insured(s) this coverage will apply\n   <em>\n    only in excess\n   </em>\n   of any other available coverage.\" (Pls.' Ex. A, at 21-22.) Moreover, ATTIC contends that Valley Stream has conceded that Watkins was not the owner of the hand truck or dolly used by Turay. (Pls.' Opp. 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendants contend, as a threshold matter, that this limitation does not apply because a \"hand truck or even a dolly\" is not \"cargo moving equipment.\" (Defs.'Reply 9.) Instead, Defendants maintain that the \"average consumer\" would more likely consider items such as a \"fork lift, hydraulic lift, crane, or something similar\" as \"cargo moving equipment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Perhaps. Merriam-Webster, however, defines a \"forklift\" as a \"self-propelled machine for hoisting and transporting heavy objects by means of steel fingers inserted under the load.\"\n   <em>\n    See Forklift\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/forklift. A \"dolly\" is defined as \"a platform on a roller or on wheels or casters for moving heavy objects.\"\n   <em>\n    See Dolly\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dolly. Under these definitions, a dolly and a fork lift are both clearly instruments intended to move cargo, contrary to Defendants' tortured argument. Nonetheless, Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs have failed to offer any support that the cargo moving equipment was not a least \"controlled\" by Turay at the time of the incident. Instead, Plaintiffs cite to Defendants' 56.1 Statement, which makes reference to a pre-mediation statement submitted by Turay wherein he states that the equipment used was not owned by Watkins; it speaks nothing of control.
