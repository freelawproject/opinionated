(\"App. Brief\"). The brief submitted by Cardi sought to overturn the verdict on nine grounds. App. Brief at 37-56. The First Department affirmed Samo's conviction and sentence. Its opinion reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The verdict was based on legally sufficient evidence and was not against the weight of the evidence. There is no basis for disturbing the jury's credibility determinations, including its resolution of any inconsistencies in testimony. Although the People's main witness was an accomplice in the crime, there was extensive evidence provided by nonaccomplice witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The court articulated a reasonable basis for the exercise of its discretion to have [petitioner] restrained during trial, and the restraint was justified by an essential state interest in courtroom security, specific to this defendant. The court based its decision on [petitioner's] threatening statements and actions only a few weeks earlier at a trial that had resulted in a mistrial. [Petitioner's] threatening behavior was serious, particularly when viewed in the context of belligerent and intimidating conduct by jointly tried codefendants, as well as courtroom spectators. The court minimized any prejudice by taking steps to prevent the jury from seeing [petitioner's] restraints, and by way of an instruction to the jury that defense counsel had requested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The court properly denied [petitioner's] motion to preclude testimony regarding admissions he made to a fellow inmate while incarcerated on this case, and there was no violation of [petitioner's] right to counsel. The record supports the court's finding that the witness was not an agent of the government with regard to the prosecution of this defendant. Moreover, [petitioner] initiated the conversation and volunteered his statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The court properly denied, as untimely, [petitioner's] motion to suppress physical evidence recovered as the result of a search warrant. [Petitioner] had all the information necessary to make a motion to controvert the warrant much earlier in the proceedings. In any event, there was no prejudice because the objects recovered under the warrant added little or nothing to the People's case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   We find that [petitioner] received effective assistance of counsel under the state and federal standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [Petitioner] did not preserve his challenges to the prosecutor's summation, and we decline to review them in the interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we find no basis for reversal. We perceive no basis for reducing the sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Samo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357712,4354701\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/124/412/\">\n    124 A.D.3d at 412-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354701\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/124/412/4354701/\">\n    1 N.Y.S.3d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Application for Leave to Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the Appellate Division ruling, Cardi submitted a letter to the New York Court of Appeals dated February 17, 2015, seeking leave to appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Dawn M.

Notably, when Samo did make inquiry by means of a letter to the New York Court of Appeals, he learned of the result within a week.
