Smith, Chief Judge\n   Presently before the Court is Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint (ECF No. 56), in which they ask permission to update their story about alleged fraud spearheaded by Defendant CVS Pharmacy, Inc., (\"CVS\"). In particular, Plaintiffs would like to revise their complaint to comport with information they learned in discovery, namely, that Pharmacy Benefit Managers (\"PBMs\"), who facilitated generic-drug purchases between Plaintiffs and CVS, were allegedly aware of and abetted CVS's fraud. But not only do Plaintiffs seek to amend their factual allegations; they also hope to add two claims under the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1968. For the reasons that follow, Plaintiffs' Motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Background\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Alleging negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and violations of state-consumer-protection acts, Plaintiffs had it in their original complaint that CVS overcharged them by collecting more for generic drugs than it was allowed under the National Council for Prescription Drug Program (\"NCPDP\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheet Metal Workers Local No. 20 Welfare and Benefit Fund v. CVS Health Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270976\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/227/#p229\">\n    221 F.Supp.3d 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229-31 (D.R.I. 2016) (denying CVS's motion to dismiss). According to this complaint, a key component of CVS's fraud was its Health Savings Pass (\"HSP\") program, which CVS developed to compete with big-box retailers (e.g., Wal-Mart, Inc.) who had recently slashed prices on certain generic drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270976\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/227/#p229\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270976\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/227/#p229\">\n    at 229-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Instituted November 2008 and discontinued February 2016, the HSP program allowed individual cash-paying CVS customers to access discounted prices by paying an annual membership fee. (Pls.' Proposed First Am. Compl. (\"PAC\") 3, ECF No. 58-1). Though nominal, the fee paid substantial dividends. CVS saved large sums by purposefully structuring the HSP program to prevent Plaintiffs, and others similarly situated, from accessing the program's discounts while remaining (or so it thought) in compliance with NCPDP's requirement that CVS charge Plaintiffs no more than the general public, that is, no more than the \"Usual and Customary\" (\"U &amp; C\") price for drugs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4, 43.) The thought was that because the HSP price was not available to cash customers, but only to HSP members, CVS was not required to offer that price to Plaintiffs, but could instead report the higher price paid by non-HSP-member cash customers as the U &amp; C price.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) This allowed CVS to retain cash customers without passing on the price cut to purchasers like Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Since filing its original complaint, Plaintiffs claim discovery has revealed a more complex scheme whereby CVS did not act alone, but rather enlisted the help of various\n   other entities to develop and conceal the gambit described above to bilk Plaintiffs and others out of billions of dollars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-43.) One of these entities was Caremark, LLC, (\"Caremark\"). Caremark helped CVS design the HSP program, and in particular, developed the nominal-membership-fee feature as a way to compete with the big-box stores for cash customers without offering similar savings to Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-24). Caremark also administered the HSP program from its inception in 2008 to 2013, when Medical Security Card Company (\"ScriptSave\") took it over. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27.) Both Caremark and ScriptSave recognized that the program allowed CVS to \" 'protect' loyalty member price[s] from third parties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.) But, anticipating that these third parties would consider such protection a bug, not a feature, of the program, they worked with CVS to keep it a secret. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that four of the country's largest PBMs-Caremark, Express Scripts, Inc., OptumRx, Inc., and MedImpact Healthcare Systems, Inc.-were in on the scheme, too. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-43.) PBMs contract with health plans like Plaintiffs to reimburse pharmacies like CVS when a plan's members fill their prescriptions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5, 10.) PBMs ostensibly work on behalf of their health-plan clients to, among other things, negotiate low pharmacy drug prices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The interests of PBMs and health plans are not perfectly aligned, however. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17.) Health plans want cheap drugs; PBMs want the difference between what they pay pharmacies for drugs and what they charge health plans for those drugs to be as large as possible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, the difference between what PBMs pay and what they charge is their gain, but the health plans' loss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The PBMs allegedly increased this spread by deliberately hiding from health plans the fact that CVS was not reporting its HSP price as its U &amp; C price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.) Each PBM developed an internal policy interpreting definitions of U &amp; C price in their respective contracts with CVS as excluding HSP prices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-43.) Plaintiffs allege that this was no coincidence-that CVS prompted the PBMs to keep the ruse a secret, and that each PBM knew the others had agreed to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This assurance was paramount to the scheme, for if any one PBM had confessed, the health plans would have put a stop to it, insisting they pay no more than CVS's cash customers in accordance with their contracts with the PBMs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.) Indeed, Plaintiffs say that, in a competitive market, such insistence would have been unnecessary, as one or more PBMs would have adopted HSP prices sua sponte in an effort to attract plan business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, fraud operated here on more than a wink and a nod. Plaintiffs allege that it \"was orchestrated out of the corporate headquarters of CVS, Caremark, each remaining PBM, and ScriptSave\" and \"required those headquarters to communicate directly and frequently by U.S. Mail and interstate wire facilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-61.) Plaintiffs aver that these parties \"share[d] information regarding various cash discount programs, the structure of those programs, and whether they [were] reporting those prices as U &amp; C prices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66.) For example, in a back-and-forth between CVS executives and executives at Indiana Carpenters Welfare Fund's PBM, Medco Health Solutions, Inc., (now owned by Express Scripts), Medco assured CVS that it would interpret its definition of U &amp; C price-\"the lowest net cash price a cash ... customer would have paid ... inclusive of all applicable discounts\"-as excluding CVS's HSP price, even though Medco had previously determined that it would consider Wal-Mart,\n   Inc.'s discounted price for generics as its U &amp; C price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-38.) Unsuccessful in its attempt to have Medco modify its definition of U &amp; C price to explicitly exclude discounts associated with \"card programs such as CVS' Health Savings Pass,\" CVS settled for Medco's sotto voce amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) CVS then notified an ostensible competitor of Medco's-Caremark-of Medco's decision when a vice president at CVS, Tina Egan, forwarded an email to Caremark's senior legal counsel, Roderick Bergin, containing Medco's discreet capitulation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37 (\"Ms. Egan forwarded Medco's response to Roderick Bergin ... as an 'FYI.' \").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs believe that the foregoing, if proved, supports the two RICO claims in their PAC. In the first of these claims, Plaintiffs allege that CVS and Caremark shepherded a RICO enterprise that included the aforementioned PBMs and ScriptSave, all of whom Plaintiffs want as defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-64.) This enterprise worked together to defraud Plaintiffs by disguising the fact that CVS failed to report HSP prices as its U &amp; C prices for certain generic drugs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The second claim is similar to the first, except that it splits the enterprise alleged in the first claim into three, each including CVS, Caremark, ScriptSave, and one of the three other PBMs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-78.) Plaintiffs also have a standalone fraud claim in their PAC, which relies on the same alleged fraud underlying their RICO claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82-83.) The remaining claims-negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and violations of state-consumer-protection acts-are holdovers from the original complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheet Metal Workers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270976\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/227/#p229\">\n    221 F.Supp.3d at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.

Compl. 3, ECF No. 65.) Defendant notes that a mere thirty pages of discovery-sworn declarations from the PBMs indicating\n   they knew CVS was not reporting HSP prices-form the basis of Plaintiffs' PAC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 3) Moreover, Plaintiffs possessed the PBMs' declarations as early as December 23, 2016, over five months before Plaintiffs submitted their Motion to Amend on June 5, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, Defendant contends, \"If they had acted diligently, Plaintiffs easily could have reviewed those documents and moved to amend the complaint by March 3, 2017, the agreed deadline.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The closest case Defendant finds to these facts is\n   <em>\n    Steir v.

In\n   <em>\n    Steir\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff moved to amend her complaint nine months after defendant tacitly conceded facts relevant to the proposed amendment, three months after the defendant openly conceded such facts, and a week after discovery had closed.\n   <em>\n    Steir\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9204512\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/383/7/\">\n    383 F.3d at 13-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notwithstanding plaintiff's \"somnolence,\" the First Circuit considered the question whether plaintiff met Rule 16(b)'s good-cause standard a difficult one, finding that \"[w]hile it would have been well within the discretion of the district court to allow the motion, it was not an abuse of discretion to deny it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9204512\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/383/7/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9204512\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/383/7/\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This case is different. Plaintiffs here moved to amend their complaint five months after CVS began producing documents which now number in the hundreds of thousands of pages. (Pls.'

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And unlike in\n   <em>\n    Steir\n   </em>\n   , discovery had not yet closed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While it may be true that Plaintiffs received the thirty pages they rely on in their PAC on December 23, 2016, these thirty pages were among 3,024 they received that day, followed by 401,175 pages they received a few weeks later. (Pls.' Reply Brief in Supp. of Their Mot. for Leave to File First Am. Compl. 11, ECF No. 62.)

Undue Delay\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant marshals the same facts to argue undue delay as it did to argue lack of diligence, namely, that Plaintiffs waited five months after they had received documentation supporting their new theories to move for amendment. (Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Obj. to Pls.' Mot. for Leave to File First Am. Compl. (\"Def.'s Obj.\") 16, 19, ECF No. 60-1.)

To be sure, where significant time has elapsed between filing the complaint and moving to amend, the movant must show a valid reason for the delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Lombardo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063999\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/1/#p3\">\n    755 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3 (1st Cir. 2014). And here, even though the time between filing the complaint and moving to amend is considerable, Plaintiffs have in fact provided a valid reason for the delay: before receiving their declarations, Plaintiffs were under the impression that the PBMs too were unaware of CVS's alleged pricing scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enzymotec Ltd. v.

Futility\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant's other argument under Rule 15(a) against allowing amendment is that to do so would be futile. (Def.'s Obj. 19-34.) As discussed above, the Court uses the familiar 12(b)(6) motion-to-dismiss standard to pass on the proposed amendment's futility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This Court has already held that Plaintiffs' negligent-misrepresentation, unjust-enrichment, and statutory consumer-protection claims meet the 12(b)(6) standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheet Metal Workers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270976\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/227/#p229\">\n    221 F.Supp.3d at 237-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Updating these claims in light of the allegation that the PBMs were privy to CVS's alleged chicanery does not change the Court's analysis as to these claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   They continue to clear Rule 12(b)(6)'s plausibility threshold, and therefore their amendment would not be futile under Rule 15(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The thornier question here is whether the same can be said of Plaintiffs' RICO claims. A viable RICO claim under \u00a7 1962(c) requires four elements: \"1) conduct; 2) of an enterprise; 3) through a\n   pattern; 4) of racketeering activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Libertad v.

Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' RICO claims are futile because they properly allege neither a RICO enterprise, a pattern of racketeering, predicate acts of racketeering, nor causation. (Def.'s Obj. 19-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   RICO defines \"enterprise\" as \"any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4).

It would stand to reason, then, that each PBM would be incented to require CVS to report HSP prices as its U &amp; C prices-in order to secure lower drug prices for its current customers and to attract those of its competitors. That the PBMs in this case seemingly did not act as they would be expected to in a competitive market, but rather in a manner that increased profit to both the PBMs and CVS at the expense of the plans, lends further credence to Plaintiffs allegation that they acted together.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evergreen Partnering Grp., Inc. v.

The statute does not require each of an enterprise's various entities to work side-by-side with every other such entity.
