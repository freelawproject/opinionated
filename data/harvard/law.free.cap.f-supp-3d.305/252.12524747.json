Plaintiffs Michael and Alla Hale (\"plaintiffs\" or \"the Hales\") bring this action against Pan Am Railways, Inc. (\"Pan Am\"), Americold Logistics LLC (\"Americold\") and Cryo-Trans, Inc. (\"Cryo-Trans\") (collectively \"defendants\"), alleging that defendants were negligent in their operation of Railcar CRYX 5017 which caused Mr. Hale's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court are the motions to dismiss of defendants Pan Am and Cryo-Trans (Docket No. 18 and 20). For the following reasons, Pan Am's motion to dismiss will be denied but Cryo-Trans's motion to dismiss will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are Connecticut residents and Mr. Hale was an employee of C &amp; S Wholesale Grocers (\"C &amp; S\") at its facility in Hatfield, Massachusetts from 1996 until the time of the accident. C &amp; S operates regional distribution centers where it receives food products and ships them to supermarkets and other retail stores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Hale alleges that on February 3, 2015, he was instructed to unload Railcar CRYX 5017 which was loaded with pallets containing frozen tater tots shipped from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Mr. Hale states that the railcar arrived and was rejected by C &amp; S due to weight distribution issues. Because the car was unbalanced, it could not be moved and Mr. Hale and other employees of C &amp; S were instructed to unload the railcar. During the process of unloading, several packages of frozen tater tots, weighing approximately 80 pounds, fell on Mr. Hale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the complaint, Mr. Hale details the injuries he suffered as a result of the\n   incident, including injuries to both feet, requiring surgery, and injuries to his ankles, knees, neck and back. Mr. Hale also notes that he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder, has been unable to return to work and has been determined to be partially disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants Americold and Pan Am are Delaware corporations with their principal places of business in Atlanta, Georgia and Billerica, Massachusetts, respectively. Defendant Cryo-Trans is a Maryland corporation with its principal place of business in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this action in May, 2017, alleging that defendants were negligent in the operation of the railcar. Ms. Hale brings a claim for loss of consortium against all defendants. Defendant Americold filed its answer and cross-claims for contribution against Cryo-Trans and Pan Am in June, 2017. Cryo-Trans and Pan Am separately moved to dismiss the complaint in July, 2017. Americold and the Hales separately opposed those motions which are the subject of this memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

They contend that the allegations in the complaint fall within the definition of \"transportation by rail carriers\" which, according to defendants, puts the claims exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (\"STB\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Hales suggest that the preemption argument of defendants Cryo-Trans and Pan Am is premature at the motion to dismiss stage. Plaintiffs also dispute the merits of that argument, contending that to defend a negligence suit would not unreasonably burden the companies' railroad operations and, therefore, this action does not fall within the jurisdiction of the ICCTA. In its opposition, Americold adds that the jurisdiction of the STB does not encompass\n   personal injury or negligence actions and that Congress instead targeted economic and regulatory matters with its enactment of the ICCTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The ICCTA vests the STB with exclusive jurisdiction over\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) transportation by rail carriers, and the remedies provided in this part with respect to rates, classifications, rules (including car service, interchange, and other operating rules), practices, routes, services, and facilities of such carriers; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) the construction, acquisition, operation, abandonment, or discontinuance of spur, industrial, team, switching, or side tracks, or facilities, even if the tracks are located, or intended to be located, entirely in one State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Mar. 31, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although the facts in the complaint are construed in favor of the plaintiffs, the Court has insufficient information to decide if, as a matter of law, Cryo-Trans owed a duty to Mr. Hale because the facts alleged do not permit the Court to determine the nature of the relationship. Instead, the complaint simply states as a general proposition that Cryo-Trans is the owner, operator or entity responsible for loading, packing, packaging, shipping or transporting Railcar CRYX 5017 and that Cryo-Trans completed one or more of those various tasks negligently.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Agard\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat. Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-10472,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204498906\">\n    2012 WL 4498906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Mass. Oct. 2, 2012) (making clear that \"[t]he mere use of the term 'negligent', without more, is insufficient to support a negligence claim\"). Because the loss of consortium claim brought by Mrs. Hale is dependent on Mr. Hale's negligence claim, that count will also be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Accordingly, Cryo-Trans's motion to dismiss will be allowed without prejudice to plaintiffs amending their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Pan Am\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Citing no law, Pan Am contends that it is not a proper party to this action because Pan Am is a parent holding company and is not a rail carrier providing any services cited by the Hales in the complaint. The Hales rejoin that the motion to dismiss is not the proper vehicle to resolve this issue and state that they will add a Pan Am subsidiary if discovery in the case reveals that a subsidiary is a more appropriate defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Pan Am negligently owned and operated Railcar CRYX 5017 and that, as a result of Pan Am's negligence, Mr. Hale sustained significant injuries. In considering a motion to dismiss, the Court must \"accept as true all well-pleaded facts ... and make all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor\".\n   <em>\n    Boroian\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050096\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/60/#p64\">\n    616 F.3d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64 (1st Cir. 2010). Unlike the conclusory allegations against Cryo-Trans, the Hales allege specific facts supporting their negligence claim against Pan Am, including that C &amp; S informed Pan Am about its concerns with the safety of Railcar CRYX 5017 due to its weight imbalance. The Hales also contend that the director of freight claims for Pan Am, Mark Ormond, rejected the return of the railcar and suggested that it be unloaded by fork lift or by hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs' complaint alleges a plausible entitlement to relief against Pan Am and the Court agrees that Pan Am's contention that it is not a proper party because it is simply a holding company and does not provide rail carrier services is premature and more appropriately reserved for a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, defendant Pan Am's motion to dismiss (Docket No. 18) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and defendant Cryo-Trans's motion to dismiss (Docket No. 20) is\n   <strong>\n    ALLOWED.\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs are permitted to file an amended complaint as to defendant Cryo-Trans, if at all, on or before Friday, April 20, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    So ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
