First is an informal motion by Evonik to find inequitable conduct. Second is Evonik's Motion to set aside the judgment of no willfulness, find Materia's pre-verdict infringement willful on summary judgment, and find Materia's post-verdict infringement willful on summary judgment. Third\n   is Evonik's Motion for enhanced damages pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20284\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   These motions come to the Court following a January 2017 jury trial on the issues of lack of enablement, lack of an adequate written description, willfulness of Materia's infringement, and damages. The jury found for Evonik on both invalidity counterclaims and awarded damages to Evonik for Materia's infringement of the '528 patent, but found for Materia on the issue of the willfulness of that infringement. Subsequently, on August 9, 2017, the Court found for Evonik on Materia's counterclaim of invalidity due to indefiniteness. The Court then entered Judgment on the jury's verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, all of Evonik's motions will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Inequitable Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the Court is Evonik's \"Opening Brief in Support of Inequitable Conduct.\" Although not filed as a formal motion, \"Evonik requests that the Court find the '590 patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.\" The Court, however, has already held that it lacks jurisdiction to rule on whether the '590 patent is enforceable because Materia has granted Evonik a broad covenant not to sue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Nonetheless, a finding that Materia engaged in inequitable conduct would support a conclusion that Materia's counterclaim against Evonik for infringement of the '590 patent-in which Evonik prevailed on the basis of noninfringement (hereafter \"the '590 infringement action\")-is an exceptional case under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20285\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Supplemental briefing was completed on August 9, 2017. For the reasons that follow, the Court finds Evonik has failed to prove Materia engaged in inequitable conduct during the prosecution of the '590 patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Evonik contends that Materia's inequitable conduct began during the USPTO interference proceedings (Nos. 105,373 and 105,374) between Professor Grubbs and Professor Nolan, and continued on through post-interference prosecution of the '590 patent. Evonik asserts four separate, but related, bases of inequitable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First, it is undisputed that Materia did not disclose the existence of Materia's '125 patent, and related information concerning the '125 patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Evonik contends the '125 patent is \"but-for prior art,\" which Materia disputes. More specifically, Evonik asserts Mark Trimmer\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"knew that the '125 patent covered what the '590 patent claimed, making the '125 patent invalidating prior art.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, Evonik asserts that Materia did not disclose Professor Nolan's alleged derivation of the subject matter of the '590 patent. Materia disputes derivation, and as will be discussed further below, the jury apparently rejected any finding of derivation when it rendered its verdict against Evonik and in favor of Materia on the issue of Materia's willfulness in infringing the '528 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Third, Evonik asserts that Materia failed to disclose the factual bases for a list of preliminary motions filed by Materia in the interferences, which challenged the patentability of the '590 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lastly, it is undisputed that the Grubbs v. Nolan interferences were settled. Evonik contends that the parties to the interferences \"settled with the intent to conceal from the USPTO Nolan's derivation, the Boulder Information, and the bases underlying Materia's preliminary motions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"To prevail on inequitable conduct, an accused infringer must show that the applicant: '(1) made an affirmative misrepresentation of material fact, failed to disclose material information, or submitted false material information, and (2) intended to deceive the [PTO].' \"\n   <em>\n    Leviton Mfg.

The supplemental briefing received from the parties confirms the Court's initial finding that courts are split on their interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   as it applies in this context. Based on the Court's review of\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds the appropriate burden of proof to apply in this case to be clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court's reading of\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   does not show an intention to change the burden of proof established in\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   . First,\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   is not cited or referenced in the\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   opinion. If it had been the Supreme Court's intention to\n   overrule that case, one would certainly expect mention of\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   . Further, the reasons behind the\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   Court determining a preponderance of the evidence standard applies to the exceptional case analysis do not translate into the inequitable conduct analysis. And the policy reasons behind the\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   court's decision still hold true even in light of the\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court compared \u00a7 285 with comparable fee-shifting statutes-a comparison that certainly has no connection with the burden of proof for inequitable conduct. The\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   Court also noted that \"nothing in \u00a7 285 justifies such a high standard of proof.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579874,12706997\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1749/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For proving inequitable conduct, however, the Federal Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   pointed out a multitude of \"far-reaching consequences\" that justified a higher standard of proof.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715257\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/1276/#p1290\">\n    649 F.3d at 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   Court noted that \"patent-infringement litigation has always been governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard,\" and referenced that this standard is generally applicable in civil cases to allow for both parties to equally share in the risk of error,\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579874,12706997\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1749/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1758 (citing\n   <em>\n    Huddleston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196891\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/375/#p390\">\n    459 U.S. at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196891\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/375/#p390\">\n    103 S.Ct. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), the inequitable conduct clear and convincing standard was an established exception to that generalization at the time\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   was decided and, again, the Federal Circuit explained the need for a departure from the preponderance of the evidence standard in\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   . Sharing equally in the risk of error, when there are such \"far-reaching\" consequences, justified to the\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   court that a clear and convincing evidence burden of proof was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that neither\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   's clear holding that an exceptional case is governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard, nor the reasoning behind that decision, evidence the Supreme Court's intent to change the burden of proof for showing inequitable conduct, nor does the reasoning support such a result. And without so much as a reference to\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   , the Court is convinced the Supreme Court did not intend to change the inequitable conduct burden of proof established in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This same position has been adopted by other district courts post-\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   . For instance, the Eastern District of Texas determined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The parties dispute what the correct burden of proof is as to Tyson's allegations of inequitable conduct. It is undisputed that proof of inequitable conduct requires \"clear and convincing evidence.\" Tyson, however, argues that it need only put forward a preponderance of the evidence per the standard in\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   ; it claims to use the label \"inequitable conduct\" merely as a shorthand. Since inequitable conduct is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a finding of exceptionality, the evidence supporting the allegation stands on its own. Thus, the Court will consider that evidence as part of the \"totality of the circumstances\" inquiry required by\n   <em>\n    Octane\n   </em>\n   , and the totality of the evidence (including both evidence of alleged inequitable conduct and other evidence) will be weighed using the preponderance of the evidence standard. If the evidence of inequitable conduct is sufficient to satisfy the clear and convincing standard, the proof of inequitable conduct will be entitled to substantial weight in that calculation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    DietGoal Innovations LLC v.

All of the facts supporting Evonik's argument in this regard were put\n   before the jury at trial. In finding against Evonik, and for Materia, on the issue of willful infringement of the '528 patent, the jury necessarily must not have found that Professor Nolan stole his idea from Professor Herrmann. The Court cannot, as a matter of law, make a finding of fact that directly conflicts with the jury's verdict in this regard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Door-Master Corp. v.

Moreover, to the extent that the other asserted bases are dependent in part on alleged derivation-namely, Evonik's assertion that the Grubbs v. Nolan interferences were settled to hide the fact of derivation, among other things; and the assertion that the alleged derivation was the underlying factual basis of at least two of Materia's listed preliminary motions-the Court does not consider those aspects of Evonik's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The remaining grounds for inequitable conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Evonik's first and third bases of inequitable conduct are based on nondisclosures which Evonik asserts were but-for material to the '590 patent prosecution. Evonik's theory concerning the fourth basis-settlement of the interference-is based not on deliberate withholding of material information, but rather what Evonik asserts is egregious misconduct aimed at preventing the need for ever disclosing but-for material information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As to all of these bases, however, Evonik must establish that Materia made a \"deliberate decision to deceive.\"\n   <em>\n    Transweb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085251\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1295/#p1303\">\n    812 F.3d at 1304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nonetheless,\n   <em>\n    Therasense\n   </em>\n   requires that the indirect and circumstantial evidence must add up to a singular inference of deceitful intent. The evidence fails in this critical regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Evonik asserts that there is clear evidence of deceptive intent in the actions and testimony of Trimmer and Materia's patent agent, Mark Warzel. According to Evonik, \"this is not a close case.\" But when the evidence itself is considered, it is much more equivocal than Evonik makes it out to be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court begins with Trimmer's Boulder Declaration executed on July 14, 2003. (PX-1152). The declaration explained to the Colorado district court how Professor Nolan and Materia were competitors, and why Professor Nolan, in his role as expert witness for Materia's adversary in the Boulder litigation, should not have access to Materia's confidential documents it had produced in the litigation. The declaration is eight pages long and consists of sixteen numbered paragraphs. The '125 patent is mentioned exactly once; and not in relation to Nolan's '590 patent application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Rather, Trimmer's Declaration points to Materia's '125 patent as an example of the overlap between Materia's technology in\n   the ROMP polymer area and a different patent application filed by Nolan which also \"describes and claims certain ... ROMP reactions.\" (\u00b6 10). In a separate paragraph, Trimmer states that \"a subset of the complexes covered by claim 1\" of Nolan's '590 patent application \"would infringe\" Materia's '121 and '139 patents without any mention of Materia's '125 patent. (\u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In an apparent attempt to bridge this gap, Evonik relies on the following general statements in Trimmer's declaration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 \"[a] review of Prof. Nolan's publications and patents reveals a great deal of overlap between Prof. Nolan's research and commercial activities and Materia's technology\" (Trimmer Decl. \u00b6 7); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 \"Prof. Nolan's articles also reveal substantial overlap between his work and Materia's technology\" (Id. \u00b6 12).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Based on these selected portions of Trimmer's Declaration, Evonik would have the Court draw the inference that \"Trimmer knew that the '125 patent covered what the '590 patent claimed, making the '125 patent invalidating prior art.\" The Court rejects that inference as without sufficient evidentiary support. The Court also rejects as unsupported by the evidence the related assertion that Trimmer later deliberately decided not to disclose the '125 patent as prior art during the '590 patent prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With regard to the failure to disclose the '125 patent and related information, Trimmer testified at his deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [Trimmer reading Materia's response to Interrogatory Number 29]: It says no one made a decision not to disclose the specific Boulder information identified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q: Okay. So it's not a question of someone just decided not to do it, it just never came up, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A: It just never came to mind, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (Trimmer 30(b)(6) Dep. p. 153;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   p. 275 \"[The '125 patent] did not come to my mind.\"; p. 274 \"Q: Why wasn't the '125 disclosed in connection with the '590? A: I don't know. I don't know.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Evonik invites the Court to discredit this testimony based on a very slim reed: twenty entries on Materia's privilege log. (PX-1309) The log demonstrates that Trimmer was included in approximately twenty e-mail communications in 2008 and 2009 concerning the '590 patent while the '590 patent was being prosecuted. Of course the content of those communications are unknown, and further, Trimmer was either the author or recipient of only eleven e-mails; the remainder he was merely copied on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nonetheless, Evonik reasons that since Trimmer had communications, and saw communications, concerning the '590 patent, there is no way the Boulder information and the '125 patent could not have come to Trimmer's mind, and therefore Trimmer must be lying. The Court disagrees. Evonik has pointed to no evidence contradicting Trimmer's testimony. There is no inherent inconsistency between Trimmer's testimony and the privilege log.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The evidence concerning Warzel's alleged deceptive intent is even weaker. Evonik's theory is that Warzel was \"willfully blind\" to the need to disclose to the Patent Office the factual bases for the list of Materia's preliminary motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Warzel became Materia's in-house patent agent shortly after the interferences were settled. He testified at his deposition\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   that when he took over the post-interferences prosecution of the '590 patent, he did not conduct \"a full and complete review of every document that might have been part of\" the interference file. (Warzel 3/13/14 Dep. p. 89-90) More specifically, he testified \"I did not know about the list of [preliminary] motions,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 115), which was drafted and filed prior to Warzel's employment with Materia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Based on this testimony, Evonik argues that Warzel \"shirk[ed] his duty [as a licensed practitioner] to investigate\" and \"fail[ed] in his duty to be fully informed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even assuming, for argument's sake, that Evonik is correct in this regard, it does not follow that \"[t]he consequence of these failures is that\n   <em>\n    deceptive intent may be inferred\n   </em>\n   ,\" as Evonik strenuously asserts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court declines to draw such an inference based solely on the fact that Warzel did not look for information related to interferences that had settled prior to Warzel's employment with Materia. The implicit assumption of Evonik's willful blindness argument is that Warzel had some reason to believe or suspect that Materia had engaged in inequitable conduct prior to Warzel's arrival at Materia. The evidence does not support such a factual finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court does not find that anyone acting on Materia's behalf intended to deceive the USPTO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Preventing the need for disclosing certain evidence in the first place is not analogous to actively taking steps to hide evidence that must be disclosed. The Court does not find Materia engaged in egregious misconduct when it settled the interferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court holds that Evonik has not established by clear and convincing evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Materia engaged in inequitable conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   That being said, the Court acknowledges that Evonik intends to move for attorneys' fees under \u00a7 285,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Evonik intends to advance additional bases for finding this case exceptional other than inequitable conduct, as explained (inappropriately) in its supplemental brief and at the hearing before this Court on inequitable conduct. In light of this finding that there is not clear and convincing evidence of inequitable conduct, the Court will still consider any motion for attorneys' fees on other bases, and the Court will give due consideration to the allegations that make up Evonik's inequitable conduct claim even in light of its finding that the clear and convincing evidence burden has not been established.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579874,12706997\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1749/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]n 'exceptional' case is simply one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party's litigating position ... or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.

Clearly Materia learned of the patent itself in June, but the point in time in which it realized that the patent rights were\n   <em>\n    adverse\n   </em>\n   is a different matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Willfulness necessarily involves knowledge of the patent\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   of infringement.
