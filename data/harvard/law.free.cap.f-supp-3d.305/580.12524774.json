Defendant's motion is granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Nitterhouse Concrete Products, Inc. (\"Nitterhouse\"), is a business entity with its principal place of business in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 1. Defendant Dobco is a business entity with its principal place of business in Wayne, New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. On December 26, 2012, the parties entered into a contact in connection with the construction of a parking garage on the campus of William Patterson University in Wayne, New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Defendant Dobco was the general contractor for the parking garage construction project, and hired Plaintiff Nitterhouse to fabricate \"pre-cast structural members\" for the construction of the garage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Dobco contracted to pay Nitterhouse $5,736,000.00 upon completion of their work on the parking garage, this amount was later reduced to $5,724,053.89.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Although Nitterhouse performed its obligations in completing the project, payment in the amount of $286,203.00 was still outstanding as of December 31, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Subcontract Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The subcontract contained provisions for alternative dispute resolution procedures. Section 6.1.2 of the subcontract contains a mediation provision, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties shall endeavor to resolve their claims by mediation which, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Construction Industry Mediation Procedures currently in effect. A request for mediation shall be made in writing, delivered to the other party to this Subcontract and filed with the American Arbitration Association unless the parties mutually agree in writing to substitute mediation administrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Standard Form of Agreement Between Contractor and Subcontractor (\"Subcontract\") \u00a7 6.1.2, ECF No. 1-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In addition to the mediation provision, the subcontract also contains a provision for binding dispute resolution. This provision, Section 6.2, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"history\" id=\"p-16\">\n   For any claim subject to, but not resolved by mediation pursuant to Section 6.1, at the sole option of [Dobco], it shall be resolved either by arbitration under the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and judgment may be entered on the basis of the award; or, if [Dobco] does not opt for arbitration, then such dispute shall be decided in the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey, and the venue of any such action shall be placed in Passaic County, New Jersey.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.2.1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Siddons Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   An individual named Donald Siddons was injured on the site of the parking garage construction project, and brought claims against both Nitterhouse and Dobco in the Superior Court of New Jersey. Def.'s Br. at 4, ECF No. 7-1. Dobco asserted cross-claims against Nitterhouse seeking indemnification under the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response, Nitterhouse claimed that Dobco was not entitled to indemnification because it was in breach of the contract due to the outstanding $286,203.00 at issue in this lawsuit. Pl.'s Opp. at 11, ECF No. 10. Nitterhouse also sought to bring an affirmative counterclaim against Dobco\n   seeking damages for breach of contract. The trial court allowed Nitterhouse to raise the breach of contract issue as a defense to indemnification, but refused to allow an affirmative damages claim for fear of confusing the issues before the jury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dobco has engaged in significant discovery in connection with the Siddons litigation, including participation in multiple depositions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. The outstanding $286,203.00 balance was raised at some of these depositions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff Nitterhouse brought suit in the District of New Jersey on November 9, 2016 alleging breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment and conversion. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 17, 2017, Defendant moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, to stay the action in the District and compel mediation and arbitration. Defendant argued that the suit should be dismissed pursuant to the forum selection clause, which provides that any litigation be venued in the Superior Court of New Jersey. In the alternative, Defendant argues that the action be stayed, and that the Court compel mediation and arbitration pursuant to the mediation and binding dispute resolution provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response, Plaintiff argues that the arbitration provision is unenforceable under New Jersey law because it failed to provide notice that Plaintiff was waiving its right to seek relief in a court of law or before a jury. Plaintiff further argues that Defendant waived the right to demand mediation and arbitration by its conduct in the Siddons litigation and in this dispute. Finally, Plaintiff argues that the forum selection clause does not apply, because it is limited to claims that the parties attempted and failed to resolve through mediation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because of the resolution of the motion to dismiss pursuant to the forum selection clause, this Court does not reach the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Third Circuit has held that a forum selection clause may be enforced under a 12(b)(6) standard.\n   <em>\n    Salovaara v.

Def.'s Reply at 14, ECF No. 11.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    It is clear from the text of the subcontract that the forum selection clause applies to Plaintiff's claims. The Subcontract provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    For any claim subject to, but not resolved by mediation pursuant to Section 6.1, at the sole option of [Dobco], it shall be resolved either by arbitration ... or, if [Dobco] does not opt for arbitration, then such disputes shall be decided in the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey, and venue of any such action shall be placed in Passaic County, New Jersey.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Subcontract \u00a7 6.2.1.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Defendant's ability to enforce the forum selection clause is unaffected by the failure to mediate the claims pursuant to section 6.1. The forum selection clause applies to claims that were \"subject to, but not resolved by mediation pursuant to Section 6.1.\" The claims here are \"subject to\" section 6.1 because they arise out of the Subcontract, but they were not \"resolved by\" the mediation procedures because neither party submitted a claim to the American Arbitration Association. The claims at issue fall within the literal terms of the forum selection clause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Further, it would contravene the clear intent of the parties to allow a party to evade the requirement to litigate in the selected forum by foregoing mediation of its claims and instead filing suit in a nonprescribed forum. The Subcontract countenances two means of binding dispute resolution; arbitration, or litigation in New Jersey Superior Court. Rather than avail itself of the clearly-established procedures set out in the Subcontract, Plaintiff instead brought suit in federal court, which for all practical purposes is the only forum that section 6.2 prohibits.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Defendant further argues that the forum selection clause is enforceable because it is mandatory and not permissive. Def.'s Br. at 5. Defendant contends that although the clause allows for either arbitration or litigation in Superior Court, it is still a mandatory forum selection clause because it \"mandates that litigation take place in one of two contemplated fora and thereby excludes all other fora.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"603014\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/277/378/#p405\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Union Steel Am.
