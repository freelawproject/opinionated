At the time of his sentencing, the applicable Guidelines range for Johnson was 262 to 327 months of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Johnson was sentenced in February 2003 to 322 months' incarceration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court imposed a sentence of 262 months on the heroin possession offense; 120 months' incarceration on the felon-in-possession offense, to run concurrently with the heroin count; and 60 months' incarceration for possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, to run consecutively to the other counts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court ordered Johnson's sentence to be followed by a period of six years' supervised release for the heroin possession, and three years' supervised release on the other counts, to run concurrently.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 9, 2017, Johnson filed a petition to modify his term of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. for Modification of an Imposed Term of Imprisonment Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) (\"Def.'s Mot.\") [ECF No. 38] at 1. He claims that he qualifies for a sentence reduction for Count One pursuant to the Sentencing Commission's Amendment 782, because he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 1-2. Amendment 782 reduces by two the base offense levels assigned to drug quantities in the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), which effectively lowers the Guidelines' minimum sentences for drug offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. supp. to app. C, amend 782. The Amendment became effective on November 1, 2014 and applies retroactively.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Johnson's claim, however, fails for two reasons. First, Johnson received a career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, because he was at least eighteen years of age at the time of this conviction, the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and he had at least two prior convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sentencing Tr. [ECF No. 33] at 5:12-:18. The base offense level on Count Three-possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment by one year or more, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) -was 24. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sentencing Tr. at 4:4-:8. Johnson then received a ten-level enhancement for Counts One and Three, which brought the adjusted offense level to 34.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sentencing Tr. at 5:12-:24. Because Johnson received the career offender enhancement, his base offense level, and therefore his sentencing guideline, was based on \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than on the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2D1.1. Amendment 782 therefore does not apply to him, because the amendment did not affect \u00a7 4B1.1.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Quintanilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264421\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/315/\">\n    868 F.3d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 320 &amp; n.8 (5th Cir. 2017) (collecting cases),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610801,12610802,12610803,12610804,12610805,12610806\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1283/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Second, even if the career offender enhancement did not apply to Johnson, Amendment 782 would not have changed the base offense level for his drug offense. The base offense level for Count One-possession\n   with intent to distribute heroin-was 12, the lowest base offense level involving heroin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Johnson was in possession of 2.4 grams of heroin, and, at that time, \u00a7 2D1.1 imposed a base offense level of 12 for 5 grams or less of heroin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3), (c)(14) (2002). Under the current version of the Guidelines, \u00a7 2D1.1 imposes a base offense level of 12 for 10 grams or less of heroin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(a)(5), (c)(14) (2017). Therefore, his base offense level for the drug offense in Count One remains unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Johnson's motion for a sentence reduction is therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    Count Two-using, carrying and possessing a firearm during a drug trafficking offense-carried a five-year mandatory minimum, which had to run consecutive to any other term of imprisonment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
