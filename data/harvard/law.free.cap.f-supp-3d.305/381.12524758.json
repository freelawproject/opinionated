Plaintiff's medical history\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1999, at the age of twenty-three, Plaintiff was diagnosed with depression and psychosis. (Am. Compl. 3.) On or around 2001, Plaintiff was prescribed the medications Risperdal and Wellbutrin by his then-psychiatrist to treat the symptoms of depression and psychosis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Within two years of taking these medications, Plaintiff developed gynecomastia, hypertension, and gained almost 100 pounds of weight. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 14, 2015, Plaintiff received test results indicating he had an enlarged liver and was in the early stages of fatty liver disease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's medical physician informed him that the medication he was being prescribed by his then-psychiatrist was known to cause liver damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff had never previously been informed of any potential side-effects of taking Risperdal and Wellbutrin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Development and marketing of Risperdal and Wellbutrin\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1994, the Janssen Defendants began manufacturing Risperdal for public use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Over the years, the Janssen Defendants\n   have agreed to settlements with state governments and the United States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") for improper promotion of off-label uses of Risperdal. (Pl. Opp'n to Defs. Mot. (\"Pl. Opp'n\") 3, 23-33, Docket Entry No. 43.) While Risperdal had only been FDA-approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and \"Bipolar I Disorder\" in adults, the Janssen Defendants promoted the product for \"unapproved uses, including dementia in elderly patients, schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder in children and adolescents, and depression ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.) The settlements focused on conduct that took place between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2005. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.) Individual Janssen Defendants Gorsky, Duato, and Heyman joined the company in 1988, 1989, and 2008, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   From January of 1999 to December of 2003, the GSK Defendants promoted Wellbutrin, \"approved at that time only for Major Depressive Disorder, for weight loss, the treatment of sexual dysfunction, substance addictions and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, among other off-label uses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) To promote these off-label uses, the GSK Defendants,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"paid millions of dollars to doctors to speak at and attend meetings, ... [and] sham advisory boards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result of these and other practices, GSK agreed to a settlement with the DOJ and various state governments because \"its labeling did not bear adequate directions for ... off-label uses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Individual GSK Defendants Witty and Hampton both served as executives of the company \"during the time Plaintiff was injured.\" (Am. Compl. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Rather than relying on allegations of general wrongdoing, Plaintiff must provide allegations specific to his own off-label use. The fact that the Janssen Defendants may have withheld information about the risks associated with other off-label uses of Risperdal does not lead to the inference that they did so with regards to every unapproved use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court dismisses all failure to warn claims against the GSK Defendants with prejudice.
