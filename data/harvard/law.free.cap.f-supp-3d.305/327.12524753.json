They seek one common determination: that defendants be ordered to permit transgender persons born in Puerto Rico to correct their birth certificates to accurately reflect their true sex, consistent with their gender identity, in accordance with the practice delineated in 24 L.P.R.A. section 1136\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and without adhering to the practice delineated in 24 L.P.R.A. section 1231 of using a strike-out line to change one's name, or otherwise including any information that would disclose a person's transgender status on the face of the birth certificate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint (d.e. 15), Prayer's Clause (C), p. 40. A Motion to Dismiss filed on June 12, 2017 by defendants Ricardo Rossello Nevares, in his official capacity as Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; Rafael Rodriguez Mercado, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Department of Health of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and Wanda LLovet Diaz, in her official capacity as Director of the Division of Demographic Registry and Vital Statistics of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (d.e. 22), was denied on August 29, 2017 (d.e. 35). Defendants have not filed an answer to the amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on June 26, 2017 (d.e. 26), accompanied by a Statement of Material Facts (d.e. 26-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Having considered the Motion for Summary Judgment, the declarations under penalty of perjury executed by the plaintiffs and other supporting materials, as well as defendants' opposition, the Court sets forth the following material facts that remain undisputed:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Findings of Fact\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Plaintiffs are three transgender individuals and an organization with transgender members that seek to have their Puerto Rico birth certificates\n   amended to accurately reflect their gender identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Ms. Daniela Arroyo's and Ms. Victoria Rodriguez's gender identity and expression is female.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3. Mr. J.G.'s gender identity and expression is male. His transgender status is not publicly known, nor known by his current employer or co-workers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   4. Ms. Arroyo and Ms. Rodriguez have aligned their body characteristics, appearance, and lived experience with their female gender identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   5. Mr. J.G. has aligned his body characteristics, appearance, and lived experience with his male gender identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   6. All three plaintiffs wish to correct the gender marker on their birth certificates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   7. Ms. Arroyo and Ms. Rodriguez wish to correct the gender markers on their birth certificates to accurately reflect the identity of each as a woman, as determined by their gender identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   8. Mr. J.G. wishes to correct the gender marker on his birth certificate to accurately reflect his identity as a man, as determined by his gender identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   9. Ms. Arroyo's and Ms. Rodriguez' birth certificates do not reflect their true identity, are incongruent with their female identity and expression, and conflict with their other identification documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   10. Mr. J.G.'s birth certificate does not reflect his true identity, is incongruent with his male identity and expression, and conflicts with his other identification documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   11. Ms. Rodr\u00edguez changed her name and corrected the gender marker on her driver's license, U.S. Passport, and Social Security records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   12. Mr. J.G. changed his name on his birth certificate and has also changed his name and corrected the gender marker on his driver's license and Social Security records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   13. An individual's birth certificate is a primary identification document. In Puerto Rico, it is needed to obtain a driver's license, a marriage license, a U.S. passport, a Social Security card, a voting card, and generally as proof of identification to conduct banking transactions and other business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   14. Pursuant to its Birth Certificate Policy, Puerto Rico categorically requires that birth certificates reflect the sex assigned at birth and prohibits transgender persons from correcting the gender marker in their birth certificates so that these accurately reflect the persons' sex, as determined by their gender identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   15. Birth certificates in Puerto Rico indicate a person's birth-assigned sex based on the appearance of genitalia rather than their actual sex, as determined by their gender identity and lived experience.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   16. Transgenderism is an immutable characteristic determined by the hormonal balance a person is born with. It is an innate trait caused by an individual's biological features and genetic makeup. Some scientists confirm that brain development is influenced by the prenatal environment, that is, to what hormones the fetus was exposed to in the uterus. For example, exposure to inadequate levels of estrogen during development of the fetus because of insufficient estrogen production in the fetus' immediate environment or poor receptive sensitivity in the fetus, are possible scenarios underlying insufficient feminization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   17. Ms. Rodriguez is 28 years old, born in Puerto Rico, and currently a resident of the District of Columbia metropolitan area. She is a graduate of the University of Puerto Rico and of the University of Maine School of Law. She is a transgender who was designated \"male\" in her birth certificate. She learned the term transgender at the age of 14. Ms. Rodriguez kept her gender secret until she was 18 and had started college for fear of rejection by her family. In 2007, by her sophomore year, she asked her professors and others to call her by her chosen name, Victoria. Calling her 'Victoria' during the roll call prevented disclosure of her transgender status to other students. She was diagnosed that same year by her medical provider with gender dysphoria and underwent hormone therapy to relieve the condition. In 2011, while at law school, she legally changed her name and gender marker on all her identification documents, except for her birth certificate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   18. Ms. Arroyo is 18 years old, a high school graduate, transgender, designated \"male\" in her birth certificate, who states she never questioned that she was a girl, so informed her family when she was a young girl, and told her mother that she was a transgender at the age 14. This led her to begin at that age to socially and medically transition to align her life experience and body characteristics with her gender identity. She began hormone therapy in 2016 after having been diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2013. Ms. Arroyo is cofounder of the Puerto Rico Trans Youth Coalition since 2015, an organization that provides a network for transgender youth in Puerto Rico with over 200 participants. In February 2017, she legally changed her name to her current female name. In March 2017, she began the process to correct her name and gender marker in her identification documents to accurately reflect her gender identity as female but has been prohibited from correcting the gender marker in her birth certificate because of Puerto Rico's Birth Certificate Policy, thereby rendering her birth certificate incongruent with her other identification papers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   19. Mr. J.G. is 25 years old, born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and designated as female on his birth certificate. He described his childhood as a solitary life. Since age four (4) he knew he was different from the children whose assigned sex at birth was female. This caused him profound discomfort and it was not until his young adulthood that Mr. J.G. was able to understand the cause of his distress: the clash between his perception of self and the sex characteristics of his body. In 2015, he commenced to medically transition to align his body characteristics and live his true self, as a man. That same year, having been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, he commenced hormone treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   20. The incongruence between a transgender person's gender identity and sex assigned at birth is associated with gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition recognized in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Ed. (2013)(\"DSM-V\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   21. Gender dysphoria refers to clinically significant distress that can result when a person's gender identity differs from the person's birth-assigned sex. If left untreated, gender dysphoria may result in psychological distress, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation or even self-inflicted harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   22. Identity documents that are consistent with one's lived experience affirm and consolidate one's gender identity, mitigating distress and functional consequences. Changes in gender presentation and role to feminize or masculinize appearance as well as social acceptance and legal legitimacy are crucial components of treatment for gender dysphoria. Social transition involves dressing, grooming, and otherwise outwardly presenting oneself through social signifiers of a person's true sex as determined by their affirmed gender identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   23. Not every person suffering from gender dysphoria undergoes the same treatment. From a medical and scientific perspective, there is no basis for refusing to acknowledge a transgender person's true sex based on whether that person has undergone surgery or any other medical treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   24. Ms. Arroyo was diagnosed with gender dysphoria by her medical provider in the year 2013. In 2016, in consultation with her medical and mental health professionals, she began to undergo medically-necessary treatment, specifically hormone therapy, to relieve her gender dysphoria and to bring her body into alignment with her gender identity. During this transition, she brought her external appearance into alignment with her female identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   25. Ms. Rodriguez was diagnosed with gender dysphoria by her medical provider in the year 2007. In consultation with her medical and mental health professionals, she began hormone therapy, to relieve her gender dysphoria and bring her body into alignment with her female identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   26. Mr. J.G. was diagnosed in 2015 with gender dysphoria. In consultation with his medical and mental health professionals, he began to undergo hormone therapy to relieve his gender dysphoria and bring his body in alignment with his gender identity. These steps brought his physical appearance into alignment with his male identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   27. Ms. Arroyo and Mr. J.G. corrected their names on their respective birth certificates but pursuant to Puerto Rico's birth certificate policy, were prohibited from correcting the gender marker on their birth certificates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   28. Ms. Rodriguez has not changed her name on her birth certificate since she deems it to be futile given the prohibition related to the correction of the gender marker in her certificate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   29. Ms. Arroyo asserts she feels stigmatized and harmed by Puerto Rico's birth certificate policy and claims her right to possess identity documents that accurately reflect who she is-a woman.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   30. Ms. Rodriguez states she considers it futile to correct the name on her birth certificate since it is impossible to obtain a correction of the gender marker on her birth certificate. As a consequence, her birth certificate, which identifies her with a male name and sex, and her other identification documents, drivers' license and U.S. passport, are incongruent with each other. She asserts the need for her identity documents to be consistent with the woman that she is.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   31. Mr. J.G. legally changed his name in 2016 to one traditionally associated with men. He updated his name and corrected the gender marker in his Puerto Rico driver's license in accordance with a policy followed by the Department of Transportation and Public Works of the Commonwealth. He also corrected his Social Security records and updated his name in his birth certificate. However, due to\n   Puerto Rico's Birth Certificate Policy, he was precluded from correcting the gender marker on his birth certificate. He attempted in April 2016 to correct the gender marker on his Puerto Rico voter identification card after the local Board of Registration staff requested his birth certificate. This was denied. As a result of this, Mr. J.G. did not vote in the 2016 election because the presentation of his voter identification card disclosed his transgender status.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   32. The forced disclosure of the transgender status of plaintiffs and other transgender persons by way of inaccurate birth certificates exposes them to prejudice, discrimination, distress, harassment, and violence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   33. On November 14, 2008, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \"Commonwealth\") issued Executive Order OE-2008-57 that established as a matter of public policy the prohibition of discrimination in the provision of public services. It applies to all public agencies and instrumentalities, including the Demographic Registry of Puerto Rico. Such sweeping outlawed discrimination in all forms, including gender identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   34. Pursuant to this public policy, on August 10, 2015, the Commonwealth issued Executive Order OE-2015-029, permitting transgender individuals to change their gender marker in their driver's license. On June 19, 2014, the Department of Transportation and Public Works issued regulations implementing the Executive Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   35. Pursuant to the aforementioned Executive Orders, on May 31, 2016, the Electoral Commission of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico issued Resolution CEE-RS-16-9, permitting transgender individuals to change the gender marker on their voter identification cards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   36. The Department of Transportation and Public Works and the Electoral Commission of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico both issue identification cards that reflect the applicant's correct gender marker in accordance with the public policy outlined in OE-2008-57, without disclosing the sex that was assigned at birth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Based on these Findings of Fact, the Court states the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusions of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Supreme Court recognizes that \"a constitutional right to privacy is now well established.\"\n   <em>\n    Daury v.
