No. 26) for summary judgment filed by defendants Jerry Foxhoven, in his official capacity as Director of the Iowa Department of Human Services, Richard Shults, in his official capacity as Administrator of the Division of Mental Health and Disability Services, Cory Turner, in his individual capacity and in his official capacity as Superintendent of the Civil Commitment Unit for Sexual Offenders (CCUSO), Brad Wittrock, in his individual capacity and in his official capacity as Deputy Superintendent of CCUSO, and Dan Pingel, in his individual capacity and in his official capacity as Treatment Program Supervisor at CCUSO. Plaintiff Michael Eric Mial (Mial) has filed a resistance (Doc. No. 29) and defendants have replied (Doc. No. 30). I find that oral argument is not necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D. Ia. L.R. 7(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mial commenced this action by filing a complaint (Doc. No. 2) on January 23, 2017. The complaint included several constitutional claims and claims under federal and Iowa law against various state employees. All of the claims relate to an allegation of unlawful discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs, allegedly culminating in the termination of Mial's employment at CCUSO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants responded with a pre-answer motion (Doc. No. 8) to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which I granted in part and denied in part.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 19. Counts VI and XI were dismissed in their entirety, as was Mial's request for declaratory relief. Certain other claims were dismissed in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants filed an answer (Doc. No. 20) on November 20, 2017, denying all remaining claims. Defendants then filed their motion for summary judgment on February 16, 2018. In his resistance, Mial states that he \"does not resist entry of summary judgment with respect to all claims other than his religious discrimination claims under Title VII and the Iowa Civil Rights Act (Counts VII and VIII of the Complaint).\" Doc. No. 29 at 1. Thus, Counts VII and VIII of the complaint set forth the only claims that remain for consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. RELEVANT FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the parties do not dispute the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mial applied for and was awarded the position of Psychiatric Security Specialist (PSS) at CCUSO. His first day of work was December 7, 2015. Doc. No. 26-3 at 44, 165. State employees, including Mial, are considered probationary for the first six months of employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 58. The PSS position involves working directly\n   with CCUSO patients,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as set out in the position description questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 165-69. Among other things, a PSS employee: \"[p]rovides care and treatment of patients by implementing program policies,\" \"[p]erforms essential security functions, such as conducting unit counts and security checks and maintaining order and discipline on the unit,\" \"[o]bserves and accurately documents information relating to each patient,\" \"[a]ttends treatment team meetings\" and \"[f]ollows written and supervisory directives, personnel policies, and departmental policies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 165-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After a probationary employee has worked for six months, CCUSO supervisors must decide whether to retain or discharge the employee. Factors considered in this decision include how the probationary employee engaged with patients and other employees, as well as the employee's ability to follow work rules, policies and supervisory directives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58. CCUSO employees are required to follow work rules, including those applicable to the use of employee email accounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58, 166.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mial sent 49 emails using his CCUSO email account between December 22, 2015, and April 27, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87-153. These emails discussed administrative matters (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 87, 89-90, 92-98, 104-05, 114-18, 142, 144), scheduling issues (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 88, 99-102, 106, 119-25, 127, 130-39, 143, 148-53), and personal matters (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 91, 126, 128). On two occasions, Mial used his CCUSO email account to forward incident reports about CCUSO patients to the next shift of employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 140, 145. Beginning March 5, 2016, Mial signed the majority of his emails sent through his CCUSO email account with the valediction \"In Christ.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120, 123-53. The two emails containing patient information also included the valediction \"In Christ.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 140, 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mial admits that he first used \"In Christ\" in his CCUSO email signature on March 5, 2016. Doc. No. 29-3 at 2 (\u00b6 12). He has not explained why he did not use that phrase before that date, or why he began doing so on that date.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. No. 26-3 at 209. Mial has stated, however, that he uses the \"In Christ\" valediction for the purpose of proclaiming his faith in all he does. Pastor Steve Britton of Cavalry Baptist Church in Estherville, Iowa, testified that while Mial is not a member of his church, he and his family have attended services at the church \"probably half a dozen times total.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. Pastor Britton testified that members of his church believe that they are to \"give out the gospel\" and that his church \"normally tr[ies] to train people to go out and knock on doors, give out gospel, give the gospel message.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35. When asked whether it would be necessary to use \"In Christ\" in a work email to proclaim one's faith, Pastor Britton responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A: It would be up to the boss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A: You know. It-whatever-whatever the company policy is. If they tell you not to do it, then you don't do it. You know, we're to-we're to obey the authorities over us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q: And that would include the employer?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. Pastor Britton also testified that there are \"several ways\" available for followers to proclaim their faith to others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mial's valediction came to the attention of his supervisors in April 2016. Turner emailed Wittrock regarding the use of the \"In Christ\" valediction on an email containing a patient incident report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 176. Turner testified that he made this decision because he thought the valediction \"could potentially be an issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65. Specifically, Turner thought that the valediction implicated issues of keeping church and state separate, and promoting one specific religion over another.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Turner testified that CCUSO policy directly addressed this issue, which he considered to be rules governing \"the use of e-mail in a professional fashion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 11, 2016, Wittrock asked Pingel, Mial's direct supervisor, to address Mial's valediction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On April 12, 2016, Wittrock sent an email memorandum to all staff at CCUSO stating: \"Email signatures need to contain business related information only and employees shall not include any personal messages.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177. While other staff stopped using non-business-related email signatures, Mial continued to use the \"In Christ\" valediction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84. On April 20, 2016, Pingel and Mial met to discuss Mial's non-compliance with the email signature rule. At this meeting, Mial requested to keep his email without any changes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82. Pingel testified that Mial did not explain in great detail why he wished to keep using the valediction, stating only that \"religion should be in every component of your life or something to that extent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82. Pingel's notes from that meeting state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   PSS Mial ... explain[ed] that his religious views were so important to him, that he cannot separate business from religious views ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   PSS Mial explained that he anticipated that supervisory staff would eventually speak with him about the \"In Christ\" signature line. Mial remarked \"fire me if you have to, I am not removing it.\" PSS Mial stated further that he has already discussed the potential ramifications of this decision with his wife, and he is willing to \"accept the consequences.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 179.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After the April 20, 2016, meeting, Turner and Wittrock consulted with Janelle Bertrand, a human resources employees from the Iowa Department of Administrative Services (DAS) as to how they should resolve Mial's failure to follow supervisory directives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-51, 177. On April 21, 2016, Wittrock sent a follow-up email to all staff repeating the directive to refrain from inserting personal messages in their email signatures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 178.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On April 28, 2016, Mial had a second meeting with Turner and Wittrock to discuss his non-compliance with the email signature rule. Mial secretly recorded the audio of this meeting on his cell phone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (the recording has been provided to the court on a DVD-R disc). During this meeting, Turner and Wittrock explained the purpose of the email policy (keeping personal lives and business separate), as well as the importance of CCUSO employees following supervisory directives. Recording at 1:00-1:48. Further, they explained their belief that all email at CCUSO was potentially subject to a discovery or an open records request. During this meeting, Mial explained that his use of the valediction was a result of his strong religious beliefs, as he used the valediction to proclaim his faith.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:19-2:32. Mial did not request or propose any accommodations and stated simply that he would continue to use the valediction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:12-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mial repeated his earlier statement that he understood that his position may cost him his job (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:25-30) and asked whether he needed to turn in his keys now (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:28-39). The parties appear to have left this meeting with the understanding that Mial would be discharged if he did not comply with the email signature rule and, in fact, Mial's employment ended that day. Doc. No. 26-3 at 180. Mial filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Iowa Civil Rights Commission (ICRC) approximately two weeks after he was fired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 183-84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mial testified that he essentially has not worked since he was discharged from CCUSO, barring a brief stint at Life Connections, a family counseling center in Marshalltown, Iowa. Doc. No. 26-3 at 6, 17, 22-27, 184-200. Mial testified that he was discharged from Life Connections because they refused to accommodate his request to use the same \"In Christ\" valediction in his email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. However, email communications between Mial and various employees at Life Connections indicate that the disagreement may have been more complicated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 184-200. Currently, Mial spends his time as a volunteer firefighter and attending online classes in furtherance of a Ph.D. in Emergency Management.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Mial still uses \"In Christ\" to sign emails for school or other purposes, but he does not use \"In Christ\" when he authors papers for school or on other forms that do not have a signature block.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV.

The two issues are not strictly tied together. Thus, the fact that a practice or belief may be connected to religion does not compel the conclusion that it is not a personal preference, or that it is in fact sincerely held.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tiano v.

However, the sincerity issue is less clear. As noted above, there is evidence in the record that the practice was merely a personal preference. For example, Mial began using the valediction during his third month of employment, he has not explained why he did not use it before that point, he does not use it in instances in which he signs his name and his pastor testified that the email valediction is not required. Further, there is some evidence that Mial began using the email valediction with the expectation that it would lead to discharge and, potentially, a lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Despite the fact that there is some evidence casting doubt on the issue of sincerity, I am unable to resolve this issue as a matter of law. Mial's testimony concerning his faith and his commitment to proclaiming Christ in everything he does is sufficient to raise a jury question as to whether his use of the valediction \"In Christ\" was sincerely connected to religion. As such, defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Notice\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment because Mial did not provide sufficient notice to trigger their duty to accommodate. Specifically, defendants state: \"Mr. Mial did assert that he wanted to continue to use the email sign off, but he never explained how it fit in with his religious practice. Mr. Mial did not explore alternatives or even request that alternatives be explored.\" Doc. No. 30 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The notice requirement is not particularly stringent, as it requires \"only enough information about an employee's religious needs to permit the employer to understand the existence of a conflict between the employee's religious practices and the employer's job requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Vetter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7845728\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/884/1287/#p1307\">\n    884 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1308 (citing\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516599\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/8/1433/#p1438\">\n    8 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1439 ). The undisputed evidence indicates that Mial informed CCUSO that his email valediction was connected to his religious beliefs. For example: (1) Pingel's notes from the April 20, 2016 meeting indicate that Mial stated his religious beliefs were so important to him that he could not separate them from business and (2) during the April 28 meeting with Turner and Wittrock, Mial stated that the email valediction was his way of proclaiming his faith in everything he does. As such, I am unable to conclude that Mial failed to provide sufficient notice as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.

As I wrote previously in this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Although the defendants' obligations under the Establishment Clause are relevant in determining whether accommodating Mial would result in hardship, a talismanic invocation of the Establishment Clause is not sufficient at this stage of the case to resolve the claim on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Also, while no written policies have been provided, deposition testimony suggests that CCUSO maintains relevant policies about professionalism in the workplace and work emails, as well as respecting coworkers' and patients' rights. However, there is scant evidence that Mial's use of \"In Christ\" at the end of work-related email messages (such as in various requests for shift changes or time off) would lead the public to assume CCUSO was endorsing a religion. Nor have defendants come forward with conclusive evidence that incident reports of the type Mial sent on April 9, 2016, and April 20, 2016, are frequently discoverable and are likely to be interpreted as CCUSO endorsing Christianity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Thus, defendants have not shown as a matter of law that the Establishment Clause prevented them from offering an accommodation. Nor have they demonstrated, as a matter of law, that Mial's email valediction caused any disruption in the workplace or violated any neutral, generally applicable rules or procedures. Of course, the jury could decide that Mial's use of the valediction violated neutral policies about professional conduct and following supervisory directives.

Doc. No. 19 at 23. Mial has not named his actual employer as a defendant but has sued Foxhoven and Shults in their official capacities. In seeking summary judgment as to Count VIII, defendants do not contend that naming Foxhoven and Shults in their official capacities is insufficient for purposes of a Title VII claim. As such, for purposes of the pending motion I will assume that Mial has directed his Title VII claim against the appropriate parties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Patients at CCUSO have completed a term of imprisonment following conviction for a violent sexual offense, but in a separate civil proceeding have been found likely to commit further violent sexual offenses.
