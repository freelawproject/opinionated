It makes no difference. To establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that he was (1) engaged in a protected activity; (2) subjected to an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse action.\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

His claim about the October 21, 2016 leave request must be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Mr. Rogers' claim about his 2016 fiscal year performance is similarly vague as to which statute(s) he claims to have been violated. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act all contain provisions prohibiting retaliation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012203\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ADA), 29 U.SC. \u00a7 791(f) (setting the standards to use for determining violations as the same as those for the ADA). Regardless, Mr. Rogers' failure to allege exhaustion of his administrative remedy for this claim is fatal under all flavors. Mr. Rogers has not alleged any facts to indicate that he has exhausted the administrative process; indeed, he does not allege that he has sought any administrative remedies at all.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-86. To the extent failure to exhaust is a procedural bar and may be excused under the equitable doctrines of waiver, estoppel, or tolling, Mr. Rogers has provided no reason to apply any of these doctrines, and I do not find that the circumstances here warrant equitable relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.
