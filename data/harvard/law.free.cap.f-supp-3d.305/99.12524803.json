According to the notice of termination, the Department decided to fire Sagar based on his conduct and performance. Sagar, however, sees it differently and alleges that he was the victim of age discrimination. He brings this action against the Department to challenge his termination, asserting three claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   He contends, first, that he was terminated because of his age; second, that the Department retaliated against him for engaging in ADEA protected activity; and, third, that he was subjected to a hostile work environment because of his age. The matter is now before the Court on the Department's motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 104. For the reasons that follow,\n   the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the Department's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 20, 2010, Sagar was hired by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") as an Information Technology Specialist at the GS-15 paygrade. Dkt. 101-20 at 3-4 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11); Dkt. 104-21 at 1 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 1). He was 62 years old at the time. Dkt. 104-21 at 1 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 1). Sagar was one of several Information Technology Specialists hired to help the IRS implement the Affordable Care Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 1). He was assigned to the Premium Tax Credit (\"PTC\") project, which was \"build[ing] the application that calculates [the] applicable tax credit for taxpayers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 2). Over the course of Sagar's tenure at the IRS, he had three managers. The first two are the alleged discriminating officials: Matthew Brady, the PTC Section Chief and Sagar's direct manager, and Peter Gianakos, the PTC Branch Chief and Sagar's second-level manager.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 3); Dkt. 64-6 at 6 (Interrogatory No. 11). The third, Sagar's third-level manager, was also the individual who hired him: Gregory Barry, the Director of Compliance and Document Matching, within the IRS's Affordable Care Act Program Management Office. Dkt. 104-21 at 1, 4 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Barry served as Sagar's direct manager until January or February 2011, when Gianakos became the Chief of the PTC Branch and thus Sagar's direct manager. Dkt. 100-25 at 5-7 (Interrogatory No. 18). In July 2011, Brady became the PTC Section Chief and replaced Gianakos as Sagar's direct manager.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Interrogatory No. 18). In March 2011, Sagar was \"named the requirements lead for the PTC project.\" Dkt. 101-20 at 7 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 27). His \"primary responsibility\" was to complete the Requirements Plan, Dkt. 104-21 at 2-3 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 6), which \"document[ed] the activities, methods, and techniques that w[ould] be used to perform and support Requirements Development ... and Requirements Management ... for the Premium Tax Credit ... Project,\" Dkt. 85-8 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the Department and one of Sagar's colleagues, Jonathan Lin, Sagar \"began to have negative encounters\" with Lin as early as February 2011. Dkt. 104-21 at 2 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 4). Although Lin did not immediately bring these encounters to the attention of management, he kept a running list of the episodes on his work computer. Dkt. 104-6 at 7 (Lin Dep. 42:12-44:19);\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Lin's notes). According to those notes, during the first incident, Sagar (who was not Lin's supervisor) \"lectured\" Lin \"in the break room,\" prompting Lin to email Sagar to ask that they \"treat each other with professional courtesies.\" Dkt. 104-6 at 22. During subsequent incidents, Sagar purportedly told Lin that he was \"not a team player\" and \"hung up\" the telephone on him; interrupted Lin at a meeting with harsh criticism implying that Lin had \"confuse[d]\" two distinct concepts; and, at another meeting, \"threw down his pencil and started to lecture\" Lin for having interrupted him, only to then himself interrupt another participant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Lin's notes report that, at a meeting on May 23, 2011, Sagar \"grabbed the [telephone] microphone while [Lin] was speaking and moved it directly in front of him\" and, then, \"after he finished [speaking], he threw it across the table [in Lin's] direction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the parties describe it, the \"microphone\" was an extension of a \"spider\" conference phone, which was typically passed among participants during conference calls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 104-6 at 16 (Lin Dep. 112:4-16); Dkt. 104-21 at 2 (Def.'s\n   SUMF \u00b6 4). Sagar, for his part, disagrees with Lin's account. He asserts that he \"treated Lin with respect and helped Lin,\" Dkt. 112-4 at 4 (Pl.'s Response to Def.'s SUMF); that Lin was \"uncooperative [and had an] antagonistic attitude,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and that Lin \"made up [some of the] events [and] distorted facts ... to get [an] outstanding [performance] rating,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties also disagree about the quality of Sagar's work as a Technology Specialist. According to Brady, when the template for the Requirements Plan was changed, the Plan \"needed to be updated to follow the new template,\" but Sagar failed to do so in a timely manner. Dkt. 104-8 at 4 (Brady Dep. 35:20-22). The Requirements Plan, in Brady's view, \"was not that complicated,\" and Sagar should have been able to update it more quickly and without assistance from others.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Brady Dep. 37:20-22). But, because Sagar did not do so, the Project Manager, Walter Kirkland, needed to ask Sagar \"numerous times\" when the Plan would be completed, and Kirkland eventually \"asked other team members, including Matthew Sikowitz, the only other GS-15 [Technology] Specialist in PTC[,] [to assist] in completing the ... Plan.\" Dkt. 104-21 at 2-3 (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8). Moreover, the Department adds, Sagar once \"called a meeting to discuss the ... Plan, but[,] because he was not prepared to go forward, [Brady was forced to] cancel[ ] the meeting.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 7). Sagar, again, paints a very different picture. He alleges that, even though \"[t]he project requirements were changing,\" he successfully completed the Requirements Plan in a timely fashion. Dkt. 101-20 at 7 (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 29);\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 30-32); Dkt. 101 at 27 (\"Sagar['s] three commitments ... were completed [on] time, [and his] performance exceeded [the relevant standards].\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[E]vidence ... show[s] that [Sagar] performed at an outstanding/exceptional level ....\"). He further asserts-albeit in arguably contradictory terms-that he did so without assistance from others. Dkt. 56-17 at 3 (\"With team input, the [Plan] was completed by me from start to finish.\"). As to the meeting that Brady claims to have adjourned prematurely, Sagar contends that the meeting was scheduled to last for \"one hour\" and that the meeting, in fact, \"lasted an hour.\" Oral Arg. Tr. (Rough at 12:12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In September 2011, Brady turned his attention to whether Sagar's employment with the Department should be terminated before the end of his probationary period. According to Brady, he was not only concerned about Sagar's performance, but had personally observed a number of \"ongoing behavioral issues\" involving \"antagonistic\" interactions with \"other team members.\" Dkt. 64-6 at 34;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    at 33-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Brady's narrative explanation, which was submitted to the Labor Relations Department, for why he recommended Sagar's dismissal). Brady noted, for example, that \"[w]hen someone wished to speak[,] [Sagar] would hold up his hand and instruct [the person] in a firm voice not to interrupt him and\" would admonish that person for \"being rude,\" and that, as a result, \"many of his team members [would] not speak while in a meeting with him due to intimidation and fear of being shut down.\" Dkt. 64-6 at 34. On other occasions, according to Brady, when \"confronted with\" a disagreement, Sagar would \"say angrily[,] 'I'll shut up now,' and [would then] stop talking and ... [would stop] provid[ing] input to the team.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Around this time, Brady asked other PTC staff whether they had had difficulties working with Sagar, and Lin showed Brady the notes that he had kept regarding Sagar's behavior. Dkt. 104-8 at 3 (Brady Dep. 33:14-19); Dkt. 104-6 at 7 (Lin Dep. 43:10-44:3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Toward the end of September, Brady completed Sagar's annual evaluation, which referred to these conduct issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Brady wrote, for example, that Sagar needed \"to work more cooperatively with peers to promote a team environment;\" that he \"should ... provide input even when there are disagreements with team members and [should] not shut down as [he has done] in meetings;\" and that his demeanor at meetings \"contribute[d] to a hostile environment.\" Dkt. 104-9 at 7. The evaluation also raised performance issues, noting that, \"[a]s a senior technical staff member, [Sagar] should be able to complete assigned tasks without the intervention of the manager and project manager[,] as was the case for completing the Requirements Plan,\" and that a \"meeting had to be shut[ ]down by the manager\" because Sagar's presentation \"was not ready to be reviewed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on these stated concerns, the review rated Sagar's performance as \"[m]inimally [s]atisfactory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 29, 2011, Brady met with Sagar to present the evaluation. Dkt. 104-1 at 3-4 (Brady Decl. \u00b6 7). Although the exact timeline is not crystal clear, at some point, Sagar \"informed\" Brady and Gianakos that the evaluation \"was not consistent and was not true.\" Dkt. 101-3 at 5. In addition, Sagar asserts that he met with Gianakos \"around October 3, 2011\" for \"a few minutes\" and told him that \"the review was incorrect, biased and vindictive,\" and that he met with Brady later that same afternoon, who said he would \"look into the review on receipt of [Sagar's] response.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Sagar sent his \"response\" to Brady on October 5, 2011.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Among other things, his response asserted that \"there seems to be some misunderstanding since I don't interrupt the thought processes of others that may be equally applicable or don't know the complete picture/context of the issue/discussion.\" Dkt. 56-17 at 2.

On October 27, 2011, Gianakos met with Sagar and gave him the option of either resigning or waiting to receive \"a written proposal/termination letter.\" Dkt. 41 at 23. When Sagar declined to resign, Gianakos sent Sagar a letter, dated October 27, 2011, notifying Sagar of his decision to terminate his employment with the IRS. Dkt. 104-4 at 2-4.

As the district court held in an ADEA case that Sagar brought against another former employer, \"[f]iring a protected employee a 'relatively short time' after hiring him creates a strong inference against age discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Sagar v.

He asserts that Gianakos once asked another employee, Matthew Sikowitz, about that employee's retirement plans, Dkt. 101 at 35, and that, when yet another employee, Walter Kirkland, referred to Andy Rooney's retirement from the television show \"60 Minutes,\" Gianakos said that he \"would have let [Rooney, who was 92 years old,] retire 10 years ago,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310439,4323943\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/658/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also reports that, when Gianakos was escorting Sagar from the building, Sagar asked Gianakos about Gianakos's \"injured knee,\" and Gianakos replied that \"he [may be] getting old.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35; Dkt. 101-3 at 12. None of this comes close to constituting direct evidence that Gianakos discriminated against Sagar because of his age or that Gianakos held any age-based animus toward anyone. Andy Rooney once remarked, \"It's paradoxical that the idea of living a long life appeals to everyone, but the idea of getting old doesn't appeal to anyone.\" That none of us like getting older (at least after a point); that we may blame our ailments on our age; and that Gianakos may have grown tired of Andy Rooney's brand of humor after more than three decades does not reflect a workplace bias against older employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, Sagar contends that comments made by various \"surrogate[s]\" of Brady and Gianakos show that Brady and Gianakos discriminated against Sagar because of his age.

Sagar concedes that he does not recall the meeting and that he would, at times, \"toss or thr[o]w the microphone [in] someone else's direction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573451\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/89/#p94\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Rough at 11:39-40). Lin, however, made notes regarding the incident. Dkt. 104-6 at 7 (Lin Dep. 42:12-44:19). Like the termination letter, those notes state that Sagar \"grabbed the microphone while [Lin] was speaking,\" \"moved it directly ... in front of him,\" and then \"threw it across the table\" in Lin's direction when done.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. There is no evidence suggesting that Lin, who was himself 59 years old, harbored any age-based animus toward Sagar. To be sure, Lin and Sagar may not have gotten along. But there is no evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find that Lin fabricated his notes for the purpose of sharing them with Brady months later, that Lin had developed a plan to induce Brady to fire Sagar, and that Lin was motivated by age-based animus. Moreover, even if the events did not occur precisely as Lin recorded, and as Brady repeated, \"the relevant factual issue\" is not \"whether the underlying ... incident occurred\" exactly as it was recounted in the termination letter, but whether the deciding officials-or those who may have influenced their decisions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noisette\n   </em>\n   , 211 F.Supp.3d at 94 -\"honestly and reasonably believed\" that it occurred as it was recounted.\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   490 (citing\n   <em>\n    George v.

Sagar, who was \"visibily upset,\" told the employee that \"gentlem[e]n should not interrupt other people while they speak,\" but then himself interrupted \"another team member\" during the same meeting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Lin recorded in his notes and testified at his deposition that he was the other employee in this interaction and that Sagar \"thr[e]w down his pencil,\" \"start[ed] lecturing [him on] how gentlemen should not interrupt other people while they speak,\" and later interrupted another employee. Dkt. 104-6 at 17 (Lin Dep. 114:16-115:2). In his opposition brief, Sagar argues that this rationale for his termination was also pretextual. He asserts, for example, that the story of what happened \"is all concocted,\" that Lin \"habitual[ly]\" interrupted Sagar, and \"[t]here was no need for [the] interruption in a sane technical discussion.\" Dkt. 101 at 38. He also asserts, moreover, that Lin \"concocted\" the story \"for pay to play\" purposes and that he \"was given [an] outstanding rating [as an] award.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. Once again, however, the basis for Sagar's conclusory assertions is unclear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   When asked to clarify at oral argument, Sagar conceded that he did not, in fact, recall whether he said anything to Lin about interrupting him while he was\n   speaking, although he explained that it was his general practice not to interrupt others. Oral Arg. Tr. (Rough at 11:41-42). Sagar's inability to recall the meeting in question means that the Department's factual account of this event, like the telephone incident, remains largely undisputed and that Sagar has failed to offer any evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find that the second stated reason for his termination was pretextual. The Department, in contrast, has produced sworn testimony indicating that the incident occurred. Sagar's own pleadings, moreover, confirm that he was frustrated by his interactions with Lin,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 101 at 38 (referring to Lin's interruptions as \"habitual,\" to Lin's \"antagonis[m],\" and to Lin's \"shallow technical capabilities\"), providing further support for the Department's conclusion that their working relationship had become toxic. But, in any event, the Court need not decide whether Lin's account of what happened is accurate or fair. All that matters for present purposes is whether Sagar has offered \"sufficient evidence to call into question\" whether the deciding officials-Brady, Gianakos, and Barry-\" 'honestly and reasonably believed' that that [misconduct] occurred,\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277864\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/1093/#p1099\">\n    849 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1100 n.2, and he has failed to offer any evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find that they doubted, or had reason to doubt, Lin's rendition of the relevant events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the Department raised performance concerns about Sagar's role as \"Requirements Manager for the PTC Project,\" and, in particular, asserted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   On August 12, 2011, you were assigned as Requirements Manager for the PTC Project and were responsible for producing the Requirement[s] Plan. The template for this project had been updated[,] but follow-up conversations were required to further explain your responsibility to revise the plan documentation. You still did not understand your role as Requirements Manager, even after several follow-up meetings regarding the same. As a result, it became necessary to assign several junior staff members to assist you with the [P]lan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Dkt. 104-4 at 3. Sagar first argues that the stated concern with his performance is false because he was assigned to serve as the Requirements Manager in February 2011 and not on August 12, 2011, as the termination letter suggests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277864\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/1093/#p1099\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Sagar was the [R]equirements [M]anager all along ....\"). That, however, is a quibble with a minor detail and not with the substance of the stated concern. All agree that Sagar received the assignment before August 12, 2011. As Brady explained at his deposition, the reference to August 12, 2011 in the letter was not intended to refer to the date he received the assignment but to when Sagar's performance on that assignment fell short.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 104-8 at 4 (Brady Dep. 35:9-17). Although inartfully phrased, there is no suggestion in the letter that the purported shortcomings in Sagar's performance had anything to do with the date he was originally assigned the role of Requirements Manager; to the contrary, if he had been assigned that role on August 12, 2011, there would have been little basis to criticize his performance during what would have been his first days in a new role. Sagar's first factual objection, accordingly, is based on a misreading of the letter and, more importantly, is immaterial to the substance of the Department's criticism of his performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberty Lobby\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 248,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

When the Court asked at\n   oral argument whether he disputes that those conversations occurred or merely disputes that they were \"required,\" Sagar conceded that the conversations occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. (Rough at 11:50-51). \"[T]hey were not required,\" in his view, however, and merely took place \"because [management] wanted the others to learn from [his] experience.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7846741\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/871/499/#p503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Rough at 11:50-51). But Sagar offers no evidence to support his speculation why his managers initiated the conversations. The Department, in contrast, has offered competent evidence that supports the letter's description of the relevant events.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 62-7 at 11 (Brady Dep. 38:1-18); Dkt. 104-7 at 8 (Sikowitz Dep. 113:4-8). To be sure, Sagar may sincerely believe that the meetings were not necessary, and he may even be right. But it is not the Court's role to put itself in the place of Sagar's managers and to decide what was necessary, or, indeed, to decide whether Sagar performed well-or not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the Court's role is limited to determining whether Sagar has produced evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find that the termination letter includes statements that the deciding officials believed to be false and that those statements were included as a pretext for discrimination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He has not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The same is true with respect to the next sentence of the termination letter. Sagar does not dispute that \"several follow-up meetings\" took place, but he disagrees with the assessment that he \"did not understand [his] role as Requirements Manager\" even after they occurred. Dkt. 104-4 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. (Rough at 11:51-53). As Sagar explained at oral argument, what he disputes is the premise that he did not know what he was doing. Oral Arg. Tr. (Rough at 11:52-53). In Sagar's words, \"No discussion was necessary[;] I knew my job.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Rough at 11:52). Subjective, personal assessments of that type, however, are insufficient to establish a triable issue of fact in a discrimination case. As the D.C.

Dkt. 104-4 at 3. Sagar disagrees, but that disagreement is, again, unsupported by any evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find that the assertion constitutes pretext for discrimination. Brady explained at his deposition that Sagar completed an earlier version of the Requirements Plan but that, subsequently, \"the template ... was updated [and the] [R]equirements [P]lan needed to be updated to follow the new template.\" Dkt. 104-8 at 4 (Brady Dep. 35:20-36:6). According to Brady, at that point, he asked Walter Kirkland and an outside contractor to assist in completing the Plan. Dkt. 62-7 at 10-11 (Brady Dep. 37:18-38:18). Brady's notes, which he shared with Labor Relations, also reflected that \"[s]everal junior staff [members] had to step in to assist [Sagar] in getting started and understanding the process.\" Dkt. 64-6 at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Matthew Sikowitz, another Technology Specialist, confirmed Brady's account. He testified that \"Sagar could not produce a final version [of the Requirements Plan] that was acceptable for signature,\" Dkt. 104-7 at 8 (Sikowitz Dep. 113:4-8); that \"Kirkland asked [Sikowitz] to help out on\n   getting the document finalized,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5878495\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/577/27/#p44\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Sikowitz Dep. 113:4-8); that Sagar \"sent [the draft] to [him] at Walter's request,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (Sikowitz Dep. 122:5-7); and that Sikowitz \"revised it,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (Sikowitz Dep. 122:5-7). Sikowitz explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [There] was a template ... and you had to fill in how the project was going to conduct the requirements gathering, what tools [were] going to be used, and how various things were going to be measured, like project scope and number ... of requirements and difficulty, and some of these things needed to be finalized. And Walter [Kirkland] asked me to step in and work on some of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (Sikowitz Dep. 113:12-20). Sikowitz further clarified that, for the \"Requirements [P]lan, [he] assisted [Sagar] ... before [Sagar] left\" and that he \"took over [the separate] requirements development after [Sagar] left.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (Sikowitz Dep. 116:15-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Sagar at times suggests that he-and he alone-performed all of the work on the final Requirements Plan, but he also concedes that others were involved. Thus, in his \"narrative response\" to his performance evaluation, Sagar wrote: \"\n   <em>\n    With team input\n   </em>\n   , the [Requirements Plan] was completed\n   <em>\n    by me\n   </em>\n   from start to finish.\" Dkt. 56-17 at 3 (emphasis added). More importantly for present purposes, he clarified at oral argument that much of his disagreement with the Department's assertion that others assisted on the Plan is not based on personal knowledge, and that which is based on personal knowledge is a matter of subjective characterization. He agreed, for example, that \"junior people were assigned or coming to the [R]equirement ... [P]lan meetings,\" but assumed that they attended only \"to learn\" or because they did not have other work to do. Oral Arg. Tr. (Rough at 11:53-59). He conceded, however, that he was not involved in assigning the junior staff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Rough at 11:59). More significantly, Sagar does not dispute that Kirkland-who, as a GS-14, was slightly junior to Sagar-was asked to edit the draft Requirements Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Rough at 11:53). He merely contends that Kirkland's assistance \"was not required because editing was done by a different unit under the ACA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Rough at 11:53). In other words, he does not dispute that Kirkland contributed to the Plan, but simply maintains that his assistance was unnecessary because others in the Department would have eventually edited his work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Understood in this light, the Court cannot conclude that Sagar has offered any evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find that the third set of events described in the termination letter constituted prextext for age discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4040322\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/928/174/#p180\">\n    928 F.Supp.2d at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , the Department relied on Brady's frustration with a meeting that Sagar scheduled-and invited the entire team to attend-regarding the Requirements Plan, but at which Sagar was \"not prepared to present and proceeded,\" instead, \"to make corrections\" to the Plan \"during the discussion.\" Dkt. 104-4 at 3. As a result, according to the termination letter, Brady\n   decided to \"adjourn the meeting\" and to ask \"others to step in [to] complete the document.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4040322\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/928/174/#p180\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To the extent that Sagar disputes Brady's assertion that others helped with the Plan, his challenge to that portion of the rationale fails for the reasons just discussed. As Sagar explained when asked about this at oral argument, he does not dispute that Kirkland edited his work; he merely contends that the edits were unnecessary. Oral Arg. Tr. (Rough at 11:53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Sagar also disputes that he made corrections to the Plan during the meeting, offering that he was actually only taking notes on his computer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4040322\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/928/174/#p180\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Rough at 12:07-08). Sagar's suggestion that Brady misunderstood what Sagar was doing-and incorrectly thought that he was making corrections to the Plan itself, rather than simply taking notes-however, does not constitute evidence of pretext or discriminatory intent. The relevant question, once again, is not whether the employer's proffered, nondiscriminatory reason for taking an adverse action is correct, but whether the \"employer honestly believe[d]\" that it was correct.\n   <em>\n    Fischbach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n    86 F.3d at 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That principle, moreover, also disposes of Sagar's contention that he was as prepared as he could have been for the meeting and that he only learned about changes to the template at the meeting; Sagar offers no evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find that Brady's assessment of Sagar's preparation was not merely mistaken, but dishonest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. (Rough at 12:05-07). Finally, Sagar contends that Brady did not adjourn the meeting and that it, in fact, lasted an hour.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Rough at 12:13). That contention is at best peripheral to the substance of Brady's criticism, which would stand regardless of whether Brady, in fact, adjourned the meeting early.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , the termination letter stressed that Brady met with Sagar \"to discuss both performance and conduct issues\" and that, \"[u]nfortunately, [Sagar] did not agree that there was any need for improvement.\" Dkt. 104-4 at 3. Sagar contends that this assertion was \"false,\" but, in the same breath, confirms that-to this day-he does not believe that his conduct or performance called for any improvement. Dkt. 101 at 41. As Sagar puts it, he \"did outstanding work in program leadership, employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction, business results, professional expertise,\" and timeliness.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The falsity that he posits, instead, is the assertion that Brady met with him \"to discuss both performance and conduct issues.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That statement was false, according to Sagar, because \"[t]he annual appraisal meeting was brief.\" Dkt. 101-3 at 8 (First Sagar Decl.). But Sagar himself submitted a declaration attesting that \"[a]round September 29, 2011 Brady prepared [the] ... evaluation\n   <em>\n    and discussed it\n   </em>\n   with\" Sagar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (First Sagar Decl.) (emphasis added). He also concedes that he responded, in writing, to the appraisal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 56-17 at 2-4, and a review of that document shows that Sagar failed to acknowledge the need to improve in any respect.

Indeed, by Sagar's own account, he merely asked Williams how to initiate a \"grievance and EEO complaint\" and was told that a probationary employee could not do so. The record does not show that he referred to his age or described the substance of his claim. But, giving Sagar the benefit of the doubt and assuming that such a general inquiry about how to initiate an EEO complaint constituted protected activity for purposes of the ADEA, Sagar still fails to offer any evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find that he was fired because he engaged in that protected activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280044,4274374\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/65/\">\n    791 F.3d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Most significantly, by October 18, 2011-the day on which Sagar was referred to Williams and asked her about \"the Agency Grievance System for Non-Bargaining Unit\" employees, Dkt. 104-13 at 2-Brady had already decided to move forward with Sagar's termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 104-8 at 3 (Brady Dep. 31:8-22) (Brady decided to fire Sagar \"after the evaluation meeting\" on September 29, 2011).

Brady and Gianakos testified under the penalty of perjury that they were not \"aware of any EEO activity until after [Sagar] was terminated.\" Dkt. 104-1 at 6 (Brady Decl. \u00b6 19); Dkt. 104-2 at 8 (Gianakos Decl. \u00b6 22).

Starting with Sagar's motion for summary judgment, he identifies the following acts that allegedly created a hostile work environment: (1) Sagar had to \"work under lower[-]grade [Premium Tax Credit] managers as well as vendor consultants,\" while Lin \"misbehaved\" and \"was pampered;\" (2) Sagar was \"not authorized to attend meetings at [the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") ], the agency that was framing the requirements,\" even though Lin was permitted to attend; (3) Sagar \"was left behind when others discussed requirements with users and vendor consultants;\" (4) Lin was \"encouraged to concoct two events listed in the termination letter [in exchange] for [receiving an] outstanding ranking, recommendation for a reward, and promotional consideration;\" (5) Sagar \"received threatening [telephone] calls from IRS officials\" beginning \"sometime in 2011;\" (6) Brady and Gianakos made \"false statements in [F]orm 11396 and delet[ed] [the] rating official's electronic signature[ ] from the ... official performance agreement;\" and (7) Sagar was denied a transfer to another project. Dkt. 101 at 47. Sagar's combined reply and opposition repeats some of these alleged acts of harassment and adds four more: (9) Kirkland contacted \"users\" directly without involving Sagar, the requirements manager; (10) Sagar was \"removed\" from a project and replaced by Lin; (11) Sagar \"was ignored\" while \"visiting [an] Austin processing center ... in favor of Brady and Kirkland;\" and (12) Lin complained about Sagar. Dkt. 112 at 39-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Sagar's hostile work environment claim fails for several reasons.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , \"[d]espite the sheer number of incidents of which [Sagar] complains,\" his claim \"contains at least one glaring defect: none of the allegations give rise to an inference of discrimination by [the Department] based on [his] age.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryant v.

Without some connection to his age, none of these incidents can support a claim of age-based harassment under the ADEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baloch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575311,5742599\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1191/\">\n    550 F.3d at 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ADEA claim requires evidence that the challenged action was taken \"because of the plaintiff's ... age\"). Not only has Sagar failed to proffer any evidence that he suffered these alleged indignities because of his age, much of his challenge centers on the contention that Lin-who was 59 years old at the time-was favored over him. He alleges that Lin was \"pampered,\" allowed to attend meetings at HHS, encouraged to say negative things about Sagar in exchange for favorable reviews and rewards, and was substituted for Sagar on a project. It is theoretically possible, to be sure, that an employer might discriminate on the basis of age in favor of a 59-year-old employee at the expense of a 63-year-old employee. But to\n   make out such a claim, the 63-year-old employee would need to identify\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   evidence supporting that unlikely scenario. Sagar has not done so. Indeed, Sagar himself attributes the complained-of events to other causes: \"poor and unconventional management,\" Dkt. 101 at 47, and Brady and Gianakos' allegedly inexplicable dislike of Sagar, Dkt. 112 at 41.

The second of these rationales mirrors the reason why Brady recommended Sagar's termination, and, for the reasons given above, Sagar has failed to offer any evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find that Brady's rationale was pretextual. Moreover, as discussed above, by the time Sagar expressed interest in the detail in October 2011, Brady had already decided to move forward with Sagar's termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 104-8 at 3 (Brady Dep. 31:8-22) (Brady decided to fire Sagar \"after the evaluation meeting\" on September 29, 2011).

Sagar responded by asserting in a brief that the calls \"started\n   sometime in 2011 while Sagar was still\" employed by the Department. Dkt. 56 at 36.

Moreover, with one exception, Sagar offers no evidence tying\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the calls he allegedly received to anyone who he alleges harbored any age-based animus against him or who played any role in his termination. To the contrary, like a common telephone scam,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 104-18, the messages that Sagar had transcribed merely directed that he return a call to someone from the \"tax litigation department ... as soon as possible\" to address a \"deficiency in [his] income tax\" and to avoid \"legal action,\" Dkt. 63-1 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Where Sagar does submit evidence purporting to tie certain calls to someone who allegedly played a role in his termination or harassment, the evidence fails to support his claim. He avers, in particular, that he received a call in December 2013 from a \"gentleman [who] gave his name as Jonathan Lin\"-the \"same name as the employee who [was] used by Front Line Managers\" to concoct false allegations of misconduct. Dkt. 101-2 at 3-4 (Fourth Sagar Decl. \u00b6 20). Unlike some of the other calls that Sagar relies upon, he does not offer a certified transcript of this message and relies, instead, on his own notes.

When Sagar returned the call, \"the gentleman\" purportedly indicated that \"[h]is name was Jonathan Lin\" and asserted that there was a \"criminal complaint against\" Sagar.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203537\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/57/#p67\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, Sagar \"[i]nquired about the nature of the complaint and whether [the caller] could call ... back to confirm that he was calling from a gov[ernment] phone.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203537\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/57/#p67\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The caller replied, \" '[I]f you don't want this call, just hang up and we w[ill] take legal action.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203537\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/57/#p67\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, as the Department notes, this call sounds much like the \"sophisticated phone scam targeting taxpayers\" about which the IRS warned the public in October 2013. Dkt. 104-18. But, even assuming-improbably-that the \"gentleman\" with whom Sagar spoke was the same Jonathan Lin who worked on the Premium Tax Credit project at the IRS, the call, while bizarre, would not support an ADEA hostile work environment claim for at least two reasons: first, by the time Sagar received these calls, he had not worked at the Department for over two years, and, second, there is no evidence that the call had anything to do with Sagar's age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As a result, even considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Sagar, a reasonable jury could not find in his favor on his claim for a hostile work environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mokhtar v.

Sagar advances a number of theories as to why the Department's investigation and termination were deficient. These theories suffer from legal or factual flaws. For instance, Sagar contends that Barry \"rel[ied] on hearsay\" in approving Sagar's termination. Dkt. 101 at 20-21. The hearsay rule, however, does not apply to an employer's personnel investigations. Sagar also asserts that persons known and unknown \"t[a]mpered\" with or \"falsely completed\" various forms.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (referring to Form 6771 and Form 12450-B);\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 47 (referring to Form 11396). But he has provided no evidence to substantiate these assertions. And, even putting these flaws aside, Sagar has failed to argue-or to present any evidence-that any such procedural defect \"gives rise to an inference of discrimination.\"\n    <em>\n     Kilby-Robb\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274575\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/182/#p193\">\n     246 F.Supp.3d at 199\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Although not at issue here, a plaintiff may also premise an ADEA retaliation claim on his participation in \"an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under\" the ADEA.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Sagar's contention that Lin concocted criticisms of Sagar at the behest of Brady and Gianakos in exchange for receiving an outstanding ranking, recommendation for a reward, and promotional consideration finds no support in the record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
