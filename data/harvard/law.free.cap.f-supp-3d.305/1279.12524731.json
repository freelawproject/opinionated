INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action. Relators Katie Brooks and Nannette Wride filed this case in January 2013 seeking relief under the False Claims Act. They allege that Defendants Stevens-Henager College, Inc.; California College San Diego, Inc.; CollegeAmerica Denver, Inc.; CollegeAmerica Arizona, Inc.; the Center for Excellence in Higher Education (\"CEHE\"); and Carl Barney (collectively, the \"Colleges\") submitted, or caused to be submitted, \"false or fraudulent\" claims for federal financial aid. In April 2014, the Government intervened with respect to certain allegations against two of the defendants: Stevens-Henager and its apparent successor in interest, CEHE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties engaged in extensive motion practice, and Relators amended their complaint three times. On March 30, 2016, the court issued a memorandum decision and order (the \"Prior Order\"). In it, the court limited Relators and the Government (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") to the legal theory that the Colleges knowingly made false statements, either express or implied, when entering into Program Participation Agreements with the Department of Education. Relators, the Government, and the Colleges have all asked the court to reconsider the Prior Order based on the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Universal Health Services, Inc. v.

Both promises were allegedly false when made because Stevens-Henager knew that it was violating and would continue to violate the ICB. GCI \u00b6 99.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the Prior Order, the court limited Plaintiffs to the legal theory that the Colleges knowingly made false statements, either express or implied, when entering into PPAs with the Department of Education. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on the now-discredited \"condition of participation versus condition of payment\" test, which was articulated by the Tenth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Conner v. Salina Regional Health Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825112\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/543/1211/\">\n    543 F.3d 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2008).

In it, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the \"condition of participation versus condition of payment\" test upon which this court had relied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Shortly after the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   , the parties requested that the court stay all deadlines while they attempted to mediate the case. The court did so. After about five months of unsuccessful mediation, the parties requested that the court lift the stay. The court lifted the stay on November 16, 2016, and on December 7, 2016, the Colleges filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that all claims under the False Claims Act should be dismissed in light of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On November 15, 2017, at a hearing on the Colleges' motion for reconsideration, the court raised concerns that it had impermissibly limited Plaintiffs' claims, in light of\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   . The court inquired of Plaintiffs why they had not sought reconsideration of the Prior Order. Plaintiffs stated that they believed that the Prior Order was erroneous in light of\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   , but offered various reasons as to why they had not sought reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The day after the hearing, Relators filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the court had impermissibly narrowed their claims in the Prior Order. Relators stated that they had been instructed by the Government, in January 2017, not to seek reconsideration. The Government followed suit shortly thereafter and filed a similar motion seeking reconsideration, explaining that it had not promptly sought reconsideration for strategic reasons. Both motions were fully briefed, and the court entertained oral argument on March 15, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The parties agree that\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   has effected an intervening change in the law, but they disagree on what it means for this case. The court agrees that\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   has effected an intervening change in the law and therefore concludes that reconsideration is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rose v.

The court therefore vacates the Prior Order as it relates to these\n   claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

That is, the court must determine whether Plaintiffs have stated claims for relief under the False Claims Act. A complaint must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ.

Specifically, the Government contends that the \"claim forms for Title IV funding in this case, accompanied by the certifications known as 'G5 certifications' ... are half-truths capable of misleading the Department [of Education].\" In each G5 certification, Stevens-Henager certified that \"the funds are being expended within three business days of receipt for the purpose and condition of the [PPA].\" GCI \u00b6 50.

In fact, the Government's complaint does not articulate this theory of liability. Instead, the Government relies exclusively on a theory of promissory fraud:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Stevens-Henager knowingly submitted or caused to be submitted, false representations regarding compliance with the requirements of Title IV ..., [in] its [PPA] and annual financial and compliance audits as well as in student loan and grant applications.

Stevens-Henager made express representations in writing ... [that]\n   <em>\n    induced\n   </em>\n   the Department of Education to make students at Stevens-Henager colleges eligible for many forms of financial aid.

Nowhere does the Government's complaint allege that Stevens-Henager's requests for Title IV funds were \"false or fraudulent\" because the requests impliedly certified that the school was eligible to receive Title IV funds when it was not. Indeed, the Government does not even explicitly reference the G5 certifications in its causes of action. In short, the Government attempts to argue a legal theory-implied false certification-which it does not allege in its complaint, and which it has not supported with factual allegations.

But, noticeably absent from the over 700 words comprising Relators' first claim for relief are any express references to G5 certifications.

The court, however, is not inclined to allow Relators to proceed on legal theories that are neither clearly articulated, nor factually supported, in their 162-page complaint. And if Relators' briefing truly does \"organize[ ] the complaint allegations\" in a manageable fashion, then they should have little difficulty amending their complaint to align with their briefing. Accordingly, Relators' complaint is dismissed without prejudice on the grounds that it does not comply with Rule 8(a)(2).

With respect to attendance taking and refund requirements, Relators' allegations appear to be limited to Stevens-Henager and CollegeAmerica Denver. Relators allege that faculty and administrative official at Stevens-Henager's Orem campus would alter attendance reports. Third Am. Compl. \u00b6 320.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Relators allege that a former CollegeAmerica employee explained that the school \" '\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   change the last day of attendance without [the student] even knowing it,' which could change student's financial aid eligibility as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 328 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relators, throughout their complaint, appear to have taken a shotgun approach, alleging a few examples of misconduct and then attempting to impute liability to the \"Defendant Schools.\" In most instances, this appears to be unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Perhaps the most egregious examples of Relators' attempt to treat the \"Defendant Schools\" as a collective entity are their claims against California College San Diego. Relators allege that California College San Diego made false statements regarding the 90/10 Rule, attendance taking and refund requirements, and accreditation standards. But, apart from conclusory statements, Relators allege no facts whatsoever suggesting that California College San Diego violated the 90/10 Rule, attendance taking and refund requirements, and accreditation standards. California College San Diego is referred to sparingly in sections of the complaint that discuss violations of the ICB,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 141, 480, but there are no examples whatsoever of California\n   College San Diego violating the 90/10 Rule, attendance taking and refund requirements, and accreditation standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Finally, the court is skeptical of Relators' suggestion that all of the management assertions submitted by the Colleges are actionable under a theory of promissory fraud. The Colleges, in required management assertions, annually certified that they were complying with various Title IV requirements, such as the ICB. Third Am. Compl. \u00b6 65. At oral argument, counsel for Relators clearly articulated, for the first time, Relators' view \"that the filing of every management certification rendered every claim for payment made subsequent to that management certification false.\" Hearing Tr. 38:18-39:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   This court is unaware of any case in which a court has applied promissory fraud, in the Title IV context, to anything other than PPAs. Promissory fraud, as articulated by Congress, attaches liability to \"every claim submitted under a contract\" when the contract \"was originally obtained by means of false statements.\" S. Rep. No. 99-345, at 9. Requests for Title IV funds are \"submitted under\" a school's PPA; the requests are not \"submitted under\" the school's required management assertions. In fact, according to Relators, the G5 certifications that accompany requests for Title IV funds state that \"the funds are being expended within three business days of receipt for the purpose and condition of the [PPA].\" (emphasis added). Thus, while the G5 certifications arguably acknowledge that the request for Title IV funds is being \"submitted under\" a PPA, they do not reference a school's management assertions in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Relators' approach would read the \"false or fraudulent claim\" requirement out of \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(B). Relators seek to impose liability on any person who \"knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a ... claim.\" But \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(B) requires that the false record or statement be material to a \"\n   <em>\n    false or fraudulent\n   </em>\n   claim.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A claim can be false based on promissory fraud, and a claim can be false because the claim falsely certifies compliance, either expressly or impliedly, with underlying legal requirements. But Relators simply urge that the court impose liability for any claims for payment submitted after the Colleges made any false statement, whether in a contract or otherwise. If Congress had intended this, the False Claims Act would not have attached liability only to those false statements material to a \"false or fraudulent claim.\" Consequently, the court is not inclined to apply a theory of promissory fraud to the required management assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Relators complaint is dismissed without prejudice on the grounds that it does not contain a short and plain statement of their claims showing that they are entitled to relief.

This delay, according to the Colleges, effected a waiver of Plaintiffs' rights to seek reconsideration and prejudices the Colleges because they may be forced to defend against claims that the court erroneously dismissed. The Colleges' arguments ring hollow. The court, during a hearing on the Colleges' motion for reconsideration, raised the issue of whether Plaintiffs also were entitled to reconsideration based on\n    <em>\n     Escobar\n    </em>\n    . In fact, the court was concerned that portions of the Prior Order, which the Colleges had not addressed, were erroneous in light of\n    <em>\n     Escobar\n    </em>\n    . But the court need not have provided Plaintiffs an opportunity to seek reconsideration. Instead, the court could, on its own accord, reconsider the Prior Order.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (\"[A]ny order, or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties ... may be revised at any time before the entry of judgment ....\"). Plaintiffs' motions for reconsideration merely gave the court the benefit of additional briefing on potential errors that the court could have corrected on its own. Thus, even if Plaintiffs somehow waived their right to seek reconsideration (they did not), the court would (and could) reconsider the Prior Order\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    The court does not reconsider the Prior Order as it relates to claims against the previously dismissed defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    The pre-2009 version of the False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who \"(1) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States Government or a member of the Armed Forces of the United States a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval; [or] (2) knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government ....\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n     31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1), (2) (1986). Plaintiffs have alleged violations of the pre- and post-2009 versions of the False Claims Act, but the 2009 amendments did not alter the essential elements for a violation of the False Claims Act as applied to the facts of this case. The 2009 amendments removed the requirement that a claim be presented \"to an officer or employee of the United States Government or a member of the Armed Forces of the United States\" and expanded liability to all false or fraudulent claims presented \"to an officer, employee, or agent of the United States; or ... to a contractor, grantee, or other recipient, if the money or property is to be spent or used on the Government's behalf or to advance a Government program or interest, and if the United States Government ... provides or has provided any portion of the money or property requested or demanded; or ... will reimburse such contractor, grantee, or other recipient for any portion of the money or property which is requested or demanded.\"\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 3729(a)(1) (1986)\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(A), (b)(2) (2009). In short, the 2009 amendment ensures that claims submitted to \"recipients of government funds to be spent on government objectives were subject to [False Claims Act] liability without the necessity of meeting a presentment to the government requirement or an intent to defraud the government requirement.\" John T. Boese,\n    <em>\n     Civil False Claims and\n    </em>\n    Qui Tam\n    <em>\n     Actions\n    </em>\n    , at 2-30 (4th Ed.). Here, all of the alleged claims were presented to an \"officer or employee of the United States Government,\" so the 2009 amendment does not alter the court's analysis. When Congress enacted the 2009 amendment, it indicated that the changes to \u00a7 3729(a)(2), which were codified at \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(B), \"shall take effect as if enacted on June 7, 2008, and apply to all\n    <em>\n     claims\n    </em>\n    under the False Claims Act ... that are pending on or after that date.\" Pub.

This court previously interpreted \"claim\" to mean \"cause of action,\" as opposed to claim for payment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sanders v. Allison Engine Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869300\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/930/#p942\">\n     703 F.3d 930\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 942 (6th Cir. 2012) (\"[W]e conclude that 'claim' in \u00a7 4(f)(1) refers to a civil action or case.\"). Because Relators' \"claims\" (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , causes of action) were filed after June 7, 2008, \u00a7 3729(a)(2) does not apply to the case at hand. For that reason, the court previously dismissed with prejudice Relators' fifth claim for relief, which relied on \u00a7 3729(a)(2). The court did not but should have also dismissed Relators' seventh claim for relief based on the same reasoning: the seventh claim for relief relies on \u00a7 3729(a)(2). Accordingly, the court now dismisses with prejudice Relators' seventh claim because it fails as a matter of law. For the reasons set forth in this footnote, the court determines that it can analyze the issues presented under the current version of the False Claims Act because there are no material differences between the pre- and post-2009 versions of the False Claims Act as applied to the facts of this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     United States v.

But the fact that the Department of Education has taken corrective action against other schools based on ICB violations would, if alleged, support the conclusion that Stevens-Henager's promises to comply with the ICB were material.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rose\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205076214\">\n     2016 WL 5076214\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6 (finding of materiality was supported based on the fact that the Department of Education \"took corrective actions against schools, issued fines, and entered into settlement agreements (which function like a fine or partial revocation of funds) totaling tens of millions of dollars\"). The Government, in its motion, states that \"post-PPA administrative actions are irrelevant to a claim for fraudulent inducement.\" The court disagrees. How the Department of Education reacted when it discovered ICB violations is relevant to the question of whether the Department of Education cared about Stevens-Henager's promises to comply with the ICB. Evidence that the Department of Education did not take action when it discovered ICB violations would tend to prove that the Department of Education did not care about a school's promise to comply with the ICB. On the other hand, evidence that the Department of Education took action against schools that violated the ICB would tend to prove that the Department of Education attached importance to a school's promises to comply with the ICB. Perhaps more probative, however, would be evidence that the Department of Education refused to enter into a PPA with a school when it knew that the school was not in compliance with the ICB. The Colleges have taken the position that the Government, to plausibly allege materiality, must allege specific examples of when the Department of Education refused to execute PPAs because it knew that a school was in violation of the ICB. The court disagrees that such an allegation is necessary in a complaint. Such a refusal, while relevant, is but one of a number of possible factors bearing on materiality in light of\n    <em>\n     Escobar,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n     136 S.Ct. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    2004 n.6 (stating that \"False Claims Act plaintiffs must plead their claims with plausibility and particularity under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 and 9(b) by, for instance, pleading facts to support allegations of materiality\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    It is possible the compensation plan invoked the safe harbors because the Colleges actually believed that the safe harbors applied.
