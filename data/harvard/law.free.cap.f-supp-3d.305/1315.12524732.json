FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Virginia College is a for-profit, post-secondary school headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama with over two dozen campuses in eleven states, including four in Alabama. Docs. 1 at 3; 24 at 2. Gilbert worked as an adjunct cosmetology instructor at the Birmingham campus from February 2013 to June 2014 and filed this lawsuit after she purportedly discovered that the College falsified certain reports in order to continue receiving Title IV funding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Docs. 1 at 3; 24 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Allegedly, to avoid a domino effect whereby the students who \"fail to make satisfactory academic progress\" lose their eligibility for Title IV funds and withdraw from school, \"negatively affect[ing] [the College's] student retention rate\" and\n   jeopardizing its accreditation, the College inflated its students' attendance records and grades. Doc. 1 at 7-8. As part of this alleged scheme, the director of the cosmetology program told Gilbert to \"mark students as present for an entire class even if they were late to class or left class early,\" a practice that resulted in the College purportedly giving credit to several students for classes that they missed and never made up.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The College also allegedly engaged in widespread grade manipulation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. For example, \"one student [who] failed 13 tests and had very poor attendance,\" \"nonetheless received a B in the class,\" despite Gilbert entering a failing grade for the student.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Gilbert also alleges that although she caught a student cheating, the president of the Birmingham campus instructed her \"to disregard the cheating and grade the student's assignment as if the student had not cheated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, Gilbert alleges that, in order to receive Pell Grants and Title IV funds, the College used these inflated grades and attendance records in its reports to its accreditation agency, the state licensing board, and the federal government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-16. She also alleges that, during a visit by one of the accreditation agency staff members, the director of the cosmetology program presented \"a binder that represented that the cosmetology department had conducted several field trips and other activities that had never actually occurred,\" as well as \"future activities that were never actually organized.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The College offers three arguments in support of its motion to dismiss these claims. For purposes of this opinion, the court focuses only on the first-i.e., that the public disclosure bar of \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A) requires dismissal and that Gilbert does not qualify for the provision's \"original source\" exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The False Claims Act was \"enacted in 1863 with the principal goal of 'stopping the massive frauds perpetrated by large [private] contractors during the Civil War.' \"\n   <em>\n    Vermont Agency of Nat.

Originally, the FCA required no firsthand knowledge of false claims, resulting in \"some enterprising individuals fil[ing] FCA actions based not on their own independent knowledge of a fraud but on information revealed in the government's criminal indictments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

In response, Congress created a jurisdictional bar to any FCA suit that was \"based upon evidence or information in the possession of the United States, or any agency, officer or employee thereof, at the time such suit was brought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20232\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C) (1946).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Congress again amended the FCA in 1986, realizing that barring any suit based on information that the government is aware of \"did not just eradicate the parasitic lawsuits,\" but in fact \"eliminated most FCA lawsuits, for courts strictly interpreted \u00a7 232(C) as barring FCA actions even when the government knew of the fraud only because the relator had reported it.\"\n   <em>\n    Majestic Blue Fisheries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p297\">\n    812 F.3d at 297-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The 1986 amendments \"replac[ed] the government knowledge defense with the less restrictive public disclosure bar,\" which \"precluded a relator from bringing an action that was based on allegations or transactions of fraud that had been publicly disclosed in certain enumerated sources, but included an exception where the relator was an 'original source' of the information underlying the action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p297\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (2006) ). The 1986 version read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (i) a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (ii) in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (iii) from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (2006). The 1986 version of the public disclosure bar was jurisdictional, so courts were obligated to dismiss a case when it applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Fla., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10508862\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/562/#p564\">\n    19 F.3d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 564 (11th Cir. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   But the 1986 version of the public disclosure bar proved too restrictive still. So, in 2010, Congress again amended the FCA, in part, to read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The court shall dismiss an action or claim under this section, unless opposed by the Government, if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (i) in a Federal criminal, civil, or administrative hearing in which the Government or its agent is a party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (ii) in a congressional, Government Accountability Office, or other Federal report, hearing, audit or investigation; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (iii) from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The 2010 amendment changed the nature of the public disclosure bar in several important ways. First, the bar is no longer jurisdictional, but rather an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Osheroff v. Humana, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890674\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/805/#p810\">\n    776 F.3d 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810 (11th Cir. 2015) (\"[T]he amended \u00a7 3730(e)(4) creates grounds for dismissal for failure to state a claim rather than for lack of jurisdiction.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, Congress limited the scope of allegations that will trigger the provision. Whereas the pre-2010 language included any claim \"based upon\" certain enumerated disclosures, the new language bars only complaints that contain \"substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (2006)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(A) (2012). Finally, Congress amended the enumerated categories of disclosure. Unlike the 1986 version, which included any allegations made public in \"a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing,\" the new set of enumerated disclosure categories is more restrictive, as it includes only information disclosed in \"a\n   <em>\n    Federal\n   </em>\n   criminal, civil, or administrative hearing\n   <em>\n    in which the Government or its agent is a party\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, while information obtained from a hearing in a state court may have barred an action under the old version of the rule, in the current version only federal proceedings qualify as public disclosures, and only if the \"Government or its agent\" is a \"party\" to the action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With this background in mind, the court turns now to the specific contentions in this case. The College argues that the public disclosure bar applies because (1) another plaintiff publicly disclosed \"substantially the same\" allegations in a previous\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   suit; (2) the \"Government or its agent\" was a party to that suit because, although the Government declined to intervene, the United States is always the \"real party in interest\" in\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   actions, and relators are \"agents\" of the Government; and (3) Gilbert does not qualify for the \"original source\" exception because her allegations do not \"materially add\" to the other complaint and she lacks \"independent\" knowledge of the wrongdoing. Doc. 24 at 3-5. The court addresses these arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether Gilbert's allegations are \"substantially the same\"?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The complaint that the College cites for the application of the public disclosure bar,\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel. Smith v. Virginia Coll.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:13-CV-00547 (M.D. Ala. July 31, 2013),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   was unsealed in mid 2014, well before Gilbert filed this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:13-CV-00547, doc. 11. To support its contention that Gilbert raises \"substantially the same\" allegations as those alleged in the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   complaint, the College cites the Eleventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Osheroff v. Humana Inc\n   </em>\n   . Doc. 24 at 3. Briefly, the relator in\n   <em>\n    Humana\n   </em>\n   claimed that insurers and health clinics receiving federal funds violated the FCA by offering services such as transportation, free meals, spa services, and entertainment, without regard for medical purpose or financial need.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890674\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/805/#p810\">\n    776 F.3d at 808-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant raised the public disclosure bar, citing news reports, newspaper advertisements, and the clinics' websites as sources of prior disclosure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890674\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/805/#p810\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890674\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/805/#p810\">\n    at 808-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court agreed, holding that the relator's post-2010 allegations were substantially the same as those publicly disclosed because of the \"significant overlap\" between them: the relator's \"essential allegation [was] that the clinics provided a\n   wealth of free services,\" and \"[t]he public sources fully disclose[d] that the defendant clinics provided such services, including transportation, meals, entertainment, and spa services, at no cost.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890674\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/805/#p810\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890674\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/805/#p810\">\n    at 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Other courts have provided additional guidance on the issue. For example, the First Circuit held that the substantial sameness test bars \"a complaint that targets a scheme previously revealed through public disclosures ... even if it offers greater detail about the underlying conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Winkelman v. CVS Caremark Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924187\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/201/#p210\">\n    827 F.3d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 210 (1st Cir. 2016). And the Seventh Circuit uses several factors to determine substantial sameness, asking whether the complaint 1) presents genuinely new and material information beyond what has been publicly disclosed; 2) alleges a different kind of deceit; 3) requires independent investigation and analysis to reveal any fraudulent behavior; 4) involves an entirely different time period than the publicly disclosed allegations; and 5) supplies vital facts not in the public domain.\n   <em>\n    Bellevue v.

In that respect, the Restatement of Agency defines agency as \"the fiduciary relationship that arises when one person (a 'principal') manifests assent to another person (an 'agent') that the agent shall act on the principal's behalf and subject to the principal's control, and the agent manifests assent or otherwise consents so to act.\" Restatement (Third) Of Agency \u00a7 1.01 (2006). The assent here is built in the statutory framework that recognizes that the Government is the real party in interest and that the relator is the assignee of the Government's damages claim. Indeed, even when the Government elects not to intervene, the Government still receives copies of all pleadings and deposition transcripts, can move to stay discovery if it interferes with an ongoing criminal or civil investigation, and has the right to approve or reject a stipulated dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3730(b)(1), (c)(2)(D)(3), (c)(4).

The need to incentivize whistleblower lawsuits is greatly reduced when the government already knows of, and has had an opportunity to investigate, the alleged violation. If Congress had intended to allow a relator who is not an original source to proceed with a lawsuit alleging substantially the same violations as a previous relator's complaint simply because the Government failed to intervene in the previous lawsuit, it would have said so. Accordingly, the court concludes that\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   relators are \"agents\" of the Government under the most reasonable reading of \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A)(i), and that the College has satisfied the second prong of the public disclosure bar by showing that the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   relator acted as an \"agent\" of the Government in that litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether Gilbert qualifies as an \"original source\" of the allegations?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Gilbert's suit may still survive if she can show she is an \"original source\" of the allegations. \"Original source\" is defined in the 2010 amendments as an individual who either:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (i) prior to a public disclosure under subsection (e)(4)(A), has voluntarily disclosed to the Government the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (ii) who has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions, and who has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B) (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This definition makes two important changes from prior versions. First, it adds a new category of original sources: individuals who disclosed the information to the government before public disclosure, regardless of their knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B) (2006)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4)(B) (2012). Second, it expands the scope of \"original source\" to include individuals with knowledge \"that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The previous definition of \"original source\" required \"direct and independent knowledge\" of the allegations, which created an \"extreme limit\" on any information that was obtained \"secondhand,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

But this argument misstates both the facts and the law. Gilbert's pleadings are clear that her knowledge is firsthand, as she alleges that her supervisors changed a failing grade she entered to a \"B,\" and directed her to mark absent students as having attended and to ignore an instance of academic dishonesty. Doc. 1 at 10, 12. Moreover, the FCA no longer requires an original source to have \"direct\" knowledge of the allegations, and, as such, the College relies on an obsolete legal standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 24 at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Saldivar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175689\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/927/#p936\">\n    841 F.3d at 936-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which applied the pre-2010 version of the public disclosure bar,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175689\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/927/#p936\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at n.1 ). Under the current law, knowledge \"that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions\" will suffice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(B) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Majestic Blue Fisheries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086900\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/294/#p297\">\n    812 F.3d at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The focus now is on what independent knowledge the relator has added to what was publicly disclosed.\"). Consequently, because Gilbert learned of the alleged misconduct through her employment, she has independent knowledge of the allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The College next argues that the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   lawsuit, \"while ultimately dismissed, asserted FCA violations by Virginia College for the very same reasons [Gilbert] alleges here\" and that Gilbert's allegations \"therefore do not 'materially add' to what has already been disclosed.\" Doc. 24 at 6. The Eleventh Circuit has had only a single opportunity to consider the \"materially adds to\" language in the new original source exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Humana Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890674\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/805/#p810\">\n    776 F.3d at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The relator in\n   <em>\n    Humana\n   </em>\n   argued that he was an \"original source\" because his complaint included more specific allegations than previous complaints, including \"the type of food the clinics served for lunch, the destinations of some of the free transportation, the frequency of salon services, and the price of substitute services or goods.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890674\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/805/#p810\">\n    776 F.3d at 815-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Allegedly, this information \"materially add[ed]\" to the existing disclosures because it showed that the services offered \"were more than nominal in value.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890674\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/805/#p810\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The circuit disagreed, holding that, although the complaint \"add[ed] background information and details relating to the value of the services offered, making it somewhat more plain\" that the clinics were violating the law, it did not \"materially add\" to the publicly disclosed allegations because \"any remuneration or offer of remuneration is illegal,\" including nominal ones.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890674\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/805/#p810\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Here, while Gilbert's complaint certainly provides previously undisclosed \"background information and details\" about the College's alleged scheme, it does not allege any new or distinct violations. All of Gilbert's allegations-grade inflation, attendance inflation, and falsifying reports to accreditation agencies-are included in the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

In that respect, though Gilbert's alleged knowledge of the wrongdoing is \"independent of\" the allegations in the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   complaint, her allegations do not \"materially add\" to those in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , and she is not an \"original source\" under \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the public disclosure bar requires dismissal because \"substantially the same allegations ... were publicly disclosed ... in a Federal ... hearing in which the Government or its agent is a party,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3730(e)(4)(A),\n   and because Gilbert does not fall within the \"original source\" exception. Therefore, as to Counts I and II, Virginia College's Motion to Dismiss, doc. 24, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . The motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , however, with respect to the retaliation claims (Counts III and IV). For the reasons stated in open court, Gilbert has adequately pleaded that she engaged in protected activity-i.e., as to her \u00a7 3730(h) claim (Count III) that she confronted administrators regarding their falsification of attendance records, and as to her Title VII claim (Count IV) that she complained about alleged sexual harassment-and that the College purportedly retaliated against her as a result by denying her severance benefits and a letter of recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 1 at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   the 29th day of March, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    As part of an effort to expand opportunities to more students, the federal government provides financial assistance under Title IV of the Higher Education Act to \"institutions of higher learning,\" provided that they meet certain conditions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201070\">\n     20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1070\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Gilbert also alleges that the College violated the FCA by providing \"incentive compensation\" to its recruiters. However, this allegation consists merely of a barebones, conclusory statement that, at some point before she began working at the College, a recruiter received compensation based on the number of students he enrolled. Doc. 1 at 13. Because Gilbert does not explain with any \"particularity\" the circumstances of the alleged compensation scheme, or how she knows that the recruiter in question received such compensation, the court holds that Gilbert's incentive compensation claim lacks the \"indicia of reliability\" necessary to satisfy Rule 9(b).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Corsello v.
