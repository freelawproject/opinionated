BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 1995,\n   <em>\n    The Washington Post\n   </em>\n   printed a manifesto written by a domestic terrorist who came to be known as the Unabomber. The day after publication, Plaintiff James Lutcher Negley walked into a library at California State University (Chico) and-in a fateful request-offered the librarian twenty dollars to leave a copy of the article at his hotel. Apparently unnerved by the interaction, the librarian called the UNABOM Hot Line and reported Negley's request. The FBI then interviewed Plaintiff and conducted a brief investigation before quickly clearing him of any involvement with the Unabomber. As far as the Bureau was concerned, all inquiries related to Negley ended there. Wishful thinking indeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For Plaintiff, those interviews have prompted more than two decades of litigation under the Freedom of Information Act, as he has tried to ascertain the scope of the FBI's interest in him. Over the years, the Bureau has released 163 documents related to its investigation of Negley, as well as thousands of pages related to his FOIA requests (and the subsequent litigation). This latest suit, however, concerns a single handwritten notation on one released document, a cover sheet for a fax sent in 2002. That notation referred, opaquely, to a file with \"500,000 pp\" and \"42,000\" of \"misc. evidence,\" which Plaintiff assumes indicates that there are at least 500,000 more responsive pages related to his case. On April 7, 2014, he submitted a FOIA request seeking a copy of the file with said 500,000 documents. The FBI, in turn, reported that the relevant file did not concern him, but related more broadly to the UNABOM investigation as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Still skeptical, Plaintiff brought suit in this Court, arguing principally that Defendant Department of Justice had failed to conduct an adequate search for the specified file. The agency now moves for summary judgment, affirming that it has, in fact, located the \"500,000 pp\" file and that it contains no new information related to Negley. Agreeing, the Court will grant the Government's Motion, thereby putting a\n   <em>\n    coda\n   </em>\n   on this decades-long saga.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To understand the agency's search efforts (and the mysterious 2002 fax notation\n   at issue), the Court must begin with a deep dive into Negley's previous three FOIA requests and the rather serpentine litigation that followed. In so summarizing, the Court draws from seven previous judicial decisions related to Negley, before turning to Plaintiff's latest FOIA request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    October 7, 1999, Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 7, 1999, Negley submitted his first FOIA request, seeking all records concerning him maintained at the FBI's field office in Sacramento, California (whose jurisdiction includes the Chico State library).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Negley v. DOJ (Negley I)\n   </em>\n   , No. 01-57 (W.D. Tex. 2002), ECF No. 26 (Report &amp; Recommendation). After some prodding, the agency located 51 pages of responsive material, ultimately releasing 50 in whole or in part.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3. Those documents included investigative reports from the CSU police along with notes from Plaintiff's interviews with detectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2001, Negley filed suit in the Western District of Texas, challenging (1) whether the FBI was withholding additional records; and (2) whether withholding one page (along with various redactions to the released pages) fell within applicable FOIA exemptions.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 3. In a 2002 declaration, Special Agent and Chief Division Counsel Brian Callihan outlined that the FBI had retrieved three relevant files:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    File 149A-SF-106204 (the San Francisco File)\n   </strong>\n   -The file was maintained by the San Francisco field division. Agent Callihan reported that \"\n   <em>\n    this file contains approximately 500,000 pages of material and approximately 42,000 pages of additional material including evidence\n   </em>\n   .\" \"While there is some information referencing Mr. Negley in this file, the complete file does not pertain to him.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    File 149A-SC-C27507\n   </strong>\n   -The file was \"opened within the Sacramento Field Office in order to contain information pertaining to possible 'Unabomb' suspects\" in the office's territory. It \"contains information on a large number of other individuals,\" only a \"small portion\" of which pertained to Negley.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    190-SC-33911\n   </strong>\n   -An internal administrative file regarding FOIA requests, which included correspondence between the FBI and Negley\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 55-15 (Declaration of Denise Swain), Exh. A (Callihan Declaration), \u00b6\u00b6 7-9 (emphasis added). A magistrate judge found that search sufficient and determined that of the pages released, the FBI had appropriately deleted \"only names, addresses, phone numbers, and other such identifying information\" pursuant to Exemption 7(C).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 10-11. The judge also reviewed\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   the one page withheld in full, which related to the FBI's \"private\" conversation with the library employee, and found the withholding proper under Exemption 7(D).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 10. The district court adopted that Report &amp; Recommendation in full, granting summary judgment for the Bureau.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. 01-57, ECF No. 29 (Judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    January 16, 2002, Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 16, 2002, Negley filed another FOIA request, this time seeking any records maintained at the San Francisco Field Office and, more specifically, found within the aforementioned File 149A-SF-106204.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Negley v.

By letter dated May 30, 2014, it responded that the \"2002 hand-written notation does not indicate or cite to any specific FBI file.\" ECF No. 55-2 (First Declaration of David Hardy), Exh. B. Because FOIA only provides access to records \"reasonably described,\" the agency asked for more specific information about the files sought.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=589%20Fed.%20Appx.%20726\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(a)(3)(A) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After receiving a follow-up letter from Plaintiff, however, the Department apparently \"reexamined [his] request in light of ongoing and prior litigation pertaining to Mr. Negley.\" First Hardy Decl., Exh.

To wit, a paralegal in the USAO of the Western District of Texas pulled the original file for\n   <em>\n    Negley I\n   </em>\n   to see if she could locate the January 22, 2002, fax.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Swain Decl., \u00b6 12. While looking at the pleadings in that case, she uncovered the aforementioned declaration from Division Counsel Brian Callihan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=589%20Fed.%20Appx.%20726\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the savvy reader might remember, that declaration described the SF-106204 file (later at issue in\n   <em>\n    Negley II\n   </em>\n   ) and indicated it \"contain[ed] approximately 500,000 pages of material and approximately 42,000 pages of additional material including evidence.\" Callihan Decl., \u00b6 7. The Declaration was signed on January 23, 2002, only one day after AUSA David Castillo sent the fax to Callihan about the same litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Swain Decl., \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Connecting the dots, the Government realized that the handwritten notation must be referring to the whole SF-106204 file. The agency thus responded on August 12, 2014, informing Negley that \"the marginal notation refers to the massive UNABOM file in its entirety.\" First Hardy Decl., Exh. D. It further explained: \"[T]he handwritten notation ... references the same information the FBI provided in a prior declaration in [\n   <em>\n    Negley I\n   </em>\n   ].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Given that background, it asked Negley to clarify whether it was \"seeking the entire UNABOM file, or a portion thereof,\" warning that until he did so, no further action would be taken on his request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff sent another letter, expressing disbelief that the \"500,000 pp.\" notation referred to the entire UNABOM file.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Hardy Decl., Exh.

The FBI then closed the request. On administrative appeal, Plaintiff once again claimed that the FBI had \"not proferr[ed] the explanation as to the source of the notation.\" First Hardy Decl., Exh.

At the time that fax was sent, Negley and the agency were engaged in their first round of litigation, and \"t[h]e fax cover sheet was created for the purpose of transmitting a draft of the declaration between the CDC [Agent Callihan] and [AUSA] handling that litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 63-1 (Second Declaration of David Hardy), \u00b6 5. To refresh, Callihan's final declaration included the following description of File SF-106204:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [T]his file contains approximately 500,000 pages of material including approximately 42,000 pages of additional material including evidence. As noted above, the file is maintained by the San Francisco division and remains an open or pending file.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Callihan Decl., \u00b6 7. The fax notation, not coincidentally, concerns each of those talking points: 1) the case is still pending; 2) there are 500,000 pages in the file; and 3) there are 42,000 pages of \"misc. evidence.\" Here is the notation itself:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It requires little sleuthing to put the pieces together. On January 22, 2002, AUSA Castillo sent a draft of a declaration to CDC Callihan, and then either he or Callihan added a handwritten notation about the San Francisco File. One day later, Callihan filed his declaration with the same information. The Court therefore credits the Government's claim that it has found the requested file: The \"file referenced\" in the 2002 fax notation is none other than the San Francisco File.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff argues otherwise, insisting the Government has found the wrong file and that there may still be \"another massive file on Mr. Negley.\" ECF No. 65 (Pl. Response) at 1. Notably, however, he focuses the bulk of his fire not on the Department's\n   <em>\n    search\n   </em>\n   for the file but rather on its description of the file's\n   <em>\n    contents\n   </em>\n   . To wit, Negley balks at the agency's assurance that the SF-106204 file is the \"massive UNABOM file in its entirety.\" He wonders how a 17-year investigation, spanning the country, could produce just one file with 500,000 pages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court is sympathetic to his skepticism, as it, too, doubts that the SF-106204 file represents the universe of UNABOM materials. At multiple hearings, it has pressed the Government to provide a more precise description of the UNABOM file, yet each time its counsel has maintained that the SF-106204 file is, in fact, the \"entire\" UNABOM file. In a follow-up declaration, the agency refined that stance somewhat. It there explained that nearly all of its 56 Field Divisions were involved in the 17-year UNABOM investigation, \"and in 1993, a UNABOM Task Force (UTF) was set up in San Francisco to give overall direction to the investigation.\" Second Hardy Decl., \u00b6 4. This task force investigated more than 2,400 suspects and apparently put together a file that the FBI refers to as \"the UNABOM file.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3479440,3479962,10532205,10532302\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/897/540/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At the time the AUSA sent his fax in 2002, he apparently estimated that the file contained 500,000 pages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5. Now, after querying its record inventory system-a system not in existence at the time of the Callihan Declaration-the FBI suspects it contains roughly 1.4 million pages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Second Hardy Declaration, while shedding a bit more light on the San Francisco File, still seems a bit imprecise. While the serial 149A-SF-106204 appears to refer to the entire \"\n   <em>\n    main\n   </em>\n   \" UNABOM file,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Negley v.

The same Callihan Declaration, for instance, noted that the Sacramento Field Office maintained a separate file for suspects within its jurisdiction. But while this discrepancy is unfortunate-and surely adds fuel to Plaintiff's longstanding suspicion that the FBI is hiding the ball-it is ultimately irrelevant to the legal issues before the Court. The only question the Court must ask is whether, pursuant to Negley's Fourth FOIA Request, the FBI has properly identified the \"file referenced\" in \"a facsimile cover sheet sent ... on January 22, 2002.\" Compl., Exh C. On review, it is obvious that the agency has found the elephant Negley has been hunting, and the agency's inconsistencies in describing that file's contents do not cast doubt on that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Negley also takes issue with the \"heavy redactions that are directly above the line noting that 500,000 pages are in evidence.\" Pl.

He believes that removing such redactions \"would assist [him] in determining whether the DOJ's information is sensible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=169%20Fed.%20Appx.%20591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Yet the agency has sworn in an affidavit that it \"was able to locate the un-redacted version of the document\" and \"no specific FBI file was located beneath the block.\" First Hardy Decl., \u00b6 9.

When pressed by the Court, he answered no, arguing that even were he \"to take the government at its word and elect to receive 500,000 (or 1.4 million) pages of the UNABOM file,\" the FBI's interim release policy would make such efforts impossible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

The Court therefore agrees with the agency's assessment that its \"standard rate of 500 pages per month\" would be appropriate were Negley to seek release of such documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hardy Decl., \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Exemptions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, in his Opposition, Plaintiff purports to challenge the Government's redactions and withholdings for documents released in\n   <em>\n    previous\n   </em>\n   litigation. Typically, an agency must show that any withheld material \"falls within one of nine statutory exemptions.\"\n   <em>\n    People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Nat'l Institutes of Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237016,5900495\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/535/\">\n    745 F.3d 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540 (D.C. Cir. 2014). The rub here, however, is that the Department has not released\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   material responsive to Plaintiff's April 14, 2016, FOIA request. Rather, Negley has repeatedly\n   <em>\n    declined\n   </em>\n   the agency's offer to produce the UNABOM file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   He nevertheless takes umbrage at pages that the FBI has released as a\n   <em>\n    courtesy\n   </em>\n   during the instant litigation. Specifically, while the litigation was pending, the FBI received \"referrals\" from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas (the site of the original 2002 fax). The Office referred 1,519 pages of responsive records, all of which were part of prior FOIA requests and the subject of subsequent litigation. On February 3, 2017, the office made an additional referral, this time with 8 pages worth of emails related to Negley's previous FOIA requests. The FBI advised Plaintiff that those documents had \"previously been reviewed, processed, and adjudicated\" in\n   <em>\n    Negley III\n   </em>\n   , but that it would provide Plaintiff with another copy as a \"courtesy.\" Pl. Opp., Exh. G (Hardy Letter).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Now, Negley challenges redactions to two groups of those duplicate documents. First, he notes that the FBI produced \"21 pages ... from File 1575,\" each of which is \"heavily redacted.\" Opp. at 18-20. File 1575 is a sub-file of the San Francisco File and was the subject of extensive litigation before Judge Kessler in\n   <em>\n    Negley II\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3971752\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/825/63/#p65\">\n    825 F.Supp.2d at 66-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, Judge Kessler ordered the Bureau to release the entire sub-file, along with the requisite\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index justifying any redactions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3971752\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/825/63/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3971752\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/825/63/#p65\">\n    at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The agency did so and\n   <em>\n    there\n   </em>\n   justified withholdings on the basis of Exemption 7(C).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3971752\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/825/63/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3971752\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/825/63/#p65\">\n    at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Kessler ultimately agreed such exemptions were proper and granted the Bureau's motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3971752\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/825/63/#p65\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3971752\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/825/63/#p65\">\n    at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Defendant has specifically explained that it redacted the names or identifying information of either witnesses, third parties merely mentioned, individuals interviewed by the FBI, or individuals of investigative interest... [and] the Court concludes the FBI properly invoked Exemption 7(C).\"). Negley cannot now reprise the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v.

Those materials fall outside his current FOIA request and, in any event, were previously released to Plaintiff in litigation in the Western District of Texas. The appropriate time to challenge any use of exemptions was before that court. Yet during that litigation, \"Plaintiff did not challenge the exemptions in his response and concede[d] that they are appropriate in his sur-reply.\"\n   <em>\n    Negley III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012099972\">\n    2013 WL 12099972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. \"Because Plaintiff [did] not contest the exemptions as they apply to the documents uncovered by Defendant,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   the district court granted the Government's \"motion for summary judgment regarding defendant's assertion of exemptions 5, 6, 7(C), and 7(E).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012099972\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The decision, of course, precludes further litigation on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parklane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330171\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/322/\">\n    439 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   326 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330171\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/322/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
