[Record No. 1, \u00b6 4] They bill themselves as \"the largest manufacturer of farm gates and animal management equipment in North America.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12] The Tarter Companies have been family-owned since 1945, and are now managed by the fourth generation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 17] Plaintiff Smith and her children, Plaintiffs Coffey and Douglas Tarter, own 50% of the Tarter companies, while the remaining 50% belongs to Joshua Tarter and his two siblings, each of whom owns a one-sixth share. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Joshua Tarter is a shareholder of the Tarter Corporations and a member and manager of the Tarter LLCs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19] He has exercised executive authority on behalf of all of the Tarter Companies, and has variously held himself out as President, Vice-President, Officer, and Senior Executive of the Tarter Companies. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20] Gregory was a management employee of Tarter Gate Company, LLC, who oversaw engineering and quality, and held himself out as Vice-President or General Manager of the Tarter Companies. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 30] The plaintiffs claim that, because of their senior positions, Joshua Tarter and Gregory were in a position to control the vendors\n   selected by the Tarter Companies, as well as the prices paid to those vendors, and that they had access to confidential and proprietary information, including marketing and business strategies, financial data, pricing, costs, profit margins, order information, and customer relationships. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22, 28, 29, 33, 77]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Tarter Companies began to source components for use in their finished products from Chinese suppliers in 2009. They engaged Xiaofeng Chen to act as their agent in China. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35] Utilizing Chinese suppliers should have enabled the Tarter Companies to save substantial costs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36] However, the plaintiffs allege that, in 2010, Joshua Tarter, Gregory, and Chen devised a plan to funnel these potential savings to themselves. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40, 52, 58, 73] To accomplish this scheme, they formed Defendant QMC, which the plaintiffs characterize as a pass-through entity which manufactures nothing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 58]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to the plaintiffs, Joshua Tarter and Gregory used their authority to ensure that the Tarter Companies ordered the components from QMC rather than other suppliers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 29, 77, 90] QMC would forward the orders to suppliers in mainland China, who would manufacture the components and ship them directly to the Tarter Companies. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39] The mainland suppliers would bill QMC for the true cost of the components, but QMC would substantially inflate the price and invoice the Tarter companies for the higher amount, thus absorbing the cost savings that the Tarter Companies would have received if they had purchased directly from the mainland suppliers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 53-56, 62, 75-76] The plaintiffs allege that Joshua Tarter and Gregory used their knowledge of the prices the Tarter Companies paid for the components, the price quotations the Tarter Companies received from other potential suppliers, and the Tarter Companies' profit margins, to determine how much to inflate the price that QMC charged the Tarter Companies. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41] In total, the Tarter Companies paid QMC approximately $70,053,226.58,\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   wire transfer, over a seven year period for the component parts. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 63-72]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs assert that Joshua Tarter and Gregory used their positions within the Tarter Companies to further this scheme in a variety of ways. Most basically, they reduced the costs associated with QMC by misappropriating the Tarter Companies' resources, including by using the Tarter Companies' facilities and personnel for QMC business, and using the Tarter Companies' funds to pay for QMC expenses. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 83-84, 103, 135] They also allegedly used their positions within the Tarter Companies to ensure that QMC received more favorable treatment than other suppliers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93] For example, the Tarter Companies typically paid QMC 50% of its price in advance, although other suppliers did not receive such a down payment. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 122] Additionally, the Tarter Companies would not seek bids from other potential suppliers when a component was sourced by QMC, corrupting the competitive bid process. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94, 96, 119, 123] Finally, the Tarter Companies would allegedly accept defective products supplied by QMC, in contravention of their standard practice, thus shifting a loss that should have fallen on QMC to the Tarter Companies. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95-96, 105, 135]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to the plaintiffs, Joshua Tarter, Gregory, and Chen realized that secrecy was essential for their plan to succeed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57, 109, 130] The plaintiffs allege that, as a result, neither Joshua Tarter nor Gregory disclosed their interest in QMC to the Tarter Companies, despite their fiduciary duties to do so. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 59-60, 101-07, 113] Further, Joshua Tarter allegedly misrepresented his ownership interest\n   in QMC to the plaintiffs and the Tarter Companies on multiple occasions. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-48, 77, 97-100] Nonetheless, after \"considerable investigation,\" the plaintiffs discovered Joshua Tarter and Gregory's ownership interests in QMC in 2016, and confronted Joshua Tarter in meetings with him and his siblings. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 109, 110-12] Joshua Tarter allegedly declined to attend further meetings, did not fully disclose his relationship with QMC, and refused to disgorge the profits he made from QMC and turn them over to the Tarter Companies. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 115-17] Gregory resigned from his position on September 14, 2016, after being confronted for his allegedly improper behavior.

As a result, they have failed to satisfy the statutory prerequisites to bring a derivative action on the Tarter Companies' behalf, and their derivative capacity claims will be dismissed for lack of standing.
