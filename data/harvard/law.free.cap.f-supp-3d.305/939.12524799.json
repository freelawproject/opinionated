Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jahns was charged in the Northern District of Ohio (Western Division) in No. 3:10-cr-00435-DAK with being a felon in possession of a firearm. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). In 2012, he pled guilty without the benefit of a plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At sentencing Jahns was deemed an armed career criminal,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), and received an executed sentence of 240 months. Section 924(e) applies to persons with three prior violent felonies or serious drug offenses. Jahns objected to the application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), \u00a7 924(e), but the district court concluded that he had at least three convictions for violent felonies based on two first degree and two second degree Kentucky burglary convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jahns\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:10-CR-435,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20928725\">\n    2012 WL 928725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ohio Mar. 19, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the imposition of sentence, Jahns filed a direct appeal arguing that second-degree burglary in Kentucky is not a violent felony and that the ACCA's residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. The Sixth Circuit disagreed, concluding that the Kentucky statute describes generic burglary under\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    495 U.S. 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    109 L.Ed.2d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), because it prohibits unlawful entry into a \"dwelling.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because the burglary convictions counted as enumerated violent felonies, the residual clause was irrelevant. The Sixth Circuit casually noted that Jahns's fourth degree burglary conviction in Ohio is also a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=528%20Fed.%20Appx.%20483\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jahns then filed a motion for relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , again challenging the application of the ACCA.

The court denied relief, rejecting Jahns's claim under\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   and finding that Jahns's argument had already been addressed in his direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jahns v.

The Sixth Circuit denied this request concluding that the classification of Jahns's burglary convictions as violent felonies did not depend on the residual clause, so\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did not apply. The Sixth Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Although\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   announced a new, substantive rule of constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court,\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

In that case, the Supreme Court held that \"[a] crime counts as 'burglary' under the Act if its elements are the same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense.

The United States argues in this case that\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   are not retroactive decisions.

Although Kentucky defines \"dwelling\" as \"a building which is usually occupied by a person lodging therein,\" Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 511.010(2), the statute further provides that \" '[b]uilding,' in addition to its ordinary meaning, means any structure, vehicle, watercraft or aircraft: (a) Where any person lives; or (b) Where people assemble for purposes of business, government, education, religion, entertainment or public transportation.\" Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 511.010(1). Thus, Kentucky's definition of a \"dwelling\" includes vehicles, watercraft, and aircraft, and is thus broader than the common-law meaning of dwelling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Sixth Circuit's rationale in\n   <em>\n    Stitt\n   </em>\n   is persuasive. Kentucky's second-degree burglary statute does not match the ACCA's definition of generic burglary and thus does not qualify as a predicate offense under the enumerated clause of the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The finding that a conviction under Kentucky's second-degree burglary statute does not categorically qualify as a violent felony does not end the inquiry. Even if a state burglary statute criminalizes more conduct than generic burglary, it may do so by listing multiple elements in the alternative, thus setting forth different crimes, and one or more of those crimes might match the definition of generic burglary.\n   <em>\n    Stitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276330\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/854/\">\n    860 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   861-62 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2248-49 ;\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   , 544 U.S. at 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). That is not the case here. The plain language of the Kentucky statute is not divisible. In other words, in order to convict a defendant under the statute, the jury may convict if the locus of the burglary was a dwelling, including a vehicle, watercraft or aircraft. The Kentucky second-degree burglary statute doesn't set out separate elements, instead it lays out alternative means of satisfying the locational element of the statute. Under these circumstances, the statute is overbroad and indivisible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In conclusion, Jahns's second-degree burglary convictions do not count as predicate offenses under the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Ohio Fourth Degree Burglary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Mr. Jahns argues that the Ohio trespass of a habitation conviction does not qualify as a predicate conviction under the ACCA because it is overbroad.

In this case, the Court may look at certain documents to determine under which section of the statute Mr. Jahns was convicted, and the parties agree he was convicted under the fourth degree trespass in habitation section, \u00a7 (A)(4).
