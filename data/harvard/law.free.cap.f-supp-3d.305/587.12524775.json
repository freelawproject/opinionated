The gravamen of the five counts against Kane is that she retaliated against the plaintiffs for engaging in speech protected by the First Amendment as incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment. Fina and Costanzo also plead in a separate count that Kane and Miletto conspired to retaliate against them for protected speech.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

On remand, this court held a phone conference with counsel who all agreed that there is no dispute as to the employment status of plaintiffs at the times relevant here. The parties thereafter filed stipulations as to these facts, and the court has incorporated these facts into this memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We now must decide whether the defendants are shielded from liability on each of plaintiffs' claims based on the bar of qualified immunity.

He was appointed to that position by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate. 71 Pa. Const. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 61, 67.1, 251.

From August 17, 1987 to January 4, 2013, Sheetz served as the Executive Deputy\n   Attorney General of the Criminal Law Division of the OAG. Costanzo was a Deputy Attorney General of the OAG from August 1993 to January 4, 2013. Fina was employed by the OAG from March 18, 2002 to January 18, 2013, ultimately reaching the position of Chief Deputy Attorney General. While Feathers, Sheetz, and Costanzo had all been employed by and had served under prior Attorney Generals, they all had left the OAG before Kane was sworn in. Fina had likewise served under prior Attorney Generals and had resigned from his latest post three days after Kane took office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs' averments stem from a series of acrimonious encounters they had with Kane. The first began while Kane was on the campaign trail in 2012. At that time, she criticized the OAG's handling of the investigation into allegations that former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky had been sexually abusing young boys for a period of years dating back to 1994.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kane promised to initiate her own inquiry into the investigation once she took office. Fina and Costanzo, who were involved in the original investigation, openly criticized Kane's statements and campaign tactics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The conflict continued after Kane became Attorney General in January 2013 and initiated her own inquiry into the Sandusky matter. Her inquiry was completed by May 2014 and a report on the original Sandusky investigation was prepared by an OAG attorney, Geoffrey Moulton, Jr. After reviewing the report, Fina, Sheetz, Feathers, and Noonan, none of whom was then employed in the OAG, slammed the inquiry as \"ill-advised\" and announced that it had been \"born of political opportunism and posturing.\" They viewed the Moulton report as an \"exercise in second guessing\" undertaken to \"sift for criticism.\" They described Kane's claims that gave rise to the report as \"ill-informed and unfounded.\" Plaintiffs' responses, by court order, were incorporated into the final version of the Moulton report, which was made public on June 23, 2014, well over a year after Kane became Attorney General. That same day during a press conference, Kane accused Noonan, Fina, Sheetz, and Feathers of delaying the original investigation. According to Kane, the delay allowed Sandusky to molest two additional victims. Plaintiffs condemned this statement as false, and Kane later acknowledged its falsity. Fina, Feathers, and Noonan fired back at a press conference by criticizing Kane and denouncing her statements as untruthful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Meanwhile, Kane was overseeing another OAG investigation in which Fina and Costanzo had been involved, and again further strife erupted between plaintiffs and Kane. This investigation concerned certain members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly from Philadelphia who were suspected of taking bribes. Confidential informant Tyron Ali had agreed to assist the OAG investigation in exchange for the OAG dropping criminal charges against him. After Kane became Attorney General, Fina discovered that Kane had a conflict of interest in the investigation. Fina asserted that Kane had a professional relationship with at least two individuals who Ali had identified in connection with his work in the bribery investigation. One of these individual was Joshua Morrow. Through Morrow, Ali had made contributions in cash and by check in the names of straw donors to a political candidate. After Ali was arrested, Morrow returned the checks to Ali. Morrow later became a paid employee\n   of Kane's campaign staff and also made contributions to her campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Fina brought this conflict of interest to Kane's attention, but she ignored it. Instead, she declined to continue the bribery investigation against the legislators and initially refused to drop the charges against Ali. Fina thereafter brought the conflict of interest to the attention of the judge supervising the grand jury related to the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In March 2014 Kane began publicly criticizing the bribery investigation and insinuated that the investigation was racially motivated. She stated that she had information that the bribery investigation targeted members of the legislative Black Caucus. Fina alleges that Kane's comments were intended to damage his reputation and cast him as racist. He made public statements refuting Kane's allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Further jousting occurred between Kane and Fina and Costanzo at some point after Kane took office over a 2009 OAG investigation concerning J. Whyatt Mondesire, the former head of the Philadelphia chapter of the NAACP. That investigation, in which Fina and Costanzo had been involved, had stalled due to the unavailability of witness testimony. Kane, through an associate, gave confidential grand jury material to a reporter for the\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Daily News\n   </em>\n   , who wrote an article suggesting that Fina and Costanzo had improperly terminated the investigation. This article, written at Kane's direction, was published in June 2014. Further, Kane and Miletto conspired to retaliate against Fina and Costanzo when Kane had Miletto fabricate a story that Miletto had uncovered evidence of Fina and Costanzo's wrongdoing in the Mondesire investigation. According to the story, Fina and Costanzo removed Miletto from the investigation after they discovered that Miletto knew of their obstruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2014, Fina and Costanzo alerted the supervising judge of the Mondesire grand jury to the leak of confidential grand jury information. On the day in August 2014 when Fina and Costanzo were scheduled to testify before the grand jury on this issue, they were met in an elevator by Miletto and others who threatened them with physical harm. The supervising judge thereafter entered a protective order to prevent future intimidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Meanwhile, sometime after Kane took office but prior to May 2014, Kane was alerted to emails containing pornographic images sent among OAG officials and others outside of the OAG using OAG email accounts in connection with the original Sandusky investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs were among the individuals in the email chains. There were two encounters between Kane's subordinates and Fina's colleagues in which Kane's subordinates threatened plaintiffs for Fina's criticism and actions relating to Kane's leak of Mondesire grand jury material. In the first encounter in the summer of 2014, one of Kane's subordinates, David Tyler, the Chief Operating Officer of the OAG, threatened that \"a lot of those people [former OAG staff] are going to be hurt if 'Fina does not back off.' \" In the second encounter in August of 2014, James Barker, the Chief Deputy Attorney General for Appeals and Legal Services of the OAG, relayed that \"if Fina did not stop criticizing Kane, Kane would release the private emails of the former OAG\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   staff.\" As the Court of Appeals has interpreted the First Amended Complaint, the subordinates made these statements at Kane's direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Kane was advised that she could not lawfully release the emails in a selective manner and that the emails were not subject to public release under Pennsylvania law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, she released a portion of the emails of Fina, Costanzo, Feathers, Sheetz, and Noonan in September 2014. Kane did so in a selective way in order to portray plaintiffs in a false light and depict them as participants in the possession and distribution of child pornography. In November 2014 during a nationally-broadcasted interview following the release, Kane insinuated that Fina, Feathers, Sheetz, and Noonan were involved in possessing and distributing child pornography using their government work computers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The First Amended Complaint details six counts asserting violations under \u00a7 1983 : (1) in Count One Fina alleges that Kane retaliated against him by publicly declaring that the Ali bribery investigation, that is the investigation of the Philadelphia legislators, was racially motivated in order to cast Fina as racist; (2) in Count Two Fina and Costanzo assert that Kane retaliated against them by releasing confidential grand jury material from the Mondesire investigation and by having her subordinates threaten to harm them by releasing their emails containing pornographic images if Fina did not stop criticizing Kane; (3) Fina and Costanzo allege in Count Three that Kane and Miletto conspired to retaliate against them by fabricating a story relayed to a reporter suggesting that Fina and Costanzo had improperly stalled the Mondesire grand jury investigation, had improperly removed Miletto from the investigation, and had Miletto threaten Fina and Costanzo physically in order to prevent them from testifying in a grand jury regarding the leak of Mondesire grand jury material; (4) Fina, Sheetz, Feathers, and Noonan aver in Count Four that Kane retaliated against them by publicly criticizing their conduct in the Jerry Sandusky investigation; (5) in Count Five, Fina, Sheetz, Feathers, and Noonan aver that Kane retaliated against them by publicly suggesting that plaintiffs distributed through emails child pornography; and (6) in Count Six all five plaintiffs contend that Kane retaliated against them by directing her subordinates to threaten to harm them if Fina did not stop criticizing her and by casting them in a false light through selectively releasing their emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Our Court of Appeals, as noted above, pointed to three specific instances described in the First Amended Complaint in which plaintiffs alleged that Kane, Miletto, or subordinates at their direction threatened them. Reading the First Amended Complaint broadly, two of those threats are relevant to Counts Two, Three, and Six since the threats related to both the Mondesire grand jury leak and the release of the emails containing pornographic images. The Chief Operating Officer of the OAG first threatened in the summer of 2014 that \"a lot of those people [former OAG staff] are going to be hurt if 'Fina does not back off' \" with respect to Fina's comments regarding the Mondesire grand jury leak. The Chief Deputy Attorney General for Appeals and Legal Services of the OAG, in August of 2014 also threatened that \"if Fina did not stop criticizing Kane,\n   Kane would release the private emails of the former OAG staff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The final threat relates to Counts Two and Three brought by Fina and Costanzo against Kane and Miletto and involves the Mondesire grand jury leak. In this threat, Miletto physically threatened and intimidated Fina and Costanzo in August 2014 in the elevator when they were going to testify before the grand jury concerning the leak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Our Court of Appeals observed in connection with the threats: \"[w]hether that retaliation would deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising [their First Amendment rights] is a question to be decided by the factfinder and not discarded so early.\"\n   <em>\n    Noonan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20Fed.%20Appx.%2049\">\n    698 Fed.Appx. at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Preliminarily we note that \u00a7 1983, under which each of the six counts is pleaded, does not create a substantive right in and of itself, but rather provides a remedy for a violation of underlying constitutional or other federally established rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Kneipp v.

Fina criticized Kane for her conflict of interest in connection with the investigation and publicly revealed this conflict. In September 2013, he filed an affidavit in support of Ali's motion to recuse Kane from the case and to compel performance of a cooperation agreement entered into with Ali. In November 2013, Kane dropped the charges against the legislators and initially declined to drop charges against Ali. In March 2014, Kane falsely implied that Fina had publicly disclosed Ali's undercover efforts. She further retaliated publicly against Fina by calling the investigation, which he led, racially motivated, and suggesting that Fina was a racist. All of these events occurred before the summer of 2014 and before any of the three threats alleged in the First Amended Complaint were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In a count such as this where Fina is challenging the speech of a public official, we must of course be cognizant that the public official also has rights under the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9464175\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/271/566/\">\n    271 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   573 ;\n   <em>\n    Zaloga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173856\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/170/#p174\">\n    841 F.3d at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, Count One of the First Amended Complaint, brought by Fina alone, will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In Count Two, Fina and Costanzo allege that Kane retaliated against them for outing her conflict of interest in the bribery investigation of the Philadelphia legislators involving cooperating witness Tyron Ali, more specifically that she had a professional relationship with Joshua Morrow, who\n   Ali had paid cash and contributions to in connection with the investigation. As part of her retaliation, in March 2014 she had an associate leak to the press confidential grand jury information from a 2009 investigation into J. Whyatt Mondesire. The purpose of this leak was to produce a news article suggesting that Fina and Costanzo, prosecutors on the case, had improperly stalled the Mondesire investigation, when in fact the investigation came to a halt due to a lack of leads in uncovering evidence. Fina and Costanzo aver damage to their reputations as prosecutors as result of the leak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Fina and Costanzo further allege in Count Two that subordinates of Kane threatened on two occasions to harm them if Fina did not stop criticizing Kane's leak of the Mondesire grand jury material. Specifically in the summer of 2014, David Tyler, the Chief Operating Officer of the OAG, warned that \"a lot of \"a lot of those people [former OAG staff] are going to be hurt if 'Fina does not back off.' \" We interpret \"those people\" to include Costanzo, who had worked with Fina on the Mondesire matter. Later in August of 2014, James Barker, the Chief Deputy Attorney General for Appeals and Legal Services of the OAG, promised that \"if Fina did not stop criticizing Kane, Kane would release the private emails of the former OAG staff.\" The Court of Appeals has read the First Amended Complaint as implicating Kane in these threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Read together the threats crossed the line from protected First Amendment speech by Kane to speech threatening harm.\n   <em>\n    Mirabella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277151\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/641/#p651\">\n    853 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   651 ;\n   <em>\n    Schleig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=695%20Fed.%20Appx.%2026\">\n    695 Fed.Appx. at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, the allegations of Fina and Costanzo against Kane in Count Two state a violation of a clearly established right, and Kane is not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to these threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As in Count Two, in Count Three Fina and Costanzo allege that in March 2014 Kane retaliated against them for Fina's involvement in publicly revealing her conflict of interest in the bribery investigation of the Philadelphia legislators. Count Three also avers that Kane and defendant Michael Miletto conspired to retaliate against Fina and Costanzo for Fina's conduct. Specifically, in retaliation Kane directed Miletto to leak a story to the press that in 2009 Miletto had uncovered misconduct by Fina and Constanzo in connection with the Mondesire investigation. As part of the fabricated story published in June 2014, Miletto stated at Kane's direction that when Fina and Costanzo discovered that Miletto had uncovered their wrongdoing, they removed him from the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Fina and Costanzo further allege that they were retaliated against by Kane and Miletto after they reported the leak of the Mondesire grand jury material to the supervising judge of the grand jury. The two were then subpoenaed to testify on August 26, 2014 before a grand jury about their knowledge of the leak. On their way to testify, they were met in the elevator by Miletto and others who \"attempted to physically intimidate, threaten and harass Fina while he was in the elevator.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition that summer they were retaliated against, as previously described in Count Two, by Kane directing her subordinates to promise that \"a lot of those people [former OAG staff] are going to be hurt if 'Fina does not back off' \" and warn that \"if Fina did not stop criticizing Kane,\n   Kane would release the private emails of the former OAG staff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   While the threat in the elevator as described in the First Amended Complaint specifically references only Fina, Costanzo is also a plaintiff in this count.

It highlighted that the Borough council president did not himself have the power to take adverse action against the plaintiff. Notably, the Court observed, \"it has never been established that a government official who does not himself retaliate but instead pressures another to retaliate ... can be held personally liable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173856\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/170/#p174\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Consequently, Kane is entitled to qualified immunity not only on the claims in Count Four brought by Fina and Noonan, who have only alleged harm to their reputation, but also on the claims brought by Feathers and Sheetz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Fina, Sheetz, Feathers, and Noonan allege in Count Five that in a November 2014 interview Kane accused them of possessing and distributing child pornography and other controversial images using their OAG email accounts and in connection with their investigation of Sandusky, even though she knew these accusations were false. This interview took place several months after Kane had released certain of their emails. No threat, coercion, or intimidation has been alleged in connection with this count.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mirabella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277151\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/641/#p651\">\n    853 F.3d at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For the reasons discussed above, Kane is entitled to qualified immunity on Count Five with respect to Fina, Noonan, Feathers, and Sheetz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally we turn to Count Six. Fina, Sheetz, Feathers, Noonan, and Costanzo\n   allege that in September 2014 Kane selectively released their names and emails that contained pornographic images in retaliation for their criticism of her. They aver that she received two legal opinions prior to the release that instructed her that she was not permitted to release their names under Pennsylvania law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The five plaintiffs appear to tie their claims in Count Six to the previously discussed threats made by the Chief Operating Officer of the OAG and the Chief Deputy Attorney General for Appeals and Legal Services of the OAG. These threats, made in the summer of 2014, promised \"a lot of those people [former OAG staff] are going to be hurt if 'Fina does not back off,' \" and \"if Fina did not stop criticizing Kane, Kane would release the private emails of the former OAG staff.\" Kane released the emails thereafter in September 2014. Reading the First Amended Complaint as did the Court of Appeals, we interpret it as including all of the plaintiffs as \"those people.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court of Appeals has deemed these threats to constitute more than defamation and would allow discovery to go forward on the merits, that is so that it can be determined \"whether that retaliation would deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising those rights[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Noonan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20Fed.%20Appx.%2049\">\n    698 Fed.Appx. at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under these circumstances, Kane is not entitled to qualified immunity on Count Six.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In sum, the court will grant the motion of defendant Kane to dismiss Counts One, Four, and Five on the ground that she is entitled to qualified immunity. The motion will otherwise be denied. The motion of defendant Miletto will be denied. Discovery may proceed on the merits as well as the issue of qualified immunity on the remaining counts.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Fina and Costanzo also asserted state law claims of defamation and false light against the Philadelphia Media Network, LLC, and Philadelphia Media Network (Digital) LLC, which together own the\n    <em>\n     Philadelphia Daily News\n    </em>\n    , and a reporter Christopher Brennan (collectively the \"Media Defendants\").
