For the reasons stated below, I GRANT in part and DENY in part the Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In December 2015, Defendant United States Forest Service issued a decision memo that approved the Walton Lake Restoration Project, a proposed commercial logging and thinning project at Walton Lake. Plaintiff League of Wilderness Defenders/Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project (LOWD) challenged the Forest Service's approval of the project under the National Environmental Protection Act and the National Forest Management Act. Complaint [1]. LOWD moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the logging, which I granted after oral argument. Order [25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Forest Service then voluntarily withdrew its decision memo, and I stayed the litigation so that the parties could negotiate attorney fees. Order [30]. Those negotiations were unsuccessful, and LOWD moved to voluntarily dismiss. Motion [34]. I granted the motion and dismissed LOWD's claims without prejudice. Order [39].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   LOWD moved for attorney fees [43] and costs [52]. The Forest Service requested discovery on the motion [54], and I denied the request after briefing. Order [66].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   LOWD seeks a grand total of $213,373.32. Reply [82] at 29. That amount is comprised of: $198,988.00 in attorney, legal fellow, and law student time, of which $59,812.50 was incurred in the attorney fee litigation itself; $13,819.25 in expert fees; and $566.07 in costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   LOWD retained attorneys Tom Buchele and Jesse Buss, as well as legal fellows and law students at Earthrise Law Center, the environmental law clinic at Lewis &amp; Clark Law School and several experts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Buchele Decl.

Application [43] at 8. LOWD's experts agree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jerger Decl. [48] at 6; Bloemers Decl. [49] at 11. The Ninth Circuit has held that environmental law cases can require distinctive skills and knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Love\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548208\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/924/1492/#p1496\">\n    924 F.2d at 1496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For Prelim. Inj. [17]. LOWD points out that Mr. Buchele's knowledge was especially necessary in this litigation since LOWD had only a few days between when it received the administrative record and when it filed its motion for preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Prelim. Inj. [9] at 2 n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Forest Service responds that the case \"involved the straightforward application of administrative law and two common environmental statutes,\" requiring no special skill. Resp. [69] at 6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thangaraja\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280345\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/870/#p876\">\n    428 F.3d at 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting enhanced fees where attorney's specialized knowledge was not necessary in routine immigration case). Its expert agrees that the case's\n   complexity was too low to justify the high hourly rates. Fite Decl. [71] at 4. The Forest Service also contends that because Mr. Buss and Mr. Buchele worked on litigation tasks together, they were interchangeable, and because they were interchangeable, there is no evidence to show that any one attorney's skills were \"necessary.\" Resp. [69] at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons\n   <em>\n    LOWD\n   </em>\n   identifies, I find that Mr. Buchele's specialized knowledge was necessary to this case. The arguments in this case strayed into the weeds of the Forest Service's Decision Memo, the interpretation of exceptions to the Eastside Screens, the meaning of terms used in the scoping notice, and the applicability of the sanitation harvest categorical exception.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Resp. in Opp. to Mot. For Prelim. Inj. [17]. Mr. Buchele's specialized knowledge was especially important since this case moved quickly. Finally, I hold that senior and junior attorney may work together on a case and yet not be interchangeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    c) Not available elsewhere at the statutory rate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, LOWD argues that Mr. Buchele's expertise was unavailable at the EAJA rate, even as adjusted for inflation. LOWD's Director, Karen Coulter, detailed her efforts to find qualified attorneys for this and other cases. She says she has \"never been able to retain a lawyer to represent LOWD who did not expect to recover for her time at market rates,\" and that \"in 2016 LOWD had multiple cases that LOWD could not bring because I could not locate available, qualified counsel,\" despite her \"constant\" efforts. Coulter Supp. Decl. [77] at 5. LOWD's experts verified that Mr. Buss and Mr. Buchele's expertise were not available at the EAJA rate. Becker Decl. [47] at 21-22; Bloemers Decl. [49] at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Forest Service responds that (a) Ms. Coulter failed to provide enough detail about her attempts to research attorneys; (b) Ms. Coulter only searched for attorneys at $125/hour, rather than the cost-of-living-adjusted rates; (c) since Mr. Buss worked on the case without Mr. Buchele for three months, there is no evidence that LOWD needed a lawyer of Mr. Buchele's caliber and rate; and (d) environmental litigation is no longer a niche area, since it is widely taught and practiced. The Forest Service's expert confirmed that there are many recent law graduates with similar training who would litigate the case at the statutory rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In its reply, LOWD points to several of its experts' declarations, which explain that qualified counsel were not available at the statutory rate, anywhere in Oregon.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Becker Decl. [47] at 31, 43. It also emphasizes that Judge Simon found that environmental attorneys were not available elsewhere at the statutory rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LOWD\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203546858\">\n    2014 WL 3546858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   I find that LOWD met its burden to demonstrate that attorneys with Mr. Buchele's experience and training were not available elsewhere at the statutory rate. Plaintiff's expert David Becker, an attorney who has practiced for 18 years (10 years in Portland) noted that \"there are no attorneys with the requisite skills and expertise in environmental law available in Portland, or elsewhere in Oregon, at the statutory EAJA rate.\" Becker Decl. [47] at 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bloemers Decl. [49] at 13 (asserting that the necessary skills are not available at adjusted statutory rate). Even if Ms. Coulter did not look for attorneys at the adjusted statutory rate, LOWD's experts insist that she would not have found them. Furthermore, as discussed above, I do not think that Mr. Buss and Mr. Buchele are interchangeable; that Mr. Buss worked for some time on the case without\n   Mr. Buchele does not mean that LOWD did not benefit from Mr. Buchele's representation once he became available. Lastly, the fact that environmental law is now taught more widely does not mean that there are significantly more attorneys who practice environmental law, and much less that there are attorneys with Mr. Buchele's thirty years of experience who are available at the statutory rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In sum, I find that Mr. Buchele qualifies for a higher rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Mr. Buss's rate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because Mr. Buss does not meet the first element, a rate above the statutory maximum is not justified. Thus, the maximum I may award to Mr. Buss is $192.68 for work performed in 2016, and $196.79 for work performed in 2017. The Forest Service does not argue that I should award Mr. Buss less than the statutory rate, and I find the rate appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Mr. Buchele's rate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   LOWD requests $475/hour for Mr. Buchele. \"If the rate requested exceeds the average rate reported in the OSB Survey, the burden is on the prevailing party to justify that higher rate. Even when such justification is present, the court usually limits the hourly rate to the 75th percentile of the OSB Survey.\"\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202156471\">\n    2013 WL 2156471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Forest Service contests Mr. Buchele's requested rate of $475/hour. First, the Forest Service argues (without legal support) that the relevant Oregon community is Eastern Oregon, because the case was brought in the Pendleton Division. There, attorneys with 30 years of experience charge $275/hour at the 75th percentile. The Forest Service also asserts that LOWD cannot argue that Portland is the correct forum because it did not raise the forum issue in its motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   LOWD responds that its experts' declarations do in fact discuss the appropriate forum. Those experts assert that Portland is the proper forum and explain that there is limited information available about attorneys in Eastern Oregon. Jerger Decl. [48] at 8; Becker Decl. [47] at 16-17; Coulter Decl. [46] at 2-3. They each conclude that no similarly-qualified attorneys were available in Eastern Oregon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   I agree that Portland is the correct forum, because the case was argued in Portland and because attorneys were not available in Eastern Oregon.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prison Legal News\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202156471\">\n    2013 WL 2156471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (awarding Portland market rates in case filed in Pendleton).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Forest Service further contends that $475/hour is excessive for Mr. Buchele because, as the director of a law school clinic, he does not incur the same overhead as attorneys at firms and non-profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In response, LOWD points out that both the U.S. Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have declined to award lower fees to attorneys who work for non-profit legal services, and lower courts have rejected the argument that legal clinics are any different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LOWD\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203546858\">\n    2014 WL 3546858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 ;\n   <em>\n    Proulx v.

Citing the 2012 OSB Survey, LOWD highlights that lawyers practicing 21-30 years charged $399/hour in the 75th percentile and $470/hour in the 95th percentile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   First, I find that Portland is the appropriate forum to judge market rates, because LOWD presented sufficient evidence of the lack of available, qualified attorneys in Eastern Oregon. And I agree that LOWD did not waive that argument. Second, Mr. Buchele's rate should not be reduced because he works for the law school clinic.\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   mandates a market-rate\n   approach to attorney fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700756\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/1196/#p1205\">\n    729 F.3d at 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Courts do not delve into the specifics of the attorney's overhead and costs. Regardless of how the overhead is initially funded, the market-rate approach assumes that attorneys generally incur the same overhead costs. Lewis &amp; Clark may front those costs for Mr. Buchele and the students, but Lewis &amp; Clark's funding does not change the fact that Mr. Buchele and the students incurred that overhead in their defense of LOWD. Lastly, I find a rate of $475/hour reasonable. The 2017 OSB Survey indicates that Portland-area attorneys who have practiced from 21-30 years charge $475/hour at the 75th percentile. Moreover, Mr. Buchele's thirty years of experience puts him at the upper end of the 21-30 age range, and he has significant specialized experience relevant to this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Legal fellows' and law students' rates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   LOWD requests $140/hour for the legal fellows, Doug DeRoy and Kathryn Roberts, and $130/hour for its law students, Tessa Chillemi, Kadin Pasley, and Skylar Sumner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Forest Service argues that $50/hour is a reasonable rate. It contends that LOWD was required to submit evidence that paying clients paid the requested rate, since \"[h]ours that are not properly billed to one's client also are not properly billed to one's adversary pursuant to statutory authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n    461 U.S. at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted).

Time spent in the same conference is not necessarily duplicative, and the Forest Service failed to explain why Mr. Buchele and Mr. Buss's joint tasks were duplicative. Indeed, its expert expressly did not opine on the reasonableness of the submitted hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fite Decl. [71] at 4.

Trip to Walton Lake objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Forest Service objects to the 6.7 hours Mr. Buss billed for his visit to Walton Lake. The Forest Service argues that the site visit was unnecessary for the administrative-law-based challenge to the Decision Memo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   LOWD responds that the site visit helped the attorneys understand generally the landscape of the site, and specifically the alternatives available to the Forest Service. As evidence of the importance of the site visit, LOWD points out that Mr. Buchele also visited the site (though he did not bill for his visit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As explained above, I find time spent on claim investigation and evaluation reasonable. I award fees for the site-visit hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Duplicative objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Forest Service objects to several entries as duplicative. Upon my\n   review, I find that those entries are not duplicative. It is not unreasonable for multiple attorneys to do some tasks, such as reviewing and editing the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LOWD\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203546858\">\n    2014 WL 3546858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *10. It is also not duplicative to start a research task on one day and continue the same research later on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Instruction objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Forest Service also objects to hours where it says the emphasis was on instruction, rather than advancing the litigation. Other courts have reduced hours for law students and new attorneys because \"unlike a law clerk in a law firm, which must justify its bills to its clients, there is no similar economic restraint for law student research in a law school clinical setting.\"\n   <em>\n    Nkihtaqmikon v.

Accordingly, the Forest Service objects to various entries in which the law students met with Mr. Buchele; followed up on assignments; and drafted memoranda. The Forest Service further objects to 27.9 hours Mr. Buchele spent meeting with students and reviewing their work, and participating in a group discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   LOWD responds that it already eliminated time where the primary emphasis was on education. Buchele Decl. [44] at 5-7. The clinic functions both as an educational opportunity for the students and as counsel for nonprofit groups such as LOWD; in the latter role, the clinic functions much as any legal nonprofit, with senior attorneys supervising junior staff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504862\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/690/1132/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Buchele asserts that student and fellow work actually saves money because the rate for law students and legal fellows is substantially reduced.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504862\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/690/1132/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For the reasons LOWD offers, I find that the law student and legal fellow hours are reasonably billed to the government.

Thus, it argues, I should not award fees for time spent on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   LOWD's response is two-fold. First, it argues that its NFMA claim was not distinct, because it arose out of the same facts. Complaint [1] at \u00b6 4. Second, LOWD contends that its NFMA claim succeeded: LOWD received all the relief it requested, including relief consistent with its NFMA-based\n   legal challenges. Buss Supp. Decl. [75], Ex. 2. Furthermore, LOWD notes that because the Forest Service withdrew the Decision Memo, LOWD did not have the opportunity to further investigate and argue its NFMA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   I hold that LOWD may recover for hours spent on the NFMA claim. The parties resolved this case in LOWD's favor after the preliminary injunction. No claim was \"unsuccessful.\" It is axiomatic that a court's analysis of the strength of claim at the preliminary injunction stage should not be viewed as any ultimate decision on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    8. Objections to hours spent before the complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In support of the 15% reduction, the Forest Service also argues that LOWD spent an excessive amount of time on the Complaint and on activities prior the Complaint. It points out that LOWD spent 153.6 hours on the case prior to filing its Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   LOWD contends the \"excessive\" objection is too vague; the Forest Service does not explain why that time was excessive.

For one, its effect seems at odds with the broad purpose of the EAJA: a hypothetical plaintiff could hire the qualified experts necessary to win its case, but receive no compensation because the United States managed to hire a single inexperienced expert for $0.01/hour. As courts have read the provision, it places no minimum on the quality or usefulness of the United States's lower-cost expert. See\n   <em>\n    ACE Const., Inc. v.

It is possible to read the provision to merely limit recovery to the compensation the United States has paid in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   litigation, but no court has read it that way, and LOWD does not make that argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In the end, I must apply the statute's plain terms. I am not persuaded by LOWD's argument that the provision does not apply because the United States paid nothing-it would be absurd if the provision applied where the government paid $0.01/hour, but not $0/hour.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, I find that the United States \"paid\" $0/hour.

Finally, while the provision may conflict with the broad purpose of the EAJA, awarding expert fees in this case would conflict with the narrowly-defined\n   intent of the provision: to restrict the recoverable expert rate to the rate paid by the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Because expert testimony is typically critical to environmental litigation, this\n    <em>\n     sub rosa\n    </em>\n    elimination of plaintiffs' experts could be an inappropriate windfall to the government. Should that future problem arise, however, there are litigative solutions available, independent of statutory text. Perhaps more fundamentally, courts and commentators have often noted that the best way to promote change in unwise or unworkable statutes is to apply them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
