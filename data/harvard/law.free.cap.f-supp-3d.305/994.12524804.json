He asked to get dressed in the bedroom, and one of the law enforcement officers agreed but said he wanted to accompany Enriquez for safety reasons, and Enriquez refused. Nevertheless, the officer stood outside the bedroom and watched through a two-and-a-half-inch crack in the accordion-style door to the bedroom. The officer \"observed Enriquez go to the closet, reach 'mid-level' or 'up above' with both of his hands and 'fumble[ ] with' or 'mess[ ] with' something.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201584114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Enriquez did not remove anything from the closet.

On September 24, 2008, Enriquez filed a motion to suppress, arguing he did not consent to the warrantless search of his home. He relied on the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but he did not rely on article I, section 8 of the Iowa Constitution. ECF No. 31-5 at 11-14. At first, the trial court granted the motion to suppress because Enriquez did not consent. ECF No. 31-5 at 39-42. On November 7, 2008, the trial court reconsidered and denied the motion to suppress because Ryder's probation agreement justified the search, no private area of Enriquez's was searched, Enriquez did not expressly object, and the drugs were in plain view during the search.

The decision in\n   <em>\n    Brandon\n   </em>\n   was not based on the Iowa Constitution, but rather was based on an interpretation of a cohabitant's rights under the Fourth Amendment in\n   <em>\n    Georgia v.

The application for stay and review did not specifically assert a challenge under the Iowa Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-60. In resisting the application, the State pointed out, \"The district court noted\n   that the residential search was valid under Ryder's probation agreement and Enriquez did not expressly object to the search so as to invoke a situation similar to that examined in\n   <em>\n    Georgia v.

In\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   , the defendant, a parolee, argued that, under the Iowa Constitution, the officers could not conduct a warrantless, suspicionless search of his hotel room based simply on his parole agreement that authorized law enforcement officers to search the parolee's residence \"at any time and for any reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7076409\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/792/260/\">\n    792 N.W.2d at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ECF No. 31-6 at 93-96. It further noted that officers entered the residence based on information implicating Enriquez in a murder. ECF No. 31-6 at 93-96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 17, 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court issued\n   <em>\n    State v.

Perhaps trial counsel could not have been expected to raise the issue in 2008, or even in 2009, when there was only an invitation to raise the issue by three Iowa Supreme\n   Court Justices in an equally divided opinion issued the week before trial began. The question gets closer as time goes on, after\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   was decided and Enriquez's appeal was awaiting decision, and the same office represented Enriquez and Ochoa on appeal, and there is no clear rationale in the record why appellate counsel did not raise the issue. Given that the defense bar has been \"implored repeatedly\" over the years to raise such issues,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206902817\">\n    2016 WL 6902817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, it is evident that competent defense lawyers now should be expected to raise claims based on the Iowa Constitution to protect their clients' privacy rights. But the standards now are not the measure of counsel's performance when Enriquez's case was on appeal in 2011. And-more to the point-this Court cannot say the Iowa courts misapplied\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   in ruling that counsel's performance was not deficient in Enriquez's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   It is vital to remember that even if this Court disagrees with the state court decision, and even if it would have decided the issue differently in the first place, that is not the standard of review for this habeas action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockyer\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030374\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/63/#p76\">\n    538 U.S. at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030374\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/63/#p76\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, for Enriquez to obtain relief, this Court must conclude \"[t]he state court decision must be 'so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.' \"\n   <em>\n    Etherton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594952\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1149/#p1151\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Given the unsettled status of the Iowa law regarding persons in Enriquez's position, this Court concludes that a fairminded jurist could determine that counsel for Enriquez during the trial and appeal was not to be faulted for failing to raise a challenge under the Iowa Constitution based on his cohabitant's probation agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Was Enriquez Prejudiced?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Beyond the question of competency is the question the Iowa court did not reach-Is there a reasonable probability\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the result would have been different if counsel had challenged the search under the Iowa Constitution? This Court must conclude there is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   At the time\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   was decided, while Enriquez's appeal was pending, Enriquez's case was arguably not as strong as the search invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   for the following reasons: (1) Ochoa objected to the\n   search, and Enriquez's cohabitant apparently did not object; (2) Ochoa was a parolee, as was the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Cullison\n   </em>\n   , and the Iowa Supreme Court had not yet addressed the case of probationers like Ryder; (3) officers had zero suspicion to search Ochoa's space, and Ryder's probation officer had suspicions that Ryder was living in a home with drug activity and firearms; and (4) only law enforcement officers were present in Ochoa's case, whereas Ryder's probation officer was present with law enforcement officers for Ryder's search. Enriquez argues his case is actually stronger than that in\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   because he was a third party, not the probationer, thus officers had no reason to be searching his home. The court in\n   <em>\n    Baldon\n   </em>\n   raised the \"concern that suspicionless consent searches of parolees also impact family and friends who live with parolees.\"\n   <em>\n    Baldon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7068387\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/829/785/#p803\">\n    829 N.W.2d at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This argument is, however, undercut by the fact that Ryder's probation officer suspected illegal activity at Ryder's home, and officers conducted a cursory search once inside to maintain their safety. Even if Ryder did not voluntarily consent to the search, it is at least arguable, even now, that the search might be valid under the \"special-needs doctrine,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12149028\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/888/406/#p415\">\n    888 N.W.2d at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the probation officer was attempting to carry out the goals of the probation agreement. Furthermore, as late as 2015, the Iowa Supreme Court refused to \"address application of this [special-needs exception] standard to probationers or how the scope of the search might be affected by the expectations of privacy held by others living in the same home.\"\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6861602\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/867/106/#p116\">\n    867 N.W.2d at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For Enriquez to win, the Iowa courts would have needed to telescope about six years of decisions down into Enriquez's case, and then gone further to rule that a probationer suspected of living with guns and possible drug trafficking was not a good enough reason to do a probation check, that the probationer's consent was not valid, and that a third party could challenge the search. Even now, it is not a given that the Iowa courts would rule in a defendant's favor on the same issue. Certainly it is up to the Iowa courts to decide on their own timetable what their state laws mean. It is not the role of this federal court to predict that the Iowa courts, if they had been presented with this issue then, would have interpreted their own laws in a certain way that was not made clear until years later. If the Iowa Supreme Court believed the lower court got it wrong in Enriquez's case, that is, if it believed counsel should have raised the issue and there is a reasonable probability it would have ruled the search was invalid, the Iowa Supreme Court could have taken up the issue on further review. It did not. Maybe it will, but this is not the case to say so. Giving the Iowa Court of Appeals the deference it is due, this Court concludes the decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent, and it was not \"based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
