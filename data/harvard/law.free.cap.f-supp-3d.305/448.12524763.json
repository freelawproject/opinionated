Olinsky, attorney for Plaintiff Lakisha Janey Sinkler (\"Plaintiff\"), moves for attorney's fees in the amount of $16,851.00 pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20406\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). (Dkt. 19). The Commissioner of Social Security (\"the Commissioner\") does not object to the request. (Dkt. 21). However, for the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that counsel's request is untimely and denies the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 8, 2014, Plaintiff filed this action, seeking review of the final decision of the Commissioner denying her application for Supplemental Security Income Benefits. (Dkt. 1). On January 30, 2015, Plaintiff moved for judgment on the pleadings. (Dkt. 8). By Stipulation and Order filed on May 15, 2015, the decision of the Commissioner was reversed and the case was remanded for further administrative proceedings. (Dkt. 12). On July 9, 2015, Plaintiff filed her first motion for attorney's fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"EAJA\"). (Dkt. 16). By Stipulation and Order filed on July 23, 2015, the parties agreed that Plaintiffs attorney was entitled to $6,500.00 for services performed and $15.39 for costs incurred in connection with this action, pursuant to the EAJA. (Dkt. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On remand, the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") issued a decision in favor of Plaintiff, dated November 7, 2016, finding her eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income payments under the Social Security Act. (Dkt. 19-2). Following that decision, on December 28, 2016, the Commissioner determined that Plaintiff was entitled to past due benefits in the amount of $67,404.00. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 19-4 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 6, 2017, Plaintiff's counsel moved for attorney's fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20406\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). (Dkt. 19). Counsel seeks $16,851.00, which represents the statutory cap of 25% of the past-due benefits granted in the Commissioner's award notice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 19-1 at \u00b6 6; Dkt. 19-4 at 2). Counsel states that, if he receives the requested fee, he will refund to Plaintiff the EAJA fee of $6,500.00. (Dkt. 19-1 at \u00b6 7). The Commissioner filed a response, stating that she has no objection to Plaintiff's counsel's fee request, that the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   hourly rate of $509.09 does not appear to be a windfall to Plaintiff's counsel, and that\n   there is no evidence of fraud or overreaching. (Dkt. 21 at 3-4). Nonetheless, the Commissioner noted that while Plaintiff's counsel received the Commissioner's notice of award on or about December 28, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's counsel did not file the present motion for attorney's fees until July 6, 2017-over six months later.

This justification is reviewed favorably because it is \"preferable for an attorney to first approach the institution in which he ultimately prevailed and only apply to the other institution if the fees initially awarded were below the 25 percent cap and the attorney was dissatisfied.\"\n   <em>\n    Garland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3847990\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/492/216/#p219\">\n    492 F.Supp.2d at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, as in\n   <em>\n    Garland\n   </em>\n   , there is no indication that Plaintiff's counsel sought \u00a7 406(a) fees before filing this \u00a7 406(b) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As the Tenth Circuit stated in\n   <em>\n    McGraw\n   </em>\n   , \"decisions on Rule 60(b)(6) motions for \u00a7 406(b)(1) fees, like Rule 60(b)(6) motions on other grounds, are committed to the district court's sound discretion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3089370\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/493/#p505\">\n    450 F.3d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Court does not find that this unjustified six-month delay is reasonable under the circumstances presented.
