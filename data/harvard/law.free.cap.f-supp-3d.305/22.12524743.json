KELLY, United States District Judge\n   This case involves a dispute between Plaintiff Edge Investment, LLC (\"Edge\"), a building construction company, and Defendants, various District of Columbia entities and their contractors. Defendants razed a building constructed by Edge, claiming that the building had damaged an underground sewer. A lawsuit addressing the same dispute and many of the same claims as this case is well into discovery in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia (the \"Superior Court\"). Before the Court are Defendant District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority's (\"D.C. Water\") and Defendant George S. Hawkins' Motions to Stay or Dismiss. For the reasons described below, the Court will grant these motions in part and stay the case pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For purposes of these motions, the Court assumes the truth of the facts set forth in Edge's complaint. The Northeast Boundary Tunnel Sewer (the \"NEBTS\") is an underground waste and storm sewer. ECF No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 15, 28. D.C. Water is authorized to operate the NEBTS on behalf of the District of Columbia (the \"District\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 10, 2013, the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (\"DCRA\") issued a building permit authorizing construction of a three-story residential building on a lot (the \"Lot\") located near the H Street corridor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 24. The NEBTS runs approximately thirteen feet below the Lot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. In May 2013, Edge purchased both the Lot and the approved building permit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Prior to doing so, Edge obtained a title report, which did not identify any easement granting authority to access or operate an underground sewer tunnel on the Lot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 22, 2013, one of Edge's construction managers placed a call, as required by the Underground Facilities Protection Act (\"UFPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-2701\">\n    D.C.
