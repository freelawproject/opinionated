[Record Document 248]. The Plaintiff, Dr. Ralph Slaughter (\"Slaughter\"), opposes the motion. [Record Document 253]. For the reasons stated herein, the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment Based on Res Judicata is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Therefore, Slaughter's remaining claims are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This litigation arises out Plaintiff's previous employment as President of the Southern University System (\"Southern\") and the Board's refusal to extend his employment contract.

The Court will attempt to succinctly set forth the history of the case leading up to this instant ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

On May 18, 2007, while President, Slaughter filed a lawsuit in the 19th Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana against the Board, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, and Board members Dale Atkins (\"Atkins\") and John Joseph. [USDC Docket No. 3:07-cv-00379, Middle District of Louisiana, Record Document 1].

[Record Document 248-3, Ex. B; 248-4, Ex. C]. In the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff agreed to dismiss any and all claims which he had or may have had against the defendants. The Settlement Agreement expressly provided that the original federal lawsuit\n   would be dismissed with prejudice in exchange for the execution of the Employment Contract. [Record Document 248-3, Ex. B \u00b6 4]. The Employment Contract provided in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Board hereby employs Dr. Ralph Slaughter to serve as President of the Southern University System and Secretary to the Board of Supervisors of Southern University ...

Nevertheless, the Board convened on March 27, 2009, and by a vote of eleven to five, declined to extend Slaughter's employment contract beyond its expiration date of June 30, 2009. Within a week of the Board's decision not to extend his employment contract, Slaughter filed three separate lawsuits against the Board and several of its members in both state and federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

R.S. 42:13. [Record Document 248-6, Ex. E]. Therein, Slaughter alleged that the Board, through its members, engaged in secret polling and balloting prior to the official vote in violation of La.

R.S. 23:967. [Record Document 248-8, Ex. G]. Slaughter also made claims under Louisiana tort law for intentional infliction of emotional distress and abuse of rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Slaughter did not name individual members of the Board in this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his petition Slaughter alleged that the Board, through the actions of its members, contacted other members and improperly polled and lobbied for sufficient votes to secure his termination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    at \u00b6 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Slaughter also alleges that at all times Clayton, Montgomery, Anderson, and Atkins were agents of the Board within the meaning of Title VII. [Record Document 42 at \u00b6 17a].

The additions are as follows. First, Clayton admitted to withholding an email between Anderson and a female employee in the original 2007 lawsuit because of Clayton's relationship with the female employee. [Record Document 1 at \u00b6 18]. Next, after Slaughter received a positive job performance evaluation in July 2008, the Board, Clayton, and Montgomery formulated a new evaluation policy that significantly altered how Slaughter would be evaluated in 2009. [Record Document 42 at \u00b6 22a]. Under the new policy, Slaughter would only be evaluated by members of the Board, while under the old policy he was evaluated by faculty, senior administrative staff, the student body, and alumni leadership.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Slaughter alleges that the evaluation policy was deliberately changed before the meeting regarding the expiration of his employment contract in an effort to undermine his performance review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Slaughter contends that the Board, through its members, revised the policy in furtherance of their plan to terminate his employment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also added to the federal lawsuit is an allegation that prior to the March 27, 2009 vote, Clayton met with Domoine Rutledge in February 2009 in Atlanta, Georgia, to secure Rutledge to be the chair of the\n   upcoming search committee for Slaughter's replacement.

It is alleged that on May 5, 2009, after Slaughter filed his state and federal lawsuits, the Board, through its member Walter Dumas, faxed a series of documents to the Baton Rouge Advocate regarding payment of student stipends by the Southern University Foundation to student board member and Student Government Association (\"SGA\") President, Jamal Taylor (\"Taylor\"), in an effort to publicly attack Slaughter and Taylor for Taylor's participation in this litigation. [Record Document 42 at \u00b6 47f]. The inference being that Taylor accepted a bribe for his testimony. The documents were released despite Clayton offering sworn testimony that there was \"nothing wrong\" with the payments and confirming that virtually every past SGA President received similar stipends.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Slaughter also alleges that as a direct result of the released documents to the Baton Rouge Advocate, Taylor received death threats via email.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Also added in the Supplemental and Amending Complaint is an allegation that on June 30, 2009, after the filing of the state and federal lawsuits, Board member Pat Magee contacted the Baton Rouge Advocate, publicly accusing Slaughter of misappropriating office furniture.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47g.

The 19th Judicial District Court dismissed case number 577,011 with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Following the dismissal of suit 577,011, the Board raised the exception of res judicata in the retaliation lawsuit, case 577,092, based on Slaughter's voluntary dismissal with prejudice of case 577,011. On August 20, 2014, after a hearing on the matter, the 19th Judicial District Court issued a final judgment wherein it sustained the Board's exception of res judicata as well as the Board's exception of no cause of action.

The appellate court held that the doctrine of res judicata barred Slaughter's retaliation case, and that Slaughter failed to establish an exceptional circumstance that would offer relief from the bar of res judicata. [Record Document 248-10, Ex. I]. The appellate court noted that both of Slaughter's suits were filed in response to the Board's non-renewal of his employment contract and that all of the facts alleged were known at the time both lawsuits were filed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the appellate court concluded that both suits arose out of the same occurrence and that res judicata barred the parties from relitigating matters that were or could have been raised in the first cause of action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because Slaughter, on his own motion, dismissed his first suit with prejudice without reserving any rights to maintain his second suit, the appellate court found that none of the exceptions to res judicata were applicable in his case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's dismissal with prejudice of Slaughter's retaliation lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Slaughter did not file a writ with the Louisiana Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

On May 26, 2016, following the decision by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeals, a status conference was held to determine the best manner to proceed with the federal litigation in light of the ruling.

The judgment issued by the 19th Judicial District Court in lawsuit 577,092 was clearly titled \"Final Judgment\" and sustained the Board's peremptory exceptions of res judicata and no cause of action.

Thus, the judgment is both final and valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Next, the Court finds that the cause or causes of action asserted in the second suit (this federal lawsuit) existed at the time of the final judgment in the state court litigation. Slaughter filed his state and federal lawsuits on the same date, April 3, 2009. All of the allegations contained within this federal lawsuit, including the additional allegations added in Plaintiff's Supplemental and Amending Complaint, involve alleged bad acts occurring years prior to the entry of the state court's judgment on August 21, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court also finds that the claims asserted in this lawsuit arose out of the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the state court lawsuit. The crux of both lawsuits is the decision of the Board not to extend Slaughter's employment contract in alleged retaliation for Slaughter's previous reporting of sexual harassment and participation in a lawsuit regarding the same. The factual allegations contained in both the state and federal lawsuits, filed on the same day, are strikingly similar. In fact, numerous paragraphs in both lawsuits contain identical language. While the federal and state lawsuits contain different causes of action under state and federal law, and the federal lawsuit includes the addition of individual Board members as defendants, the operative facts in both lawsuits involve the same occurrence or transaction. As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Slaughter's Supplemental and Amended Complaint in this lawsuit contains allegations of retaliatory acts by the Board that were not contained his state court suit. The allegations include the release of information to the local news media post termination, and the termination of individuals who previously testified against the Board. The Court finds that these additional allegations are also part of the same transaction or occurrence contained in the state court lawsuit: the decision of the Board not to extend Slaughter's employment contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Court finds that\n   all of the causes of action against the Board asserted in this case arose out of the same transaction or occurrence as alleged in the state court lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The only remaining element of contention is whether the parties may be considered the same for res judicata purposes. The Board is a party to both lawsuits and would certainly meet the requirement that the parties in the lawsuits be the same. However, Plaintiff argues that this element cannot be met by the individually named defendants because his state court lawsuit was solely against the Board while this lawsuit was brought against the Board and members Atkins, Anderson, Clayton, and Montgomery in their individual and official capacities.

The court noted that Slaughter was not precluded from asserting all of his causes of action in his original Open Meetings lawsuit, case 577,011.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7046168\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/36/272/#p279\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, it found no error in the trial court's dismissal with prejudice of his state retaliation lawsuit, case 577,092, based on res judicata.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7046168\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/36/272/#p279\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This Court is in agreement with the court of appeals that an exception is not warranted. Slaughter had the opportunity to present all of his alleged\n   causes of action in a single state court petition. The fact that he chose to split his causes of action into two cases resulting in res judicata of his retaliation case is not an exceptional circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Accordingly, this Court finds that the final judgment of the 19th Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana bars the Plaintiff from relitigating any claims that arose from the same occurrence as his state court lawsuit. All of the claims contained in this federal lawsuit were part of the same transaction or occurrence of events described in the state court lawsuit, and the Board, Clayton, and Montgomery are in privity with each other. Therefore, Plaintiff's remaining claims must be dismissed because they are precluded under the doctrine of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [Record Document 248] is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   Therefore, Plaintiff's remaining claims against the Defendants are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .

Per the comments, the 2010 amendment was intended \"to improve the procedures for presenting and deciding summary judgment motions and to make the procedures more consistent with those already used in many courts.

[Record Document 158]. Because the current question involves the preclusive effect of a Louisiana state court judgment, this court must apply Louisiana's res judicata principles to determine whether the judgment is a bar to further litigation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hernandez v.

The Oral Reasons for Judgment issued by Judge Timothy Kelley contained the following finding of fact:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n    Now, the weekend prior to his last day, Dr. Slaughter emptied his office and the stadium suite of just about anything that wasn't nailed down, and he even took things that were nailed or screwed to the walls and windows. Clearly, he took a great deal to which he had no claim or right. While this is not a suit for conversion or theft, this fact must be recognized and cannot be understated. Southern University, from the first day after his departure, attempted to inventory and calculate the value of the property inappropriately taken by Dr. Slaughter..... Southern University is justified in seeking a credit or setoff for items paid for with foundation funds which were improperly removed from the campus by Dr. Slaughter, as they became state property upon delivery to Southern University.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    [Record Document 65-2, Ex. A]; affirmed\n    <em>\n     Slaughter v. Board of Supervisors\n    </em>\n    , 2010-1114 (La.
