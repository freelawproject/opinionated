Lead plaintiffs Metzler Asset Management GmbH and Erste-Sparinvest Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH have brought suit, on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons, against biopharmaceutical company Biogen Inc. and three Biogen executives. Plaintiffs contend that class members were harmed when they purchased Biogen's common stock at prices that were artificially inflated by the company's materially misleading statements and omissions about Tecfidera, its leading multiple sclerosis drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The amended complaint relies heavily on statements by 17 former Biogen employees acting as confidential witnesses. It alleges that defendants withheld material information about Tecfidera's safety profile and declining Tecfidera sales, and made misleading positive statements about future revenue. It further asserts that several Biogen executives made 31 materially false misrepresentations and omissions during various earnings calls and conferences over a one-year period between July 23, 2014, and July 23, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint for two principal reasons. First, they contend that plaintiffs' claims are barred by the doctrine of claim preclusion, or\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , in light of this Court's dismissal of a suit raising similar claims in\n   <em>\n    In re: Biogen Inc. Sec. Litig. (\"Biogen I\")\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122022\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/193/5/\">\n    193 F.Supp.3d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. 2016),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276442\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/34/\">\n    857 F.3d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2017). While the claims in this suit are largely identical to those in\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   , because the\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   putative class was never certified, lead plaintiffs in this suit are not bound by this Court's earlier decision. Claim preclusion therefore does not bar this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Second, defendants have moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78u-4, 78u-5. Defendants contend that the complaint fails to set forth plausible allegations that the individual defendants' statements contain actionable misrepresentations or omissions. Specifically, defendants argue that the alleged misrepresentations, including nine that are newly alleged and were not included in the original action, are not adequately alleged to be false at the time they were made. In addition, they contend that the complaint fails to allege specific facts that give rise to a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As the First Circuit has observed, \"[n]ot all claims of wrongdoing by a company make out a viable claim that the company has committed securities fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Fire and Police Pension Ass'n of Colo. v. Abiomed, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051978\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/228/#p231\">\n    778 F.3d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231 (1st Cir. 2015). The amended complaint does not, for example, allege that Biogen's current or historical financial statements are misleading because of fictitious sales, off-label marketing, inventory parking, or any similar act of corporate fraud. Rather, it alleges in substance that Biogen executives made statements about Tecfidera's risks and future sales that were misleading because they were unduly optimistic and minimized the impact of adverse events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although most of the newly alleged misrepresentations do not appear to be actionable, after drawing all reasonable inferences on behalf of plaintiffs, the complaint alleges a plausible claim that at least six statements (or omissions) constitute material misrepresentations-three that are repeated from\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   , and three that are newly alleged. However, the complaint's allegations that defendants acted with the requisite degree of scienter fail to clear the relatively high hurdle of the PSLRA. In other words, even assuming that defendants made a materially false or misleading statement, plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that defendants made those statements with a \"conscious intent to defraud\n   or 'a high degree of recklessness.' \"\n   <em>\n    ACA Fin. Guar. Corp. v. Advest, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071208\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/46/#p58\">\n    512 F.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Aldridge v.

Instead, the most compelling inference that can be drawn from the complaint as a whole is that defendants were, at worst, negligent, or engaged in permissible puffery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Auto.

(Compl. \u00b6 36).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lead plaintiff Erste-Sparinvest Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH (\"Erste-Sparinvest\") is an Austrian investment company located in Vienna, Austria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37). The complaint alleges that Metzler and Erste-Sparinvest purchased Biogen securities at artificially inflated prices during the class period, which is July 23, 2014, through July 23, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 36-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Biogen Inc. is a publicly-traded corporation based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38). It is a biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and markets treatments for certain neurological, autoimmune, and hematological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (\"MS\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48). Biogen's securities trade on NASDAQ under the symbol \"BIIB.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Tecfidera is one of Biogen's four principal drugs for the treatment of MS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48). It is an oral pharmaceutical approved for use in the United States and European Union. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It competes with other oral MS drugs as well as injectable MS treatments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 14, 67). After the FDA approved Tecfidera for use in March 2013, Biogen began selling it in the United States in mid-2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 48). In 2015, the wholesale cost of the drug was approximately $70,000 per patient per year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   From its 2013 launch, Tecfidera was a significant source of revenue for Biogen, and it fueled much of the company's growth. In 2015, Tecfidera was Biogen's highest grossing product, producing $1 billion\n   in revenue more than the second-place product. (Def. Ex. 24 at 16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants have publicly acknowledged Tecfidera's importance to the company. In Biogen's quarterly reports and annual report released during the class period, the company stated that it \"may be substantially dependent on sales from our principal products for many years, including an increasing reliance on sales of [Tecfidera] as we expand into additional markets.\" (Compl. \u00b6 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 22, 2014, Biogen publicly announced, for the first time, that an MS patient who had taken Tecfidera for more than four years as part of a clinical study had died of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (\"PML\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). PML is an infection that is particularly dangerous for individuals with a weakened immune system, including those with low white blood cell counts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A month later, on November 25, 2014, the FDA issued a warning to the public about the patient who died from PML while using Tecfidera. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83). The FDA stated that the patient was not taking any other drugs associated with PML, and it advised physicians and patients to monitor Tecfidera patients for side effects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It further noted that \"[a]s a result, information describing this case of PML ... is being added to the Tecfidera label.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Tecfidera's label was updated in the United States to include the PML risk on December 3, 2014. (Def. Ex. 13 \u00a7 5.2). Tecfidera's original label, dated March 27, 2013, had already disclosed the risk that \"Tecfidera may cause lymphopenia.\" (Def. Ex. 1 at 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On July 24, 2015, Biogen cut its guidance for revenue growth in half, attributing the change to the decline in Tecfidera's recent financial performance. (Compl. \u00b6 159). That day, Biogen's stock price fell over 20%, and there was unusually heavy trading volume in the stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 161).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     New Witness Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The amended complaint alleges claims against Biogen and individual defendants George Scangos (the Chief Executive Officer), Paul Clancy (the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Finance), and Stuart Kingsley (the former Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The complaint essentially alleges that defendants knew from both internal data and discussions with physicians that Tecfidera potentially weakened patients' immune systems and that the PML incident materially affected Tecfidera sales-effects that their public statements fraudulently or recklessly misrepresented and concealed. In support of its allegations, the complaint relies heavily on statements from 17 confidential witnesses (\"CWs\") who were formerly employed by Biogen in various capacities across the country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Many of the confidential witnesses were Biogen Area Business Managers (\"ABMs\"), defined by Biogen as a \"specialty sales representative position [that is] called upon to sell our [n]eurology products [including Tecfidera] with key stakeholders in the [MS] community: including [n]eurologists, allied health professionals, and local MS chapters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68 n. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     New Confidential Witnesses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   offered statements from ten confidential witnesses. The\n   <em>\n    Biogen II\n   </em>\n   complaint adds seven additional confidential witnesses. The statements of the seven new witnesses may be summarized as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   CW 11 was a Biogen senior territory business manager responsible for Pennsylvania from September 2012 to January 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88). His largest client was the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He provided \"several internal Biogen documents that corroborate\" plaintiffs' claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). His \"sales of Tecfidera dropped precipitously immediately after the [PML death] announcement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90). In addition, his 2015 mid-year review quoted an internal Biogen e-mail from \"early 2015 stating that the company was cutting sales goals for Tecfidera ... for the second quarter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   CW 11's Tecfidera sales goals were lowered throughout 2015; by Q3 2015, his sales goal was 44 units, whereas it had been 95 units one year before. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95). By contrast, his sales goal for another Biogen MS drug, Tysabri, remained stable throughout the class period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In mid-2015, CW 11 also received a slide deck titled \"2015 Q2 Quarterly Business Review-Philadelphia West.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97). The slide deck stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   In the oral market Tecfidera is down and Gilenya is up.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Major factors: SAFETY is a major concern at Penn. PML and low lymphocyte counts (in the upwards of 4 months after being [discontinued] ) seem to have the most impact on their use of Tecfidera. In addition, they have seen breakthrough with Tecfidera patients and believe Gilenya is more efficacious. Copaxone is considered their safest alternative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CW 12 was a Biogen ABM responsible for the Atlanta area from March 2009 to July 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68). The complaint does not specify to whom CW 12 reported, although his 2014 year-end review was written by Regional Director Craig Brown. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to the complaint, Brown wrote \"that CW 12's performance took a negative [turn] 'due to a non-commercial event which impacted your number one MS volume and influencer account [Shepherd Center].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Around that time, Brown also wrote that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Dr. Ben Thrower [of the Shepherd Center] and his partners began\n   <strong>\n    removing patients from Tecfidera, and the number of new starts and referrals subsequently plummeted\n   </strong>\n   . Dr. Thrower's actions\n   <strong>\n    began a domino effect in the territory\n   </strong>\n   which caused some of your community based neurologist[s] to also\n   <strong>\n    change their prescribing patterns away from Tecfidera.\n   </strong>\n   At the conclusion of Q3, you fell short of your Tecfidera new patient start goal....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Brown later added, \"your Atlanta South territory is one of [the] few in the nation that has a BIIB [Biogen] share above 50%.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   CW 13 was a Biogen employee located in the company's Raleigh, North Carolina office from September 2012 to July 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124). His titles during that time period included MS Case Manager, Active Support Coordinator, and Patient Services Coordinator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As an MS Case Manager, he supported Biogen's MS sales team. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He was at least five managerial levels below the named defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). CW 13 stated that immediately following the PML death, \"new start[s]\" of Tecfidera dropped and there were regular meetings with his immediate supervisors to discuss turning around the situation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125). CW 13 further believed that senior company executives had extensive sales reports on key metrics, and received them on at least a quarterly basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   CW 14 was a Biogen ABM responsible for parts of New York and Pennsylvania from July 2012 to February 2016. He was five managerial levels below Kingsley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126). CW 14 recalled \"lots of discontinuations\" of existing Tecfidera patients immediately after the PML death was announced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127). He further stated that there were non-regularly scheduled conference calls in the \"East Division,\" in which his territories were located, following the PML announcement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129). Such calls were attended by ABMs from his division, and many reported declining Tecfidera sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   CW 15 was a Biogen employee located in the company's Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters from February 2012 to November 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60). He was the Manager of Medical Research in Global Medical and previously served as a medical affairs scientist, scientific writer, and senior scientific writer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He was five reporting levels below Scangos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   CW 15 stated that when he was a senior scientific writer (August 2013 to July 2014), he worked on a prepared response \"for any PML case associated with Tecfidera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61). According to him, the company's marketing and communication departments decided to prepare a response to such an incident soon after Tecfidera's approval and release to the public in 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He stated that \"a Tecfidera-linked PML case was a matter of 'when, not if.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The prepared response was approved by \"G8,\" which was Scangos's term for his senior executive leadership team, approximately three months before the first PML case linked to Tecfidera was reported. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   CW 16 was a former Senior Vice President for Biogen's Worldwide Medical Organization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142). He was the Head of Medical Affairs from January 2014 to March 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He stated that Biogen senior executives knew of \"external communication measures\" that the company's medical teams were undertaking in response to the PML death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   CW 17 was a former Executive Territory Business Manager and Field Trainer for Biogen from September 2007 to November 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130). He reported to Regional Director Karen Grant.

Their new statements may be summarized as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   CW 1 was a Biogen ABM responsible for parts of southern Florida and Puerto Rico from November 2010 to June 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was five reporting levels below Scangos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to CW 1, by December 2014, Biogen's neurologist customers were taking their patients off Tecfidera. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101). He stated that Tecfidera had some immune-suppressive properties and that after the PML death, the drug was considered an immune-suppressive agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Similar to other ABMs, CW 1's sales of Tecfidera declined toward the end of 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102). He first became aware of \"a severe drop in Tecfidera sales\" when there were \"emergency\" Biogen conference calls in December 2014 and January 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103). These calls were led by Senior Vice President of U.S. Commercial Joe Ciaffoni and Senior Sales Director Keith Ferguson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). CW 1 recalled that slide decks were distributed in advance of these calls, and that they showed an increase in discontinuations nationally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition, CW 1 personally saw a decline in Tecfidera sales in his area, including his largest customer, the MS Center at the University of Miami. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104). He also spoke with other ABMs, who similarly stated that Tecfidera prescriptions were down at other MS treatment centers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   CW 3, like CW 1, was a Biogen ABM responsible for parts of southern Florida and Puerto Rico from May 2012 to June 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108). He was also five reporting levels below Scangos. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). CW 3 saw a decline in prescriptions of Tecfidera after the PML announcement, and recalled neurologists at the University of Miami telling him in November 2014 that they \"were not going to write Tecfidera prescriptions for new patients unless the patient specifically asked to be put on Tecfidera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Beginning in January 2015, he participated in regularly scheduled conference calls for the Southeast Region, during which other ABMs also reported large declines in Tecfidera sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 109, 113).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Both CW 1 and CW 3 stated that Biogen instructed ABMs \"to downplay the significance of the PML death in order to convince doctors to continue to prescribe Tecfidera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 110-11). In particular, \"medical science liaisons\" made appointments with neurologists to discuss the PML death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110). These meetings reflected Biogen's efforts at \"damage control.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   CW 7 was a Biogen ABM responsible for parts of Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland from April 2011 to June 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119). CW 7 reported to a regional sales manager, who reported to the Senior Sales Director-East.

He further recalled attending a National Sales Meeting in\n   March 2015, during which declining Tecfidera sales were discussed and acknowledged. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   CW 8 was the senior director of commercial operations for Biogen, a position \"equivalent to chief of staff for the head of commercial operations,\" from August 2014 to November 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122). CW8 reported to the Senior Vice President of U.S. Commercial.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63). Between 2010 and 2013, he was involved in a clinical trial that Biogen conducted for Tecfidera. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He also serves as a clinical instructor of neurology at Emory University, and as a Senior Medical Advisor to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Shepherd Center was the \"leading prescriber of Tecfidera in the United States among MS centers\" as of August 1, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65). On that date, the Shepherd Center had approximately 400 patients taking Tecfidera. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, during spring 2014, the center had begun monitoring for possible side effects of MS patients taking Tecfidera by taking additional blood tests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Doctors noted that \"there was an elevated risk of developing low lymphocyte counts among patients on Tecfidera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In August 2014, Dr. Thrower notified Biogen employees Keith Ferguson, a senior sales director, and Eric Hall, a medical science liaison, that Tecfidera was causing declining lymphocyte counts in about 30% of patients taking Tecfidera. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Afterward, physicians at the Shepherd Center stopped prescribing Tecfidera for new MS patients, and discontinued it for at least half of the 400 patients already taking the drug. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67). The center informed Ferguson, Hall, and an individual named Todd Burks of this development. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Dr. Scott Zamvil is a neurologist at the University of California-San Francisco Medical Center who specializes in MS treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69). He has conducted extensive research and published studies about MS and MS treatments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He recalled Shepherd Center doctors telling him in summer 2014 about the lymphocyte-count decline in patients taking Tecfidera. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70). In addition, he recalled Dr. Guy Buckle of the Shepherd Center telling him in March 2015 that the center had alerted Biogen about its findings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Dr. Zamvil also asserts that he was one among many doctors who went through \"Biogen brainwashing\" concerning Tecfidera's safety profile. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71). After the drug was launched in spring 2013, he prescribed it for many of his MS patients, believing it was a safe option. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, in February 2015, he conducted his own study, and like the Shepherd Center, found that Tecfidera lowered patients' lymphocyte counts and left them susceptible to PML. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   His findings were published\n   in an article released on February 12, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Following the PML death and the release of his study, Dr. Zamvil stopped prescribing Tecfidera and discontinued the drug for many of his patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Overview of the Class Period Timeline\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case have alleged an extended class period: the\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   class period was from December 2, 2014, to July 23, 2015, but the\n   <em>\n    Biogen II\n   </em>\n   class period is from July 23, 2014, to July 23, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The complaint alleges that \"[o]n July 23, 2014, the first day of the class period ... Biogen held an earnings call with analysts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 166). Defendants Scangos, Clancy, and Kingsley participated in the earnings call. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). That same day, Biogen also issued a press release touting its 2014 second-quarter financial results, increasing its \"full-year financial guidance\" because of \"the growth of Tecfidera in the U.S. and the E.U.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 170-71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Another press release was issued on September 11, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 176). Like the July 23 press release, this statement \"continued to extol the safety profile of Tecfidera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, on October 22, 2014, Biogen released third-quarter 2014 financial results and announced the PML incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 178). CFO Clancy spoke on an investor conference call on December 2, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 192-93). CEO Scangos spoke during a healthcare conference on January 12, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 194-95).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On January 29, 2015, Biogen announced fourth-quarter results, reporting Tecfidera revenues of $916 million, up 16.4 percent from the third quarter, which was 34.7 percent of total Biogen revenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 143). As part of its practice to issue projected revenue guidance twice per year, defendants projected annual Biogen revenue growth of 14 percent to 16 percent for 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144). Biogen's stock rose 0.6 percent on January 29, 2015, and 10.2 percent the next day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 209). Scangos, Clancy, and Kingsley all spoke during the earnings call. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 197-208). Analysts reacted positively to Biogen's fourth-quarter earnings and defendants' statements during the call. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 210-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   After fourth-quarter earnings, Kingsley spoke during a February 25, 2015 healthcare conference. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 147-49). Scangos also spoke during a March 2, 2015 healthcare conference. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 257).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On April 24, 2015, Biogen released disappointing 2015 first-quarter earnings, announcing Tecfidera revenues of $825 million, which were below the market's consensus estimates and a 9.9 percent decrease from the previous quarter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150). On a company level, Biogen's total revenue decreased 3.2 percent from the previous quarter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48). The complaint alleges that the earnings call on April 24 was the \"first time [that] defendants partially acknowledged that the PML death was impacting Tecfidera sales.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150). In response, Biogen's stock price decreased 6.6 percent on April 24. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, maintaining their practice of providing revenue guidance only twice a year, defendants did not change the projected annual revenue growth for Biogen of 14 to 16 percent that they had released after announcing fourth-quarter results in January. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151). Instead, Clancy stated, \"If [Tecfidera's] U.S. trajectory does not improve, we may come in at the lower end of our previously provided [annual] revenue growth.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 222).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   After announcing first-quarter earnings, Clancy spoke during a healthcare conference on May 6, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 227-28). A week later, Executive Vice President of R &amp; D Doug Williams (not a named defendant in this action) spoke during a May 13 healthcare conference. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 229-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Two weeks later, Clancy spoke during a May 27 strategic-decisions conference. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 231-33). On May 27, 2015, Biogen's stock price increased 2.5 percent from the previous day, closing at $402.92. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On July 24, 2015, the day after the end of the class period, Biogen released second-quarter earnings. It announced Tecfidera revenue of $883 million, a 7.1 percent increase from the first quarter, but still less than the $916 million in revenue earned during the fourth quarter of 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48). Biogen's total revenue increased 1.4 percent from the first quarter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At that point, Biogen revised its full-year 2015 revenue guidance, stating that \"[r]evenue growth is expected to be approximately 6 percent to 8 percent compared to 2014 [down from the January estimate of 14 percent to 16 percent], a decrease from prior guidance based largely on revised expectations for the growth of Tecfidera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 159). \"Our balance of year forecast assumes limited patient growth for Tecfidera in the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   During the earnings call, Scangos stated, \"We had expected to see a reacceleration of Tecfidera, but that did not happen to any appreciable extent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 236). Kingsley also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   We believe the safety event reported in late 2014 has created greater caution on the part of both physicians and patients about switching to orals.

An analyst asked \"when you thought about Tecfidera and flat sales, how much-to what extent do you think there will be people stopping [the] drug versus just minimal growth?\" Williams responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [We didn't expect] a modest but not trivial increase in discontinuations in Tec[fidera] in the United States [in particular].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 239).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The market and analysts reacted negatively, and Biogen's stock price decreased $85, or 22 percent, on July 24. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 237-45). The 22 percent decline occurred on unusually heavy trading volume, with 16.6 million shares traded compared with an average daily trading volume over the class period of 1.6 million shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   After the class period, during a September 18, 2015 healthcare conference, Kingsley stated \"[i]t was clear to us that we were going to get a-some kind of a downtick in the safety profile that would have some kind of an impact on physician behavior, but we couldn't tell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 163). He added that \"the [Tecfidera] label was so clean [before the PML incident], the first PML event was a pretty big change statement for a broad base of physicians who were very comfortable with having essentially no safety issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   On October 9, 2015, Biogen announced that Kingsley was leaving the company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 164). Twelve days later, the company announced that it would eliminate approximately 11 percent of its workforce.

In addition, the complaint states Kingsley \"admitted after the class period that defendants knew the PML death had led to a significant change to the safety profile and physicians' views of Tecfidera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     April 24, 2015-Williams on Earnings Call\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   On April 24, 2015, Biogen held its first-quarter earnings call.

(Compl. \u00b6 226). The complaint further alleges that Biogen was aware of Dr. Zamvil's February 2015 study showing Tecfidera lowered patients' lymphocyte counts, leaving them susceptible to PML. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Additional Scienter Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In addition to the statements from the confidential witnesses and Drs. Thrower and Zamvil, the complaint includes other allegations that plaintiffs contend bolster the inference that defendants had the requisite scienter (that is, that they had the conscious intent to defraud investors or acted with a high degree of recklessness).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   First, the complaint alleges that because the individual defendants made several specific statements concerning Tecfidera sales, they were receiving specific information\n   regarding the drug and either fabricated the information they provided to investors or deliberately ignored the information they possessed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 249-250).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Second, the complaint contends that Tecfidera was Biogen's main revenue source throughout the class period, accounting for approximately one-third of the company's total revenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 251).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the company's SEC filings and public statements, defendants repeatedly stated that Tecfidera was the company's \"principal product,\" \"major business driver\" and \"largest contributor to overall revenue growth.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 254-56). The complaint reasons that the individual defendants were necessarily aware of facts concerning Tecfidera's safety profile, new starts, and discontinuation rates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 258). It also alleges that Kingsley, as a result of his close proximity to Biogen's sales force, \"was aware of, or was reckless in not being aware of, the fact that safety-related concerns had materially impacted Tecfidera sales and caused physicians to stop prescribing Tecfidera and switch patients to other therapies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 259).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Third, the complaint contends that because Biogen's products are highly regulated by American and foreign government entities, it can be inferred that defendants \"closely monitored the Company's 'most critical business activities,' including 'adverse event reporting' and 'product risk management,' as they pertained to Tecfidera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 262).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Fourth, the complaint alleges that the \"disparity between Defendants' words to the market and the actual state of affairs within Biogen further supports a strong inference of scienter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 263).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Finally, the complaint contends that two post-class period events augment a strong inference of scienter. Kingsley abruptly left Biogen in October 2015, and the complaint suggests that his departure was linked to declining Tecfidera sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 266). In addition, Scangos took a substantial pay cut between 2014, when he received a bonus of more than $4 million, and 2015, when he received only $1.2 million in compensation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 267). The complaint suggests that Scangos's pay was linked to Tecfidera sales, creating a clear motive for him to conceal the truth about the drug's safety profile and financial performance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The complaint in\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   was filed on August 18, 2015. On November 18, 2015, the Court appointed GBR Group, Ltd. as lead plaintiff in that case. An amended complaint was filed on January 19, 2016. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint with prejudice on March 1, 2016, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) and (12)(b)(6), and the PSLRA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78u-4, 78u-5. The Court granted the motion on June 23, 2016, finding that three statements identified by plaintiffs were plausibly misleading or false. However, the complaint failed to give rise to a \"strong\" inference of scienter required by the PSLRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   After the court's dismissal, the\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs filed a proposed second amended complaint on July 21, 2016.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169). That argument fails for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   First, a reasonable investor would conclude that Tecfidera sales were in fact on a \"solid trajectory\" in July 2014; between Q1 and Q2 2014, Tecfidera and overall company revenues increased 38.5% and 13.7%, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48). Tecfidera sales had almost quadrupled between its release in Q2 2013 and Q2 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following quarter, the drug's growth slowed, but Tecfidera revenue still increased by 12.4%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs have not provided any data that contradicts defendants' statements on this date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Second, and perhaps more importantly, the complaint contains no allegations that\n   defendants and other Biogen executives were aware in July 2014 of the Shepherd Center's concerns about \"blood work [ ] conducted on MS patients taking Tecfidera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169). In fact, the complaint states that Dr. Thrower did not even notify Biogen that \"Tecfidera was causing this impact\" until \"approximately August 2014.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66).\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   These statements are thus not actionable misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Statement 3-Q2 2014 Press Release\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The complaint further alleges the following excerpt from Biogen's July 23, 2014 press release was misleading:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   This past quarter highlighted significant accomplishments across our business, from the approval of Eloctate for hemophilia A,\n   <strong>\n    to the continued patient uptake of Tecfidera in the U.S.\n   </strong>\n   and new markets worldwide, to strong clinical results for important emerging MS treatments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6 170). Plaintiffs contend that the statement was misleading because Biogen \"knew that the Shepherd Center\" and \"other neurologists\" \"had already begun taking patients off of Tecfidera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 172).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Again, there is a \"significant timing problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276442\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/34/\">\n    857 F.3d at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The complaint specified that Dr. Thrower did not inform anyone at Biogen about Tecfidera's impact on lymphocyte counts until August 2014, at least one week after the July 23, 2014 press release. (Compl. \u00b6 66). In addition, Biogen financials indicate that there was \"continued patient update\" throughout the first half of 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48). Therefore, this statement is similarly not an actionable misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Statement 4-Q3 2014 Press Release\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Next, the complaint alleges that the following quote by Chief Medical Officer Sandrock from Biogen's September 11, 2014 press release was misleading:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   Tecfidera continues to provide patients with effective oral treatment for MS that is supported by a growing body of data reinforcing its benefits and favorable safety profile.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 176). It is plausible that this statement was false or misleading, because by that date Dr. Thrower had informed Biogen about Tecfidera's impact on patients' immune systems in 30% of Shepherd Center patients taking the drug. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 177).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   It is true that there are other inferences that can be drawn from Sandrock's statement. For example, other physicians and institutions more generally may not have had similar safety concerns about Tecfidera. The complaint does not allege that corroborating evidence confirming the effect of Tecfidera on lymphocyte counts existed until February 2015, when Dr. Zamvil conducted his own independent study. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). The complaint does not state what percentage of MS patients taking Tecfidera nationwide were treated at the Shepherd Center. And Tecfidera's label already included a warning that the drug would reduce lymphocyte counts in March 2013, well before the class period began. (Def. Ex. 1 \u00a7 5.1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless,\n   drawing all reasonable inferences on behalf of plaintiffs, there is a sufficient basis to conclude that this statement was a material misrepresentation or omission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Statements 5 and 6-Kingsley on Earnings Call\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Kingsley made the following allegedly false or misleading statements during the Q3 earnings call on October 22, 2014:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   <em>\n    Question:\n   </em>\n   Maybe for Tony [Scangos] or Paul [Clancy] on Tecfidera, looks like the growth on a quarter on quarter basis either absolute dollars or percentage basis, it looks a little bit lower in Q3 than, say, over any of the last four or five prior quarters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   Was there anything one time nature that you want to call out?

First, Tecfidera revenue for the first quarter of 2015 did not just experience slowing growth; it actually decreased $91 million, or 9.9 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48). Second, multiple confidential witnesses stated that there were \"emergency\" nationwide Biogen conference calls in late 2014 and early 2015 to address declining Tecfidera sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 103, 109). Third, confidential witnesses stated that in early 2015, \"physicians were transferring patients off Tecfidera and onto different therapies.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115). Fourth, after the class period, during the Q2 2015 earnings call on July 24, 2015, Biogen's executive vice president of research and development stated that there was \"a modest but not trivial increase in discontinuations in Tec[fidera] in the United States in particular.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 239).\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Kingsley's statement suggested that new starts and switches remained positive and consistent with historical numbers, it is at least plausible that this statement was false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that during that same earnings call, Kingsley made the following allegedly false or misleading statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   On Tecfidera-look.

First, the complaint alleges that by April 2015, Biogen was aware not only of Dr. Thrower's findings at the Shepherd Center, but also of Dr. Zamvil's study confirming that Tecfidera reduced lymphocyte counts in patients. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 63-67, 69-74). Second, at least one ABM reported that Tecfidera sales declined in Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 due to safety concerns with the drug. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 93-97). Third, as discussed earlier, Tecfidera sales declined in Q1 2015 by $91 million, or 9.9 percent, from the previous quarter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48). And fourth, several Biogen executives made statements on the last day of the class period suggesting that physicians became wary of prescribing Tecfidera in the wake of the PML death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 236-40).\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Drawing\n   all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs' favor, it is plausible that this statement was materially false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   <strong>\n    7.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   In summary, the majority of the newly alleged statements do not appear to be actionable under the PSLRA, whether considered separately or taken as a whole.

The first relies on allegations of 17 confidential witnesses and Drs. Thrower and Zamvil to establish that defendants intentionally or recklessly misled investors about the risk Tecfidera posed to lymphocyte counts and the subsequent impact of the PML death. The second component, referred to as \"additional scienter allegations\" in the complaint, includes allegations that defendants must have known the true state of Tecfidera sales, because they made numerous statements concerning Tecfidera's discontinuation rates and safety profile. Among other things, the complaint alleges that Tecfidera's status as Biogen's most important\n   product, or part of its \"core operations,\" contributes to an inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Defendants counter with proposed inferences that (1) Tecfidera's risks were known in summer 2014 and that sales growth began to slow in late 2014-facts that defendants disclosed both before and throughout the class period-and (2) the PML death-again, a risk that they disclosed-had a greater and longer-lasting impact on Tecfidera than they anticipated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   There is little doubt that plaintiffs' allegations of scienter are plausible. That is not, however, the relevant question; rather, it is whether the allegations support a \"strong inference\" of scienter, as the law requires. As set forth below, the allegations of the confidential witnesses and Drs. Thrower and Zamvil are not sufficient to support a strong inference of scienter on their own, and the complaint's \"additional scienter allegations\" add little and are not sufficient to tip the balance. Accordingly, and for the following reasons, the complaint's allegations are insufficient to support a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Confidential Witness Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   The confidential-witness allegations, although multiple and generally corroborative, are insufficient to support a strong inference of scienter.

According to the ABMs, the following occurred around late 2014 and early 2015: sales \"dropped precipitously;\" sales \"took a negative\"; sales \"dropped steeply and immediately\"; there was a \"large drop in new prescription sales\"; there was a \"sharp decline\" in sales; \"sales dropped dramatically\"; there was \"a large drop in new prescription sales\"; there was a \"big slowdown\" in market expansion; there was a \"serious downturn\" in \"start forms\"; \"new prescriptions significantly slowed down\"; sales \"took a hit\"; and new prescriptions came to a \"screeching halt.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68, 90, 100, 108, 114, 116-19, 127).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Those allegations do not set forth\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   facts about the sales, such as a measurement of the sales decline, why sales were declining, whether the decline was due to lower new starts and switches or\n   higher discontinuations, or how the sales decline affected the company's financial guidance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coyne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227474\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/943/259/#p267\">\n    943 F.Supp.2d at 266-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that \"vague (and largely conclusory) allegations of struggling sales, problems with production, and difficulty retaining repeat clients\" were insufficient to demonstrate that company was \"\n   <em>\n    incapable\n   </em>\n   of meeting its predicted target\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276442\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/34/\">\n    857 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   45 n.9 (stating that CW 11's statements were \"inadequate\" to prove scienter). At most, the CW statements are generalized comments that Tecfidera sales dropped in Q4 2014 after the PML death was announced, and that in response Biogen attempted to address physicians' concerns with the drug, convened meetings and/or sales calls to discuss the situation, and lowered its marketing team's sales goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   The other newly presented CWs-CW 13 and CWs 15 through 17-also offer no substantive information that would lead to a strong inference of scienter. Like the ABMs, CWs 13, 15, and 17 were five levels removed from the named defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   CW 13 and 17's statements merely echo what the ABMs already stated: namely, that after the PML death, Tecfidera sales dropped and Biogen executives were aware of that development. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 125, 130, 134). CW 15's statement that in 2013 Scangos's \"G8\" prepared a public statement for a potential PML-related death does not contradict defendants' public statements, particularly where Tecfidera's label already included a lymphopenia warning back in March 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61; Def. Ex. 1 \u00a7 5.1). Likewise, although the complaint suggests that CW 16 was fewer reporting levels removed from the named defendants, the fact that senior company executives were aware of \"external communication measures\" in response to the PML death adds little to the scienter analysis. (Compl. \u00b6 142).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that requiring them to allege more would require them to plead evidence of fraud. But particularized facts about the Biogen's misrepresentation of Tecfidera's safety profile and sales decline after the PML death (and more specifically, discontinuations) are necessary here, where defendants specifically included the lymphopenia risk on the Tecfidera label in March 2013 and warned investors about slowing Tecfidera growth throughout the class period. Taken altogether, the CW statements do not \"purport to contradict any of the financial information released by Biogen in its quarterly and yearly reports.\"\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276442\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/34/\">\n    857 F.3d at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, on October 22, 2014-before the PML death had any impact on Tecfidera sales, and while revenues were still growing at a healthy rate-Kingsley warned the market about Tecfidera's slowing growth: \"We have always expected Tecfidera's growth rate would moderate over time. I think we are seeing a natural case of that.\" (Def. Ex. 8 at 8). On January 29, 2015, during the same call that Biogen announced record annual and quarterly revenue for Tecfidera (and the company as a whole), Kingsley stated that he was seeing slowing Tecfidera sales due, in part, to the PML death:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-249\">\n   As you may have seen through IMS, we observed moderating new starts for Tecfidera, including a decline in the overall market switch rate,\n   <em>\n    the U.S. label update in December\n   </em>\n   , and the recent\n   launch of Plegridy, which is capturing some interferon switches that otherwise may have gone to Tecfidera.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-250\">\n   Importantly, we have not noticed a meaningful change in Tecfidera discontinuation rates ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   (Def. Ex. 15 at 5) (emphasis added). On February 25, 2015-the same day that the complaint alleges he intentionally or recklessly misled investors about Tecfidera's discontinuation rates-Kingsley again noted the \"slowing of the growth rate,\" told investors that the PML death was a \"meaningful event that [Biogen] ha[s] to manage through,\" and stated that he thought Tecfidera was \"resilient\" in the face of \"hesitancy\" among physicians. (Def. Ex. 17 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   In other words, absent more particularized details and stripped of their generalities, the confidential-witness allegations about Tecfidera sales are not clearly inconsistent with what defendants were publicly disclosing to the market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.J.

But ... on the crucial question of when cancellations began piling up, [defendant's] statement and the confidential witness' description of cancellations increasing 'suddenly' in 'late summer' are not in conflict.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) ). Accordingly, the relatively vague statements of the confidential witnesses, absent more particularized details, lend support to an inference of scienter, but not a strong one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276442\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/34/\">\n    857 F.3d at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The statements do not even begin to quantify the magnitude of the sales decline at the company level.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   New allegations attributable to Drs. Thrower and Zamvil do not affect the outcome of this analysis. In substance, Dr. Thrower states that Shepherd Center personnel noted that MS patients taking Tecfidera had a higher risk of developing lower lymphocyte counts. (Compl. \u00b6 65). In August 2014, Dr. Thrower notified two Biogen employees, Keith Ferguson and Eric Hall, of this development. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66). Putting aside the fact that Dr. Thrower had no contact with Scangos, Clancy, or Kingsley, the risk of Tecfidera reducing patients' lymphocyte counts had already been disclosed nearly 18 months before. (Def. Ex. 1 \u00a7 5.1). The risk was also disclosed in various SEC filings. (Def. Ex. 3 at 22 (2013 Form 10-K); Ex. 4 at 50 (2014 Q1 Form 10-Q); Ex. 6 at 52-53 (2014 Q2 Form 10-Q); Ex. 16 at 25 (2014 Form 10-K) ). In addition, while approximately 200 patients at the Shepherd Center discontinued using Tecfidera, there were more than 100,000 patients worldwide taking the drug. (Compl. \u00b6 67; Def. Ex. 8 at 3). The number of discontinued Shepherd Center patients thus constituted less than 0.2% of all Tecfidera patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Dr. Zamvil's statements fail to support a strong inference of scienter for similar reasons. Dr. Zamvil alleged that he spoke with Shepherd Center doctors in summer 2014 about the risk Tecfidera posed to patients' lymphocyte counts. (Compl. \u00b6 70). He then conducted his own study in February 2015 confirming the findings, and discontinued the drug for many of his patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-74). While those allegations certainly corroborate those of Dr. Thrower, they again do not contradict defendants' public statements, particularly where Dr. Zamvil never spoke with defendants and failed to quantify the number of discontinued patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   The allegations that there were conference calls concerning declining Tecfidera sales, a March 2015 national sales meeting, and Biogen's lowering of employees' sales goals likewise add relatively little to the inference of scienter. The complaint alleges that CW 3 and CW 14 participated in conference calls during which ABMs reported lower Tecfidera sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 113, 129). The complaint further alleges that CWs 1, 3, and 7 attended a national sales meeting in March 2015 (after Kingsley's statements about the discontinuation rates, and well after the company's January projections). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112, 114, 121). According to the allegations, unidentified \"senior Biogen leaders\" at the meeting acknowledged that the PML death \"definitely was impacting Tecfidera sales,\" an unidentified person described the death as a \"market event,\" and an unidentified person stated that \"sales [presumably of Tecfidera] would need to pick up again if [Biogen] was going to meet expected 14-16% revenue growth.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112, 114).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Missing from those allegations are any details about the magnitude of the impact on sales, the change in the discontinuation rate, who made the statements, or whether any of the defendants attended the meeting. The allegations also support an inference that Tecfidera growth was slowing due to a number of factors, including the PML death, as defendants disclosed. CWs 1, 5, and 11 allege that Biogen lowered sales goals for ABMs around January 2015, and that a Biogen vice-president sent an e-mail stating that the adjustment was due to \"lower guidance due to unforeseen market events.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-96, 138-39). A \"concealed change in company policy might, depending on the circumstances, assist an inference of scienter.\"\n   <em>\n    Auto. Indus. Pension Trust Fund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892389\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/34/#p39\">\n    682 F.3d at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, there are no allegations that defendants took any steps to conceal the change, and again, the allegations do not include particularized details about the magnitude of the change or defendants' involvement in it. Biogen's efforts to assist its sales employees to reach compensation goals while also warning the market about slowing Tecfidera growth do not warrant a strong inference of fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Finally, the complaint alleges that CW 2 attended a November 2014 Biogen \"town hall\" meeting led by Scangos. According to CW 2, Scangos's presentation stated that \"the overall sense of the trajectory [at Biogen] was changing,\" and another presentation addressed \"potential organizational changes as a result of the PML death.\" (Compl. \u00b6 107). Again, those allegations are consistent with competing inferences. CW 2 does not explain what the potential changes were, or any details about how Biogen's \"trajectory\" was changing. Even viewing CW 2's allegations in light of the entire complaint, they require the Court to make several assumptions to piece together an inference of fraudulent intent or recklessness, let alone a compelling one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Moreover, those allegations are consistent with the competing inference of a lack of scienter. Biogen had experienced meteoric revenue growth in 2014, and in November 2014 it was only weeks away from announcing 232 percent annual revenue growth for Tecfidera. Nevertheless, the \"trajectory\" of Tecfidera's growth was changing, as the company disclosed beginning in October 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 8 at 8). Kingsley, in response to question about moderating Tecfidera growth in the third quarter of 2014, stated: \"As always[,] a little probably difficult to predict exactly, but look, we have always expected Tecfidera's growth rate would moderate over time. I think we are seeing a natural case of that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Also, during the same January 2015 call in which Biogen announced that annual Tecfidera revenue had more than doubled, Kingsley explicitly acknowledged that the PML announcement was having an impact on performance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Ex. 15 at 5) (\"We believe several factors have\n   <em>\n    impacted\n   </em>\n   the recent performance of Tecfidera, including a decline in the overall market switch rate, the US label update in December ....\" (emphasis added) ). He also addressed Biogen's sales approach after the PML announcement, an approach that could be reasonably inferred to mean \"organizational changes\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   I think the\n   <em>\n    educational initiatives\n   </em>\n   are underway, which is, we have sales forces out, talking to a broad set of physicians. Our medical team is providing support where there are requests. So I think we are [executing on this]-educating people to the label and what the label says. And answering those questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   In short, the various allegations of the confidential witnesses and Drs. Thrower and Zamvil, taken as a whole, certainly support a plausible inference of scienter. However, without more, they are not sufficient to support a\n   <em>\n    strong\n   </em>\n   inference of scienter, as the law requires, and they are consistent with the competing non-fraudulent inferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Additional Scienter Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   The complaint's \"additional\" scienter allegations do not add much, if anything, to the new confidential witness allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleges that defendants had both the motive and opportunity to misrepresent Tecfidera's growth projections. However, some of the allegations make little sense in the factual context of Biogen's purported fraud, and they are otherwise too generic to support an inference of scienter. \" '[C]atch-all allegations' which merely assert motive and opportunity, without something more, fail to satisfy the PSLRA.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cabletron Sys.\n   </em>\n   , 311 F.3d at 39 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Greebel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11555852\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/194/185/#p188\">\n    194 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   197 ). Instead, motive and opportunity allegations must state \"more than the usual concern by executives to improve financial results.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11555852\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/194/185/#p188\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   First, plaintiffs contend that specific statements made by the individual defendants \"reflect\" that they received \"specific information regarding Tecfidera.\" (Compl. \u00b6 250). Therefore, plaintiffs suggest that defendants \"either fabricated the information they provided to investors and the market or they deliberately ignored information they possessed or had access to relating to such matters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This is plainly a conclusory assertion that lacks the specific allegations necessary to support an inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Second, the complaint restates the \"core operations\" allegations from\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   . The\n   complaint alleges that because Tecfidera was Biogen's main revenue source during the class period, accounting for approximately one-third of total company revenue, defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that their statements about Tecfidera were misleading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 251-59). Certainly, under\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   , the \"core operations\" allegations and Tecfidera's importance to Biogen must be taken into account as part of the Court's assessment of the scienter allegations. However, courts have been hesitant to apply significant weight to \"core operations\" allegations without other significant evidence of a defendant's intent or recklessness, or a \"plus factor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re A123 Sys., Inc.

Plaintiffs further allege that the \"patent inconsistencies between Defendants' public pronouncements and what was known internally within Biogen provide further evidence of scienter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 265). Here, plaintiffs again offer merely conclusory allegations and fail to provide any further specifics necessary to support a strong inference of scienter where defendants disclosed Tecfidera's risks and sales data to investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs allege that two post-class period developments support an inference of scienter. First, Kingsley \"abruptly left his position at Biogen only two months after the company's July 2015 admissions concerning Tecfidera.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 266). Second, Scangos \"took a substantial pay cut due, in large part, to the performance of Tecfidera during 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 267). Plaintiffs reason that there was \"a clear motive for Scangos to conceal the truth about the drug's safety profile, as his compensation was tied directly to Tecfidera's success in the marketplace.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Neither supports a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   The complaint fails to plead with any particularity that Kinglsey's employment was terminated because of declining Tecfidera sales. Accordingly, this allegation alone cannot support an inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abrams v. Baker Hughes, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9416158\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/424/\">\n    292 F.3d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434 n.28 (5th Cir. 2002) (\"Scienter may not be inferred from resignation of company officials 'for personal reasons.' \") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   In addition, the allegation concerning Scangos's compensation makes little sense in this context. Even though plaintiffs suggest that Scangos had an incentive to pump up Tecfidera sales, and by extension Biogen's stock price, by concealing the risk of lymphopenia, that risk was disclosed by defendants well before the start of the class period. Furthermore, the complaint largely reiterates the argument from\n   <em>\n    Biogen I\n   </em>\n   that defendants attempted to minimize the PML death's effects on Tecfidera sales. However, it does not allege that Biogen's revenue\n   <em>\n    reporting\n   </em>\n   was false or misleading in any way. Instead, the complaint alleges that Biogen's future revenue\n   <em>\n    projections\n   </em>\n   were misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   In sum, the complaint's \"additional\" allegations of motive, opportunity, and \"core product,\" taken as a whole, do not make the complaint's otherwise plausible inference of scienter strong enough to satisfy the PSLRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Opposing Inferences\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   Based on the complaint as a whole, plaintiffs' asserted inference of scienter may be plausible, but it is not strong, cogent, or compelling.

Ex. 8 at 3). During the same call, Kingsley responded to an analyst's question (about third-quarter Tecfidera growth being the lowest of the previous five quarters) by noting that growth was moderating and difficult to predict. (Compl. \u00b6 183; Def. Ex. 8 at 7-8) (\"As always a little probably difficult to predict exactly, but look, we have always expected Tecfidera's growth rate would moderate over time.

(Def. Ex. 12 at 2-4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 29, 2015, after announcing record quarterly revenue for Tecfidera, Kingsley stated that the company had observed \"moderating new starts for Tecfidera in the fourth quarter\" and that it \"believe[d] several factors have impacted the recent performance of Tecfidera, including a decline in the overall market switch rate, [and] the U.S. label update in December ....\" (Compl. \u00b6 199; Def. Ex. 15 at 5). He also stated that the reasons for slowing growth were \"[a]ctually hard to piece apart.\" (Compl. \u00b6 200; Def. Ex. 15 at 11-13). In the same breath that he stated that he did not \"believe\" he was seeing a \"meaningful change\" in Tecfidera's discontinuation rate, he was again cautious: \"Look-I think that, naturally, in a case like this, as people are processing the new label, you'll see softness in switch rate for a period of time.\" (Def. Ex. 15 at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   In February 2016, Kingsley again noted the effect that the PML death was having on Tecfidera, despite the drug's resilience:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n   Fourth quarter, we had the report of one PML incident and I think we talked about this in earnings call and toward the end of the year which is that's a\n   <em>\n    meaningful event that you have to manage through\n   </em>\n   , right?\n   <em>\n    There's a lot of communication that has to happen to physicians\n   </em>\n   .

When directly asked to predict whether \"a lot of the [ ] PML noise or news\" had come out in the fourth quarter of 2015 after the December label change, or whether it would carry over into the first quarter, Kingsley was again, at the very least, cautious:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-279\">\n   Yes, so the information certainly got out in the fourth quarter.

Ex. 18 at 3). Kingsley again noted the PML death when he stated, \"We believe [moderation in growth rates] is occurring as expected, but also believe that the [Tecfidera] safety event in October further dampened market growth and switch rates in Q1.\" (Def. Ex. 18 at 4). Finally, Clancy warned that \"[i]f the U.S. [Tecfidera] trajectory does not improve, we may come in at the lower end of our previously provided revenue growth [range of 14 to 16 percent].\" (Compl. \u00b6 222; Def. Ex. 18 at 6). In May 2015, Clancy stated that the \"unfavorable impact\" that the PML death had on physicians' attitudes toward Tecfidera had \"stabilized\" but that it \"hasn't turned around as quick as we had wanted it to turn around.\" (Def. Ex. 19 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Other factors appear to support the inference that defendants, at worst, negligently\n   overestimated Tecfidera's short-term revenue growth after the PML death. After Biogen announced record Tecfidera quarterly revenue of $916 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, Tecfidera revenue dropped in the first quarter and demonstrated tepid growth in the second quarter due, in part, to the PML death.
