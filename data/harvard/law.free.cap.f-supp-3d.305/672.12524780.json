Before the court is Advanced's motion to dismiss. (Doc. 6.) The motion has been fully briefed and is ready for decision. (Docs. 7, 8, 9.) For the reasons set forth below, the motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to the EEOC as the non-moving party, the operative facts are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Advanced offers in-home health care services to patients. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 \u00b6 12.) On February 3, 2014, Advanced hired Pennell to serve as a Patient Accounts Representative at its High Point location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The main function of Pennell's job was to manage cases for patients who required at home health care services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) This required that she spend some portion of her typical work day on the telephone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the spring of 2015, Pennell began to experience frequent asthma attacks and flare ups of bronchitis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) That August, she collapsed at work, was hospitalized, and subsequently was diagnosed with chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\"COPD\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) As a result of these conditions, Pennell has difficulty talking continuously for extended periods of time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Her conditions are aggravated by scents and odors of the sort that she was regularly exposed to when working in a cubicle at Advanced along with hundreds of other employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following her diagnosis, Pennell was out of work under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , from August 5 through 30, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) When she returned to work, Pennell asked her supervisor if she could telework either part-time or full-time as an accommodation for her disability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) She requested this accommodation because it would prevent her from being exposed to irritants in her work environment and because she would not have to take inbound calls while teleworking, meaning she would have to spend less time continuously talking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The supervisor informed Pennell that she would get back to her, but never did. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Between August and December of 2015, Pennell requested the accommodation of telework on at least three separate occasions, but never received a response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In November of 2015, Pennell was again hospitalized with COPD-related symptoms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) On November 11, 2015, she went on leave again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In December, while still on leave, she received a performance review from her supervisor that stated she had met Advanced's performance expectations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Pennell's direct supervisor told her on more than one occasion, however, that if she could not return to work without restrictions on January 7, 2016, when her FMLA leave ended, she would be terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Pennell exhausted all twelve weeks of her leave but could not return to work, and she was fired on January 8, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly after her termination, Pennell filed an EEOC complaint against Advanced, alleging violations of the ADA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) The EEOC issued Advanced a letter stating that there was reasonable cause to believe that the ADA had been violated and inviting Advance to engage in conciliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) When that failed, the EEOC filed the present action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Doc. 8 at 7.) Specifically, it contends, the complaint alleges that in her job \"Pennell served as a case manager for patients requiring home services. As a case manager, Pennell was required to spend part of her day on telephone calls.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 12.) Thus, the EEOC argues, the essential function of Pennell's position was to manage cases for patients who require home health services. (Doc. 8 at 7-9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Calloway v. Durham Cnty.

The EEOC also argues that it has adequately alleged that Pennell could have performed the essential functions of her position with a reasonable accommodation of telework. (Doc. 8 at 10.) It argues that it alleges that Pennell's job was performed in part via telephone and that telework would allow her to perform the essential function of her position by removing her from the potential respiratory irritants at the office and reducing the amount of time that she would spend talking continuously. (Doc. 8 at 9-11.) The EEOC notes that this is in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Mejia\n   </em>\n   , where the complaint only stated that the plaintiff would return to work, \"if the problem was fixed,\" without further detail.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205531432\">\n    2014 WL 5531432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. The EEOC also argues that it is not required to plead facts to rebut any potential undue hardship defense that Advanced may have as to the requested accommodation. (Doc. 8 at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The EEOC is correct. In each of the cases Advanced cites, no information was alleged as to the essential function of the plaintiffs' jobs. While the duties of Pennell's position are not described in depth-the complaint only states that she is a case manager and that she spends part of her time on the phone, they are sufficiently alleged, particularly as to the need for accommodation.\n   <em>\n    Calloway\n   </em>\n   . 2016, WL 634878, at *9. The EEOC has also alleged sufficient detail about the requested accommodation and how Pennell could have performed the essential functions of her position. The EEOC's complaint makes clear that Pennell requested the accommodation of telework (part-time or full-time), that some of her work required her to be on the telephone, and that she could perform the essential function of her position with the requested accommodation. This is sufficient factual detail for the court to draw the reasonable inference that Pennell could have performed the essential function of her position with the requested accommodation.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.);\n   <em>\n    Woods v.

(Doc. 8 at 15-16.) Specifically, Pennell's supervisor repeatedly told her that she would be terminated when her FLMA leave ended if she could not return to work\n   <em>\n    without restrictions\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (citing Doc. 1 \u00b6 21).) The EEOC cites as analogous\n   <em>\n    Mesi v. Hoskin &amp; Muir, Incorporated\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-00630 BMK,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201362019\">\n    2017 WL 1362019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Haw. Apr. 7, 2017), which denied a motion to dismiss where the plaintiff was terminated at the end of his leave after his requested accommodations due to a work-related injury were refused and he could not return to work without restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Again, the EEOC is correct. Its complaint states a wrongful discharge claim sufficiently to survive the motion to dismiss. It alleges that Pennell had received a satisfactory performance review, was discharged, had requested accommodations on several occasions before her discharge but received no meaningful response, and was discharged upon the expiration of her FMLA leave under circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference it was because of her disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The motion to dismiss will therefore be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the reasons stated,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that Advanced's motion to dismiss (Doc. 6) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Advanced also cites\n    <em>\n     Rubino v.

May 11, 2009) (dismissing a failure to accommodate claim, in part, because the plaintiff failed to state \"what his job entailed\" and \"whether he is able to perform the essential functions of his job, with or without reasonable accommodation\"). Each case is distinguishable in its failure to present any information as to the essential functions of the plaintiff's job.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    It is not clear that Advanced disputes this conclusion. While Advanced's memorandum accompanying its motion to dismiss noted that the complaint did not allege facts to show that \"telework as an accommodation would not create or constitute an undue hardship (i.e. that it was in fact reasonable),\" its reply brief notes that that \"the EEOC does bear the burden of pleading facts supporting that the alleged accommodation is reasonable/plausible,\" without mention of undue burden.
