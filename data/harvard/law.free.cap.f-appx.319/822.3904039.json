Because Cruz did not meet his burden to establish the five applicable criteria, the district court properly denied a reduction under the safety-valve provision pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Cruz was indicted for one count of conspiracy to manufacture and possess with intent to distribute 100 or more marijuana plants, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and one count of manufacturing and possession with intent to distribute 100 or more marijuana plants, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. In his guilty plea, Cruz admitted that, when police searched the home in which he was present there were 188 marijuana plants as well as items used to grow and cultivate the plants, and that he had agreed to grow and distribute the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">By statute, the mandatory minimum was 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(vii). In preparing the pre-sentence investigation report, the probation officer concluded that Cruz was ineligible for the safety-valve provision, which would have permitted the court to sentence Cruz below the mandatory minimum, because Cruz did not provide complete and truthful information in his debriefing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cruz objected to the failure to apply the safety-valve provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">At sentencing, Cruz declined to testify, stating he had already said everything he knew and there was no need to say it again. The court warned that Cruz\u2019s failure to testify would result in the denial of the safety-valve application. The government then presented the following testimony of DEA Agent Kevin Clark: In January 2007, during the investigation, authorities observed codefendant Poggini arrive at the house in which Cruz was staying. Another car arrived with two men later identified as Cruz\u2019s nephew, Juan Carlos, and Lazro Cortina, the owner of the house. The following week, Cruz placed the utilities for the house in his name. Clark opined that Cruz\u2019s nephew was part of the marijuana conspiracy and had convinced Cruz to act as caretaker over the plants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cruz admitted having access to the buildings where the plants were kept and knew the plants were there and expected to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">During the 60 \u2014 to 90-minute interview, Cruz gave descriptions and nicknames of people involved, but did not give any names. Cruz denied knowing Poggini and Cortina. At no time during the interview did Cruz refuse to answer any questions. Clark explained, however, that he did not ask specific questions during the debriefing because it was Cruz\u2019s obligation to offer everything he knew. Clark had a \u201cstrong belief in [his] mind\u201d that Cruz was withholding information, but he could not confirm Cruz lied.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">After noting that Cruz had not testified, the court found that Cruz had not been truthful with authorities based on Clark\u2019s testimony, Cruz\u2019s guilty plea, the utilities in Cruz\u2019s name, and Cruz\u2019s nephew\u2019s role. The court also noted that Cruz expected to be paid for his role. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>court concluded that Cruz had not carried his burden and was not eligible for the safety-valve reduction. The court sentenced him to the mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Cruz\u2019s sole issue on appeal is that the court erred by refusing to apply the safety-valve provision because there was no basis for the court to conclude that he did not provide full and truthful information in his debriefing. Cruz further argues that the court is punishing him for his decision not to testify at sentencing, in violation of his Fifth Amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s factual determinations and subsequent denial of safety valve relief for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>261 F.3d 1071, 1073 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). The defendant has the burden of proving his eligibility for relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The safety-valve provision permits the court to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum sentence if a defendant meets the five criteria set forth in the statutory subsection. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2; <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2000). Relevant to this appeal, the defendant must show that he truthfully provided the government with all the information and evidence he had \u201cconcerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5). \u201c[T]he burden is on the defendant to come forward and to supply truthfully to the government all the information that he possesses about his involvement in the offense, including information relating to the involvement of others and to the chain of the narcotics distribution.\u201d <em>United States v. Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d 1339, 1345 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and alteration omitted). There is no initial burden on the government to solicit information from the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1346. Moreover, a district court cannot apply the safety valve if it determines that the defendant \u201cwithheld or misrepresented information,\u201d even if the information would not have aided further investigation or prosecution if properly disclosed. <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>199 F.3d 1281, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">In determining the honesty of a defendant, the district court must independently assess the facts and may not rely on the government\u2019s assertion of dishonesty. <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em>172 F.3d 795, 796-97 (11th Cir.1999). As such, the court has a duty to determine whether the statement provided by the defendant is truthful and complete. <em>Id. </em>at 797. \u201cCredibility determinations are typically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Here, the reasons given by the district court support the denial of the reduction. Clark testified that he believed Cruz was not forthcoming based on the involvement of Cruz\u2019s nephew and the nephew\u2019s connection to the owner of the home. The government was not required to solicit information; Cruz had the responsibility to provide information on the offenses. Cruz\u2019s refusal to testify at sentencing left the district court with little ability to access his credibility. Because the burden rested with Cruz, and Cruz offered nothing to establish he was entitled to the reduction, the court properly denied the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">We further conclude that, although the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination extends to sentencing, <em>Mitchell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 314, 319, 119 S.Ct. 1307, 1310, 143 L.Ed.2d 424 (1999), Cruz was not punished for his refusal to testify. Rather, he simply did not receive a benefit to which he would have been entitled had he met his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-9\">. Had the provision applied, the sentencing range would have been 24 to 30 months' imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(b) and Sentencing Table.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b847-14\">.
