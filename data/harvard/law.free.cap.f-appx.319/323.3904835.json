He argues that the BIA erred by declining to accept \u201cjurisdiction by certification,\u201d of his untimely appeal, as provided in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(c). The Respondent argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the decision of the BIA because it was purely discretionary and this court has no legal standard by which to review the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-26\">We do not decide the jurisdictional issue presented herein because even assuming that jurisdiction exists, Benitez has not adequately briefed his argument that the BIA erred in finding no extraordinary circumstances warranting an untimely appeal. Accordingly, the argument is deemed abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-27\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
