This court generally reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision, not that of the IJ, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision influences the BIA. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). In the instant case, the BIA relied in part on the IJ\u2019s analysis in determining whether Amolegbe was entitled to relief. Thus, consideration of the IJ\u2019s decision is appropriate. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2002). While questions of law are reviewed de novo, this court \u201caccord[s] deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration statutes unless the record reveals compelling evidence that the BIA\u2019s interpretation is incorrect.\u201d <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"ALl\">Preliminarily, the Government argues pursuant to \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) that this court lacks jurisdiction over Amolegbe\u2019s appeal of the order of removal because Amo-legbe\u2019s removal results from his having committed a controlled substance offense covered in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B). However, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) provides that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) does not deprive this court of jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law. Because Amolegbe argues that his delivery of cocaine conviction does not constitute a valid basis for his deportation as a matter of law, this court does not lack jurisdiction over his appeal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-22\">Amolegbe argues that he is not deporta-ble because his cocaine delivery conviction under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.112(b) does not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d citing for support, inter alia, <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714-715 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3031, 168 L.Ed.2d 748 (2007). However, while Amo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>legbe\u2019s argument may call into question whether his cocaine delivery conviction constitutes an aggravated felony<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for purposes of former \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii), there is no doubt that his cocaine conviction constitutes a state crime \u201crelating to a controlled substance\u201d such that his deportation pursuant to former \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(B)\u00ae is appropriate. <em>See Peters v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 302, 306-07 (5th Cir.2004) (holding that an expansive interpretation of the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d within the context of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae is appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">With regard to the denial of his \u00a7 1182(c) waiver request, Amolegbe does not argue that he made the necessary showing to obtain the waiver, but only that he was not afforded due process because the IJ ruled without having first held an eligibility hearing. However, Amolegbe did not raise a due process argument in his brief to the BIA. Judicial review is available only where the applicant has exhausted all administrative remedies of right. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). \u201cAn alien fails to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to an issue when the issue is not raised in the first instance before the BIA \u2014 either on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen.\u201d <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). Because the exhaustion requirement is statutorily mandated, an alien\u2019s failure to exhaust an issue before the BIA is a jurisdictional bar to this court\u2019s consideration of the issue. <em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Even assuming this court has jurisdiction to consider Amolegbe\u2019s due process argument, it lacks merit. This court has held in both civil and criminal contexts that eligibility for \u00a7 1182(c) relief is not a liberty or property interest that warrants due process protection. <em>Nguyen v. District Director, Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>400 F.3d 255, 259 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. </em>Lopez-<em>Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.2002). In any event, IJ\u2019s order addresses arguments raised by Amolegbe regarding his alleged \u00a7 1182(c) eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"AtE\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b368-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
