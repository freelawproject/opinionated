The facts relating to Chen\u2019s immigration proceedings are set forth in <em>Chen v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>262 Fed.Appx. 984 (11th Cir.2008). There we held that the BIA had abused its discretion in denying Chen\u2019s motion to reopen based on newly submitted evidence of his wife\u2019s forced sterilization in China, because the BIA failed to make a finding as to whether such evidence was previously unavailable and the record did not support the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Chen\u2019s evidence was not material. On remand, the BIA again denied Chen\u2019s motion to reopen. It concluded that the evidence was previously available and discoverable and that Chen was not eligible for asylum relief based solely upon his wife\u2019s forced sterilization.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-23\">Chen contends that the BIA erred in concluding that the evidence was previously unavailable because he had no knowledge of, or documents pertaining to, his wife\u2019s forced sterilization until after his asylum hearing. He argues that he provided evidence that his wife did not inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>him of the forced sterilization until after the asylum hearing and that the BIA unfairly denied him the opportunity to present a claim based upon such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Montano Cisneros v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cOur review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">A motion to reopen \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentia-ry material.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). \u201cMotions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1149 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the [BIA] that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing; ...\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001) (recognizing that the BIA may deny a motion to reopen based on the alien\u2019s \u201cfailure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Here the record supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Chen\u2019s evidence was previously available and discoverable. Chen admits that his wife\u2019s forced sterilization occurred more than two months before his asylum hearing, but argues that his wife did not tell him about the procedure until after his hearing. <em>See contra Verano-Velasco v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>456 F.3d 1372 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that the alien\u2019s petition to reopen was based on a family court order that was issued after the alien\u2019s asylum hearing). Relying on the Immigration Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination, the BIA did not accept Chen\u2019s explanation. Although Chen argues that the adverse credibility determination was \u201cgroundless,\u201d we have already held that we lacked jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Chen failed to file a timely petition for review from the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. <em>See Chen, </em>262 Fed.Appx. at 986-87. We therefore conclude that the BIA\u2019s reliance on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not an abuse of discretion. Because the BIA found that Chen\u2019s evidence was available and discoverable before his asylum hearing, it properly denied his petition to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
