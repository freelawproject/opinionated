On appeal, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">To qualify for asylum, an applicant must prove her status as a \u201crefugee.\u201d Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-6\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To carry her burden to prove statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status, an asylum applicant must, with \u201cspecific and credible evidence,\u201d establish that she suffered past persecution or has a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">As a threshold matter, we note that although the IJ questioned the believability of Chacon\u2019s testimony and pointed out inconsistencies in her testimony, we agree with Chacon that the IJ did not make a \u201cclean\u201d adverse credibility determination. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (requiring IJs to make \u201cclean determinations of credibility\u201d). Thus, we accept Chacon\u2019s hearing testimony as true. <em>See De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1011 n. 10 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that where IJ fails to make a clean adverse credibility determination, we accept the asylum applicant\u2019s testimony as true).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">Even accepting Chacon\u2019s testimony as true, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s denial of Chacon\u2019s asylum petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties raise issues regarding: (1) whether Chacon exhausted her administrative remedies as to or abandoned the issue of whether she proved a nexus between her political opinion and the alleged persecution and (2) whether Chacon\u2019s testimony was so vague that she was required to submit at least some corroborative evidence. We need not address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>these issues because we conclude the events Chacon suffered do not amount to past persecution and Chacon\u2019s fear of future persecution is not objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">More specifically, the verbal threats and one failed kidnapping attempt, which lasted only minutes and during which Chacon was not harmed, do not compel a finding that Chacon was persecuted. <em>See, e.g., Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding 36-hour detention, beating and threat of arrest did not amount to persecution); <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding 5-day detention did not amount to persecution); <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir.2006); (concluding \u201ccondolence\u201d note and several threatening phone calls received three weeks after shots fired at car did not amount to persecution); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding threats and menacing phone calls did not amount to persecution). Even considered cumulatively, the events Chacon described do not reach the level of severity found in cases in which the record has compelled a conclusion that the applicant was persecuted. <em>See, e.g., De Santa-maria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999 (11th Cir.2008) (involving verbal threats, assault resulting in hospitalization, trauma from torture and fatal shooting of family groundskeeper who refused to reveal petitioner\u2019s location, kidnapping and beating with guns resulting in hospitalization); <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762 (11th Cir.2007) (involving verbal threats, brief detention and physical assault during which another person was shot trying to escape, another brief detention in which petitioner was beaten with weapons and kidnapping during which petitioner\u2019s wife was raped, his farm animals were killed and petitioner was forced to march into the jungle, where he was held for 15 days before he escaped).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Furthermore, given Chacon\u2019s repeated trips back and forth between Colombia and the United States, including at least one with her infant son, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Chacon\u2019s fear of future persecution was not objectively reasonable. <em>See, e.g., Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289-90 (stating that, to show a \u201cwell-founded fear,\u201d an applicant must show that her fear is objectively reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Because Chacon failed to establish her eligibility for asylum, her claim for withholding of removal, which has a higher burden of proof, also must fail. <em>See Porgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005). For all these reasons, we deny petitioners\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-9\">. Chacon's appellate brief does not challenge the denial of relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Thus, she has abandoned this claim. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b850-10\">. Because Chacon's minor son is listed on Chacon\u2019s application as a derivative beneficiary, we refer only to Chacon, but our discussion of Chacon's claims applies equally to her son.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b850-11\">. We review the factual determinations regarding whether an applicant is eligible for asylum or withholding of removal under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001). Under the substantial evidence test, \"we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). Here, where the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision \"for the reasons stated therein\u201d and also elaborated upon those reasons in its own order, we review both the BIA's and the IJ's decision. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
