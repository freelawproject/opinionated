(The Guidelines sentence range prescribed a sentence of 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment.) The district court, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>reduced his sentence to 87 months pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 706 of the Sentencing Guidelines. The court found that, under Amendment 706, Graham was entitled to a two-level reduction of his offense level. That reduction, coupled with his category II criminal history, yielded a sentence range of 87 to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-18\">Graham now appeals his reduced sentence on the ground that the district court should have exercised its discretion under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and reduced his sentence to a term of 60 months under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007),'because a sentence of 60 months would be \u201csufficient to fulfill the purposes of sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-19\">In his brief to us, Graham argues that the district court misconstrued <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217 (11th Cir.2005), in finding that <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582 proceedings. He asserts that, under <em>Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines and policy statements are advisory in \u00a7 3582 proceedings. Thus, the district court had authority to sentence him below the sentence range.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-20\">This court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009), forecloses Graham\u2019s argument. The district court\u2019s decision is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b810-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
