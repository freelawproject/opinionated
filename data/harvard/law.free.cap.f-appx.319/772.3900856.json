The district court issued an order approv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>ing and adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. We affirm on the basis of the report and recommendation, as adopted by the district court, to which we add only the following two points for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The first one concerns Cline\u2019s claim that the ALJ erred in discounting the opinion of Cline\u2019s treating doctor, Dr. Hal Silcox. In a May 2003 letter Dr. Silcox opined that Cline\u2019s condition met the listing requirements for social security benefits based on back injuries. The ALJ had \u201cgood cause\u201d to discount Dr. Silcox\u2019s opinion because it was inconsistent with Dr. Silcox\u2019s own medical records. <em>See Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004). One of the listing requirements relevant to Cline\u2019s disability claim is that the injured person test positive on a \u201cstraight leg test,\u201d which is used to assess nerve compression in the person\u2019s back. Dr. Silcox\u2019s treatment notes do not indicate a positive straight leg test for Cline. Instead, every time that Dr. Silcox performed a straight leg test on Cline, the test was negative. Therefore, Dr. Silcox\u2019s opinion that Cline\u2019s injuries met listing requirements is inconsistent with those medical records, and the ALJ had good cause to discount that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Our second point is that the record does support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Cline\u2019s testimony was not entirely credible regarding the amount of pain that he was suffering. \u201cThe ALJ determines the disabling nature of pain. If substantial evidence supports the determination, this court will affirm.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Heckler, </em>734 F.2d 513, 517 (11th Cir.1984) (citations omitted). Cline\u2019s pain allegedly stems from a failed surgery that was intended to fuse two discs in his lower spine. A failed fusion is known as \u201cpseudoarthrosis.\u201d Cline argues that the ALJ erred in failing to recognize his pseudoarthrosis as an \u201cobjectively determined medical condition\u201d that \u201ccan reasonably be expected to give rise to [his] alleged pain.\u201d <em>Johns v. Bowen, </em>821 F.2d 551, 556 (11th Cir.1987). We disagree. It is true that Dr. Silcox diagnosed Cline with pseudoarthrosis after x-raying his back in January 2003. However, that diagnosis was not confirmed in later x-rays, including one taken by another doctor in 2005. Therefore, the evidence regarding whether Cline has pseudoar-throsis is conflicting. In social security disability cases, we have noted that \u201cchoosing between conflicting evidence is a task particularly suited to the fact finder, and we will not disturb such a determination on appeal.\u201d <em>Landry v. Heckler, </em>782 F.2d 1551, 1553 (11th Cir.1986). Moreover, none of the doctors treating Cline after his fusion surgery indicated in their treatment notes that Cline was in the type of pain that he had described during his testimony before the ALJ. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Cline\u2019s testimony regarding the severity of his pain was not wholly credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-18\">. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Cline's motion for remand because the allegedly newly discovered evidence that supported the motion was not material. <em>See Ingram v. Comm'r Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1267 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
