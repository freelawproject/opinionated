The Daleidens then requested a Collections Due Process Hearing (\u201cCDP\u201d) hearing. Prior to the hearing, the IRS instructed the Daleidens to submit a collection information statement, collection alternatives, and an estimated tax payment. The Daleidens requested a face-to-face CDP hearing and identified the issues they wished to address. Because the IRS determined the arguments were frivolous, it denied a face-to-face hearing and scheduled a telephone hearing. The Daleidens apparently refused to participate in this conference and did not submit any of the requested information. Accordingly, the IRS Appeals Office upheld the assessment of liabilities. The Daleidens then petitioned the Tax Court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-18\">The Tax Court set the case for trial for February 11, notified the parties of the date, and warned that the failure to appear could result in dismissal. The court also issued a pre-trial order, instructing the parties to submit stipulations and a pretrial memorandum and again warned that the failure to comply could result in dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-19\">The Daleidens failed to appear at the trial on February 11 and the IRS moved to dismiss the petition for lack of prosecution. The Tax Court granted the motion to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>miss and sustained the notice of determination issued against Roger. On February 25, the Daleidens filed a motion for a continuance, asserting that Roger\u2019s medical condition prevented him from appearing at trial. In support, they submitted a letter from Roger\u2019s doctor. The Tax Court construed the motion as a motion to vacate the order of dismissal and summarily denied it. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">In his appellate brief, Daleiden argues that the Tax Court improperly conducted a <em>de novo </em>trial and erroneously considered new evidence that was not before the IRS at the CDP hearing. Daleiden, however, raises no claims explaining how the Tax Court erred by dismissing his petition for failure to comply with the court\u2019s rules.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">When a party fails to make any argument in his appellate brief, we deem the issue abandoned. <em>Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998). Accordingly, the issue has been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Moreover, Daleiden\u2019s challenges to the CDP hearing are not properly before us. During a CDP hearing, a taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d possible defenses, and offers of collection alternatives. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The taxpayer may challenge the existence or amount of the underlying tax liability, but only if the taxpayer did not receive a Notice of Deficiency. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">In this ease, Daleiden alleged that the IRS failed to follow procedures, but he did not argue that he never received the notice of deficiency; thus he would not have been able to challenge the underlying tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the Tax Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-14\">. In the proceedings before the Tax Court, Roger and his wife Maureen challenged the IRS\u2019s determination of liabilities. The IRS ultimately conceded that it had improperly assessed taxes against Maureen and informed the court that it would abate her notice of determination. Thus, Maureen is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b827-8\">. Nor does he challenge the Tax Court\u2019s denial of his motion for continuance, construed as a motion to vacate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
