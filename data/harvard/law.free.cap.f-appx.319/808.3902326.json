His original sentence was based on the career of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>fender guidelines in \u00a7 4B 1.1. He argues that the district court erred in finding that his career offender status barred him from relief, because the policies embodied in Amendment 706, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and Supreme Court case law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> all support granting a two-level reduction to defendants in crack cocaine-related cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998)). Where the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, review is <em>de novo. See United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Amendment 706, which reduced the \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) offense levels in crack cocaine cases by two levels, was made retroactive by incorporation into U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713. \u201c[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\u201d pursuant to a retroactive amendment, the district court \u201cmay reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Thus, a defendant who was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 rather than under the drug-quantity-based offense levels in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) is ineligible for relief under Amendment 706, which did not alter the \u00a7 4B1.1 offense levels. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">Because Turner was sentenced as a career offender, his base offense level was determined by \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1. As such, it was unaffected by Amendment 706. The district court did not err when it found that Amendment 706 offered no grounds for resentencing Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Turner\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\">. <em>E.g., Kimbrough v.
