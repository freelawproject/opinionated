Appel-lee, the debtor, has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal to this Court for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-23\">This Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review decisions of the district court on bankruptcy matters is defined by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158, under which we hear appeals from all \u201cfinal decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees.\u201d Interpreting finality in this context, we have held: \u201cTo determine whether a remand by a district court really signals the end of the game, we must follow a two step inquiry. First, we must ask whether the order of the bankruptcy court itself is final in character, and second, if it is, we must ask if the remand by the district court requires extensive further proceedings. The answer to the first question must be in the affirmative while the answer to the second question must be in the negative.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Regarding the district court\u2019s remand on the issue of the appointment of counsel for the trustee, we have held that such an order of a bankruptcy court is not final.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the district court\u2019s decision to remand the issue to the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Similarly, we have held that a district court\u2019s remand to a bankruptcy court to determine whether attorneys\u2019 fees were warranted and if so, in what amount, requires the bankruptcy court to perform \u201csignificant further proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider the district court\u2019s remand of the award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction is GRANTED. Appel-lee\u2019s motion for costs and damages is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
