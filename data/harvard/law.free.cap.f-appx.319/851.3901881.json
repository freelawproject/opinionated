St. George argues that the re-sentencing court should have (1) revisited the drug amount used in determining his initial sentence because it was based on unreliable evidence and (2) applied the Sentencing Guidelines in an advisory manner only and granted a downward variance from the amended guideline imprisonment range, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-17\">A jury convicted St. George of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). In a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), a probation officer (1) set St. George\u2019s base offense level at 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, because he was responsible for 4.1 kilograms of crack cocaine, and (2) determined that St. George\u2019s criminal history category was I. With a total offense level of 38 and a criminal history category of I, St. George\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was 235 to 293 months. On August 17, 1998, the district court sentenced St. George to 264 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> St. George appealed, and we affirmed his conviction and sentence. On March 31, 2008, St. George filed the instant motion to reduce sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), on account of Amendment 706 to the Guidelines. On April 11, 2008, the district court partially granted the motion, reducing St. George\u2019s guideline imprisonment range to 188 to 235 months and sentencing him to 211 months\u2019 imprisonment, within the amended range.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-19\">We review the denial of a motion for modification of sentence for an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>discretion. <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998). We review <em>de novo </em>\u201cthe district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the [Guidelines].\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce an already-incarcerated defendant\u2019s sentence if (1) the sentence was determined using a guideline imprisonment range that subsequent retroactive amendments to the Guidelines have reduced and (2) the district court has considered the applicable factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and determined that a reduction would be consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). These policy statements are contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">In determining whether, and to what extent, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is warranted, the district court must engage in a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the district court must substitute the amended base offense level for the originally applied base offense level and determine what sentence it would have imposed had the amended base offense level been in effect at the time of the original sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 780-81. In making this determination, the district court must leave intact all other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, we have held that a district court did not err in refusing to re-examine the number of marijuana plants involved in the offense in question and rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the district court should have heard new evidence on the drug quantity at a hearing. <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562 (11th Cir.1997). Second, the district court must decide whether, in its discretion, it will elect to impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781. In making this determination, the district court: (1) shall consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; (2) shall consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community posed by the reduction; and (3) may consider the post-sentencing conduct of the defendant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">We recently held that, once the district court has determined the defendant\u2019s amended guideline imprisonment range and that a reduction is warranted, it may not rely on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and impose a sentence below that guideline imprisonment range. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009). In <em>Melvin, </em>the defendant argued that, pursuant to <em>Booker, </em>the district court could depart below the amended guideline imprisonment range at re-sentencing, as this range was advisory only. <em>Id. </em>at 1191. The district court agreed, calculating an amended guideline imprisonment range of 84 to 105 months but imposing a sentence of 75 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>We vacated and remanded, reasoning that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) instructs that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under [\u00a7 3582(c)(2)] and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range determined under [\u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) ]\u201d and holding that <em>Booker </em>did not prohibit this limitation on the district court\u2019s discretion in re-sentencing the defendant under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 1192-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">Regarding St. George\u2019s drug-amount argument, the district court did not err in declining to revisit the drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>amount. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1326. In re-sentencing a defendant under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court must leave intact all guideline application decisions made during the initial sentencing, save the specific change made by the amendment in question. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. The district court does not have authority to revisit other factual matters, including drug quantity. <em>See id.; Cothran, </em>106 F.3d at 1562. Likewise, regarding St. George\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument, the district court did not err in declining to apply the Guidelines in an advisory manner and grant a downward variance. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1326. <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable at re-sentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192-93. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-14\">. The district court found that St. George was responsible for only 1.78 kilograms of crack cocaine, but noted that this change did not alter his guideline imprisonment range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
