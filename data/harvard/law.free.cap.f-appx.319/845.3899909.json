No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-15\">Smith, who was on supervised release after serving the incarceration portion of his sentence for travel with intent to engage in a sexual act with a juvenile in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b), offers no challenge to the revocation of his supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But on appeal, Smith argues that his sentence \u2014 the statutory maximum- \u2014 is unreasonable because (1) the district court relied on impermissible sentencing factors, including the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the underlying offense, promote respect for the law and provide just punishment for the underlying offense; and (2) the reasons given by the court for his sentence were unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-16\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may revoke supervised release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness in the light of the section 3553(a) factors cited in section 3583(e). <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). And we evaluate the substantive reasonableness of a sentence \u2014 whether inside or outside the guidelines range \u2014 under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (in the context of original criminal sentencing). The party challenging the reasonableness of the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the section 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">We conclude that Smith\u2019s sentence is reasonable. Smith\u2019s sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Although Smith\u2019s sentence exceeded significantly the advisory sentencing range set out in the Chapter 7 policy statements, the district court was not required to sentence Smith within that range.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that the recommended ranges are advisory; and the court, while required to consider the ranges, is not bound by them).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">In addition, the district court heard Smith\u2019s and the government\u2019s arguments and noted that, after considering both the guidelines range and the section 3553(a) factors, an above-guidelines sentence was appropriate. The district court considered Smith\u2019s history and characteristics, noting that he had not taken advantage of the treatment opportunities provided to him by failing to comply with his mental health treatment program. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1). The district court also noted that, based on the nature of Smith\u2019s supervision violations, his chances of recidivism were high, which required that he be incarcerated to provide deterrence and to protect the public from him. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">These reasons are supported by the record. Smith failed to comply fully with his mental health treatment program by disrupting counseling sessions, omitting information from his journals about his contacts with teenage boys, and fabricating cardiac symptoms that would allow him to discontinue treatment. Smith also had contact with two minors, including a 15-year-old boy that he later admitted he was sexually attracted to, which indicated that Smith had a high risk of recidivism and was a danger to the public. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, comment, (n.3) (explaining that in the case of a Grade C violation that is associated with a high risk of new felonious conduct \u2014 such as violation of a condition that a defendant not associate with children by a defendant under supervision for a criminal sexual abuse conviction \u2014 an upward departure may be warranted).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">The court considered no impermissible factors. Smith is correct that the factors in section 3583(e) do not include the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the underlying offense, promote respect for the law, or provide just punishment for the underlying offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e), 3553(a)(2)(A). But that the district court was not sentencing Smith for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>the underlying offense is clear; instead, the court\u2019s statements reflect an intent to sanction Smith for his supervised release violations. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, intro. comment. 3(b) (noting that \u201cat revocation the court should sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust, while taking into account, to a limited degree, the seriousness of the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">On this record, no abuse of discretion has been shown; and we conclude that Smith\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-9\">. Smith committed the following supervised release violations: (1) failing to participate in mental health counseling specializing in sex offender treatment; (2) having direct contact with a minor; and (3) failing to comply with a home detention program. He admitted to the second and third violations and the district court, after hearing testimony, determined that he committed the first.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b871-6\">. In addition, we review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court considered impermissible factors in sentencing a defendant. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b871-11\">. Smith's Chapter 7 sentencing range was 5 to 11 months, based on Smith\u2019s original sentencing criminal history score of III and commission of Grade C supervision violations. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B 1.1(a)(3), 7B 1.4(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b872-16\">. While the district court used the term \"punishment,\u201d it is clear that the court imposed consequences for Smith's supervised release violations \u2014 and not his underlying offense\u2014 based on several factors authorized by section 3583(e). Smith also argues that incarceration was not an adequate means of rehabilitation; but the court was not sentencing Smith for rehabilitation purposes. Instead, the court determined that Smith was not amenable to rehabilitation and, thus, he required incarceration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
