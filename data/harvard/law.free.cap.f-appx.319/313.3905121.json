He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, which seeks a two-level sentencing reduction based on the retroactive Amendment 706 to the crack cocaine guidelines. The district court denied the motion on the ground that Caicedo was held accountable only for powder cocaine. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Caicedo renews his argument that he was entitled to a sentencing reduction based on the retroactive crack cocaine amendments; he asserts that his original indictment and the offense conduct involved crack cocaine. Although the initial indictment alleged offenses involving both powder and crack cocaine, Caicedo pleaded guilty to a superseding indictment that alleged offenses involving only powder cocaine. The presentence report (PSR) also indicates that Caicedo\u2019s offense level was calculated based upon a quantity of cocaine, not crack cocaine. As the district court correctly determined, because Caice-do\u2019s guidelines range was not derived from a quantity of crack cocaine, he was not \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that ha[d] subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). To the extent Caicedo challenges the validity of the superseding indictment, such a claim is not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"A2k\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
