Baughman argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to comply with Baughman\u2019s instruction to appeal his sentence and failed to consult adequately \u2022with Baughman about his right to appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">Baughman was indicted for conspiracy to commit bank fraud and mail fraud and five counts of bank fraud. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 1344. Later, the government made Baughman an offer to plead guilty. The government offered to recommend a sentence of no more than five years to be followed by no more than three years of supervised release in exchange for Baugh-man\u2019s plea of guilty to the conspiracy charge. The agreement did not require Baughman to waive his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-17\">Baughman pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge, and the district court dismissed the remaining counts of the indictment. The presentence investigation report provided a guideline range for sentencing of between 15 and 21 months of imprisonment. Baughman\u2019s attorney, Richard Darden, warned Baughman that the guidelines were advisory only and that the district court could depart from that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">At the outset of the sentencing hearing, the district court told Baughman that it intended to vary upward from the range recommended by the guidelines because it failed to account for Baughman\u2019s misconduct. After the victim testified, the district court sentenced Baughman to 36 months of imprisonment. Baughman expressed \u201cdismay and surprise\u201d at the variance. The district court advised Baugh-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>man that he had ten days to file a notice of appeal and that Darden would continue to represent him or the clerk of court could prepare and file a notice of appeal for Baughman if he so requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">After the hearing, Baughman met with Darden between 45 minutes and an hour. For fifteen to twenty minutes, they discussed the merits of an appeal. Darden explained that he could file a notice of appeal for Baughman, but Darden predicted that the appellate court would not vacate Baughman\u2019s sentence. Darden explained to Baughman that the district court varied from the Guidelines, but Dar-den stated that the variance was not an abuse of discretion based on the victim impact statement and Baughman\u2019s crimes. Darden did not file a notice of appeal for Baughman.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Two months later, Darden received a telephone call from Baughman\u2019s sister. She requested that Darden send copies of Baughman\u2019s presentence investigation report, objections to the report, and the final judgment. Darden mailed the documents to Baughman.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Baughman moved to vacate his conviction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In a brief attached to the motion, Baughman argued that Darden was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal at Baughman\u2019s request or to make a reasonable attempt to determine whether he wanted to appeal. Baughman alleged that he instructed Dar-den to file a notice of appeal. The government responded to Baughman\u2019s motion and asked the district court to schedule an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">At the evidentiary hearing, Darden testified that he met with Baughman several times before the sentencing hearing to discuss the possible sentence and to explain that the range of sentence recommended under the guidelines was not mandatory. Darden explained that, after the sentencing hearing, he advised Baughman that he believed he would not prevail on appeal. Darden testified that he advised Baugh-man about the obvious advantages and disadvantages of an appeal and offered to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-9\">THE COURT: Did you at any time discuss with your client what advantages or disadvantages might arise from taking an appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-10\">THE WITNESS: Other than the obvious, no. I mean, the obvious advantage is if they send it back, remand it for resentencing, other than that, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-11\">THE COURT: What disadvantages can you envision that might have accrued from taking an appeal in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-12\">THE WITNESS: I know of no disadvantages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-13\">THE COURT: After discussing all of that, did you ever specifically ask whether he, in light of your comments and your assessment of the merits, did you ever specifically ask him, well, do you want me to take an appeal or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-14\">THE WITNESS: I can\u2019t say that I specifically worded in that effect. I think what I expected John to do was to get back with me. But he never did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-15\">Darden testified that he had practiced criminal law in federal court for several years and this was the first occasion that he had been accused of failing to file a notice of appeal. Darden stated that he always filed a notice of appeal at the request of his client, even if he believed the appeal was meritless. He stated that he had appealed sentences within and below the guidelines and he would not have hesitated, upon request, to file a notice of appeal for Baughman. Darden testified that Baughman understood he had only ten days to file a notice of appeal. Darden testified that he could have made a non-frivolous argument on Baughman\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Baughman testified that Darden told him an appeal would cost $15,000 in attorney\u2019s fees in addition to costs. Baughman testified that Darden said he would file a brief challenging the sentence and the judge who sentenced Baughman would decide whether to modify the sentence. Baughman stated that Darden advised Baughman that he could not prevail on appeal; Darden offered to file a notice of appeal; and Baughman instructed him to appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-5\">O\u2019BRIEN: And what did [Darden] \u2014 did he discuss with you anything about the likelihood of succeeding on that appellant [sic] point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-6\">BAUGHMAN: He said that I didn\u2019t have a snowball\u2019s chance in hell, I think is the exact words that he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An2\">O\u2019BRIEN: Ml right. Did he discuss with you at all anything about what was necessary to protect your position regarding that appeal, what had to be done in order to protect your rights in that appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-7\">BAUGHMAN: After we had discussed \u2014 after he had said that I don\u2019t have a snowball\u2019s chance in hell, he said that if I would like he could file a notice of appeal to protect my rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-9\">O\u2019BRIEN: What did you do \u2014 what, if anything, did you do after he told you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-10\">BAUGHMAN: I think that is what \u2014 I said that is what we should do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVg\">Baughman testified that he never suggested that Darden wait for further instructions before filing a notice of appeal. Baughman testified that he left the meeting with the impression that Darden would file the notice of appeal. Baughman testified that his sister called the clerk\u2019s office to inquire about the status of his appeal and learned that Darden did not file a notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">On cross-examination, Baughman acknowledged that he was pleased with Dar-den\u2019s representation until he was sentenced. Baughman also acknowledged that, even though Darden stated it would cost $15,000 to appeal, Baughman never paid Darden or contacted him to inquire about the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">On redirect examination, Baughman testified that he knew a notice of appeal consisted of a single-page form. He stated that Darden told him \u201cindependent of that $15,000 [Darden] would do what was necessary to protect [Baughman\u2019s] appellant [sic] position[.]\u201d Baughman testified in response to questions from the court that he believed Darden would file the notice then contact him to discuss what issues would be argued on appeal. When asked about the fee, Baughman stated that he and Dar-den would address the cost \u201c[a]t some point[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">The district court denied Baughman\u2019s motion. The district court found that Baughman\u2019s testimony that he instructed Darden to file a notice of appeal was not credible, and the district court credited testimony from Darden that Baughman did not instruct him to file a notice of appeal. The district court also found that \u201cDarden\u2019s consultation was adequate under <em>Thompson[v. United </em>States,] 504 F.3d [1203,] 1206 [(11th Cir.2007) ]\u201d and that \u201c[i]t was reasonable for Darden to conclude that his client, after being fully advised of his right and his attorney\u2019s views, did not wish to pursue an appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b893-16\">\u201cIn a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-17\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b893-18\">Baughman challenges the ruling of the district court on two grounds. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Baughman argues that he instructed Dar-den to file a notice of appeal and Darden violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by disregarding that instruction. Second, Baughman argues that his consultation with Darden was inadequate for four reasons: (1) Darden did not address the disadvantages of an appeal; (2) Dar-den mentioned as the only advantage that Baughman might be resentenced; (3) Dar-den failed to ask Baughman if he wanted to appeal; and (4) Baughman left the consultation with the impression that Darden would file a notice of appeal. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The record supports the finding of the district court that Baughman did not instruct Darden to file a notice of appeal. Darden testified that Baughman did not respond to an offer to file a notice of appeal and Baughman wavered in his testimony that he instructed Darden to appeal. The magistrate judge found Baughman\u2019s testimony on this point not credible and \u201c[w]e allot \u2018substantial deference to the factfinder in reaching credibility determinations with respect to witness testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Devine, </em>520 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The record also supports the finding of the district court that Darden consulted with Baughman regarding the right to appeal. The Supreme Court explained in <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega </em>that \u201ccounsel has a constitutionally imposed duty to consult\u201d with his client about the right to appeal \u201cwhen there is reason to think either ... that a rational defendant would want to appeal\u201d or the client expresses interest in an appeal. 528 U.S. 470, 480, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 1036, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). The duty to consult includes two obligations: to advise the client \u201cabout the advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal,\u201d and to make a \u201creasonable effort to discover\u201d whether the client wants to appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 478, 120 S.Ct. at 1035. Darden did not elaborate on the consultation, but Baughman testified to details regarding the information and advice shared by Dar-den. Both Baughman and Darden testified that Darden offered Baughman practical advice about the benefits and costs of an appeal. After Darden advised Baugh-man that an appeal would have little chance of success, Darden offered to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Baughman relies on our decision in <em>Thompson v. United States, </em>504 F.3d 1203 (11th Cir.2007), but <em>Thompson </em>is distinguishable. Darden and Baughman shared a longer and more meaningful discussion than Thompson and his counsel. Unlike Thompson\u2019s counsel, Darden was confident that Baughman understood his right to appeal and the filing deadline, and Darden offered to file a notice of appeal despite his opinion that Baughman would not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Baughman asks that we require counsel to inquire directly of a client whether he wants to appeal, but the Supreme Court explained in <em>Flores-Ortega </em>that \u201cimposing \u2018specific guidelines\u2019 on counsel is \u2018not appropriate.\u2019 \u201d 528 U.S. at 479, 120 S.Ct. at 1036 (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). Our task is to evaluate the findings of fact by the district court that Darden advised Baughman about the advantages and disadvantages of an appeal and made a reasonable effort to discover whether Baughman wanted to appeal. Based on our review of the record, the district court did not clearly err by finding that Darden consulted with Baughman about his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">The denial of Baughman\u2019s motion to vacate his conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
