He argues that his indictment failed to allege the felony offense of assault of a federal officer, because it did not include an allegation that the offense involved physical contact. Carranza-Maldonado asserts that his indictment charged only the misdemeanor offense of assault of a federal officer. Because Carranza-Maldonado was sentenced as if he had pleaded guilty of the felony offense of assault of a federal officer, he contends that the district court plainly erred in determining that a sufficient factual basis existed to support his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The government has not invoked the waiver-of-appeal provisions in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Acquaye, </em>452 F.3d 380, 381-82 (5th Cir.2006). Nevertheless, Carranza-Maldonado is precluded from challenging the sufficiency of his indictment, because he entered an unconditional guilty plea and waived all non-jurisdictional defects leading to his conviction. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>302 F.3d 279, 285-86 (5th Cir.2002). A defective indictment does not deprive this court of jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630-31, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The entry of an unconditional guilty plea does not preclude us from reviewing whether the factual basis of Carranza-Maldonado\u2019s plea establishes the elements of the offense of which he pleaded guilty. <em>United States v. Hildenbrand, </em>527 F.3d 466, 474 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 437, 172 L.Ed.2d 290 (2008). A review of the stipulated facts underlying the guilty plea establishes the existence of physical contact sufficient to support the plea of guilty of a felony \u201call other cases\u201d assault under \u00a7 111(a)(1). <em>United States v. Hazlewood, </em>526 F.3d 862, 865 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Hildenbrand, </em>527 F.3d at 474; <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>233 F.3d 318, 321-22 (5th Cir.2000), <em>overruled on other grounds, United States v. Longoria, </em>298 F.3d 367, 372 &amp; n. 6 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc). Carranza-Maldonado\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the factual basis fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
