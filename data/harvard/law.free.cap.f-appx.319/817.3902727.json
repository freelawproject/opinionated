INA \u00a7 241(b)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158, 1231(b)(3). The Board of Immigration Appeals and immigration judge denied the application based on a finding that Lin was not credible. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-17\">We review credibility findings under the substantial evidence test. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). Adverse credibility findings will be reversed \u201conly if the evidence \u2018compels\u2019 a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231(quoting <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted)). An adverse credibility finding may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and falsehoods in the applicant\u2019s oral and written statements. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-18\">The record does not compel a reasonable fact finder to reverse the adverse credibility finding or to conclude that Lin established eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. Substantial evidence supports the decision of the Board that Lin was not credible, <em>see Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001), and the immigration judge provided specific and cogent reasons to support that finding. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. Lin gave implausible testimony about his practice of Falun Gong in a public park and the capture of several members of his group. Lin could not identify half of the small group of participants or the park where they met, he gave a vague and inconsistent account of his travel to the United States, and he failed to provide authentic evidence of his identity. The letters Lin submitted from his father and his mentor in Falun Gong do not substantiate his claim of persecution. Both letters match the format and terminology of Lin\u2019s application and the mentor\u2019s letter did not state that he had been forced to hide from authorities or practice Falun Gong secretly-</p>\n<p id=\"AM5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Lin\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"AlFV\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
