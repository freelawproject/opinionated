On appeal, Valdes argues that: (1) the district court erroneously calculated the amount of loss under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1; (2) the district court misapplied the sophisticated means enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C); (3) his sentence was substantively unreasonable; and (4) his sentence violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">We review a district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts <em>de novo </em>and all factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Humber, </em>255 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cA factual finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1295, 170 L.Ed.2d 117 (2008). However, where a party fails to raise an issue before the lower court, we review the issue for plain error only. <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1308-09 (11th Cir.2001). To prove plain error, a party must show: (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Generally, we review a sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">First, we reject Valdes\u2019s claim that the district court erred in calculating the amount of loss under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. \u201cIt is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>131 F.3d 970, 988 (11th Cir.1997) (quotations omitted). \u201cThe doctrine of invited error is implicated when a party induces or invites the district court into making an error.\u201d <em>United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1327 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). A court is precluded from invoking the plain error rule and reversing a district court decision where invited error exists. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">Valdes invited any error resulting from the district court\u2019s adoption of the amount of loss calculated in the PSI when he urged the court \u201cto adopt [the probation officers\u2019] position with respect to intended loss....\u201d Thus, we will not review the district court\u2019s determination of amount of loss. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">Second, we are unpersuaded that the district court misapplied the sophisticated means enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(C). Under this provision, a sentencing court may increase the base offense level for fraud by two levels if \u201cthe offense otherwise involved sophisticated means.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C). The application note defines \u201csophisticated means\u201d as \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 8(B). The examples include \u201chiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts\u201d or \u201cin a telemarketing scheme, locating the main office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>of the scheme in one jurisdiction but locating soliciting operations in another jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">As applied here, the district court did not clearly err in applying the two-level sophisticated means enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C) to Valdes\u2019s base offense level for fraud. The information provided at trial and contained in the PSI \u2014 that Valdes recruited beneficiaries and sought out doctors so as to aid in hiding the illegality of his Medicare claims, and converted F &amp; M Medical into a pharmacy through which he continued to defraud Medicare \u2014 plainly supports the application of this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Third, we do not agree that Valdes\u2019s sentence was substantively unreasonable. In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we ordinarily perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">\u201c[Wjhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Furthermore, in considering the guideline factors, the district court need not discuss each of them individually. Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under Booker.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">At Valdes\u2019s sentencing, the district court did not, contrary to Valdes\u2019s assertion, consider only the Guidelines range. Instead, the district court noted that it had given \u201ccareful consideration to the statements of all of the parties and the presentence report and the statutory factors .... \u201d The district court also specifically noted its awareness of Valdes\u2019s ill health and his request for a departure, but explained that it was \u201cnot persuaded to grant that departure which is meant for extremely rare and very complicated medical impairments.\u201d The district court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>imposed a sentence of 151 months, at the high end of the Guidelines range, observing that such a sentence \u201creflect[ed] the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s offenses, the fact that this is the defendant\u2019s third conviction for Medicare fraud.\u201d As the record shows, the district court adequately explained the reasons for its sentence, and Valdes\u2019s sentence was within the guideline range, which we ordinarily expect to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Valdes has failed to meet his burden of establishing that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Lastly, we find no merit in Valdes\u2019s claim that his sentence violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 543 U.S. at 244. However, we have held that <em>Booker </em>does not prohibit courts from considering relevant conduct in an advisory Guidelines system as long as a court does not impose a sentence that exceeds the statutory maximum authorized by the jury verdict. <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1304-05 (11th Cir.2005) (concerning acquitted conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Further, the Supreme Court has said that the \u201capplication of the preponderance standard at sentencing generally satisfies due process.\u201d <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 156, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997). The Supreme Court also acknowledged the circuit split on whether to apply a \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard in extreme circumstances where a sentence could be dramatically increased. <em>Id. </em>We have continued to hold that relevant uncharged or acquitted conduct may be taken into account in sentencing, as long as such conduct is proven by a preponderance of the evidence and the court clearly applied the Guidelines as advisory. <em>United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1347-48 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Because this issue was not preserved, we review only for plain error, and Valdes has not established any. Under the case law, Valdes\u2019s constitutional rights clearly were not violated when the district court considered his uncharged conduct in arriving at his ultimate sentence, as the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Valdes did in fact engage in such conduct. In addition, Valdes himself urged the district court to accept the PSI\u2019s calculations of amount of loss, which amount included losses from Valdes\u2019s uncharged conduct. And finally, Valdes was sentenced within the statutory range on each of the counts of conviction, and the district court expressly recognized the Guidelines as advisory when it discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 1347; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(l); <em>Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1304-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-12\">. <em>United States v.
