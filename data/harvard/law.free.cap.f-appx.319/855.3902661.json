Stone contends that the district court erred by increasing her sentence by four levels based on her leadership role in the offense. She argues that, because she did not admit the facts upon which this increase was based and the facts were not found by a jury, the imposition of a four-level increase violated <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Stone also contends that the district court imposed a sentence \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d by not granting her a downward departure on the basis of her health condition, family responsibilities, and alleged acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 749-50 (11th Cir.2006). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-14\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court (1) held that sentence enhancements based solely on judicial fact-finding pursuant to the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines violate the Sixth Amendment and (2) excised the provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act that made the guidelines mandatory, thereby effectively rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 233-35, 259, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51, 764. \u201cWhen the district court applies the Guidelines in an advisory manner, nothing in <em>Booker </em>prohibits district courts from making, under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, additional factual findings that go beyond a defendant\u2019s admissions.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1281 (11th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 175, 169 L.Ed.2d 119 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (recognizing that \u201cthe use of extra-verdict enhancements in a non-mandatory guidelines system is not unconstitutional\u201d). We have also held that \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>district court may enhance a sentence based upon judicial fact-finding provided that its findings do not increase the sentence beyond the statutory maximum authorized by facts determined in a guilty plea or jury verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Dean, </em>487 F.3d 840, 854 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1444, 170 L.Ed.2d 275 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Furthermore, \u201c[w]e lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a downward departure unless the district court incorrectly believed that it lacked authority to grant the departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The district court is not required to state on the record whether it believed it had authority to depart below the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>Instead, \u201c \u2018when nothing in the record indicates otherwise, we assume the sentencing court understood it had authority to depart downward.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Chase, </em>174 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">Here, Stone\u2019s sentence did not exceed the applicable statutory maximum penalty, and the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory. The district court was entitled to enhance her sentence based on findings of fact it made by a preponderance of the evidence. Additionally, because the district court indicated that it knew it had the authority to depart downward, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
