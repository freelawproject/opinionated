After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">L BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Evans pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a), (b)(l)(A)(iii), and 846. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated a base offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, based on the drug quantity. However, an offense level of 37 applied, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, because Evans qualified as a career offender and his underlying offense carried a statutory maximum penalty of life imprisonment. After applying a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the PSI calculated an adjusted offense level of 34. Evans\u2019s criminal history category was VI, which yielded an advisory guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSI also noted that a mandatory minimum term of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the PSI\u2019s factual statements and guidelines calculations. The district court acknowledged that it was permitted to consider the craek/powder disparity after <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and stated that it had considered that disparity. The district court also stated that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Evans\u2019s criminal history, his co-defendant\u2019s sentence, and the other factors discussed. The district court sentenced Evans to 200 months\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years\u2019 supervised release. This was below the advisory guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. Evans raised no objections after sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">Evans argues that the disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses in the Sentencing Guidelines and in the mandatory minimum sentences in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Because Evans raises this constitutional argument on appeal for the first time, we review only for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018 (11th Cir.2005). For several reasons, Evans has not shown plain error in either regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">First, this Court already has rejected the argument that the disproportionality of sentences for crack and powder cocaine violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1158 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo, </em>483 F.3d 124, 134 (1st Cir.) (stating that \u201cevery other circuit has rejected the argument that the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\u201d), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 338, 169 L.Ed.2d 237 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">Second, Evans\u2019s Eighth Amendment argument is based on the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Kimbrough </em>decision. <em>Kimbrough </em>addressed only whether a district court was allowed to consider the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 crack/powder cocaine disparity when determining an appropriate sentence in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 564. <em>Kimbrough </em>did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>not address the constitutionality of the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 offense levels or the statutory minimum sentences in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) for crack cocaine offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor did it address an Eighth Amendment challenge to the Sentencing Guidelines or 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1). And Evans has not pointed to any other case from the Supreme Court or this Court in support of his Eighth Amendment argument. <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005) (stating an alleged error cannot be plain \u201c \u2018where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003))).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Third, any crack/powder cocaine disparity in the Sentencing Guidelines is irrelevant here because Evans\u2019s base offense level was determined by the career offender provision under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not the drug guidelines provision for his offense conduct. <em>See United States v. Vazquez, </em>558 F.3d 1224, 1227-29 (11th Cir.2009) (rejecting argument that <em>Kimbrough </em>overruled this Court\u2019s precedent that a district court may not consider its disagreement with the career offender provision in the Sentencing Guidelines at sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Finally, we note that, in considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court acknowledged that it could consider the crack/powder cocaine disparity after <em>Kim-brough, </em>stated that it had considered that disparity at sentencing, and sentenced Evans below the advisory guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">For all these reasons, we affirm Evans\u2019s 200-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\">. To prove plain error, an appellant must show \"(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1019. If all three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to recognize the error, \"but only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\">. To the contrary, it recognized that district court remain bound by the statutory minimum sentences in \u00a7 841(b)(1). <em>See Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 574 (\u2018\u2018[A]s to crack cocaine sentences in particular, we note a congressional control on disparities: possible variations among district courts are constrained by the mandatory m\u00ednimums Congress prescribed in the [Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986]\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 572 (stating that the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 \"does not require the [Sentencing] Commission \u2014 or, after <em>Booker, </em>sentencing courts \u2014 to adhere to the 100-to-l ratio for crack cocaine quantities <em>other than those that trigger the statutory mandatory minimum sentences \u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
