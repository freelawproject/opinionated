Roberts contends that the district erred when it refused to apply <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), at his resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">In 1996 Roberts was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)(A). The district court determined that his offense level was 41 and his criminal history category was III, giving Roberts a sentencing guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. He was sentenced to 360 months. After Amendment 706 became retroactive in 2008, Roberts\u2019 offense level dropped to 39 and his guidelines range became 324 to 405 months. Acting under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court resentenced Roberts to 324 months, the bottom of his amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Roberts, seeking a further reduction in his sentence, argues that the district court erred in failing to apply <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>at his \u00a7 3582(c) resentencing. Recently we held that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply at resentencing proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1190-91 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Starks, </em>551 F.3d 839 (8th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833 (10th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Dunphy, </em>551 F.3d 247 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Because the district court sentenced Roberts to the bottom of his amended guidelines range, under <em>Melvin </em>and the applicable policy statement of the Sentencing Commission, it had no discretion to reduce his sentence any further. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) (\u201c[T]he court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range ...\u201d); <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1193-94. There was no error at the resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
