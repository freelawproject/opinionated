He argues that the district court unreasonably exceeded the recommended guideline range of 8 to 14 months and imposed the statutory maximum. He contends that his sentence was the same length that he would have received if he had committed a serious felony instead of the misdemeanors he actually committed that led to the revocation. He asserts the district court failed to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities with other defendants. Adaway argues that the court should have given more weight to the guideline recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-18\">We review a sentence imposed for revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106 (11th Cir.2006). The Supreme Court has stated that when reviewing for reasonableness, courts of appeal are to apply the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38,-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-21\">The court may, after considering certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors, revoke a term of supervised release and sentence the defendant to prison. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The factors considered include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (3) protecting the public from further crimes of the defendant; (4) providing the defendant with needed educational, vocational training, or medical care; (5) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (6) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (7) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (8) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B)-(D), (4) \u2014 (7), 3583(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-22\">When reviewing a sentence, we must first determine that the \u201cdistrict court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If we conclude that the district court made no procedural errors, we \u201cshould then con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>sider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">There is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The challenger \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court need not state on the record that it has explicitly considered each factor and need not discuss each factor. <em>Id. </em>at 786. Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>[United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The maximum term of imprisonment for revocation of supervised release is two years where the offense that resulted in the supervised release was a Class C felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The guidelines recommend 8-14 months\u2019 imprisonment for the Grade C violations Adaway committed because of his criminal history category of VI. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Adaway to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment because it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the weight given those factors was left to its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
