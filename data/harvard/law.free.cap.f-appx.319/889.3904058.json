Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the \u201csubstantial evidence test.\u201d Under that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). We will not reverse the BIA\u2019s factual determinations unless the record compels us to do so. <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must show it is more likely than not that if he returned to his country his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). To satisfy his burden of proof, an alien may establish \u201cpast persecution in his country based on a protected ground.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Alternatively, an alien may \u201cdemonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Amaya was not entitled to withholding of removal on account of an imputed political opinion. Amaya\u2019s relationship with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (\u201cFARC\u201d) was a commercial one based on his mechanical expertise. Whatever abuse or harassment Amaya suffered from the FARC was due to his refusal to manufacture weapons for them; it was not based on any actual or imputed political opinion. Because Amaya\u2019s problem with the FARC arose from his refusal to cooperate with it, he is not entitled to withholding of removal based on political opinion. <em>See Sanchez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cIt is not enough to show that []he was or will be persecuted or tortured due to h[is] refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Amaya is not entitled to withholding of removal based on the membership in a \u201cparticular social group.\u201d Amaya\u2019s \u201cspecial knowledge of weapon design\u201d does not qualify him as a member of a particular social group. We have recognized that the phrase \u201c \u2018particular social group\u2019 should not be a \u2018catch all\u2019 for all persons alleging persecution who do not fit elsewhere.\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1196 (11th Cir.2006). Instead, a particular social group must be based on an \u201cimmutable characteristic\u201d that is \u201cfundamental\u201d to the group members\u2019 \u201cindividual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Amaya\u2019s vocational expertise does not meet that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Because Amaya is not entitled to withholding of removal, we also deny the claims of derivative applicants Henao and Karen.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">PETITIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-13\">. Henao and Karen Amaya are derivative applicants based on Alvaro Amaya's petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b914-23\">. The petitioners withdrew their applications for asylum before the IJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
