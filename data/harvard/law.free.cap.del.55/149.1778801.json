Young, as a consequence of a fall on a ramp entrance to the Kent Apartments, allegedly caused by accumulations of snow and ice thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">Mrs. Young was a tenant in one of the basement apartments in the building. She claims she fell about 9:30 P.M. on the evening of March 4,1960 while proceeding down the ramp entrance en route to the door of her basement apartment. Plaintiff contends that defendant, as the landlord, was under a duty (1) to keep the ramp entrance free and clear of ice and snow; (2) that the ramp was not properly lighted and <em>(3) </em>that the defendant should have constructed hand rails on the ramp.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-15\">Defendant\u2019s answer denied the several negligences charged against him; it also pleaded plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence and assumption of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>The case came on for trial to the Court on March 29, 1962. At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case defendant moved for judgment and the motion was renewed when the trial was concluded. These motions were taken under advisement and the Court directed counsel for the parties to exchange briefs in support of their respective positions. Briefs have been filed and the case is now ready for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The Kent Apartment was formerly a school building in Dover. It has been converted into a number of apartments. Plaintiff was a tenant in a basement apartment. The principal \u2014if not the only \u2014 means of ingress and egress to plaintiff\u2019s apartment was by means of a paved ramp that leads up from the entranceway to her apartment to the sidewalk level. It appears from the evidence that the ramp has a 13.18% grade from the street level down to the entrance and doorway to Mrs. Young\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Plaintiffs made no showing of any accumulations of snow and/or ice on the ramp from previous snow falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">About 7 to 8 inches of snow fell in Dover on March 3, 1960, continuing into March 4, 1960, and with some continuing snow flurries late in the evening of March 4, 1960. Temperatures were in the low 20\u2019s on both days and the winds were high with gusts measuring 38 to 50 m.p.h. at times.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Mrs. Young left her apartment about 8:00 P.M. on the night of March 4, 1960 to go visit a friend who lives in the same apartment building. The entranceway to this friend\u2019s apartment is different from the one providing access to the Young apartment, requiring plaintiff to go up the ramp and thence along the sidewalk in front of her apartment, then along a side entranceway to the door of her friend\u2019s apartment. The sidewalk and this side entranceway were unprotected from the elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Mrs. Young testified that when she left her apartment the snow condition was \u201cnot too bad. I could get along all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>right\u201d \u2014 some snow was on the ground as she left for her visit but \u201cI didn\u2019t really look, to tell you the truth\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Mrs. Young\u2019s testimony concerning the ramp, her use of it and the like is all quite interesting and is set out in her own language.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u201cQ Did you ever have any trouble getting up and down this ramp entrance before this time?</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u201cA No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">\u201cQ And had you gone up and down the ramp in snow conditions before?</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">\u201cA Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">\u201cQ How many times, would you say?</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">\u201cA Well, I don\u2019t know. Every time it snowed from the time I went in. I went in there, I think it was in November. I am pretty sure I went in in November.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">\u201cQ Yes, you have told us about that. So every or most times it snowed during that winter of \u201959-\u201960 you used the ramp?</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">\u201cA Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-15\">I find from Mrs. Young\u2019s testimony and that of Mr. Varea, witness for plaintiff, that the ramp slope and area were not dangerous <em>per se </em>and could be used, even in snowy weather without any undue possibilities of damages; plaintiff did not introduce any testimony regarding the need for guard rails.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-16\">Defendant had placed an electric light in the center of a portico over the entranceway to the doors of the two basement apartments. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney contended it was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-17\">Mrs. Young had testified she didn\u2019t remember if there was ice or snow on the ramp as she left to make her visit say<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ing that \u201cI don\u2019t remember even looking when I went up\u201d to make her visit. She then testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u201cQ Tell me, did that light over the \u2014 well, between the two basement apartment entrances, did that illuminate the area of the ash cans \u2014 the trash cans? Excuse me.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\"><em>\u201cA </em>What do you mean? Could I see the trash cans?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\u201cQ Yes, and the area around them.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\u201cA Yes, you can see the trash cans from that light.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">\u201cQ And the area around them?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">\u201cA Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">\u201cQ Your answer is, yes?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">\u201cA Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">In light of this testimony I find that the lighting over the door to Mrs. Young\u2019s apartment illuminating the entranceway and the ramp was adequate, see <em>Frelick v. Homeopathic Hospital Ass\u2019n, </em>1 Storey 568, 574, 150 A. 2d 17 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">Having completed her visit to her friend Mrs. Young left her friend\u2019s apartment about 9:30 P.M. Testifying in response to her attorney\u2019s inquiries as to her return to her apartment, she said:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">\u201cQ Now, upon your return would you describe the condition of the surface of the ramp?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-17\">\u201cA * * * I came down from her apartment, and it was snowing or sort of like sleeting * * As she\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b169-19\">\u201c* * * came down the ramp quite cautiously. * * * when I got halfway down the ramp * * * my feet went out from under me and I crashed back onto my back, onto my spine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Having been asked to describe conditions on the ramp, she said:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u201cA It was slippery, and I proceeded with caution from the gate down. But when I got, as I say, halfway down, opposite those garbage cans is where I fell. It was really slippery, and I could feel ice under my hands when I got up, to try to get up.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u201cQ Can you describe the surface as to accumulation of snow?</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\u201cA No, I really couldn\u2019t tell you how much snow there was. I was in too much pain to even notice very much about it that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">\u201cQ Well, Mrs. Young, I am speaking about when you first went to descend the ramp. Did you notice at that time\u2014 can you describe any accumulation on the ramp, or the ramp as to accumulation?</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">\u201cA Yes, there was some.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">\u201cQ Can you say how much?</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Did you pause to look to see whether there was ice and snow on that ramp before you went down to your door?</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: No, I didn\u2019t, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">\u201cBY MR. TURNER:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">\u201cQ Could you clearly see the ramp, Mrs. Young?</p>\n<p id=\"b170-16\">\u201cA Well, pretty well. I was used to going down there.\u201d At a later point Mrs. Young testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-17\">\u201cQ Now, Mrs. Young, on the evening in question, March 4, 1960, do you have any recollection of noticing any sand or salt-</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u201cA No, I never saw any salt or any sand on there in all the time I lived there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Mrs. Young testified in the course of cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u201cQ You didn\u2019t even look?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u201cA No. But I got up the ramp all right. It was when I came back down that I fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">\u201cQ Yes, I understand. You say it was slippery. How could you tell it was slippery when you left?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">\u201cA Well, by the way my feet slipped around a little bit.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">\u201cQ Did you take a look at the ramp then when your feet slid around?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">\u201cA No, I didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">\u201cQ So you never looked at the ramp when you were going up?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">\u201cA No, I didn\u2019t. I was just going about my business upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">\u201cQ So, then, you didn\u2019t see any snow on the ramp at 8 o\u2019clock when you left?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">\u201cA No.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-17\">\u201cQ Did you have any difficulty getting up to Mrs. Guertin\u2019s apartment?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-18\">\u201cA No I got up there fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-19\">\u201cQ What was the condition of the side entrances and steps to the main apartment building?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-20\">\u201cA There was snow over there on the sidewalk on the side. It is in the same building that I went. You just go out front and down the side and upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: Did you say there was snow, or was no snow on the sidewalk going up to this side entrance?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes, there was snow.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u201cBY MR. CORROON:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\u201cQ How much snow was there, Mrs. Young?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u201cA I don\u2019t know how to tell you. I don\u2019t know how to gouge it. There was just snow, that is all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Defendant testified that after four in the afternoon of March 4, 1960 he had two men remove the snow that had fallen that day and the previous day. A Mr. Kerrick also testified, saying:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">\u201cQ Describe the area that you shovelled on that day, would you, Mr. Kerrick?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">\u201cA The area we shovelled was \u2014 we started at the front entrance on the south side and shovelled to the south gate along the sidewalk, down the ramp, back up the ramp to the north gate, and into the first entrance on the north side, and then retraced the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">*?\u00a3*\u2756\u2756*</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">\u201cQ What were the weather conditions at that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">\u201cA At that time it was \u2014 we had a few light snow flurries. The wind was blowing pretty hard. It caused an accumulation of snow swirls.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">\u201cQ About how much snow was on the ground, would you say?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">\u201cA I\u2019d say approximately 6 to 8 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-17\">\u201cQ Did the wind which you have described have any effect on the area you shovelled?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-18\">\u201cA Yes. It caused slight drifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-19\">\u201cQ Had that caused drifting, or did it continue to cause drifting?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>It caused slight drifting of loose top snow after shovelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">One Louie Harris, another witness for the defendant, testified, by way of deposition, that he had lived in the Kent Apartments on March 4, 1960 with his wife and two children and was familiar with the walks and entrances around and into the apartment house. He had been employed by defendant to shovel snow from the walks and entranceways \u201cevery time it snowed\u201d, and that he shovelled snow on March 4, 1960, starting \u201ca little after three\u201d and was paid at the rate of $1 per hour for 4 hours, meaning he had shovelled snow until about 7:00 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">He worked with Kerrick and helped clear the ramp\u2014 leading down from the sidewalk to the front entrance of the building \u2014 stating it had been shovelled \u201ctwice\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Specifically he testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">\u201cQ Would you describe to me as best you can the weather conditions during the time you were shovelling?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">\u201cA It was very cold and windy and snowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">\u201cQ And was there snow on the ground after you started shovelling?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">\u201cA Yes, there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">\u201cQ Would you describe to me how much you remember, or approximately?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">\u201cA Well, I would say four or five inches, I guess.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">\u201cQ And did the wind have any effect on that snow?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">\u201cA Yes, sir. The wind would blow the snow back and forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">\u201cQ And did the wind have any effect on the area that you shovelled?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>Yes, sir. Some of it would blow it back into where we had shovelled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">On cross-examination Harris testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u201cQ * * * in other words, you cleared the entire ramp except for that portion on each side where you stacked the snow, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u201cA That is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\u201cQ Now, at the time you were shovelling you said it was very cold, windy, and snowing. Did it snow all the time you were shovelling?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">\u201cA Well, it snowed most of the time. And it \u2014 you would have flurries and heavy snow, and a little snow, and \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">\u201cQ Did the snow stop when you were shovelling?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">\u201cA Well, it would stop and then start again.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-13\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">\u201cQ All right, when you shovelled the ramp did you get down to the bare surface of the ramp?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\"><em>\u201cA </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">\u201cQ Was there any ice on the ramp?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-17\">\u201cA Not at the time, no sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-18\">\u201cQ Not at the time you were shovelling?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-19\">\u201cA No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-20\">\u201cQ Now, was the ramp wet?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-21\"><em>\u201cA </em>Well, it was \u2014 I\u2019d say it was damp. Not running water on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-22\">\u201cQ But it was damp?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-23\">\u201cA Well, it was a little damp. I can\u2019t say that it was wet or damp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Harris testified further concerning the continuance of the snow and storm:</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u201cQ When you stopped shovelling had the snow ceased at that time? Was it snowing, do you know?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u201cA I don\u2019t remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\u201cQ Do you recall the particular evening to the extent of knowing whether you went out or not that particular evening? Or is that in your mind at all?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\"><em>\u201cA </em>Yes, sir, I remember it definitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">\u201cQ Do you remember whether you went out that evening?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">\u201cA No, sir, I didn\u2019t go out.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">\u201cQ You did not?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-16\">\u201cA Not after I went in. I had to put chains on my car that night, and then I went back home.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-17\">\u201cQ Well, now was it snowing when you put the chains on your car?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-18\">\u201cA Yes, it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-19\">\u201cQ What time was that?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-20\">\u201cA Well, I\u2019d say two hours after I quit shovelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-21\">Harris testified more concerning the continuance of the storm:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u201cQ What were the wind conditions at the time you stopped shovelling?</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u201cA It was still on.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u201cQ Well, describe to me how the wind was blowing at that time when you quit shovelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">&gt;|\u00ed ^</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u201cA I think it was still about the same as it was while we was shovelling. All the time the weather stayed about the same, the temperature and the wind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Mrs. Young\u2019s testimony was that when she left her apartment to go visiting her friend and neighbor the snow had stopped, but when she left her neighbor-friend at 9:30 P.M. to return to her apartment it was snowing and sleeting. A Mr. Hardie, a witness for plaintiff, a tenant in the same apartment testified that the snow continued, although it seems more likely that the continuing high winds were blowing and drifting the snow, \u2014 as a factor in the general storm.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">From my review and a studied consideration of all the evidence relating to the snow and the storm I find that the storm was continuing and continued until after ten o\u2019clock on the evening of March 4, 1960, \u2014 during the period when Mrs. Young left to go visiting her friend\u2019s apartment and when she returned to her own place.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">The defendant testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">\u201cQ Did you do anything with that ramp after Harris and Kerrick had finished shovelling?</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">\u201cA I went up and got a bag of salt, rock salt, and threw it in all two entrances, one to the right and one to the left.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">\u201cQ About how much did you put down, do you remember?</p>\n<p id=\"b176-16\">\u201cA I used two bags, ten-pound bags, but with some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>there and some at the gate that you are coming in, north gate, south gate, so the people won\u2019t slip.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: In other words, you took a total of 20 pounds, which covered the ramp and these other two gates?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: That is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u2756 * * * * \u2756</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\u201cQ All right, what area of the ramp did you spread the rock salt on?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">\u201cA On both areas, on both entrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">\u201cQ The entire length?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">\u201cA Yes, close to the door, right to the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">\u201cQ Did you start from the gate?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">\u201cA From the gate right down.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">\u201cQ From wall to wall, or just down the entranceways?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-16\">\u201cA Well, from the gate to the wall at the entrance to the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-17\">Defendant also testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-18\">\u201cQ Now, Mr. Saroukos, you testified you had some shoveling done on March 4th. Did you have any shoveling done on March 3rd?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-19\">\u201cA Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-20\">\u201cQ Who did you employ for that?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-21\">\u201cA Myself and a colored boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-22\">\u201cQ On March 3rd did you have occasion to place any salt around?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-23\">\u201cA Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-24\">\u201cQ Where did you put the salt then?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u201cA On the same direction I did on March 4th.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u201cQ Was the ramp shoveled on March 3rd?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\"><em>\u201cA </em>Yes, sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u201cQ Who did it?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u201cA I say myself and a colored fellow.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">\u201cQ In other words, both of you worked on the ramp. What time of day was this, Mr. Saroukos?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">\u201cA I don\u2019t know exactly what time.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">\u201cQ Was it morning, afternoon, evening?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">\u201cA It was sometime in around noon, I presume.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">\u201cQ Now, Mr. Saroukos, was there snow on the 4th prior to your shoveling?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">\u201cA Certainly, not much but it was snowing, and the wind were drifting it right back.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">\u201cQ It was that snow that you were having shoveled, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-17\"><em>\u201cA </em>Well, we did shovel the snow, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-18\">\u201cQ It was the snow that fell on the 4th that you were having shoveled on the 4th?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-19\">\u201cA That is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-20\">\u201cQ And the ramp had been cleared the day before, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-21\"><em>\u201cA </em>That is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-22\">The witnesses who testified before me concerning the clearing of the snow were somewhat impressive in their testimony and I find that defendant did have his premises shovelled and that he placed rock salt in the pathways as he testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The question then for decision is whether the facts show the defendant fulfilled his duties as a landlord concerning those portions of the premises as were not specifically covered by the lease of any tenant. This will depend on the extent of the landlord\u2019s duty with respect thereto and specifically towards Mrs. Young, his tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">A landlord usually is not liable to a tenant or to a member of tenant\u2019s family or to a guest of a tenant for alleged defective condition of demised premises. <em>Seligman v. Simon et al., </em>7 Terry 301, 83 A. 2d 682 (1951) (tenant\u2019s customer injured when ceiling fell); and <em>Villani v. Wilm. Housing Authority et al., </em>9 Terry 450, 106 A. 2d 211 (1954) (tenant\u2019s child fell into a natural water course and drowned, the water course had not been fenced); and see <em>Grochowski v. Stewart, </em>Del. Super., 169 A. 2d 14, 16 (1961), but compare <em>Hysore v. Quigley, </em>9 Houst. 348, 350, 32 A. 960 (1892), and <em>Fulmele v. Forrest, </em>4 Boyce 155, 86 A. 733 (1913) (damages allowed for tenant\u2019s death arising from a fall on stairs from landlord improperly repairing the stairs).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Judge Stiftel considered the liability of a landlord for personal injuries incurred by tenants occasioned by accumulations' of ice and snow in <em>Whalen v. Zolper, </em>1 Storey 519, 148 2d 778 (1959), but because of the record then presented, he declined to pass on and determine the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Judge Stiftel pointed out (1 Storey 521, 148 A. 2d 780):</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">\u201cThe authorities in this country on the question of whether or not there is a duty on the part of the landlord who has rented a building to several tenants to remove natural accumulations of ice or snow in certain areas such as on porches and steps used in common are not in harmony. The cases on the subject are collected in 25 A. L. R. 1273; 39 A. L. R. 294; 58 A. L. R. 1411; 75 A. L. R. 154; 97 A. L. R. 220, and more recently, in 26 A. L. R. 2d 610. From an examination of certain treatises and of the cases cited in the above A. L. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>notes, it appears that the authorities are primarily divided between the common-law Massachusetts rule and the so-called Connecticut rule. <em>Durkin v. Lewitz, </em>3 Ill. App. 2d 481,123 N. E. 2d 151, 155, 156. The Massachusetts rule holds that the relation of landlord and tenant does not impose upon the landlord a duty to remove from common areas under his control ice or snow naturally accumulating there. <em>Bell v. Siegel, </em>242 Mass. 380, 136 N. E. 109, 25 A. L. R. 1261; <em>Woods v. Naumkeag Steam, Cotton Co., </em>134 Mass. 357; 2 <em>Stevenson [on Neg</em>ligence] <em>in the Atlantic States </em>(1954 ed.), Sec. 513. The Connecticut rule as stated in <em>Reardon v. Shimelman, </em>102 Conn. 383, 128 A. 705, 707, 39 A. L. R. 287, imposes upon the landlord a liability for injuries due to the accumulation of ice or snow, provided he knew or ought to have known of the existence of the dangerous condition existing and failed to exercise reasonable care to provide against the injury because of it. The landlord has the duty to use reasonable care to see to it that the premises are kept safe. <em>Sheehan v. Sette, </em>130 Conn. 295, 33 A. 2d 327, 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u201cThe basic difference between the two rules is that under the Massachusetts line of cases, an adherence to the common-law conception of the duty of a landlord is followed, and snow and ice are understood to be temporary obstructions for which a landlord is not held liable, and the Connecticut line of cases follows the more modern approach requiring the landlord to use reasonable care with respect to premises used in common, including the removal of ice and snow. <em>Durkin v. Lewitz, supra, </em>123, N. E. 2d at page 156.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Looking at the treatises, encyclopedias and text books one will find excellent and exhaustive discussions, for instance in <em>Prosser on Torts, </em>2nd Ed., page 465, \u00a7 80, and see discussion pages 471/473.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The rule is also discussed and stated in <em>Harper &amp; James \u2014The Law of Torts </em>\u2014 at \u00a7 27.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>After a detailed and intensive study of the treatises, text books and many cases on the general subject and some law review notes, see 41 <em>Columbia Law Review, </em>p. 349, I unhesitatingly choose the Connecticut Rule and hold it is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\"> I hold the proper and applicable rule to be that it is the obligation of the owner of an apartment house to exercise ordinary care to maintain the approaches and other parts of the building under his exclusive control in a reasonably safe condition for the use of tenants and their guests. Where a landlord demises separate portions of a building to several tenants, expressly or impliedly reserving to himself control of the common areas, his duty as to such areas is more extensive. Here he must exercise reasonable care to keep such areas in a safe condition for the use of his tenants and their business and social guests, all such persons being regarded, while on the common areas, as invitees of the landlord. I regard and hold that the announced rule applies to these common areas so as to require the landlord to render safe or to remove natural or artificial accumulations of snow and ice.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">I adopt, however, as part of the applicable rule, the determination expressed in the Iowa and Virginia cases, <em>Reuter v. Iowa Trust &amp; Savings Bank, </em>244 Iowa 939, 57 N. W. 2d 255 (1953) and <em>Walker v. Memorial Hospital, </em>187 Va. 5, 45 S. E. 2d 898. In the cited Iowa and Virginia cases the Supreme Courts of those states have ruled:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u201cThe authorities are in substantial accord in support of the rule that a business establishment, <em>landlord, </em>carrier, or other inviter, in the absence of unusual circumstances <em>is permitted to await the end of the storm and a reasonable time thereafter to remove ice and snow from an outdoor entrance walk, platform, or steps. The general controlling principle is that changing conditions due to the pending storm render it inexpedient and impracticable to take earlier effective action, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>and that ordinary care does not require it.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">I have considered and I reject the holding in <em>Pessagno v. Euclid Inv. Co., Inc., </em>72 App. D. C. 141, 112 F. 2d 577 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In light, therefore, of the facts found in this case and the rules of law adopted I conclude, as a matter of law, that the defendant exercised ordinary care in light of the continuing storm, and that he is not hable to the plaintiff on the facts she showed at the trial. Defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss are therefore granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">An order granting judgment to defendant may be presented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
