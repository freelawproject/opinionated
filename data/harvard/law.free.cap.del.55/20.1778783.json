(referred to hereafter as Appellant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) filed an applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>tian with the Delaware State Board of Pharmacy (referred to hereafter as Board), pursuant to the pertinent provisions of the State Laws, for a permit to open and establish a pharmacy. The application was made on the form prescribed by the Board and all the information called for by the statute and the application form was submitted to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The pertinent provisions of the statute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> found in Title 24 Del. C., Chapter 25, are herewith set out:</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u201c\u00a7 2551. No person shall * * * open or establish any pharmacy within this State without first having obtained a permit so to do from the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u201c\u00a7 2552. The application for a permit required under this subchapter shall be made on a form to be prescribed and furnished by the Board and shall be accompanied by a required fee of $1, * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u201c\u00a7 2553. (a) On evidence satisfactory to the Board that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">\u201c(1) the pharmacy for which the permit is sought will be conducted in full compliance with the law and with the rules and regulations of the Board;</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">\u201c(2) the location and appointments of the pharmacy are such that it can be operated and maintained without endangering the public health or safety; and</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201c(3) the pharmacy will be constantly under the personal and immediate supervision of a registered pharmacist, a permit shall be issued to such persons as the Board shall deem qualified to conduct such pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u201c(b) No permit shall be issued * * * for the conduct of a pharmacy unless the premises of such pharmacy shall be equipped with proper sanitary appliances and kept in a clean and orderly manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\u201c\u00a7 2554. If an application for a permit to conduct a pharmacy is refused, the Board shall notify the applicant in writing of its decision and the reasons therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The Board caused an inspection to be made of Appellant\u2019s premises on December 15, 1961 by its Secretary David Krigstein. Assumedly, the Secretary found Appellant\u2019s premises, \u00a7 2553(a) (2) and (3) and (b), were satisfactory. No immediate action, however, was taken by the Board on the application, so on February 7, 1962 Appellant instituted Civil Action No. 143, 1962 in this Court, seeking an issuance of a peremptory writ of mandamus, \u201cdirecting\u201d the Board \u201cto issue a permit pursuant to 24 Del. Code \u00a7 2553\u201d or in the alternative \u201cto notify the [appellant] in writing of its refusal to issue a permit pursuant to 24 Del. Code, Section 2554.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The petition in that case, <em>inter alla, </em>alleged:</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">\u201c4. The Board is in possession of satisfactory evidence that petitioner is entitled to a permit to operate a pharmacy pursuant to 24 Del. Code, Section 2554.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">It further alleged that:</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">\u201c6. Since December 1, 1961, respondent Board, its individual Members, and its Secretary have neglected and omitted either to issue a permit pursuant to 24 Del. Code, Section 2554, or to notify the applicant of its refusal to issue a permit pursuant to 24 Del. Code, Section 2554.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>This Court held a hearing on this petition and the Board\u2019s answer thereto, following which hearing Judge Christie of this Court issued<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a Peremptory Writ of -Mandamus, on March 7, 1962, ordering the Board to take action on the application for a permit and to give notice of the Board\u2019s action not later than March 31, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Following the issuance of the Peremptory Writ of Mandamus the Board met at Dover on March 25, 1962 and acted on the application. The pertinent minutes of the Board (which are a part of the record on appeal) set out the action taken by the Board. These minutes are set forth in full, so far as they pertain to Appellant\u2019s application:</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">\u201cApplication for discussion: Wilmington Vitamin and Cosmetic Corp. of 613 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware. Inspector\u2019s report was given:</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">\u201c1) Edward Pastor initiated the request for the original application. A report was read concerning Mr. Pastor\u2019s previous record from Narcotic Division of Treasury Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">\u201c2) Violation of trademark act and Section 2589 of Delaware Code Title 24 Chapter 25 substitution of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">\u201c3) Affidavit from Mr. Marshall Kalen was read as received from attorney Ernest Wilson representing Wilmington Vitamin &amp; Cosmetic Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">\u201c4) Letter was read as received from Deputy Attorney General Thomas Herlihy III. This letter<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> concerned recommendations to the Board concerning this application under discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>\u201c5) Letter from Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy concerning Mr. Pastor\u2019s suspension of Pharmacy license from July 13, 1960 to September 17,1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u201cThis completed inspector\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u201cFollowing discussion from Board Members:</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u201c1) Mr. Edward Pastor has been seen behind the counter in 613 Market Street of Wilmington Vitamin &amp; Cosmetic Corporation by Mr. G. Edward Casper.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">2) Firm has violated Delaware Fair Trade Law \u2014 Title 6 Chapter 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">\u201cPharmacy permit was denied and Secretary was instructed to remit letter stating that the denial was based on Delaware Code Title 24 Chapter 25 Section 2553(a) (1). Letter to be sent by March 31, 1962 as ordered by Judge Christie in Mandamus proceedings early in March 1962.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">On March 27, 1962 a letter was mailed to Wilmington Vitamin &amp; Cosmetic Corp., signed by David J. Krigstein, Secretary of the Delaware State Board of Pharmacy. That letter reads in full as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">\u201cGentlemen:</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">\u201cThe application for a pharmacy permit at 613 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware has been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">\u201cThe denial is based on Del. Code Title 24, Chapter 25, Section 2553 (a) (l)\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">Cordially,</p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">\u201c/s/ David J. Krigstein \u201cSecretary\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-16\">On March 29, 1962, two days after the issuance of the Board\u2019s letter of denial of the application, Appellant filed this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>appeal, pursuant to 24 Del. Code, Section 2557(a), which statute is quoted in footnote 1, <em>supra, </em>page 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The minutes, as set forth above on pages 16 and 17, refer to an inspector\u2019s report followed by two numbered paragraphs which the Court regards as the findings required by the statute, Title 24 Del. C. \u00a7 2553, showing the reasons for denial of the application. It is to be noted that these findings in their entirety are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u201c1) Mr. Edward Pastor has been seen behind the counter in 613 Market Street of Wilmington Vitamin &amp; Cosmetic Corporation by Mr. G. Edward Casper.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u201c2) Firm has violated Delaware Fair Trade Law \u2014 Title 6, Chapter 19.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Some comment is necessary as to whether the reasons given by the Board are legally sufficient to justify denial of the application. This comment will include some references to the record certified by the Board to this Court, and on which record Appellant\u2019s application was considered and determined, as it shows the basis for the reasons given by the Board for denying the application. Reference will be made too to the law, so that a proper perspective of the entire situation can be established for a determination by this Court of the case on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">The record shows <em>first </em>that one Edward Pastor addressed a letter in November 1961 to Mr. Krigstein, Secretary of the Board, reading:</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">\u201cKindly send Application for Opening a Pharmacy in State of Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">\u201cI would greatly appreciate application soon as possible.\u201d There was a Postscript to the letter, reading:</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">\u201cP.S. The First Application was erroneously made\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The application from Appellant and as received by the Board made no reference whatsoever to the name of Edward Pastor; his name did not appear therein; moreover, there was an affidavit in the record, made by President of Appellant, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u201cNo person having the name of Edward Pastor or any similar name is now or has ever been an officer, director, or employee of Wilmington Vitamin &amp; Cosmetic Corp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Notwithstanding this, the name of Edward Pastor is written into the application, in brackets, under the heading \u2014 \u201cNames of all unregistered employees in Pharmacy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">A Stipulation was filed with the Court, signed by counsel for the parties, stating that Pastor\u2019s name \u201cwas inserted in the pharmacy application by David Krigstein, who is Secretary of the Board, and was not inserted by the applicant\u201d. A like statement appears in the Certification of the record, made over the hand of David Krigstein, \u201cSecretary State Board of Pharmacy\u201d. Five different papers pertaining to Mr. Pastor\u2019s past activities and to his record with the Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">No possible relationship of Mr. Casper\u2019s<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> having seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Mr. Pastor \u201cbehind the counter in 613 Market Street of Wilmington Vitamin &amp; Cosmetic Corporation\u201d is shown with respect to the action of the Board in giving this as a reason for denying of the application, and in light of the application, as submitted, and the affidavit of the Appellant\u2019s President, I can see no relevancy under the law between what Mr. Casper saw as to Mr. Pastor\u2019s having been on Appellant\u2019s premises<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or to Mr. Pastor\u2019s past record with the Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy or with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and the application. This reference to Mr. Pastor has no place in this case on the present record and I propose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>to and will disregard such references as having no proper place in the record or as affording the Board a reason to refuse the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The second reason advanced by the Board for its denial of the application was:</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u201c2) Firm has violated Delaware Fair Trade Law \u2014 Title 6, Chapter 19.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Title 24 Del. C., \u00a7 2554 (a) (1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u201c(a) On evidence satisfactory to the Board that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u201c(1) The pharmacy for which the permit is sought will</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">be conducted in full compliance with the laws and with the rules and regulations of the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">The record did not include any \u201crules and regulations of the Board\u201d; it did contain a number of \u201cRulings\u201d. At oral argument it was made plain that the Board had not adopted and promulgated any rules and regulations, notwithstanding Title 24 Del. C. \u00a7 2503(a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> empowers the Board to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u201cAdopt such rules and by laws, not inconsistent with laws, as may be necessary for the regulation of its proceedings, and for the discharge of the duties imposed under this chapter, or any laws of this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Hence, we can proceed on the basis that the Board had no basis for denial of the application because Applicant would conduct its pharmacy otherwise than \u201cin full compliance * * * with the rules and regulations of the Board\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The record contains copies of a number of Complaints filed in our Court of Chancery against Appellant by manufacturers and licensed pharmacists seeking to enforce the Fair Trade Act, Title 6 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1907 and one order issued by a Vice Chancellor in an action brought by a manufacturer enjoins Appellant from continued violations of the Fair Trade Act, Title 6 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1907 by selling \u201cfair trade items at prices less than the minimum retail, resale prices\u201d stipulated by the manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Mention has already been made of the Attorney General\u2019s letter9 sent to the Board, regarding suggested action by the Board on Appellant\u2019s application. The Attorney General advised the Board in this letter, among other things,\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">\u201c* * * the evidence that you now have regarding the application is not sufficiently strong to warrant the refusal of a pharmacy permit. We felt that the alleged fair trade law violations were more of an economic consideration as opposed to the public health and welfare requirements of 24 Del. C., \u00a7 2553. In other words, we felt that the statutory requirements for a pharmacy permit were aimed at the public welfare and safety, and, therefore, economic considerations would not play a part in an application for a permit unless that affected the health and safety of the public in general.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">It may be noted in passing that the record includes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>letter report, dated December 8, 1961,10 addressed to the Board from a private detective agency advising that two investigators of the agency had \u201cshopped\u201d Appellant\u2019s store and sought to make \u201cpurchases\u201d of \u201ctrade marked\u201d pharmaceuticals and were urged to and did buy products which contained identical ingredients but sold at a price less than those items which were \u201ctrade marked\u201d. These transactions11 were considered in the Attorney General\u2019s letter.12</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The advice of the Attorney General on these transactions was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u201cFinally, the alleged trade marked violations are not strong enough in and of themselves to warrant the refusal of a permit. In other words, when a person enters a store seeking a certain product and ends up buying another product which was urged upon him, this is the decision on the part of the buyer without further consultation with his doctor. Again, trademark violations are mainly economic considerations and not considerations regarding the health and safety of the public unless the substituted product is not the same (chemically) as the product originally sought by the buyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The concluding paragraph of the Attorney General\u2019s letter is giving advice to the Board and it is set forth because it shows to what extent the Board chose to ignore the Attorney General\u2019s advice with respect to the reasons given by the Board in denying the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u201cPlease understand this merely represents our advice on the above matters on facts which are currently within our knowledge. With this in mind, it is our opinion that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>insufficient grounds to refuse a pharmacy permit at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">It is also of interest in connection with the motions filed by the Board seeking remand of the proceedings so that further consideration could be given to the application, which motions are considered later.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">The record, as analyzed, sets out but one substantial reason for the Board\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s application for a pharmacy permit, and that is\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u201cthe pharmacy for which the permit is sought will\u201d not \u201cbe conducted in full compliance with the law * *</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Since, as has been pointed out, the Board never adopted rules and regulations, it becomes, only necessary to determine the meaning to be given to the term \u201cthe law\u201d, appearing in Title 24 Del. C. \u00a7 2553(a) (1) \u2014 the section noted by the Board in the letter sent as required by Title 24 Del. C. \u00a7 2554, to Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Study of Chapter 25 of Title 24 Del. C. and the Code clearly shows that this term must mean \u201cthe law\u201d which appears generally in Chapter 25 of Title 24 of the Code. See <em>Safeway Stores v. State Board of Agriculture, </em>cited post pages 21 <em>et seq., </em>particularly at page 22, post. In addition to references to pharmacists, retail pharmacies, hospital pharmacies, and the manufacturers, etc. of certain pharmaceutical items, the Board was vested, Title 24, \u00a7 2589, with power over sale of substituted drugs, and with specific power to \u201cenforce the provisions of * * * the law relating to pure drugs, as provided by Section 3315 of Title 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Title 24, \u00a7 2503(a) (2) of the Code empowers the Board to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">\u201cEmploy an attorney to conduct prosecutions or to assist in the conduct of prosecutions under this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">That section, when carefully considered, gives a clue to the powers of the Board; in fact consideration of the entire chap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>ter leads me to conclude that these stated powers pertain solely to the regulation of retail and hospital pharmacies and pharmacists, except that Sub-Ch. V shows the Board has been given power over the manufacture, production, packing, packaging or preparation of \u201cdrugs or medicines, toilet preparations, dentifrices or cosmetics\u201d and a permit is required from the Board to act in any of these matters. I am wholly convinced that the Board has no power whatsoever to enforce the Fair Trade Law, Title 6 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1907, since that law provides the method of enforcement of that law. Nowhere is provision made therein or elsewhere for any enforcement of that statute by the Board. It is quite clear to me that the Board\u2019s powers, such as were vested in it by the statute, are limited to guarding the health and safety of the public; nowhere has the General Assembly provided the Board with any powers to make any rules or otherwise to impose any economic regulations, see <em>Stadnik v. Shell\u2019s City, Inc., </em>decided by the Florida Supreme Court May 11, 1962 and reported at 140 So. 2d 871, where that Court considered and struck down as an invalid usurpation of powers a rule adopted by the Florida Pharmacy Board, attempting to regulate advertisements of the prices of prescription drugs. The Florida Supreme Court, 140 So. 2d at p. 875 said:</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\"><em>\u201cIn actuality, the rule has more resemblance to an economic regulation appropriating price competition in the prescription drug business than it does to a regulation guarding the public health. </em>* * * The effect of the rule simply is that the druggist cannot advertise the price of a prescription drug even though he is prohibited by law from selling the drug except upon the prescription from a physician. <em>There is simply no reasonable justification for such an administrative intrusion on private rights when the regulation is so completely lacking in public benefit. </em>* * *\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">See also <em>State v. Peoples Drug Store, Inc., </em>cited <em>supra </em>in footnote 2, quoting from <em>Liggett Co. v. Baldridge, </em>278 U. S. 105, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>49 S. Ct. 57, 73 L. Ed. 204 (U. S. Sup. Ct. 1928). It was said in the latter case that:</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u201c* * * A state cannot, \u2018under the guise of protecting the public, arbitrarily * * * impose unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions upon them.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">There must be \u201ca reasonable relation to the public health\u201d, otherwise, said the Supreme Court of the United States, the regulation \u201crests upon conjecture, unsupported by anything of substance. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">It is well established that administrative agencies, such as the State Board of Pharmacy, derive their powers and authority solely from the statute creating such agencies and which define their powers and authority, 73 C. J. S. Public Administrative Bodies and Procedure \u00a7 49, citing, among many other cases, <em>Diamond State Liquors v. Delaware Liquor Commission, </em>6 Terry 112, 420, 75 A. 2d 248, 253 (Gen Sessions 1950) and <em>In re Auditorium, </em>7 Terry 430, 84 A. 2d 598, remanded <em>8 </em>Terry 373, 382, 91 A. 2d 528, 533 (Sup. Ct. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">See also 1 Am. Jur. 2d, Administrative Law, \u00a7 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">It is stated, 73 C. J. S. Public Administrative Bodies &amp; Procedure \u00a7 49 at page 371, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">\u201cThe powers of administrative agencies * * <em>* </em>must affirmatively appear from the enactment under which they claim to act. * * * Any reasonable doubt as to the existence of any particular power should be resolved against it * *</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">See also 1 Am. Jur. 2d, Administrative Law, \u00a7 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">The statutory powers granted to the Board relate solely to pharmacists, retail pharmacies, hospital pharmacies, and the manufacturers, etc. of certain \u201cdrugs or medicines, toilet preparations, dentifrices or cosmetics\u201d; no power has been granted to the Board to act in any respect in the enforcement of the Fair Trade Law or in other economic fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The duty of an appelate Court, in reviewing orders of an Administrative Agency, is well stated in <em>Safeway Stores v. State Board of Agriculture, </em>198 Or. 43, 255 P. 2d 564, 569 (1953). At the cited page the Oregon Supreme Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u201c* * * if the Milk Marketing Act does not authorize [the State Board of Agriculture] to afford present processors the benefit of restricted competition, then the findings of fact</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">* * * which are based solely upon the premise that Salem has a sufficient number of processing plants, demand that the challenged order must be vacated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">At a later point in this same paragraph the Court observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u201c* * * if the findings of fact do not support an order which is challenged by a writ of review, the reviewing court must vacate the order * * *. A writ of review calls upon the court to match the findings of fact with the agency order and if the former do not justify the latter, the order must be held illegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">At 255 P. 2d at page 575 the Oregon Court referred to the statutory language and noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">\u201c* * * Its language is sweeping and authorizes the defendant \u2018to supervise and regulate the milk industry\u2019. If the seven words quoted must be given their literal import throughout the act, all of the rest of the latter, * * *, could have been left unpenned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">Continuing the Court <em>(Id.) </em>then said:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">\u201c* * * In contrast to the general and indiscriminate provision just quoted, the act contains many sections which are specific and which clearly identify the course of action which the defendant is authorized to pursue in the instances to which they are germane. It is our duty to construe and give effect to the act in its entirety. After reading the whole act, we must seek from all of its terms the purpose of the enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ment, for the intention of the whole controls the meaning of the parts. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The Oregon Court used other language, 255 P. 2d on page 576 which is most expressive \u2014 and determinative here:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u201cThe draftsman of a statute, unlike a painter or a sculptor, has no choice of materials, such as canvas, bronze or marble, with which to work in depicting the ideas which he wishes to portray. Bronze, marble, paint and clay respond to the artist\u2019s touch and subject themselves to his control. But there is available to a draftsman of a statute only words\u2014 inflexible and yet treacherous in their connotation. They do not forge in the minds of all readers the same images.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u201cIn an effort to find the ideas which are packaged in words, the courts have fashioned the rules of statutory construction. Those rules always give preference to specific provisions over others which are general or abstract. One of the rules holds that definite provisions in a statute relating to the subject under consideration control general provisions, in the absence of language which requires a contrary holding. * * * In the construction of legislation which confers authority upon officials, the rules render the courts ever sensible to the axiom that ours is a government of laws and not of men. See, generally, 12 Tulane Law Rev. 179. Another of the rules is expressed by Sutherland, Statutory Construction 3d Ed., \u00a7 322, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">\u201c \u2018The tendency of the more recent cases is to sustain delegations of the licensing power even when broad discretions are delegated. This tendency seems justifiable when activity of licensing is an appropriate field for legislative regulation and where the determination of conditions is impracticable for legislative resolution and the legislature has provided as practical a standard for administrative guidance as is appropriate for the particular regulation.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u201c \u2018* * * In <em>Board of Railroad Commissioners of the State of Oregon v. Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, </em>17 Or. 65,19 P. 702, 707, this court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><em>\u201c \u2018 \u201cIt has for a long time been considered the safer and better rule, in determining questions of jurisdiction of boards and officers exercising powers delegated to them by the legislature to hold that their authority must affirmatively appear from the commission under which they claim to act. </em>(Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u201c \u2018 <em>\u201cThere is too strong a desire in the human heart to exercise authority, and too much of a disposition upon the part of those intrusted with it to extend beyond the design for which and the scope within which it was intended it should be exercised, to leave the question of its extent to inference. Should it be so left serious disturbances might arise involving a conflict of jurisdiction, which would be highly detrimental to the community. </em>(Emphasis Supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u201c \u2018 <em>\u201cIt is not, it seems to me, requiring too much of the legislative branch of the government to exact, when it creates a commission and clothes it with important functions, that it shall define and specify the authority given it so clearly that no doubt can reasonably arise in the mind of the public as to its extent.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u201c Tn the more recent case of <em>Layman v. State Unemployment Compensation Commission, </em>167 Or. 379, 117 P. 2d 974, 982,136 A. L. R. 1468, the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cIt is an elementary and fundamental principle, which no one will dispute, that a commission, created by the legislature to administer a statute, is wholly limited in its powers and authority by the law of its creation. No more unwholesome doctrine could be suggested than such a body is vested with discretion to ignore or transgress these limitations even to accomplish what it may deem to be laudable ends. That would be to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>leave room for that \u2018play and action of purely personal and arbitrary power\u2019 condemned in <em>Yick Wo v. Hopkins, </em>118 U. S. 356, 6 S. Ct. 1064, 1071, 30 L. Ed 220, 226.

In fact, it must be worded in terms so clear \u2018that no doubt can reasonably arise in the mind of the public.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">This Court has heretofore ruled that if an Adminitrative Agency decides a matter brought before it upon grounds not justified under the statute creating the Agency, the action of such Agency will not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">In <em>Wilmington Country Club v. Delaware Liquor Commission, </em>8 Terry 352, 363, 364, 91 A. 2d 250, 255, 256 (1952) the Wilmington Country Club applied for an off-premises license for the sale of alcoholic liquors. The Liquor Commission denied the license, setting forth several grounds therefor. President Judge Terry of this Court, in reversing the Commission said: (8 Terry 365, 91 A. 2d 256)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">\u201c* * * If an application by a club for an off-premises license is to be refused, then the reason must be other than the one asserted in the present case. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\"><em>Application of Julian, </em>167 A. 2d 21 (Del.

Giving the Board\u2019s fact findings the benefit of all imaginable inferences in their favor, they amount to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">(1) One Edward Pastor was found to have had some connection with applicant, not in any wise supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">(2) The applicant had \u201cviolated\u201d the Delaware Fair Trade Law, a matter entirely outside the scope of the Board\u2019s regulatory field.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">To paraphrase Judge Terry, if the permit was to be denied, then the reasons must have been other than the ones asserted by the Board and appearing in the record. I find and hold that the reasons stated in the record did not justify the Board to deny the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Before oral argument was held the Board moved \u201cthe Court to direct the Prothonotary to refer the * * * case back to the Defendants with instructions that the case be reopened and both parties be given an opportunity of presenting additional evidence\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Consideration of this motion involves a determination as to whether this Court has been given power, under the statute13 to order a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Our Supreme Court has, in three cases, considered the existence of such a power, and has ruled, <em>Searles v.

The statute considered in the latter case specifically granted a power of remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In <em>Searles v.

The Statute simply says that the court \u2018may reverse or affirm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought up for review\u2019. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The ruling was restated by the Supreme Court in the <em>Auditorium, Inc. </em>case, <em>8 </em>Terry at page 380, 91 A. 2d at page 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">This power of remand was. considered in a very scholarly opinion of the Supreme Court of New Mexico in <em>State ex rel. Transcontinental Bus Service v. Carmody, </em>53 N. M. 367, 208 P. 2d 1073 (1949). The opinion considered both sides of the question, <em>i.e. </em>whether a reviewing court does or does not have the power in the absence of a specific legislative grant of power to remand, see 208 P. 2d at page 1076 and 208 P. 2d at page 1079. At this latter point the New Mexico Supreme Court reviewed cases and statements in treatises and encyclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>pedias to the effect that a Court reviewing Administrative orders may remand the cases to the Agency for the purpose of taking additional testimony, and concluded (208 P. 2d at page 1079):</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u201cIn every case cited * * * the Supreme Court [of the United States] was dealing <em>[Ford Motor Co. v.

Ed. 221] with a congressional act containing specific authority to remand for further proceedings. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The New Mexico Supreme Court then considered statements to the same effect to be found in Vom Baur\u2019s work on Federal Administrative Law, in an annotation in 153 A.

This record, therefore, contains no basis for review. <em>The burden, therefore, was unfairly imposed upon the Superior Court to take testimony to ascertain the facts, since that court has no authority to remand the proceedings to the Board of Adjustment.

State Board of Agriculture, supra, </em>at pages 740 to 742, and specifically adopt the holdings of the Oregon Supreme Court\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>1. That unless the statute authorizes the Administrative Agency to make the order appealed from, the challenged order must be vacated as illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">2. It is the Court\u2019s duty, in ascertaining the powers of an Administrative Agency \u201cto construe and give effect to\u201d all the statutes relating to such Agency. The whole act, amendments thereof and supplements thereto, must be read together and from all of such legislation \u201cthe purpose of the enactments\u201d considered, since \u201cthe intention of the whole controls the meaning of the parts\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">3. The powers, the authority and the jurisdiction of Administrative Agencies must affirmatively appear from the legislation under which they claim to act and are not to be inferred; it is for the General Assembly to \u201cdefine and specify the authority given [to an Agency] so clearly that no doubt can reasonably arise in the mind of the public as to its extent\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">4. Any Administrative Agency or Officer clothed with Administrative powers \u201cmust place his finger upon legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>couched in express and non ambiguous language\u201d to support the making of an order if an order is challenged; the power granted by the General Assembly \u201cmust be worded in terms so clear \u2018that no doubt can reasonably arise in the mind of the public\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Since our Supreme Court has three times determined, <em>Searles v. Darling, supra; Auditorium, Inc. v. Board of Adjustment, supra; </em>and <em>Board of Education v. Shockley, suprti, </em>that this Court does not have the power of remand unless it is specifically granted to it by statute; and since our Supreme Court has twice ruled that the record sent up by the Administrative Agency is the record this Court should use in considering the appeal, see <em>Searles v. Darling, supra, </em>and <em>Auditorium, Inc. v. Board of Adjustment, supra, </em>the Board\u2019s motion to remand, see page 31, <em>supra, </em>is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The decision of the Board is, therefore, reversed, and the cause remanded to the Board with instructions to issue the permit sought by the Appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">An order may be presented making effective the holding of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-13\">Title 24 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2557 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">\u201c (a) Any person, to whom the Board has refused to issue a permit to conduct a pharmacy * * * may appeal from the decision and order of the Board to the Superior Court of the county in which the * * * proposed pharmacy in question * * * is intended to be located, at any time within 30 days after the date of the receipt by the applicant of the decision of the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-15\">When the appeal was lodged, the Board Members were made parties to the appeal in their individual capacities. The Secretary of the Board was likewise named a party appellee. In light of the above quoted provision and of other provisions found in Title 24 <em>Del. C., </em>Ch. 25, Sub-Chapter I, and Sections 2501-2505, and Sub-Division IV and specifically Sections 2551, 2553, 2554, and 2557,1 preliminarily ruled that individual Board Members or the Secretary are not properly parties appellee. Consequently, counsel was directed to prepare an order providing for their dismissal as parties to this appeal. Such an order has been entered and the caption of the case on appeal changed in accordance with the preliminary ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The place and need of Sub-Chapter IV of Chapter 25 of Title 24 <em>Del. C. </em>in the regulation of the profession of pharmacy and in the regulation of retail pharmacies may be open to debate. Sub-Chapters I, II, III, V and VI seemingly provide all the measures needed for the protection of the health and safety of the public and for regulation of pharmacies and pharmacists.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Counsel for Appellant suggests that since it was adopted in 1937, there may be some relationship between the ruling made by the Superior Court in <em>State v. Peoples Drug Stores, Inc., </em>6 W. W. Harr. 120, 172 A. 257 (Super. Ct. 1934) and the enactment in 1937 of Volume 41 <em>Del. Laws, </em>Ch. 87, now Subdivision IV \u2014 at the suggestion of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The_ inclusion of the second paragraph of \u00a7 2551, which reads\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">\u201cIf it is desired to operate, maintain, open or establish more than one pharmacy, separate applications shall be made and separate permits issued for each.\u201d also gives a possible clue \u2014 that the cited statute was enacted so as to give the Board some form of control over chain pharmacies. In <em>State v. Peoples Drug Stores, Inc. </em>Judge Rodney, speaking for the Superior Court, observed, 6 W. W. Harr, at 122,172 A. at 257,258:</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">\u201cIn <em>Liggett Co. v. Baldridge, </em>278 U. S. 105, 49 S. Ct. 57, 73 L. Ed. 204, the Supreme Court of the United States passed upon the Pennsylvania statute (P. L. 1927, p. 1009), the first section of which provided \u2018Every pharmacy or drug store shall be owned only by a licensed pharmacist * * The Supreme Court reiterated the principle that the right to do business was a property right to be protected against unreasonable invasion. The Court sustained the right of a State to \u2018regulate the prescription, compounding of prescriptions, purchase and sale of medicines, by appropriate legislation to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the public health.\u2019 The Court held that every point at which the public health could be injuriously affected by the act of the owner in buying, compounding or selling drugs or medicines was amply safe-guarded by provisions of law other than mere \u2018ownership.\u2019 All these statutory provisions of Pennsylvania considered by the Supreme Court have their counterparts in the statutes of the State of Delaware. The Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">\u201c \u2018The act under review does not deal with any of the things covered by the prior statutes above enumerated. It deals in terms only with ownership. It plainly forbids the exercise of an ordinary property right and, on its face, denies what the Constitution guarantees. A state cannot, \u201cunder the guise of protecting the public, arbitrarily interfere with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>private business or prohibit lawful occupations or impose unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions upon them.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">This discussion of the reasons for the inclusion of Sub-Chapter IV in Title 24, Ch. 25 of the Delaware Code is of no particular relevancy to this case. The Court feels compelled to point out that no provision is made in this Sub-Chapter for \u201cnotice and hearing\u201d on an application for a permit to open, establish, operate or maintain a pharmacy. The statute, Title 24 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2553, by the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d apparently makes it mandatory on the Board to issue the permit if the application meets the requirement of the statute. It has not been here contended, and it is doubted that the Board would contend it has any discretion to refuse an application if there is full compliance on the part of an applicant with the statute. What was said in <em>State v. Peoples Drug Stores, Inc., supra, </em>clearly establishes that there is a \u201cright\u201d to open a retail pharmacy if there is compliance with the health and safety measures provided in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">At one time the Court considered striking the Sub-Chapter down as unconstitutional for want of due process because of the lack of requirement for \u201cnotice and hearing\u201d by the Board on applications. Since the Court has other grounds for determining the appeal this constitutional question, see generally <em>Cantor v. Sachs, </em>18 Del. Ch. 359, 364, 162 A. 73, 75 (Ct. Ch. 1932) and <em>State ex rel. Craven v. Schorr, et al., </em>11 Terry 365, 376, 131 A. 2d 158 (Sup. Ct. 1957), although it is so obvious, will not be considered and determined. The court takes note that Appellant was not invited to or represented at the meeting held by the Board to consider Appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b42-12\">I regard this determination by Judge Christie as a holding that the \u201cBoard is in possession of satisfactory evidence that [appellant] is entitled to a permit to operate a pharmacy * * *\u201d as was alleged in the Petition for a Writ of Mandamus. This placed a burden on the Board to show good cause otherwise if the application was to be denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b42-13\">Reference is made hereafter to this letter at several points of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b43-17\">See page 5 for provisions of cited statutory provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b45-9\">A member of the Board, I might point out. I call attention to an Annotation entitled \u201cAdministrative Decision or Finding Based on Evidence Secured Outside of Hearing\u201d, to be found in 18 A. <em>L. R. </em>2d 552, where it is said at page 555:</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">\u201cAs a general proposition, it is not proper for administrative authority to base a decision of adjudicatory nature, or findings in support thereof, upon evidence or information outside the record, and in particular upon evidence obtained without the presence of \u201cand notice to the interested parties, and not made known to them prior to the decision.\u201d In <em>Radic v. Fullilove, </em>198 F. Supp. 162 (U.S.D.Ct. N.D. Calif. 1961) there is an excellent discussion of \u201cprocedural due process\u201d. The discussion emphasizes the need that procedure before an Administrative Agency must be \u201cessentially fair\u201d otherwise the party involved in the Administrative Process \u201chas not been afforded procedural due process\u201d, and this includes the party\u2019s right to be given the \u201copportunity * * * to explain, rebut, contradict or impeach\u201d the testimony and documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>relied on by the Administrative Agency for the action it takes on the matter before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">In <em>Reardon v. Dental Commission, </em>128 Conn. 116, 20 A. 2d 622 (1941) the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut dealt with the revocation of a dental license based, in part, upon evidence developed by one of the members of the Dental Commission. While the Connecticut statute required a hearing, the holding (20 A. 2d at 624) is most significant, since it too refers to the concept of \u201cdue process\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u201cSuch (personal investigation of charges by commissioners) * * * might well lead them to approach the hearing with a preconceived idea of guilt or innocence of the accused. He would, very likely, be placed in the position of having to overcome, by evidence he might produce, this idea. Moreover, such an investigation would be apt to result in violation of that requirement of due process of law that when called upon to answer shall be confronted with the evidence against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">The Supreme Court of New Jersey reached a simfiar conclusion in <em>Giordano v. City Commission of City of Newark, </em>2 N. J. 585, 67 A. 2d 454, 455:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">\u201cNo determination can be permitted to rest upon undisclosed findings for information dehors the record. If such could be the parties would be denied the essence of a hearing, they would be kept in ignorance of the things controlling the action of the Board, and due process would be flouted.\u201d See also <em>Coleman v. Watts, </em>81 So. 2d 650, 652 (Sup. Ct. Fla. 1955); <em>Mazza v. Cavicchia, </em>15 N. J. 498, 105 A. 2d 545; <em>Kerney v. Trecker, Corp. v. N. L. R. B. </em>(C.

E. 2d 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">Many of these cited cases dealt with evidence which should have been, but was not, produced at a hearing. The question of whether or not the applicant had sufficient notice of evidence to be presented prior to the hearing occasionally causes these Courts some difficulty. Such difficulty, of course, was not presented in the instant case, since no hearing was afforded the Applicant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b46-12\">Comment has already been made to the possible unconstitutionality of Sub-Chapter IV of Chapter 25 <em>Del.

It is sufficient to note here that had a hearing been held on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Appellant\u2019s application the Board could, if the evidence and circumstances justified, have shown some odious relationship between Appellant and Mr. Pastor; at least the opportunity for cross examination of Applicant-Appellant's witnesses would have provided counsel for the Board a means to establish the possible untruthfulness of the contents of the application and of the affidavit mentioned above, see page 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">I must make some reference to a letter (see footnote 4, supra), sent by the office of the Attorney General of this State to the Secretary of the Board, under date of March 20, 1962, in which the Board was advised:</p>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">\u201cthe evidence about Edward Pastor we felt that since he is now in good standing with the State of Pennsylvania and has no criminal record in Delaware would nullify any serious consideration regarding his connection with the \u2018Appellant\u2019.\u201d Ih light of this letter I am at loss to comprehend the Board\u2019s references to Mr. Pastor.

Sometimes the statute gives the Court the power to remand the case to the Agency and in other instances the statutes are silent. In light of the divergency in such statutes this is confusing to say the least. The precise \u201cmanner\u201d of review is not at all clear. An incomplete list is set forth below of statutes which do authorize court review of orders and decisions of Administrative Agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Title 2 <em>Del.

C. </em>\u00a7 541 prescribes the method of appeal from decisions of the Delaware Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission. This statute requires that Commission to make a record of the hearing and directs certification thereof to the Superior Court. The cited section provides that if the Court \u201cfinds that additional evidence should be taken, the court may take the additional evidence or remand the cause to the Commission for completion of the record. If the court finds that the Commission has made an error of law, the court shall reverse or modify the Commission\u2019s decision and render an appropriate judgment.\u201d The power to remand is specifically granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Decisions of the New Castle County Board of Adjustment are reviewable, 9 <em>Del.

That law directs that Board \u201cto return certified or sworn copies\u201d to this court of \u201cthe original papers acted upon by it\u201d. This Court is authorized to \u201ctake evidence, or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to the Court with his findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>mination of the Court shall be made.\u201d The Court is authorized to \u201creverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought up for review.\u201d There is no power of remand granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Professional employees of Boards of Education, State or otherwise, are given the right of appeal, 14 <em>Del.

The Commission is directed to send to the Superior Court \u201ccertified or sworn copies\u201d of \u201cthe original papers acted upon by it\u201d. The Court is authorized to take testimony, if found \u201cnecessary for the proper disposition of the matter\u201d. In other respects, the matter of review is comparable to that provided for review of decisions of the New Castle County Board of Adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">Provision is made, Article XV, in the newly created \u201cThe Delaware River and Bay Authority\u201d, (53 <em>Del.

The statute authorizes the Court to adopt \u201cproper rules [prescribing] the procedure to be followed in the case of such appeals\u201d; it directs that \u201cthe cause shall be determined by the Court from the record\u201d and authorizes the Court to \u201creverse, affirm or modify the award of the Board, or remand the cause to the Board for a rehearing\u201d. Again there is an express grant to remand vested in the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Title 19 <em>Del.

The Commission is directed to \u201ccertify and file with the Court all documents and papers and a transcript of all testimony taken in the matter, together with the Commission\u2019s findings of fact and decision thereon.\u201d No other direction is provided in the statute as to what action the Court may take created the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. The statute provides for Court Review \u201cto determine the reasonableness and valid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ity of any rule made pursuant\u201d to Title 19 <em>Del.

The Superior Court cannot review questions of fact by the Delaware Real Estate Commission \u201cin the absence of fraud\u201d. It is authorized to review questions of law; its jurisdiction may be invoked \u201cby certiorari, mandamus, or by any other method permissible under the rules and practices of such Court, or the laws of this State.\u201d Elaborate provision is made for notice and hearing before the Commission and opportunity given for subpoenaing of witnesses and production of testimony, but there is no statutory requirement that the Commission is to make a record.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Appeals from orders of the Public Service Commission is provided in Title 26 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 192. The appeal is to be determined from the record, appeals, and with power to make any and all rules needful or convenient in the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Suspension or revocation of licenses issued by the Delaware Racing Commission (flat racing), Title 28 <em>Del.

Laws, </em>Ch. 259, repealing Chapter 1 of Title 19 <em>Del. C., </em>the problem would be one of producing a record on which the Board\u2019s order was predicated. <em>Kaufman Construction Co. v. Holcomb, </em>357 Pa. 514, 55 A. 2d 534,174 A. L. R. 189 (1947) and <em>Ritter Finance Company, Inc. v.

C., </em>Ch. 7, Sub-Ch. II, over the formation of banks. Under Title 5 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 726 it considers and determines applications for certificates of \u201cpublic convenience and advantage\u201d for the formation of banks. The cited section provides that \u201cIf the Board refuses to issue a certificate, no further proceedings shall be had, * * It is possible that applicants might have some limited court review of such refusal, as by certiorari in this Court; <em>Bank Control of South Carolina v. Thomason (Fidelity Finance Co.), </em>236 S. C. 158, 113 S. E. 2d 544 (1960) consider some of the questions that would arise under legislation affecting this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">Title 5 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2006 provides for an appeal to the Governor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>matters relating to the approval of articles of merger or consolidation of Building and Loan Associations. His decision is not subject to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The State Bank Commission has the primary duty of considering and determining if such articles are to be approved. The Court of Chancery is empowered, 5 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2009, to appoint \u201cthree disinterested persons to appraise\u201d the value of shares of dissenters. Their award, when confirmed by the Court \u201cshall be final and conclusive\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">An \u201caggrieved\u201d person is given the right, 5 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2301(b), to have the action of the State Bank Commission reviewed by this Court in the licensing of persons engaged \u201cin the business of receiving money for forwarding or transmission\u201d. The statute directs the Court to \u201cdetermine <em>de nova, </em>and in a summary manner, all questions both of fact and law, touching upon the legality and reasonableness of\u201d the Commissioner\u2019s determination. The Court is directed to \u201crender a lawful and just judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Licensees engaged in the business of Sales Finance \u2014 which handle financing of Installment Sales Contracts relating to Motor Vehicles, (See Vol. 52 <em>Del. Laws, </em>Ch. 335), are given a right of court review, 5 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2903 (d), of the action of the State Banking Commissioner in suspending or revoking a license. The Court\u2019s power is like that granted by 5 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2301 (b), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">Appeals or Court Review of orders of the State Board of Health are granted in some limited circumstances. For instance, licensees engaged in poultry processing \u201caggrieved by decisions\u201d of the State Board of Health may appeal, 16 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 3709, to this Court. The statute provides \u201cissue shall be framed in that Court and a trial had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">Licensees or applicants for a license to manufacture soft drinks \u201cmay appeal\u201d, 16 <em>Del.

The procedure on appeal is the same as in the case of poultry processors, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">Surely there are more important situations, than those listed above, where citizens of this State can be affected by orders, judicial or quasi-Highway Department and the State Board of Health. On the other hand, the listing of these Agencies is not to be understood as inferring there are not other Agencies whose orders can leave wide effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">It is suggested that the Delaware State Bar Association and the Legislative Reference Bureau should consider the desirability of proposing to the General Assembly the enactment of a uniform statute relating to Court Review of all orders of Administrative Agencies and officials, which are judicial or quasi-judicial in nature, thus assuring a right of review of all such orders and providing for uniform procedure in the matter of all such court reviews. Such suggested uniform statute might consider application of the right of review to Accountants, Architects, Barbers, Chiropodists, Dentists, Nurses, Optometrists, Pawnbrokers, Physicians and Surgeons (including Osteopaths), Undertakers, State Planning Commission, and State Treasurer, in matters involving State Employees Pension Plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
