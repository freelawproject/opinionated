Paragraph 9 of this complaint alleged the work \u201cwas finished\u201d on September 23, 1961. Defendants\u2019 verified answer denied the complaint\u2019s allegations that the work \u201cwas finished\u201d on September 23, 1961, and alleged that the plantiff\u2019s work under his engagement with defendant Julian was completed June 8, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">As part of their verified answer defendants filed an affidavit, dated January 16, 1962, in which it was alleged and contended that plaintiff\u2019s Statement of Claim was not filed within the time permitted by 25 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2711(b) (90 days from the date of completion of plaintiff\u2019s work); that plaintiff\u2019s work was \u201cunsatisfactory, in that he did not properly grade his work\u201d so that \u201cthe paved area\u201d is filled with depressions that prevent water from draining off the premises; and asserting a counterclaim for damages \u201carising out of the faulty performance of the plaintiff\u2019s work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Defendant Julian filed an affidavit on March 5, 1962, stating (j[4) (1) that the work was started about June 1, 1960 and (2) it was completed on or before June 8, 1960. The affidavit further states on June 9,1960 plaintiff had submitted his bill to defendant julian, in the same amount as sued for, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>which bill Mr. Julian \u201crefused to pay because the plaintiff\u2019s performance of the work was unsatisfactory\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The affidavit further stated that plaintiff came to the job site about September 1960 on more than one occasion and did certain patch work in an effort to remedy his unsatisfactory performance; that \u201cthe patch work * * * did not remedy the plaintiff\u2019s unsatisfactory performance\u201d; that \u201con or about September 23, 1960,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff returned to the premises and attempted to resurface the same but his efforts * * * did not succeed in remedying his defective performance\u201d and \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s performance is entirely without value * *\u201d because the plaintiff failed to construct a proper grade for the project; that the job plaintiff \u201cdone * * * must be completely redone * *</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Plaintiff filed nothing in answer or in response to the statements appearing in the Julian affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">As part of their answer defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s Statement of Claim, \u2014 contending it had been filed too late \u2014 as a mechanic\u2019s lien proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">When defendants filed this motion and supported it by the subsequent filing of the Julian affidavit made March 5, 1962 \u201cmatters outside the pleadings\u201d were thereby injected into the case and thus, by the provisions of Rule 12(b), <em>Del. C., </em>this requires defendants\u2019 motion to \u201cbe treated as one for summary judgment\u201d and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, rather than as a Motion to Dismiss as originally labeled. See Vol. 6, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>2d Ed., \u00b656.11 [1], at page 2058. On page 2059, the author mentioned, refers to the use of affidavits under Rule 56 and states that the Rule \u201cauthorizes the use of affidavits * * * for the purpose of establishing that there is or is not a triable issue of fact\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The Julian affidavit did present facts tending to show there is not \u201ca triable issue of fact\u201d in this case and since plaintiff did not see fit to show by responsive affidavit or by deposition that the matters presented in the Julian affidavit were not true, it is proper for the Court to consider and determine the case on the record presented. It was for plaintiff to disclose any evidence he had which would have disclosed the existence of a genuine issue of fact. <em>Sparks Co. v. Huber Baking Co., 9 </em>Terry (48 Del.) 9, 96 A. 2d 456 (Super. Ct. 1953), and merely asserting it was insufficient; it must appear to the Court from the affidavits or other discovery and certainly it cannot be done by asserting, as here, factual matters in a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In their brief in support of such motion defendants cited <em>Van Der Heuvel v. Wisnulski, </em>9 Terry (48 Del.) 377, 104 A. 2d 381 (Super. Ct. 1954) and <em>Breeding v. Melson, </em>4 W. W. Harr. (34 Del) 9, 143 A. 23, 60 A. L. R. 1252 (Sup. Ct. 1927) as authorities supporting their contention advanced in their motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Plaintiff argued (Brief 4-5) he completely re-surfaced \u201cthe parking area with a finer material than originally contemplated within the contract upon the insistence of the defendants\u201d and that defendants \u201cadmitted that a complete new surfacing was completed on December 23, 1961, within the statutory period for mechanics liens\u201d. Nowhere is it shown by acceptable discovery material that plaintiff\u2019s work was satisfactory and acceptable to defendants. Just where this information came into the record, if it ever did, does not appear. I recognize the allegation of the date of completion in the complaint but this only fixed a completion date; it made no reference to any re-surfacing of the premises and the consequent acceptance by defendants of the re-surface job.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">On the contrary, the Julian affidavit shows other matters and that there was no acceptance of any re-surfaced prem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>ises, and this affidavit stands unchallenged. I cannot find any verified factual showing by affidavit or deposition or other accepted discovery of any re-surfacing of the DePolo land by plaintiffs or the acceptance of such re-surfacing by defendants in any part of the record. If plaintiff wanted to show such facts he should have done so by appropriate discovery, and this he has not chosen to do, and clearly he cannot do so in his brief and thereby seek to show existence of a genuine issue of a material fact. There is no general issue of any material fact on the record before me and I can see only a legal question to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">I find and conclude, from the record, that plaintiff performed his contract by June 8, 1960 and that it was unsatisfactory; that he made efforts to redo the work, such as they may have been, but these efforts were never accepted by defendants so as to show a later date than June 8, 1960. He may have a cause of action against Julian for such work \u2014 he argues in his brief that he did \u2014 if it is true. I do not consider this.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">I rule that defendants\u2019 motion must, on the authorities cited, be sustained and granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The case, as pleaded, does not show plaintiff\u2019s efforts, such as they may have been, were \u201cfor the erection, alteration, or repair of any structure\u201d; Title <em>25 Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2702 gives a lien to any person who has erected, altered or repaired any structure on land. Plaintiff nowhere alleges that his efforts were along such lines; to the contrary, they appear to have been limited to \u201cimprovements * * * to the land alone\u201d, such as by paving and the installation of curbing work. He does not show that his efforts were part of some over all contract for the erection of buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Under such circumstances I am of opinion that Title 25 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 2703 is applicable and since no \u201ccontract in writing, signed by the owner or owners thereof\u201d, together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>with the remaining required portions of the cited statutory section, is pleaded it would appear plaintiff cannot further maintain his action. Since there is, as stated above, another reason to grant defendants\u2019 motion, the foregoing may be unnecessary to this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">I am conscious that former Judge Herrmann ruled in <em>Whittington v. Clay\u2019s Motels, Inc. </em>(C. A. 24, 1956, New Castle County, unreported) that paving work, if it is part of a general building program may be recoverable in a mechanic\u2019s lien proceeding. Judge Herrmann\u2019s ruling was made <em>after </em>trial and undoubtedly there was a showing which would have justified his conclusion in that case that the paving work was an \u201cintegral part\u201d of the general undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In that cited case plaintiff sought to recover for labor and materials in the construction of a driveway about a motel; here there is nothing which shows a general undertaking to construct a motel except by way of references in the briefs. It does not appear in plaintiff\u2019s Statement of Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Since I have heretofore ruled, <em>Greenhouse v. Duncan Village Corp. et al., </em>5 Storey 102, 184 A. 2d 479, 482 (1962), that a statement of claim in a mechanic\u2019s lien proceeding may not be amended, there is some considerable doubt as to whether the plaintiff could now amend his complaint to allege the necessary \u201ccontract in writing\u201d, assuming that there was one or other facts which could bring the case within Judge Herrmann\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">An order may be presented on notice providing that defendants\u2019 motion should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-10\">In his brief plaintiff argues this date should have been September 23, 1961; no affidavit was filed by plaintiff except as appears in his verified complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
