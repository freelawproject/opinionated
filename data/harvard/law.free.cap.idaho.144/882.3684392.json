JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">Appellant, Andrew Navarro (Navarro), directly appeals the decision of the Magistrate Judge granting legal and physical custody of the parties\u2019 minor child, Jessica Morgan Navarro-Yonkers (Jessica), to Respondent, Laura Yonkers (Yonkers).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-17\">Navarro and Yonkers met in September 2001 and began residing together at the end of 2001. They moved from Carson City, Nevada to St. Maries, Idaho near the end of 2001. Navarro and Yonkers never married. Jessica was born November 25, 2002. There is conflicting testimony whether a pregnancy and miscarriage occurred prior to Jessica\u2019s birth due to alcohol abuse by Yonkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-19\">Yonkers has four children including Jessica. Two of her children, Brandon and Justin, are subject to a 1999 guardianship order, granting custody to Yonkers\u2019 parents, Katherine and Doug Yonkers. A third child, Rachel, resides with Yonkers and Jessica. Navarro has two children including Jessica. Navarro\u2019s other child is the result of his first marriage. Navarro\u2019s other child resides with his wife in Oklahoma. Navarro and his wife have been separated for awhile, but have never formally divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-20\">Both parties were arrested in November of 2003 for methamphetamine use. There is conflicting testimony by both parties regarding the nature and extent of the other\u2019s drug use. Alcohol is Yonkers\u2019 drug of choice and methamphetamine is Navarro\u2019s. Jessica and Rachel were placed in temporary custody of the Department of Health and Welfare. Navarro and Yonkers entered the drug court program following the arrest. Yonkers was involuntarily removed from the program in August 2004 when she moved from Idaho to Nevada without permission. Navarro was removed a week later when Carlis Hanlan (an acquaintance of Yonkers) informed police of methamphetamine production equipment on the Navarro-Yonkers premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-21\">Yonkers permanently took Jessica to Nevada in August 2004. Yonkers failed to inform Navarro of the move or the intent to move Jessica to Nevada. In Nevada, Yonkers filed a temporary restraining order against Navarro for alleged physical abuse. Navarro, in his brief, states that the evidence used in the restraining order was \u201cweak,\u201d but does not allege that it was false. Navarro filed a custody petition in Idaho the day after Yonkers and Jessica left. In January 2005, Navarro moved to Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-22\">The parties stipulated to an interim custody order in December 2004. A temporary custody order was issued on July 12, 2005 following a hearing awarding legal and physical custody of Jessica to Yonkers. Navarro was awarded joint custody for 14 days of each month, the exchange to occur at the Reno-Tahoe airport, with Navarro paying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>transportation costs to Hawaii. The final child custody decree, and subject of this appeal, was entered March 31,2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">The following issues are presented to this court on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-5\">1. Whether Yonkers is estopped from asserting her fitness as a parent when a Nevada guardianship order affects Yonkers\u2019 rights regarding two other minor children</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-6\">a. Whether the court erred in refusing to admit into evidence a certified copy of the Nevada guardianship order as Plaintiffs [Navarro\u2019s] exhibit 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-7\">2. Whether the court erred in denying Navarro\u2019s motion for a psychological evaluation of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-8\">3. Whether the court erred in refusing to admit into evidence a tape of Yonkers\u2019 testimony from a previous hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-9\">4. Whether the court erred by treating Yonkers\u2019 unilateral move from Idaho to Nevada as a factor in the physical custody award rather than a determinative condition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-10\">a. Whether the court\u2019s treatment of Yonkers\u2019 move to Nevada was against prior precedent as stated in <em>Hopper v. Hopper, </em>144 Idaho 624, 167 P.3d 761 (2007).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-11\">5. Whether there is sufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s award of primary physical custody to Yonkers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">The Magistrate court\u2019s findings of fact will be upheld if supported by substantial and competent evidence. <em>Leavitt v. Leavitt, </em>142 Idaho 664, 668, 132 P.3d 421, 425 (2006) citing <em>Roe Family Services v. Doe, </em>139 Idaho 930, 934, 88 P.3d 749, 753 (2004). \u201cWith regard to child custody determinations, these are committed to the sound discretion of the magistrate court and will not be overturned on appeal unless such discretion is abused.\u201d <em>Riggers v. Riggers, </em>103 Idaho 550, 555, 650 P.2d 692, 697 (1982). The trial court\u2019s decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Roberts v. Roberts, </em>138 Idaho 401, 403, 64 P.3d 327, 329 (2003). An abuse of discretion does not exist if the trial court (1) recognizes the issue as one of discretion, (2) acts within the limits of discretion and consistently with the legal standards that apply, and (3) reaches the conclusion through an exercise of reason. <em>Roberts, </em>138 Idaho at 403, 64 P.3d at 329 citing <em>Sun Valley Shopping Ctr. v. Idaho Power Co., </em>119 Idaho 87, 94, 803 P.2d 993, 1000 (1991). This Court will freely review a lower court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Leavitt, </em>142 Idaho at 668, 132 P.3d at 425 citing <em>Roe Family Services, </em>139 Idaho at 934, 88 P.3d at 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-16\">Yonkers is not estopped from arguing her fitness as a parent regardless of a Nevada guardianship order affecting her rights in two other minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-17\"><em>Res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel are questions of law, which this Court will freely review. <em>Lohman v. Flynn, </em>139 Idaho 312, 320, 78 P.3d 379, 387 (2003). <em>\u201cRes judicata </em>is comprised of claim preclusion (true <em>res </em>judicata) and issue preclusion (collateral estoppel). Under the principles of claim preclusion, a valid final judgment rendered on the merits ... is an absolute bar to a subsequent action between the same parties upon the same claim.\u201d <em>Hindmarsh v. Mock, </em>138 Idaho 92, 94, 57 P.3d 803, 805 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-18\">Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, may be applied to prior judgments, estopping a person from arguing a finding or verdict that has already been rendered. <em>Anderson v. City of Pocatello, </em>112 Idaho 176, 183, 731 P.2d 171, 177 (1986). The test of when collateral estoppel should apply is (1) whether the party had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue, (2) whether the issue decided in the previous litigation is identical to the current issue presented, (3) whether the issue was actually decided in the previous litigation and whether the issue was necessary to the prior judgment, (4) whether the final judgment was on the merits and (5) whether the party who the judgment is asserted against was a party or in privity with the party to the prior judgment. <em>Anderson, </em>112 Idaho at 183-184, 731 P.2d at 177-179 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-19\">In the present ease, a stipulated guardianship order from 1999 exists for two of Yonkers\u2019 children. As to those two children, Yonkers has stipulated that she is an unfit parent. The Nevada guardianship or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>der is temporary according to Nevada statute, and may be revoked at any time. N.R.S. \u00a7 159.1905. Navarro was not a party to the guardianship order and the order does not address Yonkers\u2019 fitness as a parent as it relates to Jessica. Therefore, <em>res judicata </em>does not apply because Navarro was not a party to the first action and the first action did not address Yonkers\u2019 ability to parent Jessica. By definition, <em>res judicata </em>only applies to \u201csubsequent action between the same parties upon the same claim.\u201d <em>Hindmarsh, </em>138 Idaho at 94, 57 P.3d at 805. Additionally, collateral estoppel does not apply because the Nevada guardianship addresses a different issue. Specifically, the Nevada guardianship addresses the issue of Yonkers\u2019 fitness to parent Brandon and Justin, whereas, the issue in the present case is Yonkers\u2019 fitness to parent Jessica.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Under I.C. \u00a7 32-ll-303(a), a valid guardianship order from another jurisdiction is applicable in this jurisdiction as it relates to the children listed in the guardianship order. However, the court is not bound to apply the findings in the guardianship order to other children. The magistrate judge correctly recognized the Nevada guardianship order and considered the order when evaluating \u201c[t]he character and circumstances of all individuals involved\u201d. I.C. \u00a7 32-717(e). A trial court may consider a guardianship order relating to children that are not part of the custody dispute, but the lower court is not bound by the findings as it relates to the disputed child under the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. A guardianship order from another jurisdiction, when it applies to different children and a different timeframe, is merely another factor to consider when determining parental fitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\"><em>Jain </em>does not apply to this case because Jessica was not a child in issue to the previous guardianship order.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">\u201cA court of this state [Idaho] shall recognize and enforce a child custody determination of a court of another state ...\u201d I.C. \u00a7 32-ll-303(a). A child custody determination places the burden on the parent to show that conditions have changed. <em>Jain v. Priest, </em>30 Idaho 273, 274, 164 P. 364, 366 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">In <em>Jain, </em>the court found that a determination of unfitness as a parent shifted the burden to the parent to show that the circumstances had changed. <em>Jain, </em>30 Idaho at 274, 164 P. at 366. In that case, the parents petitioned the court to revoke a finding of parental unfitness after both of the children had been removed from the home. <em>Id. </em>at 273, 164 P. at 365. In Nevada, a guardianship for more than one child may be severed and removed as it relates to only one of the children. N.R.S. \u00a7 159-057. Therefore, a parent may be fit to parent one child, but unfit to parent a second. Here, the burden never shifted to Yonkers because there was no child custody determination relating to Jessica.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">The court did not commit reversible error in refusing to admit the guardianship order.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">During trial, Navarro also attempted to submit a certified copy of the guardianship order into evidence. Yonkers\u2019 objected on the grounds of hearsay and the witness was not the custodian of the document. The court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Idaho Rules of Evidence allow for the admission of public records as an exception to the hearsay rule. I.R.E. 803(8). The Nevada guardianship order, as a certified copy of a public record, falls within this exception and should have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">The following documents and testimony were, however, admitted into evidence regarding the guardianship order; (1) petition for appointment of temporary and permanent co-guardians, (2) stipulation and consent to appointment of co-guardians, (3) consent to guardianship, and (4) Yonkers\u2019 testimony that two of her children were subject to a guardianship order. The document refused was the order granting petition for guardianship and for issuance of letters of guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">The court did not commit reversible error in refusing to admit the order for guardianship. The order was cumulative, as stated by Navarro in his brief, and provided no additional evidence of the guardianship. Any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>error committed by failing to admit the guardianship order was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">The court did not err by denying Navarro\u2019s motion to order psychological testing of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The court <em>may </em>order a party to submit to mental or physical examination when the mental or physical condition of the party is in controversy. I.R.C.P. 35(a). The decision to order psychological testing is within the discretion of the trial court. A trial court acts within its discretion when it (1) recognizes the decision as one of discretion, (2) acts within the outer limits of that discretion and (3) reaches its conclusion through an exercise of reason. <em>Roberts, </em>138 Idaho at 403, 64 P.3d at 329 citing <em>Sun Valley Shopping Ctr., </em>119 Idaho at 94, 803 P.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">In the present case, the court reserved ruling on the motion at the July 12, 2005 hearing and ordered that the parties submit medical records for <em>in camera </em>review. After reviewing the parties\u2019 mental and physical health records, the court concluded that an order for psychological testing was unnecessary. Both parties submitted substantial records of recent medical and mental health histories. The magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion. He recognized his ability to make the decision, and after reviewing the substantial medical records of each party, determined that there were sufficient records of each party\u2019s mental state before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">The court did not commit reversible error by refusing admission of the tape of Yonkers\u2019 previous testimony into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">The Idaho Rules of Evidence allow for the admission of official transcripts into evidence, as long as the transcript is an official transcript as defined in Rule 27(d) of the Idaho Court Administrative Rules. I.R.E. 1005(b). An official transcript is the court reporter\u2019s transcript. I.C.A.R. 27(d). If the court reporter has not made a transcript, then a transcript prepared from tape of the proceeding is the transcript as long as it was prepared by the court reporter. I.C.A.R. 27(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">During trial, Navarro\u2019s counsel alleged an inconsistency in Yonkers\u2019 testimony. At the July 12 hearing Yonkers stated \u201c... my girlfriend has her [Jessica] in Portland right now because she drove up here to visit, and she\u2019s taking\u2014driving them back. And I could ask her to drive her back here [Idaho].\u201d At the November hearing Yonkers stated that her girlfriend took Jessica a few days before the July hearing to Nevada, rather than Portland. The magistrate judge denied Navarro\u2019s motion to submit a tape of the July 12 hearing into evidence, but took judicial notice of the hearing \u201cto the extent that I [magistrate judge] recall what occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">A judge may take judicial notice of personal recollection of prior proceedings to the extent that the judge recalls what occurred. <em>State v. Nunez, </em>138 Idaho 636, 643, 67 P.3d 831, 838 (2003). However, the previous hearing must be transcribed so that any alleged error in such judicial notice is subject to appellate review. <em>Matthews v. State, </em>122 Idaho 801, 808, 839 P.2d 1215, 1222 (1992). Because this Court was provided with a transcript of the July 12 hearing, judicial notice of the magistrate judge\u2019s personal recollection of the testimony was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">The judge committed harmless error when he failed to admit the tape of the July 12 hearing. The tape is not admissible as an official transcript under I.R.E 1005(b). However, the tape is admissible to impeach Yonkers as a witness under I.R.E. 607. This error is harmless under I.R.C.P. 61 because failure to impeach is not inconsistent with substantial justice and does not affect a substantial right of the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">The Court did not err in the treatment of Yonkers\u2019 unilateral departure from Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">Navarro argues that Yonkers\u2019 unilateral move to Nevada violated his rights as stated by this Court in <em>Hopper v. Hopper, </em>144 Idaho 624, 167 P.3d 761 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">In <em>Hopper, </em>the mother absconded with the child to Montana and filed for divorce obtaining a domestic violence protection order. <em>Hopper, </em>144 Idaho at 625, 167 P.3d at 762. The father filed for divorce in Idaho and the cases were consolidated, with the Montana action being dismissed. <em>Id. </em>The lower court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>awarded legal custody to the mother based on testimony that the child\u2019s bond with the mother was greater. <em>Id. </em>at 626, 167 P.3d at 763. This Court found that the father\u2019s rights were prejudiced by the mother\u2019s move and unfounded domestic violence order and that \u201c[grossing over these facts and going to the end result that the mother has a greater relationship with the child than the father creates an untenable condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627, 167 P.3d at 764. This Court then ordered that the child be returned to Idaho so that the father may attempt a relationship with the child during the course of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>The lower court\u2019s decision was vacated and remanded. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\"><em>Hopper </em>mirrors this case only in the sense that the mother left the jurisdiction with the child. However, in the present case, Navarro was able to maintain a relationship with Jessica throughout the course of the proceedings. In <em>Hopper, </em>the father had trouble locating the child and fought vigorously throughout the proceedings to have the child returned to the jurisdiction. Here, an interim custody order was entered by stipulation in December 2004 and a temporary custody order was entered July 2005. Navarro had visitation with Jessica under the December 2004 order and visitation under the July 2005 order. Throughout the course of the proceedings the lower court was able to hear testimony regarding Navarro\u2019s relationship with Jessica. Navarro\u2019s equal rights to Jessica were not prejudiced by Yonkers\u2019 move to Nevada. Although, in no way does this Court condone Yonkers\u2019 behavior, it cannot be claimed that the lower court failed to provide Navarro an opportunity to establish a relationship with Jessica. The lower court fully took into account Yonkers\u2019 move to Nevada and did not abuse its discretion in the weight the move was assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\"><em>Hopper </em>was not a \u201cmove-away\u201d case, as argued by Navarro. A \u201cmove-away\u201d case exists when a parent leaves the jurisdiction with the child subsequent to the commencement of child custody proceedings. Here, as in <em>Hopper, </em>the child and parent had left the jurisdiction prior to the commencement of proceedings. Neither <em>Hopper, </em>nor this case is a true \u201cmove-away\u201d case.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The lower court did not err in treating Yonkers\u2019 unilateral move to Nevada as a factor rather than a determinative condition in the child custody determination. A unilateral move may relate to the child\u2019s best interest; however, prior cases suggest that the court must elaborate how the move relates. Although, a lower court must address a unilateral move in its findings, it is not required to grant custody based purely on that move.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">The evidence is sufficient to support the verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">A judge shall consider all relevant factors when making a child custody determination. I.C. \u00a7 32-717(1). Child custody determinations are made in the best interest of the child. I.C. \u00a7 32-717(1). Relevant factors may include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-10\">(a) [t]he wishes of the child\u2019s parent or parents as to his or her custody; (b) [t]he wishes of the child as to his or her custodian; (c) [t]he interaction and interrelationship of the child with his or her parent or parents, and his or her siblings; (d) [t]he child\u2019s adjustment to his or her home, school and community; (e) [t]he character and circumstances of all individuals involved; (f) [t]he need to promote continuity and stability in the life of the child; and (g) [djomestie violence as defined in section 39-6303, Idaho Code, whether or not in the presence of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">I.C. \u00a7 32-717(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">\u201cAppellate courts ... are not permitted to substitute their own view of the evidence for that of the trial court, nor to make credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Pieper, </em>125 Idaho at 669, 873 P.2d at 923 citing <em>Brammer v. Brammer, </em>93 Idaho 671, 674, 471 P.2d 58, 61 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">In making the decision in the present case, the magistrate judge heard testimony that; (a) both parents desired legal custody of the child; (b) Jessica was too young to make her wishes known as to which parent she desires as her custodian; (c) Jessica interacts with Yonkers\u2019 other children and relates to both her mother (Yonkers) and her father (Navarro); (d) Jessica is involved in numerous activities in Carson City, Nevada and that Nevada has a strong family support system for Jessica; (e) Yonkers has a guard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>ianship order for two of her other kids, but continues to maintain a relationship, while Navarro has failed to maintain a stable relationship with his previous child; (f)Yonkers unilaterally moved to Nevada without Navarro\u2019s knowledge; (g) Jessica has adapted to life in Carson City and her pre-school program and interacts with her brothers, sisters and grandparents; and (h) all the evidence presented regarding domestic violence was \u201cweak,\u201d but Navarro is the controlling personality in the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">The Magistrate Judge, in his findings, noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-5\">[b]oth [Yonkers and Navarro] have engaged in conduct toward each other attempting to interfere with and frustrate the other party\u2019s efforts to parent Jessica. [Yonkers] has had a history of substance abuse and mental health issues that do not cast a favorable light on her ability to parent. She has also had four children, all by different fathers ... Andrew has had little contact with [his other child]. The court is also concerned about Andrew\u2019s history of substance abuse and mental health issues. On a more positive note, at the time of trial and for the few months prior to the trial, both parties seem to have matured. Both appeared at trial seemingly drug free with current family support systems in place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">From the testimony and the court\u2019s findings, it is clear, that neither party substantially excels above the other as a parent. The Magistrate Judge made his determination of custody based on substantial evidence. The Magistrate Judge did not abuse his discretion and the decision below is affirmed. Costs awarded to Respondent Yonkers.</p>\n<judges id=\"b921-7\">Justices BURDICK, J. JONES and HORTON, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b921-8\">Chief Justice EISMANN,</author>\n<p id=\"AyQ\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">I concur in the majority opinion, but write only to further discuss the applicability of <em>Hopper v. Hopper, </em>144 Idaho 624, 167 P.3d 761 (2007), to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">\u201cThe welfare and best interest of the child is of paramount importance when awarding custody.\u201d <em>Gustaves v. Gustaves, </em>138 Idaho 64, 68, 57 P.3d 775, 779 (2002); I.C. \u00a7 32-717(1). Except in cases where one parent is a habitual perpetrator of domestic violence, there is a presumption that it is in the best interests of a child to have frequent and continuing contact with both parents. I.C. \u00a7 32-717B(l), (4), &amp; (5). Therefore, it is presumed that it is not in the child\u2019s best interests to permit one parent to unilaterally remove a child from the community where the parents and child resided when such move prevents the other parent from having frequent and continuing contact with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">In <em>Hopper, </em>the mother unilaterally removed the child from Boise, Idaho, where the parties had resided with their child, to Montana. Her conduct prevented the father from having frequent and continuing contact with their child, and was presumptively not in the child\u2019s best interests. Therefore, we held, \u201cThe mother should have been ordered to return the child to Idaho where the father might exercise his rights as an equal parent and have this case decided with the underlying legal and social principle that it is the best interests of a child to have a continuing relationship with both parents.\u201d 144 Idaho at 627, 167 P.3d at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">In the instant case, Navarro stipulated that Yonkers could have physical custody of the child in Nevada while this ease was pending. He then moved to Hawaii. Ordering the child returned to Idaho would not have increased Navarro\u2019s ability to have frequent and continuing contact with the child. Although the magistrate judge must ensure that Navarro had the opportunity to have frequent and continuing contact with his child, it was Navarro\u2019s responsibility to take advantage of that opportunity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
