The magistrate judge did not inform him prior to the plea that under Idaho Code Section 18-4007(3)(d) he could be ordered to pay child support for the victim\u2019s children. At sentencing the magistrate court ordered him to pay child support for the victim\u2019s five minor children in addition to license suspension, fine, jail sentence, probation, and community service. Heredia filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea based on the fact that he had not been advised of the child support consequence prior to his plea. The magistrate court denied the motion based on its finding that Heredia failed to demonstrate manifest injustice since he and his counsel knew the court could order child support and that child support is a collateral consequence of which Heredia need not be informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-23\">Heredia appealed to the district court which reversed the magistrate court\u2019s decision, concluding that child support is a direct consequence of which Heredia should have been informed before he pled guilty and that Heredia established manifest injustice because the record did not show that he knew the court could order him to pay child sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>port. The State appeals, alleging that the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">When reviewing a decision of the district court acting in its appellate capacity, the Supreme Court will review the record and the magistrate court\u2019s decision independently of, but with due regard for, the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Doe v. State, </em>137 Idaho 758, 760, 53 P.3d 341, 343 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">A motion to withdraw a guilty plea brought after sentencing will only be granted to correct manifest injustice. Idaho Criminal Rule 33(c); <em>State v. Huffman, </em>137 Idaho 886, 887, 55 P.3d 879, 880 (Ct.App.2002). Because a guilty plea by a criminal defendant waives certain constitutional rights, including the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to a jury trial, and the right of confrontation, a guilty plea will only be upheld if the entire record demonstrates that the waiver was made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. <em>Ray v. State, </em>133 Idaho 96, 99, 982 P.2d 931, 934 (1999); <em>accord State v. Colyer, </em>98 Idaho 32, 33-34, 557 P.2d 626, 627-28 (1976). Manifest injustice occurs if this standard requiring a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver is not met. <em>Huffman, </em>137 Idaho at 887, 55 P.3d at 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">THE POSSIBILITY OF CHILD SUPPORT IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF A GUILTY PLEA TO VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Heredia pled guilty to vehicular manslaughter, defined in I.C. \u00a7 18-4006(3)(c) as \u201cvehicular \u2014 in which the operation of a motor vehicle is a significant cause contributing to the death because of: ... (c) the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to a felony, without gross negligence.\u201d The possible punishments for non-felony vehicular manslaughter as described in I.C. \u00a7 18-4007(3) are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">(c)For a violation of section 18-4006 3.(c), Idaho Code, by a fine of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000), or by a jail sentence not exceeding one (1) year, or by both such fine and jail sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">(d) In addition to the foregoing, any person convicted of a violation of section 18-4006 3., Idaho Code, which resulted in the death of the parent or parents of minor children may be ordered by the court to pay support for each such minor child until the child reaches the age of eighteen (18) years. Support shall be established in accordance with the child support guidelines then in effect, and the nonpayment of such support shall be subject to enforcement and collection by the surviving parent or guardian of the child in the same manner that other child support orders are enforced as provided by law. In no event shall the child support judgment or order imposed by the court under this section be paid or indemnified by the proceeds of any liability insurance policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-13\">(e) In addition to the foregoing, the driver\u2019s license of any person convicted of a violation of section 18-4006 3., Idaho Code, may be suspended for a time determined by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">Heredia was not informed prior to his plea of the provision in I.C. \u00a7 18-4007(3)(d) that he might be ordered to pay child support. A guilty plea will only be upheld if the entire record demonstrates that the waiver was made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. <em>Ray, </em>133 Idaho at 99, 982 P.2d at 934; <em>Colyer, </em>98 Idaho at 33-34, 557 P.2d at 627-28. There is a prima facie showing that a plea was entered into knowingly and voluntarily when the minimum requirements of I.C.R. 11 are met. <em>Ray, </em>133 Idaho at 99, 982 P.2d at 934. Idaho Criminal Rule 11 states that when a defendant in Idaho enters a guilty plea \u201cthe record of the entire proceedings, including reasonable inferences therefrom, must show: ... the defendant was informed of the consequences of the plea, including minimum and maximum punishments, and other direct consequences which may apply.\u201d I.C.R. 11(c)(2). The trial court is not required to inform a defendant of consequences that are collateral or indirect. <em>Huffman, </em>137 Idaho at 887, 55 P.3d at 880; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Ray, </em>133 Idaho at 99-101, 982 P.2d at 934-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The Court discussed three factors in <em>Ray: </em>(1) the defendant\u2019s power to prevent the consequence; (2) the punitive or remedial nature of the consequence; and (3) the amount of control the sentencing judge has over imposing the consequence. <em>Ray, </em>133 Idaho at 99-101, 982 P.2d at 934-36. The \u201cpower to prevent\u201d analysis infers that where a possible consequence is within the defendant\u2019s power to prevent, such as persistent violator status, it is collateral to a guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 99, 982 P.2d at 934. The \u201camount of control\u201d discussion by the Court infers that where a judge has no control over a consequence, such as mandatory registration on the sex offender watch list, it is collateral to a guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 101, 982 P.2d at 936. These factors indicate that a direct consequence is involved where a judge has a large amount of control over the consequence and the defendant had no power to prevent its occurrence. In <em>Ray, </em>the Court also assessed the remedial or punitive nature of the consequence in determining whether sex offender registration was a direct or collateral consequence, concluding that registering was not a deterrent, that the primary intent of the legislature was informative, that it was not excessive in relation to its non-punitive purpose, and that a defendant can petition to be relieved of the duty to register. <em>Id. </em>at 99-101, 982 P.2d at 934-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Analysis of the factors discussed in <em>Ray </em>lead to the conclusion that child support is a direct consequence of a guilty plea to vehicular manslaughter. Heredia had no power to prevent the consequence of child support. The judge had control of the consequence of child support. Doubtless there are remedial elements in the possibility of child support in the vehicular manslaughter statute. However, it is also clear that there is a strong punitive intent in the statute. The possibility is listed under I.C. \u00a7 18-4007, entitled \u201cPunishment for Manslaughter.\u201d Also showing the punitive nature of the consequence is the provision that \u201c[i]n no event shall\u201d the child support be paid or indemnified by proceeds of a liability insurance policy. I.C. \u00a7 18 \u2014 4007(3)(d). If the child support were purely remedial in nature, one of the ways to ensure payment would be through an insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Part of knowingly and intelligently pleading guilty involves understanding the nature of the consequences which the Court may impose. This includes analysis of the disproportionate nature of the consequence when compared to the other consequences of which the defendant was informed. Heredia was told of the possibility of a maximum $2,000 fine, a year of jail time, and suspension of his driving privileges. Child support for five minor children until they reach the age of 18 is of major magnitude in comparison to the financial threat of the fine of which he was advised. Heredia should have been advised of the potential by the magistrate court before entering a plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">HEREDIA MAY WITHDRAW HIS GUILTY PLEA</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">The State argues that Heredia did not establish manifest injustice, pointing to the fact that his attorney argued against child support in his sentencing memorandum and orally at the sentencing hearing. Heredia did not indicate that he did not know child support was a possible consequence when the magistrate asked if he wanted to say anything. The magistrate court inferred that Heredia knew about the possibility of paying child support based upon his attorney\u2019s arguments and his failure to express surprise when child support was addressed at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">Manifest injustice will be found if the plea was not taken in compliance with the constitutional due process standards requiring that a guilty plea be entered into voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. <em>Huffman, </em>137 Idaho at 887, 55 P.3d at 880. While I.C.R. 11 meets this standard, it has not been held to be constitutionally mandated in order to fulfill the requirement of a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent plea. <em>State v. Weber, </em>140 Idaho 89, 95, 90 P.3d 314, 320 (2004). The record of the entire proceedings must affirmatively show that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>was informed of that consequence before the plea was accepted. <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>117 Idaho 292, 294-95, 787 P.2d 278, 280-81 (1990) (citing <em>Colyer, </em>98 Idaho at 35, 557 P.2d at 629). This can be shown by statements other than from the defendant, such as statements by the defendant\u2019s counsel that the defendant has been fully informed. <em>Id. </em>This does not stand for the proposition that knowledge of the defendant\u2019s attorney can be imputed to the defendant absent evidence that the knowledge of the attorney has been communicated to the defendant. Heredia was informed of the constitutional rights he was giving up. The magistrate court informed Heredia of the possible penalties by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">I\u2019m free to impose any lawful sentence for vehicular manslaughter which includes a fine of up to \u2014 let me double-check this. I want to make sure I don\u2019t state it incorrectly. This is not amounting to a felony. It\u2019s charged under 3(c). Okay. Without gross negligence. I\u2019m free to impose a fine of up to $2,000. I\u2019m free to impose up to one year in jail or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">In addition to that, I may suspend your driver\u2019s license for a time to be determined by the Court. And since there\u2019s not a cap on that, I think that arguably the Court could permanently suspend your driving privileges. So do you understand that those are the maximum penalties and that I\u2019m free to impose any penalty up to the maximum?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The record does not show that the defendant was informed of the consequence of child support. It was not listed as a consequence of the plea when Heredia entered his guilty plea. The only mention of child support in the record is at sentencing. This is not \u201cbefore a plea of guilty is accepted\u201d as required by I.C.R. 11. Heredia may withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The decision of the magistrate court denying Heredia\u2019s motion to withdraw guilty plea is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b131-10\">Justices TROUT, EISMANN, BURDICK and JONES concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
