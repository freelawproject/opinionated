As a result of disputes arising during construction, the Frittses filed suit against Liddle &amp; Moeller for damages and removal of a lien, alleging twenty-five causes of action based on allegations of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, negligence, violation of the Idaho Consumer Protection Act, and conversion. Liddle &amp; Moeller counterclaimed for damages and sought attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-21\">The matter proceeded to a court trial. No transcript of the proceedings was requested or prepared on appeal and it is therefore impossible to determine what evidence was presented regarding the parties\u2019 agreement or actions beyond what is recited in the district court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (Findings). What is provided to us is an estimate prepared by defendants Liddle &amp; Moeller. The document is unsigned and simply indicates Liddle &amp; Moeller\u2019s estimate of some of the costs associated with building a house for the Frittses. In its Findings, the district court concluded that \u201cExhibit 1 [the estimate] did not constitute a complete meeting of the minds between the parties and material terms were omitted.\u201d Nevertheless, the trial court apparently recognized that some agreement between the parties existed, and that some work was done in furtherance of that agreement. Rick Moeller and Steve Fritts are brothers-in-law, and the district court noted this in concluding that their business relationship was informal and was not at arm\u2019s length. The district court ultimately concluded that both parties had received what they were entitled to as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>result of their agreement: Liddle &amp; Moeller had received \u201cfair value\u201d for the work performed and material provided, and the Frittses had received \u201cfair value\u201d for the construction completed on their home. The court denied relief to both parties, but found that Liddle &amp; Moeller was the prevailing party in a commercial transaction and was therefore entitled to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Within fourteen days of the district court\u2019s decision, the Frittses moved for a new trial on July 29, 2004. The Frittses alleged error in the Findings made by the district court and in the court\u2019s failure to address the Frittses\u2019 consumer protection claim. Thereafter, on August 2, 2004, the district judge entered a judgment in accordance with his earlier decision. Within fourteen days of entry of judgment, the Frittses filed a revised motion for a new trial. Neither the motion for new trial nor the amended motion for new trial was noticed up for hearing. Liddle &amp; Moeller filed a memorandum of costs and fees, to which the Frittses objected, and on November 9, 2004, the district court entered an order determining an amount for attorney fees. \u201cConsidering the relative claims of the parties, the Defendants prevailed,\u201d concluded the court. Following the court\u2019s order on attorney fees, the court entered a supplemental judgment on November 16, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Two months later, on January 12, 2005, the Frittses moved to amend their motion for a new trial, or in the alternative, to alter or amend the judgment. The district court denied the motion, finding in a February 14, 2005, order that the Frittses\u2019 motion was not timely made. The Frittses again moved for a new trial, or in the alternative to amend judgment, on March 8, 2005. The district court heard arguments on this motion on May 20, 2005, and denied the Frittses\u2019 motion on June 1, 2005. Subsequently, the Frittses filed an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">This Court reviews the decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gunter v. Murphy\u2019s Lounge, LLC, </em>141 Idaho 16, 30, 105 P.3d 676, 690 (2005), citing <em>Warren v. Sharp, </em>139 Idaho 599, 603, 83 P.3d 773, 777 (2003). In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial, this Court does not assume error on appeal; rather, the party assigning error must affirmatively show it. <em>Student Loan Fund of Idaho, Inc. v. Duerner, </em>131 Idaho 45, 54, 951 P.2d 1272, 1281 (1997). The appellant has the responsibility to include exhibits and transcripts of hearings in the record before the appellate court. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen the record on appeal does not contain the evidence taken into account by the district court, this Court must necessarily presume that the evidence justifies the decision and that the findings are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Idaho Code section 12-120(3) mandates an award of fees to the prevailing party in a suit involving a commercial transaction. <em>Hayden Lake Fire Protection Dist. v. Alcorn, </em>141 Idaho 307, 313, 109 P.3d 161, 167. Whether a district court has correctly determined that a case is based on a \u201ccommercial transaction\u201d for the purpose of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) is a question of law. <em>Great Plains Equipment, Inc. v. Northwest Pipeline Corp., </em>136 Idaho 466, 470, 36 P.3d 218, 222 (2001). This Court exercises free review over questions of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">\u201cThe award of costs as a matter of right and discretionary costs is subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, 36 P.3d at 226, citing I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(C, D); <em>Perkins v. U.S. Transformer West, </em>132 Idaho 427, 431, 974 P.2d 73, 77 (1999). The party opposing the award of costs bears the burden of demonstrating an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Great Plains Equipment, Inc., </em>136 Idaho at 474, 36 P.3d at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ADQ\">A. Motion for new trial</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">1. Motion to amend motion for a new trial</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">We first address the Frittses\u2019 claim of error in the district court\u2019s denial of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>January 12, 2005, motion to amend their motion for a new trial, or in the alternative to amend the judgment. In denying the Frittses\u2019 January 12, 2005, motion to amend their motion for a new trial, the district court reasoned that the Frittses\u2019 delay of almost two months in filing their motion to amend their motion was inappropriate under the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">We conclude that the district court was correct in finding the motion to amend untimely. Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 59 provides for the filing of a motion for a new trial within fourteen days. I.R.C.P. 59(b)-(e). This very limited time period encourages parties to act promptly in raising issues they wish the trial court to address with respect to a new trial. While the rules do not speak to a motion to amend the motion for a new trial, they clearly do speak to the time frame within which motions for a new trial, in whatever form, must be filed. The Frittses motion to amend was filed some five months after the original entry of judgment and the original and revised motions on which it was predicated. To allow a party to file a motion for a new trial within fourteen days of judgment and thereafter amend the motion at will in order to raise other issues would circumvent the time limitations set forth by Rule 59. Such a practice would violate the purpose and intent of the rule. The Frittses\u2019 motion to amend was not timely, and the district court was correct in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">2. Motion for a new trial</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">As to the Frittses\u2019 original motion for a new trial, we have no basis on which to determine whether the district court was correct in denying the Frittses\u2019 motion for a new trial. In their motion, the Frittses challenged the district court\u2019s Findings. There is no transcript of the trial and we are therefore unable to review the factual findings made by the district court and the evidentiary basis for those findings. In the absence of a proper record on appeal, we must assume there is substantial competent evidence to support the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>See Student Loan Fund of Idaho, Inc. v. Duerner, </em>131 Idaho 45, 951 P.2d 1272 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The Frittses also allege that the district court erred as a matter of law by relying upon a theory, \u201cfair value,\u201d not pled by either party and that the district court erred in declining to find a contract when both parties had alleged a contract existed. A close reading of the Findings indicates the trial court concluded that the parties failed to reach a specific agreement as to some terms and that \u201cExhibit 1\u201d (the estimate) was not the parties\u2019 agreement, rather than finding no contractual agreement was reached at all. In using the phrase \u201cfair value,\u201d the district judge simply recognized each party was entitled to receive that for which they had bargained. Under the district court\u2019s analysis, both parties received the benefit to which they were entitled and neither was entitled to further compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">B. Award of costs and fees to Liddle &amp; Moeller</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">1. Proper statutory pleadings</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">The Frittses argue the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to Liddle &amp; Moeller because Liddle &amp; Moeller did not adequately plead the applicable statutes. The trial court awarded fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">(3) In any civil action to recover on an open account, account stated, note, bill, negotiable instrument, guaranty, or contract relating to the purchase or sale of goods, wares, merchandise, or services and in any commercial transaction unless otherwise provided by law, the prevailing party shall be allowed a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be set by the court, to be taxed and collected as costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">The term \u201ccommercial transaction\u201d is defined to mean all transactions except transactions for personal or household purposes. The term \u201cparty\u201d is defined to mean any person, partnership, corporation, association, private organization, the state of Idaho or political subdivision thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">Liddle &amp; Moeller, in their answer and counterclaim, as well as the Frittses themselves, both clearly allege that I.C. \u00a7 12-120 applies. In <em>Lexington Heights Development, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>LLC v. Crandlemire, </em>140 Idaho 276, 287, 92 P.3d 526, 537 (2004) we noted that \u201c[w]here a party alleges the existence of a contract that would be a commercial transaction under Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3), that claim triggers the application of the statute and the prevailing party may recover attorney fees even if no liability under the contract is established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 92 P.3d at 537, citing <em>Miller v. St Alphonsus Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>139 Idaho 825, 87 P.3d 934 (2004); <em>Magic Lantern Prods., Inc. v. Dolsot, </em>126 Idaho 805, 892 P.2d 480 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">While our previous decisions have required prevailing parties to state in pleadings the specific code section on which they rely for their fee award, we have since found such a requirement \u201cat odds with Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(4) which states, \u2018It shall not be necessary for any party in a civil action to assert a claim for attorney fees in any pleading____\u2019 \u201d 141 Idaho at 720, 117 P.3d at 134; I. R.C. P. 54(e)(4). <em>Eighteen Mile Ranch, LLC v. Nord Excavating &amp; Paving, Inc., </em>141 Idaho 716, 117 P.3d 130 (2005). In <em>Eighteen Mile Ranch, </em>the Court acknowledged that a party must claim attorney fees, but emphasized that \u201ca party need not have listed a specific attorney fee provision in its pleading in order to obtain a fee award under that provision upon prevailing in the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 721, 117 P.3d at 135. Here, both parties alleged the applicability of I.C. \u00a7 12-120, and the district court concluded this was a commercial transaction for which fees should be awarded. Further, the district court determined that Liddle &amp; Moeller prevailed in the action. The parties adequately raised the issue of attorney fees awardable under I.C. \u00a7 12-120.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">2. Finding of commercial transaction</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The district court concluded that \u201cthe Defendants are the prevailing party in a commercial transaction.\u201d The Frittses contend the judge erred in this conclusion because Liddle &amp; Moeller never pled nor asserted that the case involved a commercial transaction, because the claim involved numerous theories of tort and statutory liability under the Consumer Protection Act, and because a commercial transaction was not the gravamen of the case. There is no question, however, that the Frittses\u2019 complaint alleged breach of a construction contract for a home, which may be a commercial transaction. <em>See Ervin Const. Co. v. Van Orden, </em>125 Idaho 695, 874 P.2d 506 (1994). Without an adequate record, we have no ability to determine what evidence was presented and we must assume it would support the district court\u2019s conclusion that this ease involved a commercial transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">3. Award of costs for an accounting</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">As part of its total award of costs and fees to Liddle &amp; Moeller, the district court included the request for $1,834.25 in fees for expert witness Norm Kolb. The Frittses argue they should not have been made to pay Norm Kolb\u2019s fee because his work amounted to compiling accounting records, which they argue Liddle &amp; Moeller should have maintained as the Frittses\u2019 agent. There is simply no basis in the record \u2014 which, we again stress, includes no transcript \u2014 for concluding the district court erred on this point. Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54 provides that costs shall be allowed to the prevailing party as a matter of right, including \u201cReasonable expert witness fees for an expert who testifies at a deposition or at a trial of an action not to exceed the sum of $2,000 for each expert witness for all appearances.\u201d I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(C)(8). No error has been demonstrated in the district court\u2019s award of expert witness fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">C. Idaho Consumer Protection Act</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">The Frittses argue the trial court erred in failing to make findings on their Idaho Consumer Protection Act claims. The trial court made no reference to the Idaho Consumer Protection Act in finding that this case involved a commercial transaction and in denying the Frittses relief. Though the Frittses raised this issue in their motion for a new trial and on appeal, they have given this Court no basis on which to determine what evidence was presented on their claim. If no evidence was presented to the district court on the consumer protection claims, the district court did not err in not making findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>on the matter. We decline to address this further in the absence of a proper record.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">D. Attorney fees on appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We conclude that Liddle &amp; Moeller is the prevailing party on appeal. As such, the Frittses\u2019 request for attorney fees on appeal is denied. Liddle &amp; Moeller seek attorney fees under I.A.R. 41 and I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120(3) and 12-121.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Given the particular circumstances of this appeal, we conclude that Liddle <em>&amp; </em>Moeller is entitled to attorney fees under Idaho Appellate Rule 11.1. Idaho Appellate Rule 11.1 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate that the attorney or party has read the notice of appeal, petition, motion, brief or other document; that to the best of the signer\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. If the notice of appeal, petition, motion, brief, or other document is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the notice of appeal, petition, motion, brief or other document including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">I.A.R. 11.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\u201c[A] violation of this rule requires the signed notice of appeal, petition, motion, brief or other document to (1) not be well grounded in fact (2) not be warranted by existing law or not be a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law and (3) to be interposed for an improper purpose.\u201d <em>Neihart v. Universal Joint Auto Parts, Inc., </em>141 Idaho 801, 803, 118 P.3d 133, 135 (2005), citing <em>Painter v. Potlatch Corp., </em>138 Idaho 309, 315, 63 P.3d 435, 441 (2003). In this case, the Court was unable to review the Frittses\u2019 fact-dependent claims because they failed to provide this Court with an adequate record. Though the absence of a record undermined the entirety of this appeal, nowhere was the problem more glaring than in the Frittses\u2019 failure to provide a transcript in conjunction with their request for a new trial. Without a record, we must conclude the evidence supported the district court\u2019s decisions. Accordingly, we conclude the Frittses\u2019 appeal is not well grounded in fact under the first element of I.A.R. 11.1. Because the Frittses bore the burden of demonstrating error by the trial court, their request for this Court to act in the absence of evidence to support their claims was unwarranted under the second element of I.A.R. 11.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">The final element of violation of I.A.R. 11.1 requires that claims be brought for an improper purpose. \u201cAlthough an attorney\u2019s purpose in filing an appeal may not always appear clear from the record, this Court can infer intent and purpose from the attorney\u2019s actions and the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Neihart, </em>141 Idaho at 803, 118 P.3d at 135. In <em>Neihart, </em>the Court found improper purpose where an attorney submitted to the Court the improper standard of review, failed to respond to the opposing party\u2019s identification of this error, and failed to appear at oral argument. <em>See id. </em>Here, the Frittses asserted, without citation, that \u201cThe standard of review for a trial court, when its [sic] sitting as a finder of fact is one of substantial evidence,\u201d that \u201cAppellant [sic] Courts exercise a right of free review when determining issues of law,\u201d and that \u201cAs to some motions, there exists an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d Despite the Frittses\u2019 approximate recognition that an essential element of their appeal required this Court\u2019s evaluation of whether the trial court\u2019s findings were based on substantial and competent evidence, the Frittses failed to supply the necessary record. The Frittses\u2019 appeal amounts to a delay of the inevitable and this Court is left with no alternative but to affirm the district court. By failing to supply this Court with a trial transcript and adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>record, the Frittses\u2019 attorney failed to demonstrate a basis for this appeal and wasted judicial resources. We conclude that under these circumstances, the Frittses\u2019 attorney, rather than the Frittses themselves, should bear the cost of Liddle &amp; Moeser\u2019s attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The Frittses have not shown they are entitled to a new trial or that the district court erred in denying their January 12, 2005, motion to amend their motion for a new trial. We affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Liddle &amp; Moeller under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). Pursuant to I.A.R. 11.1, this Court awards Liddle &amp; Moeller their reasonable attorney fees incurred in this appeal, together with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-6\">Chief Justice SCHROEDER and Justices EISMANN, BURDICK and JONES concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
