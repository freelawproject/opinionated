JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">James Horkley and Joe\u2019s Filling Station, LLC (Horkley) hired Davies to construct two buildings in Rexburg, Idaho: a restaurant building and an insulated storage building. On an open account, Davies purchased materials from BMC West Corporation (BMC) to use for the project. Davies had opened an account with BMC on October 1, 1988, and BMC closed the account in August 2005. BMC acknowledges that Horkley paid Davies $111,335.91, of which $101,419.41 was for the restaurant and insulated storage building. Of the $101,419.41, Davies charged Horkley $27,992.48 for BMC materials furnished for the project as of January 29, 2005. For the subsequently purchased BMC materials, Davies charged Horkley $1,817.05. So, Davies charged Horkley a total of $29,809.53 for materials purchased from BMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">In addition, Davies billed Horkley for substantial materials and rental costs from other suppliers separate from the materials purchased from BMC. On Davies\u2019 bills to Horkley, he identified the source of each particular charge. So, one could identify both the total amount Horkley was charged for BMC materials and the amount he was charged for materials or supplies purchased from others. Davies did not fully pay for the materials purchased from BMC. As a result, under I.C. \u00a7 45-501 and I.C. \u00a7 45-505, BMC filed liens on the land on which the buildings were located, and on the buildings themselves. Finally, BMC requested relief in the form of $10,471.80 for the balance on the account, and foreclosure on the liens. In his answer, Horkley opposed BMC\u2019s claims for relief. BMC then filed a motion for summary judgment on January 23, 2006, and Judge Moss granted the motion on March 21, 2006. On May 15, 2006, Judge Moss entered a judgment and decree of foreclosure in favor of BMC. From this decision, Horkley appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">The relevant payments from Horkley to Davies took place as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-12\">09/10/04: $9,916.50 for the foundation for the buildings. BMC argues that this payment was for a separate project, even though the buildings were constructed atop the foundation, and Horkley does not dispute BMC\u2019s argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-13\">12/16/04: $35,000.00. Davies\u2019 bill to Horkley indicates that this $35,000.00 was \u201cpaid down,\u201d i.e., a down payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-14\">02/02/05: $56,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-15\">02/17/05: $10,419.41.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-16\"><em>Total: </em>$101,419.41 ($111,335.91 counting the inapplicable $9,916.50 from 09/10/04 for the foundation).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-17\">Davies\u2019 payments to BMC occurred as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-18\">09/03/04: $2,600.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-19\">09/30/04: $2,700.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-20\">10/28/04: $3,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-21\">11/30/04: $23,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-22\">01/31/05: $25,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-23\"><em>Total: </em>$56,300.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-24\">Davies submitted the first bill to Horkley on January 31, 2005. The bill stated that it represented charges \u201cas of\u2019 January 29, 2005. At that time, Horkley had amassed $101,419.41 worth of labor and materials charges. The bill\u2019s total, though, was only $66,419.41, because Horkley was credited $35,000.00 for his December 16, 2004 down payment. Construction was not complete by January 31, 2005 (the date of the first bill). Instead, construction was completed several months later on April 27, 2005. Because additional work took place between January 29, 2005 (the date of the charges on the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>bill) and April 27, 2005 (the date of completion), Horkley accumulated additional charges. Therefore, Davies sent Horkley a second bill on or about May 3, 2005, for approximately $29,809.53. Horkley objected to the amount he was charged for Davies\u2019 labor, and Davies agreed to reduce the bill to $21,452.24. Horkley denied that he owed Davies $21,452.24, and stated that he \u201cwould not pay any further amounts to him without supporting documentation and information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">The legal framework for our review of BMC\u2019s action against Horkley is outlined as follows. Because Horkley appeals from BMC\u2019s successful motion for summary judgment, we review this case under the standards governing review of motions for summary judgment. Under I.R.C.P. 56(c), summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The party seeking summary judgment faces the burden of proving the absence of material facts <em>Tingley v. Harrison, </em>125 Idaho 86, 89, 867 P.2d 960, 963 (1994), but if \u201ca party moves for summary judgment on the basis that no genuine issue of material fact exists with regard to an element of the non-moving party\u2019s case, the non-moving party must establish the existence of an issue of fact regarding that element.\u201d <em>Farm Credit Bank of Spokane v. Stevenson, </em>125 Idaho 270, 273, 869 P.2d 1365, 1368 (1994). In other words, the non-moving party must \u201cmake a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Moreover, the non-moving party cannot withstand summary judgment when there is only a \u201cslight doubt as to the facts,\u201d as \u201cthere must be sufficient evidence upon which a jury could reasonably return a verdict resisting the motion.\u201d <em>Harpole v. State, </em>131 Idaho 437, 439, 958 P.2d 594, 596 (1998). Finally, \u201c[a]ll disputed facts are to be construed liberally in favor of the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the record are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Bear Island Water Association, Inc. v. Brown, </em>125 Idaho 717, 721, 874 P.2d 528, 532 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">\u201cThe right of a materialman to assert a lien against a structure for which materials have been furnished is a right granted and therefore determined by statute.\u201d <em>Layrite Products Co. v. Lux, </em>91 Idaho 110, 113, 416 P.2d 501, 504 (1966). In Idaho, the right exists in I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 45-501 and 505. Section 45-501 states in relevant part that \u201c[ejvery person performing labor upon, or furnishing materials to be used in the construction, alteration or repair of any ... building ... or any other structure ... or who ... improves any land ... has a lien upon the same for the ... materials furnished____\u201d Section 45-505 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-10\">The land upon which or in connection with which any ... building, improvement or structure is constructed, together with a convenient space about the same, or so much as may be required for the convenient use and occupation thereof, to be determined by the court on rendering judgment, is also subject to the lien, if, at the commencement of the furnishing of professional services or other work, [or] the furnishing of the material ... the land belonged to the person who caused said ... building, improvement or structure to be constructed, altered or repaired, or such person was acting as the agent of the owner, but if such person owns less than a fee simple estate in such land, then only the interest of the person or persons causing the services or improvement therein is subject to such lien.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">\u201cThe purpose of these statutes is to compensate persons who perform labor upon or furnish material to be used in construction, alteration or repair of a structure.\u201d <em>Franklin Building Supply Co. v. Sumpter, </em>139 Idaho 846, 850, 87 P.3d 955, 959 (2004). Materialman\u2019s hen laws are construed liberally \u201cin favor of the person who performs labor upon or furnishes materials to be used in the construction of a building.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo create a valid hen, there must be substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>compliance with the requirements of the statutes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">\u201cStatutes such as the Idaho provision which permit a hen for materials furnished usuahy apply only to furnishing for building purposes, and do not include a furnishing for general or unknown purposes ... or on a general open account.\u201d <em>Layrite, </em>91 Idaho 110, 113, 416 P.2d 501, 504. The \u201copen account defense\u201d is applicable \u201cin situations when a person furnishing materials relies exclusively on the general credit of the purchaser, and does not look to the land, structure or building as additional security for the materials sold on credit.\u201d <em>Great Plains Equipment, Inc. v. Northwest Pipeline Corp., </em>132 Idaho 754, 772, 979 P.2d 627, 645 (1999). In such a case, the materialman is not entitled to a lien. <em>Id. </em>In addition, the lien statutes do not apply to \u201ca sale without any reference as to what shall be done with the material sold.\u201d <em>Layrite, </em>91 Idaho 110, 113, 416 P.2d 501, 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">So, to secure the protection of a mechanic\u2019s hen law, \u201c[m]aterials must be furnished with special reference to their use in a particular building.\u201d <em>Colorado Iron Works v. Riekenberg, </em>4 Idaho 705, 710, 43 P. 681, 683 (1896). Therefore, \u201ca mere furnishing for building purposes generally is not sufficient.\u201d <em>Layrite, </em>91 Idaho 110, 114, 416 P.2d 501, 505. As a result, \u201cif a materialman sells his materials without any understanding as to their apphcation the materialman can assert no hen upon the building upon which the materials may, in fact, be used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[w]here materials are furnished for use in a particular building, the fact that the materialman looks first or primarily to the contractor for payment and only subsequently to the building for security, would not of itself defeat the lien.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Horkley argues that BMC\u2019s hen is invalid because BMC sold the building materials to Davies on an open account and therefore did not satisfy the requirement that BMC specifically refer to the materials\u2019 purpose. To support his claim that BMC purchased materials on an open account, Horkley notes that BMC applied Davies\u2019 payments with a \u201cfirst in first out\u201d (FIFO) method. BMC admits both that Davies had an open account with BMC, and that Davies\u2019 payments were applied on a FIFO basis. It denies, however, that these concessions result in an enforceable defense for Horkley.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">BMC is correct. The open account defense is inapplicable here, because BMC did not rely exclusively on Davies\u2019 general credit. BMC submitted evidence that its general practice was to place a hen on the property built by the contractor when the contractor failed to pay for the purchased materials. Of course, if BMC places a hen on that property, it is not relying exclusively on the general credit of the purchaser. Horkley\u2019s only countervailing evidence is that BMC apphed Davies\u2019 payments on a FIFO basis. That fact, though, serves only to support precisely what BMC admits: that Davies\u2019 payments were credited on an open account. But, as estabhshed, there exists no genuine issue as to whether the open account defense is inapplicable here, because Horkley has failed to present evidence to support the applicability of the open account defense. Instead, he only presented evidence that an open account exists, and that fact alone does not estabhsh a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">A defense would be estabhshed if BMC sold the materials without reference to the project for which they were used. BMC cited evidence contradicting this defense, though. Glenda Kamachi, the credit manager of BMC, testified that BMC customers must identify their projects on a \u201cship to\u201d section on BMC\u2019s invoices. She further testified that Davies placed the name \u201cHorkley\u201d in this section, and that BMC\u2019s purpose in ascertaining this information was to inform BMC as to the particular projects for which the materials were purchased. Nevertheless, Horkley suggests that it can defend on the basis that materials were furnished without referencing a particular project, because \u201cmany invoices in the record ... have no reference to a particular project.\u201d But this evidence is enormously insufficient to meet the standard of review for summary judgment. The fact that \u201cmany invoices\u201d do not reference the Horkley project provides nowhere near the amount of evidence necessary for a jury to \u201creturn a verdict resisting the motion.\u201d This evidence serves only as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>trivial observation, given that a review of the record demonstrates that the <em>vast </em>majority of the invoices do reference the Horkley project. Additionally, it is clear that in discovery Horkley requested all invoices from BMC for a particular time period, not just those from the Horkley job. So, it is not surprising that there are invoices in the record that do not pertain to Horkley.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">The fact of the matter is that this case is fairly straightforward. Idaho Code \u00a7 45-501 provides a lien to \u201c[ejvery person ... furnishing materials to be used in the construction, alteration or repair of any ... building ... or any other structure____\u201d BMC furnished materials for the construction of the Horkley project; therefore, it is entitled to a lien on the buildings that that project produced. Since it has not received full payment, and since Horkley\u2019s defenses fail, BMC has the right to foreclose on the hen.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Next, Horkley claims that BMC\u2019s hen is not vahd because Horkley satisfied his obhgation to Davies. This contention is based on the principle that one\u2019s property should not be subject to a hen for a satisfied debt. Horkley cites a single, readily distinguishable ease in support of his position: <em>Mountain Home Redi-Mix v. Conner Homes, Inc., </em>91 Idaho 612, 428 P.2d 744 (1967). <em>Redi-Mix </em>held that a materialman\u2019s hen is invahd when, among other things, (1) the materialman knew of the payment\u2019s source and the relevant project\u2019s purpose, and (2) the property owner had paid for materials that nevertheless would still be subject \u201cto a secured claim for payment of the same debt which the owner has in truth already satisfied.\u201d <em>Redi-Mix, </em>91 Idaho 612, 614, 428 P.2d 744, 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Redi-Mix is distinguishable first because BMC (the materialman) was not aware that Horkley was the source of Davies\u2019 payments, since Horkley <em>wasn\u2019t </em>the source. At the time BMC accepted Davies\u2019 payments, Horkley had yet to make any payment to BMC or Davies. BMC cannot be faulted for failing to credit the Horkley account, when Horkley was not the source of Davies\u2019 payment to BMC. The following side-by-side comparison of payments reveals that Horkley could not possibly have been the source of Davies\u2019 payments to BMC with the possible exception of Horkley\u2019s down payment of $35,000. Davies made no payments to BMC after January 31, 2005. Both of Horkley\u2019s last two payments to Davies were after that date:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APm\">Davies\u2019 Horkley\u2019s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-9\">Payments to BMC Payments to Davies</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABtF\">09/03/04: $ 2,600 None</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-10\">09/30/04: $ 2,700 None</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-11\">10/28/04: $ 3,000 None</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-12\">11/30/04: $23,000 None</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-13\">12/16/04: None $35,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-14\">01/31/05: $25,000 None</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-15\">02/02/05: None $56,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-16\">02/10/05: None $10,419.41</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">Secondly, the key concern in the <em>Redi-Mix </em>ease was that an innocent property owner could be subjected to a lien on property for which he already has paid. Here, however, Horkley remains in arrears on his debt to Davies. Horkley owed $66,419.41 for work performed as of January 29, 2005, and he duly paid that debt through his two February, 2005 payments. Since that time, though, he has paid nothing. In fact, he admitted that he has not paid, and that he will continue not to pay Davies, even though BMC has cited scores of post-January 29 invoices referencing the Horkley project. BMC clearly furnished materials to Davies for use on the Horkley project, for which BMC has not been paid by anybody. In <em>Redi-Mix, </em>on the other hand, the owner was in danger of being subjected to a lien of an amount greater than he owed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 91 Idaho 612, 613, 428 P.2d 744, 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">Horkley remains persistent, however, citing a litany of cases from other jurisdictions generally supporting the proposition that the equities favor a rule that would not require a property owner to pay twice for his property. Unfortunately for Horkley, though, he persistently cited irrelevant and distinguishable cases. In the cited eases, it may have been the case that the equities favored such a rule, but the facts here do not present reason to consider adopting the rule. The bottom line in the present case is that it is undisputed that even though Horkley paid a total of $101,419.41 to Davies, not all of those pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>ments were for materials. Davies\u2019 bill included labor and other charges as well. Although Horkley argues that he paid Davies more than the total amount of the materials, that is not the issue in the present case, since as already noted, Davies had many other expenses also to pay from the payments he received from Horkley. The issue here is that BMC was not paid and that BMC tracked the use of the materials to the project on which they were used. Those facts trigger Idaho\u2019s materialman lien statutes, which provide BMC a right to a hen on the materials and property.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">In the present case, BMC identified the Horkley project with respect to the overwhelming number of invoices for materials sold. Davies\u2019 itemized bills provided Horkley notice of the source of the materials furnished for the project. It should not be forgotten that it was readily within the power of Horkley to protect himself against any unwanted lien by making his payments to Davies contingent upon Davies providing a lien release from BMC, or only making his payments to Davies by a check payable both to Davies and BMC. His failure to do so should not preclude BMC from exercising its rights under the hen statutes to protect itself when making credit sales while relying both upon the credit reliability of the contractor as well as the security in the materials sold by tracking them to the project on which they were used.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Horkley next claims that the last relevant invoice was dated March 30, 2005, whereas BMC maintains that the last invoice was dated April 27, 2005. This issue is relevant because Idaho Code \u00a7 45-507(2) requires that a person claiming a lien file \u201cwithin ninety (90) days after the completion of the labor or services, or furnishing of materials.\u201d The hen was filed on July 22, 2005. The issue turns on whether the insulated storage building was part of the same project as the restaurant construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Horkley argues that it was not, because it was portable and merely chattel placed on the land. However, Horkley cites no authority for the proposition that chattel cannot qualify under I.C. \u00a7 45-501 as furnished materials to be used in \u201cthe construction, alteration or repair of any ... building ... or any other structure\u201d or an improvement on land. Nevertheless, BMC persuasively argues that the building is not chattel. Davies testified that it was built for the particular location where it sits, as is evidenced by the fact that it sits on a foundation and possesses the unique feature of being sloped both to the west and to the south. The building therefore is not chattel. In addition, it clearly was built for the purpose of complementing the restaurant: it was constructed of the same colors and with the same design. It qualifies as an \u201cimprovement\u201d on the land, allowing it to fall under I.C. \u00a7 45-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">It also is not relevant \u2014 contrary to Horkley\u2019s differing contention \u2014 that the insulated storage building was constructed on a third party\u2019s land. Here, the relevant third party is Eastern Idaho Railroad, which possessed a right of way on the relevant land, while Horkley had no property interest in the land. \u201cIdaho\u2019s materialman\u2019s lien statutes appear to have been adopted from those of California.\u201d <em>Chief Industries, Inc. v. Schwendiman, </em>99 Idaho 682, 687, 587 P.2d 823, 828 (1978). So, the following language from a California case is useful: \u201cthe lien upon [a] building exists separately from the land.\u201d <em>English v. Olympic Auditorium, </em>217 Cal. 631, 20 P.2d 946, 950 (1933). In other words, a hen is not destroyed by the fact that the liened building sits upon the land of a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">The fact that the hen can attach to improvements to land owned by third persons is suggested by the language of I.C. \u00a7 45-505, which states that \u201c... if such person owns less than a fee simple estate in such land, then only the interest of the person or persons causing the services or improvement therein is subject to such hen.\u201d Because the storage building sits on land in which Eastern Idaho Railroad has a property interest, the hen attaches only to the building or such property interest as is owned by Horkley.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">Next, since Kamachi, the agent of BMC, typed her name rather than signing it, Horkley argues that the hen was not properly verified by oath. Idaho Code \u00a7 45-507 requires that claims of lien \u201cbe verified by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>the oath of the claimant, his agent or attorney, to the effect that the affiant believes the same to be just.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th ed.2004) defines \u201cverification\u201d as a \u201cformal declaration made in the presence of an authorized officer, such as a notary public____\u201d Kamachi was \u201csworn upon oath\u201d by a notary public. Idaho Code \u00a7 45-507 does not state that the lien must be signed; it only states that it must be verified by the oath of the claimant. Because Kamachi was given an oath by a notary public, and because a signature is not explicitly required, her typewritten name suffices. Kamachi\u2019s verification therefore was not defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Finally, BMC requests costs and attorney\u2019s fees on appeal. Idaho Appellate Rule 40(a) states that \u201cCosts shall be allowed as a matter of course to the prevailing party unless otherwise provided by law or order of the Court.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 45-513 provides for attorney\u2019s fees in lien cases, stating that \u201cAny number of persons claiming liens against the same property may join in the same action, and when separate actions are commenced the court may consolidate them. The court shall also allow as part of the costs the moneys paid for filing and recording the claim, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed and costs and attorney\u2019s fees are awarded to BMC.</p>\n<judges id=\"b929-8\">Chief Justice EISMANN, Justices BUR-DICK, J.
