FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">Appellant, Anissa Stout, brought four claims against Respondent, Key Training Corp. (Key Training): (1) violation of the Idaho Human Rights Act (I.C. \u00a7 67-5909); (2) termination in violation of public policy; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (4) breach of contract. Key Training then moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion on all claims except for the statutory claim. The district court noted that the parties agreed there were issues of fact on the statutory claim and that the parties agreed Key Training was entitled to summary judgment on the public policy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-18\">A jury trial was held on the statutory claim in which Stout contended her former employer, Key Training, violated the Idaho Human Rights Act by discriminating against her because of gender and pregnancy. After a trial, the jury awarded Stout $50,927.16. Stout then moved the district court for an award of reasonable attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) and I.C. \u00a7 67-5908. The district court denied Stout\u2019s request for attorney fees. Stout timely appealed that order to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-19\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b228-20\">The district court\u2019s decision to award attorney fees is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Contreras v. Rubley, </em>142 Idaho 573, 576, 130 P.3d 1111, 1114 (2006). However, when an award of attorney fees depends on the interpretation of a statute, the standard of review for statutory interpretation applies. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review.\u201d <em>Carrier v. Lake Pend Oreille Sch. Dist. </em># <em>81, </em>142 Idaho 804, 807, 134 P.3d 655, 658 (2006). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>We must construe a statute to give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Stout argues that she is entitled to an award of attorney fees on her successful employment discrimination claim pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-5908(3) and I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). Additionally, both parties argue they are entitled to attorney fees on appeal. Each argument is addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">A. Stout is not entitled to attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 67-5908(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Stout argues that she is entitled to attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 67-5908(3) because she would be entitled to attorney fees under federal employment discrimination law and because the legislature intended the courts have broad remedial discretion when enforcing the Idaho Human Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5908(3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">In a civil action filed by the commission or filed directly by the person alleging unlawful discrimination, if the court finds that unlawful discrimination has occurred, its judgment shall specify an appropriate remedy or remedies therefor. Such remedies may include, but are not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">(a) An order to cease and desist from the unlawful practice specified in the order;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">(b) An order to employ, reinstate, promote or grant other employment benefits to a victim of unlawful employment discrimination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">(c) An order for actual damages including lost wages and benefits, provided that such back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than two (2) years prior to the filing of the complaint with the commission or the district court, whichever occurs first;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">(d) An order to accept or reinstate such a person in a union;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">(e) An order for punitive damages, not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each willful violation of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">We construe a statute so as to give effect to legislative intent. <em>Carrier, </em>142 Idaho at 807, 134 P.3d at 658. The legislative intent reflected in I.C. \u00a7 67-5901 allows our state courts to look to federal law for guidance when interpreting the Idaho Human Rights Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Dell v. Basabe, </em>119 Idaho 796, 811, 810 P.2d 1082, 1097 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-17\">The district court correctly analyzed Stout\u2019s claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-18\">Stout asserts that the ... language of [I.C. \u00a7 67-5908(3)], especially when read in conjunction with the federal statutes it implements, permits an award of attorney fees. The Idaho Human Rights Act itself does not contain any express provision relating to attorney fees. The Court has reviewed the relevant federal statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e~5. That statute contains a provision similar to that set forth above, in that it allows a court to grant \u201cany other equitable relief.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g)(1). However, unlike the Idaho statute, the federal statute also contains an express provision for an award of attorney fees. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). The Court has compared the above-quoted language to similar language in the Idaho Consumer Protection Act, Idaho Code \u00a7 48-608(1), which provides that the court may grant \u201cother appropriate relief.\u201d That statute also contains a specific section relating to attorney fee awards, 48-608(4). The Court concludes from its review of the foregoing authorities that since the Idaho Human Rights Act does not make express allowance for an award of attorney fees, the legislature did not intend that such an award would be available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-19\">In this ease, an analysis of federal law does not lead to the conclusion that the Idaho Human Rights Act includes the remedy of attorney fees. The federal Civil Rights Act specifically provides for attorney fees while the Idaho Human Rights Act does not. Furthermore, the federal Civil Rights Act provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>sion allowing for an award of attorney fees had been enacted long before the Idaho Human Rights Act remedy provision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yet, the Idaho legislature chose not to include attorney fees in its remedy provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">No language in the Idaho Human Rights Act indicates that the legislature contemplated remedies which go toward the legal expense of enforcing the act. As demonstrated by the language in the Idaho Consumer Protection Act, when the legislature intends to provide for an award of attorney fees, it does so. It is reasonable, then, to infer that the legislature did not intend the expense of enforcement to fall under the I.C. \u00a7 67-5908(3) statutory remedial provision especially in light of the fact that the federal civil rights law expressly allowed for an award of attorney fees when I.C. \u00a7 67-5908(3) was enacted. Therefore, we affirm the district court and hold that I.C. \u00a7 67-5908(3) does not allow for an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">B. Stout is not entitled to attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Stout argues she should be awarded attorney fees pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), which allows attorney fees in actions relating to contract for services, because based on a sequence of events below it would be unfair to deny her attorney fees under this statute. Key Training argues that Stout is not entitled to attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) because Stout prevailed on a statutory claim, not a contract claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">We have held that termination of employment at will in violation of public policy is a contract action which results in contract damages. <em>Hummer v. </em>Evans, 129 Idaho 274, 280, 923 P.2d 981, 987 (1996). In this case, though, the district court dismissed Stout\u2019s termination in violation of public policy claim on summary judgment. Below, Stout conceded that because statutory remedies provide full relief to plaintiffs her wrongful discharge claim was unnecessary. However, Stout argues she only conceded that point because Key Training conceded that federal law was the appropriate standard of law as to her discrimination claim. Stout asserts that federal law favorably impacts her attorney fees claim and that Key Training is now arguing federal law does not apply; therefore it would be unfair to prevent Stout from receiving the remedies she could have received as a result of pursuing her termination in violation of public policy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">First, Stout\u2019s assertion that it would be unfair to refuse her attorney fees she would have received from her termination in violation of public policy claim is without merit. Key Training agreed th\u00e1t the federal definition of \u201csex discrimination\u201d which includes discrimination based on pregnancy and childbirth, would apply to the Idaho Human Rights Act. Key Training also agreed that the Idaho Supreme Court has noted federal case law is instructive to claims under the Idaho Human Rights Act. However, those concessions in no way require that the provisions of the Idaho Human Rights Act be ignored and that all federal law provisions be adopted in order to decide Stout\u2019s Idaho Human Rights Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">Next, Stout is not entitled to an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) because she did not prevail on her contract claim; she prevailed only on her statutory claim. As the district court pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-13\">In <em>Atwood v. Western Construction, Inc., </em>129 Idaho 234, 923 P.2d 479 (Ct.App.1996), which involved claims very similar to those alleged by Stout but based on age discrimination, the court held that although Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3) applies to employment contracts, it generally does not apply to claims in which the gravamen of the cause of action is a claimed violation of a statute such as the Idaho Human Rights Act. <em>See also Northwest Bec-Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>v. Home Living Service </em>[ ], 136 Idaho 835, 41 P.3d 263 (2002). Here, the only theory on which Stout prevailed was one for discrimination based on gender under the Idaho Human Rights Act. Therefore, Stout is not entitled to attorney fees pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">In <em>Northwest Bec-Corp., </em>we noted that a party was properly denied attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) when its claims were \u201cbased in rights created by statute or tort.\u201d 136 Idaho at 842, 41 P.3d at 270. In this case, Stout was successful only on her statutory claim. Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3) does not authorize attorney fees on statutory claims. Therefore, we hold Stout is not entitled to an award of attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">C. Neither party is entitled to attorney fees on appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Stout argues she is entitled to attorney fees on appeal on the same basis she is entitled to attorney fees for the trial below. Since we hold Stout is not entitled to attorney fees for the trial below, we also hold she is not entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Key Training argues it is entitled to attorney fees on appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-121. That statute allows an award of \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party____\u201d I.C. \u00a7 12-121. Attorney fees are awarded to the prevailing party only if \u201cthe Court determines that the action was brought or pursued frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation.\u201d <em>Baker v. Sullivan, </em>132 Idaho 746, 751, 979 P.2d 619, 624 (1999). Whether I.C. \u00a7 67-5908(3) allows an award of attorney fees to a successful plaintiff is an issue of first impression for this Court. Thus, we hold Key Training is not entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of attorney fees to Stout. Furthermore, we decline to award either party attorney fees on appeal.

Key Training also argues that Stout\u2019s request for fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) contains issues not raised below and therefore that should not be considered on appeal. While Stout\u2019s arguments here for entitlement to an award under that subsection is riot identical to her arguments below, in her motion for attorney fees, she specifically referenced I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3). Thus, the issue of whether she is entitled to attorney fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) was raised below.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b231-15\">Chief Justice SCHROEDER,</author>\n<p id=\"Au8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">I respectfully dissent from the decision of the Court. Emphasis must be on respectful in this case, because the Court has properly applied prior case decisions. However, after struggling for many years with the application of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), it is time to go back to the statute itself and apply it as written. The Court\u2019s decisions, in which this author has participated, have created a patchwork of application that commonly requires more analysis than the substance of the claims in the lawsuit. The Court signaled a change in attitude in <em>Blimka v. My Web Wholesaler, LLC, a Maine Limited Liability Company, and Lisa DePalma, </em>143 Idaho 723, 152 P.3d 594 (2007). It is proper to follow the lead of that case and apply I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) as written, allowing attorney fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-17\">In any civil action to recover on an open account, account stated, note, bill, negotiable instrument, guaranty, or contract relating to the purchase or sale of goods, wares, merchandise, or services and in any commercial transaction unless otherwise provided by law, the prevailing party shall be allowed a reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be set by the court, to be taxed and collected as costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-18\">The term \u201ccommercial transaction\u201d is defined to mean all transactions except transactions for personal or household purposes. The \u201cparty\u201d is defined to mean any person, partnership, corporation, association, private organization, the state of Idaho, or political subdivision thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-19\">Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-20\">In <em>Hummer v. Evans, </em>129 Idaho 274, 280, 923 P.2d 981, 987 (1996), the Court held that termination of employment at will in violation of public policy is a contract action which results in contract damages. The fact that this case proceeded under the Idaho Human Rights Act for discrimination based upon gender and pregnancy does not alter the fact that this is an action arising from employment, a contractual relationship. The overlay of limiting attorney fees when the claim is made pursuant to a statute is one created by the Court not the legislature. The legislation is broad and inclusive. The Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>constricted the statute and created a myriad of exceptions that should not exist. The legislature said that a \u201ccommercial transaction\u201d means \u201call transactions except transactions for personal or household purposes.\u201d This case does not involve a personal or household purpose. It can be classified under either a contract relating to services or a commercial transaction. The fact that there is a statute in place defining a cause of action in employment does not limit the definition of either contract or commercial transaction. The Court made the following analysis in <em>Blimka:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">A transaction involving the sale of 26,500 pairs of jeans is not made for personal or household purposes. Rather, it is a business or commercial transaction, as Blimka obviously intended to market the jeans rather than wear them. From time to time the Court has denied fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) on the commercial transaction ground either because the claim sounded in tort or because no contract was involved. The commercial transaction ground in I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3) neither prohibits a fee award for a commercial transaction that involves tortious conduct <em>(see Lettunich v. Key Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, </em>141 Idaho 362, 369, 109 P.3d 1104, 1111 (2005)), nor does it require that there be a contract. Any previous holdings to the contrary are overruled. We hold that Blimka is entitled to a fee award on appeal with respect to his fraud claim, as he is seeking recovery of damages sustained as a result of the commercial transaction involved in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\"><em>Blimka </em>rerouted this Court in the proper direction and interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 12-120(3), overruling eases to the contrary. The same logic is applicable in this case. The Court should take the same step it took in <em>Blimka </em>with regard to the interpretation of a commercial transaction when an allegation of tortious conduct was made. If the underlying transaction, though couched in terms of a statutory right, involves a qualifying contract or a commercial transaction, attorney fees should be awarded to the prevailing party. The maze of guesswork should be taken off the table, and those who litigate should be aware that the statute means exactly what it says without judicial overlay.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
