We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">The facts of this case are undisputed. On April 14, 2004, Timothy Hedges was released from prison after serving his entire five-year sentence for felony DUI, his eighth DUI. Only four months later, on August 18, 2004, Hedges, driving drunk, crossed the center-line of Highway 21 in Ada County and collided head-on with a vehicle driven by Patrick Cafferty. Patrick Cafferty was killed in the accident, and his wife, Camilla, and son, Allan, were injured. Hedges had a long history of DUI convictions; the accident resulted in Hedges\u2019s tenth DUI conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Hedges\u2019s driver\u2019s license had been suspended as part of his latest felony DUI conviction, prior to the collision he had applied to have it reinstated, and his license had been reinstated by DMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">In addition to the aggregate five-year sentence on Hedges\u2019s eighth felony DUI in 1999, the sentencing judge, The Honorable James C. Morfitt, suspended Hedges\u2019s license for five years. The judgment, however, did not indicate when the suspension started, stating: \u201cIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the defendants driving privileges are suspended for a period of five (5) years.\u201d After initially receiving the judgment suspending Hedges\u2019s license, DMV inputted a suspension start date of July 25, 2001 (five years from Hedges\u2019s earliest possible release date). The DMV notified Hedges that his suspension would last through April 26, 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, however, Danny E. Reed, a records specialist of the DMV, reviewed the file and changed the start date of the suspension to July 20, 1999, the date the order was signed; this change was based upon the silence in the district court order as to the start date and the DMVs policy regarding such silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">On May 12, 2004, the district judge issued Hedges a temporary restricted license. The temporary restricted driver\u2019s license stated that Hedges\u2019s five-year suspension began on July 9, 1999. DMV received a copy of the temporary restricted license on July 9, 2004. Once again, DMV records were changed, this time to reflect that the suspension began on July 9, 1999, and expired on July 9, 2004. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Less than three months after his release from prison, on July 13, 2004, after Hedges applied for a license and passed the relevant tests, DMV issued him an unrestricted license.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">After the accident, Camilla Cafferty filed a complaint alleging gross negligence against DMV. Prior to trial, the parties made cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court then orally granted DMV\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and Cafferty appeals this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">When reviewing a motion for summary judgment, this Court uses the same standard employed by the trial court when deciding such a motion. <em>Kolln v. Saint Luke\u2019s Regl. Med. Ctr., </em>130 Idaho 323, 327, 940 P.2d 1142, 1146 (1997). \u201c[I]f the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\u201d summary judgment is proper. I.R.C.P. 56(c). The burden is on the moving party to prove an absence of genuine issues of material fact. <em>Evans v. Griswold, </em>129 Idaho 902, 905, 935 P.2d 165, 168 (1997). In addition, this Court views the facts and inferences in the record in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review. <em>See, e.g., Martin v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>138 Idaho 244, 246, 61 P.3d 601, 603 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">In addition to the \u201cstrong line\u201d of authority setting out the standards under which this Court reviews a motion for summary judgment, <em>Harris v. State Dept. of Health &amp; Welfare, </em>123 Idaho 295, 298, 847 P.2d 1156, 1159 (1992), when reviewing a motion for summary judgment against a governmental entity and its employees under ITCA, this Court must engage in a three step analysis. <em>Coonse ex rel. Coonse v. Boise Sch. Dist., </em>132 Idaho 803, 805, 979 P.2d 1161, 1163 (1999); <em>Harris, </em>123 Idaho at 298 n. 1, 847 P.2d at 1159 n. 1; <em>Olguin v. City of Burley, </em>119 Idaho 721, 723, 810 P.2d 255, 257 (1991); <em>Czaplicki v. Gooding Joint Sch. Dist. No. 231, </em>116 Idaho 326, 330, 775 P.2d 640, 644 (1989). First, we must determine whether \u201ctort recovery is allowed under the laws of Idaho.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>123 Idaho at 298 n. 1, 847 P.2d at 1159 n. 1. Second, this Court determines if \u201can exception to liability under the ITCA shields the alleged misconduct from liability.\u201d <em>Coonse, </em>132 Idaho at 805, 979 P.2d at 1163. Finally, \u201cif no exception applies, [we examine] whether the merits of the claim as presented for consideration on the motion for summary judgment entitle the moving party to dismissal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Here, the parties concede that a cause of action for negligence exists under the laws of Idaho. They disagree, however, on whether an exception to the liability of ITCA provides DMV with immunity from Cafferty\u2019s suit. Cafferty recognizes that DMV is only liable for issuing Hedges a license if its actions were grossly negligent or reckless, willful and wanton. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 6-904B(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Importantly, the parties do not argue that there is a question of fact; instead they argue as to whether the facts show that DMV\u2019s actions rose to a level of gross negligence so as to open DMV to liability. Cafferty maintains that because DMV failed to follow its statutory obligations when it issued the license it cannot claim immunity under ITCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">First, Cafferty asserts that I.C. \u00a7 18-8005(5)(d) governs this situation, and DMV\u2019s failure to follow its mandates amounts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>gross negligence or reckless, willful or wanton conduct. Moreover, Cafferty asserts that DMV\u2019s failure to use the procedures set out in I.C. \u00a7 49-326A also amount to gross negligence or reckless, willful and wanton conduct. Finally, Cafferty argues that DMV\u2019s failure to refuse Hedges a license under I.C. \u00a7 49-303(6) or (10) amounts to gross negligence or reckless, willful and wanton conduct, and that the district court incorrectly concluded that she did not adequately plead a cause of action based on these statutes. We will turn first, then, to the issue of whether the district court correctly determined that Cafferty had not pleaded a cause of action based on I.C. \u00a7 49-303(6) or (10) since resolution of this issue affects the immunity analysis. We will then address the question of whether DMV is entitled to immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">A. Did Cafferty adequately plead a cause of action based on I.C. \u00a7 49-303(6) and (10)?</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Cafferty argues that because her complaint alleges that DMV improperly issued a license to Hedges, that the issuance of that license proximately caused the death of Patrick Cafferty and the injuries to Camilla and Allan Cafferty, and that DMV\u2019s conduct was grossly negligent or reckless, she has met the requirements of I.R.C.P. 8(a)(1). In its briefing, DMV argued that it was entitled to rely on Cafferty\u2019s pleadings, which did not put it on notice that she was claiming a cause of action based on I.C. \u00a7 49-303(6) or (10), and since she failed to timely amend her pleadings, the district court correctly held that Cafferty had not raised the issue and granted DMV summary judgment. However, at oral argument DMV conceded that broadly read, Cafferty\u2019s pleadings raised the issue of negligence under I.C. \u00a7 49-303(6) or (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Our Rules of Civil Procedure establish a system of notice pleading. <em>Cook v. Skyline Corp., </em>135 Idaho 26, 33, 13 P.3d 857, 864 (2000). A complaint need only contain a concise statement of the facts constituting the cause of action and a demand for relief. I.R.C.P. 8(a)(1); <em>Clark v. Olsen, </em>110 Idaho 323, 325, 715 P.2d 993, 995 (1986). <em>\u201cA </em>party\u2019s pleadings should be liberally construed to secure a \u2018just, speedy and inexpensive\u2019 resolution of the case.\u201d <em>Gillespie v. Mountain Park Estates, LLC, </em>138 Idaho 27, 30, 56 P.3d 1277, 1280 (2002) (citing <em>Christensen v. Rice, </em>114 Idaho 929, 931, 763 P.2d 302, 304 (Ct.App.1988) (citing I.R.C.P. 1(a)); <em>M.T. Deaton &amp; Co. v. Leibrock, </em>114 Idaho 614, 759 P.2d 905 (Ct.App.1988)). \u201c[I]ssues considered on summary judgment are those raised by the pleadings.\u201d <em>Gardner v. Evans, </em>110 Idaho 925, 939, 719 P.2d 1185, 1199 (1986) (quoting <em>Argyle v. Slemaker, </em>107 Idaho 668, 669, 691 P.2d 1283, 1284 (Ct.App.1984)). While courts may allow parties to amend their pleadings to conform to proof offered at trial, I.R.C.P. 15(b), \u201c[a] cause of action not raised in a party\u2019s pleadings may not be considered on summary judgment____\u201d <em>O\u2019Guin v. Bingham County, </em>139 Idaho 9, 15, 72 P.3d 849, 855 (2003) (citing <em>Beco Const. Co. v. City of Idaho Falls, </em>124 Idaho 859, 865, 865 P.2d 950, 956 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Cafferty\u2019s amended complaint alleges that Hedges\u2019s license should have been suspended until at least April 14, 2005, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 18-8005(5)(d), and that by issuing Hedges a license \u201cduring a period of time when his driving privileges should have remained suspended\u201d DMV acted with gross negligence or recklessly, willfully and wantonly. Additionally, it also alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">The conduct of [DMV] involved doing acts or failing to perform acts, which a reasonable person in a similar situation and of similar responsibility would, with a minimum of contemplation, be inescapably drawn to recognize their duty to act or their duty not to act, and failing that duty shows a deliberate indifference to the harmful consequences to others, including the consequence to [Camilla and Allan Cafferty].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">Defendant Hedges was allowed to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of the State of Idaho, under circumstances where it was foreseeable that he would again operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants, and as a proximate result of said improper conduct by Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>dant Idaho DMV, Plaintiffs decedent was killed and Plaintiffs were also injured ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT1K\">Therefore, Cafferty\u2019s amended complaint speaks generally to duty, a failure to recognize such a duty by DMV, and improper actions by DMV. It also speaks to the foreseeable harm of allowing a person with Hedges\u2019s history to operate a vehicle on the highways of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Idaho Code \u00a7 49-303 provides DMV with duties. It mandates that DMV shall not issue a driver\u2019s license to any person who is a habitual drunkard, I.C. \u00a7 49-303(6), or when the DMV \u201chas good cause to believe that the operation of a motor vehicle on the highways by that person would be harmful to public safety or welfare.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 49-303(10). Such a statute gives DMV a mandatory duty to refuse to issue a license in certain situations. Since Cafferty\u2019s amended complaint speaks to duty and negligence, and the harm which might result if such a duty is disregarded, we hold that Cafferty raised the issue of negligence under I.C. \u00a7 49-303(6) and (10) and reverse the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">B. Did the district court err when it granted DMV\u2019s motion on the basis of immunity?</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Cafferty argues that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment to DMV on the basis of immunity because DMV was grossly negligent by reinstating Hedges\u2019s license or by not refusing to issue him a license. First, Cafferty asserts that DMV\u2019s failure to reinstate Hedges\u2019s license using the procedures set out in I.C. \u00a7 49-326A amounts to gross negligence or reckless, willful or wanton conduct. Second, Cafferty asserts that DMV\u2019s issuing Hedges violated I.C. \u00a7 49-303(6) or (10) and was therefore grossly negligent or reckless, willful and wanton conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Under ITCA, gross negligence is \u201cthe doing or failing to do an act which a reasonable person in a similar situation and of similar responsibility would, with a minimum of contemplation, be inescapably drawn to recognize his or her duty to do or not do such act and that failing that duty shows deliberate indifference to the harmful consequences to others.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 6-904C(l). Reckless, willful and wanton conduct is \u201cpresent only when a person intentionally and knowingly does or fails to do an act creating unreasonable risk of harm to another, and which involves a high degree of probability that such harm will result.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 6-904C(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">We begin with Cafferty\u2019s arguments regarding the reinstatement of Hedges\u2019s license without using the procedures set out in I.C. \u00a7 49-326A. Cafferty asserts that because Judge Morfitt\u2019s order suspending Hedges\u2019s license was silent as to the start date of the suspension, I.C. \u00a7 18-8005(5)(d) \u201cfills the gap\u201d left by the silence. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-8005(5) provides the penalties for a person who has two or more DUI convictions. It requires, among other penalties, that the driver shall have his license suspended beginning after release from imprisonment. I.C. \u00a7 18-8005(5)(d). Cafferty asserts DMV should have continued to treat the five-year suspension as if it became effective upon Hedges\u2019s release from prison and used the procedures for reinstatement set out in I.C. \u00a7 49-326A. Therefore, she concludes, the changes to the start date of Hedges\u2019s suspension amount to gross negligence or reckless, willful and wanton conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">DMV argues that I.C. \u00a7 49-326A governs the administration of court ordered suspensions only when the judge has specifically ordered the suspension to begin after the release from prison, and that it was entitled to rely on both the 1999 order and the 2004 issuance of a temporary license when determining the start date of the suspension rather than assuming it commenced upon Hedges\u2019s release. Therefore, DMV concludes, it did not act with gross negligence or recklessly, willfully and wantonly when it issued Hedges a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">Here, the reinstatement of Hedges\u2019s license was possibly governed by two separate statutes: I.C. \u00a7 49-326A,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> governing the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ministration of judicially suspended licenses that become effective after release from imprisonment, and I.C. \u00a7 49-328,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> governing the reinstatement of suspended licenses when the period for suspension has expired. These statutes work together. For I.C. \u00a7 49-326A to apply to a reinstatement, the judge must order the suspension to begin upon release from imprisonment; if so, then the DMV must follow certain procedures, such as requiring documentation from the driver seeking reinstatement regarding his release date, before it can reinstate the license. Idaho Code \u00a7 49-328 applies to all situations once the period of suspension has expired. Therefore, if a driver seeks a reinstatement, and that driver\u2019s suspension was ordered to begin after the period of his imprisonment, he must meet both the requirements of I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 49-326A and 49-328. If, however, the driver\u2019s suspension does not begin after the period of his imprisonment, then he must meet only the requirements of I.C. \u00a7 49-328 before DMV shall reinstate his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">There is no question that DMV followed the procedures set out in I.C. \u00a7 49-328. Therefore, it can only have acted negligently if the reinstatement of Hedges\u2019s license should have also been governed by I.C. \u00a7 49-326A. In order to determine if I.C. \u00a7 49-326A applied to the reinstatement, it is necessary to determine whether Hedges\u2019s sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>pension was <em>ordered to begin after Ms release.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Judge Morfitt\u2019s original order provided for a five-year suspension, but was silent as to the start date. However, his subsequent issuance of a temporary license to Hedges indicated that the suspension did not commence after the date Hedges was released from prison. Instead, it specifically states that the suspension began on July 9, 1999. Cafferty insists that this does not matter for two reasons: (1) Reed had already changed the suspension start date prior to receiving the temporary license; and (2) DMV should have ignored the district court\u2019s statement and instead applied I.C. \u00a7 18-8005(5)(d) to figure the start date of the suspension. Both of these arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">To begin, Cafferty\u2019s first argument fails under the facts of the case. Although Reed first changed the start date on his own accord to July 20, 1999, he again changed it to reflect the judge\u2019s statement that the suspension began on July 9, 1999. Therefore, the fact that Reed had previously changed it is immaterial because the DMV did not rely on this change when reinstating Hedges\u2019s license. Since Hedges\u2019s license was reinstated on July 13, 2004, it is clear that DMV did not and could not have relied on Reed\u2019s original change when it reinstated Hedges\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">While we have found immunity as to the claim under I.C. \u00a7 49-326A, the DMV\u2019s actions are not above reproach. The evidence before us indicates that DMV ignored the procedure for reinstating licenses under I.C. \u00a7 49-326A. There is no indication that DMV implemented the changes prescribed by the legislature when it adopted this statute, nor even trained their employees so as to make them aware of a secondary procedure they would need to follow in certain instances. The failure to implement training to follow the Legislature\u2019s mandates by a shoddy or nonexistent training program is inexcusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Next, Cafferty\u2019s second argument also fails as only the district court had the authority to suspend Hedges\u2019s license as part of his sentence and DMV could not disregard this authority. Hedges\u2019s suspension was part of his criminal sentence, and our courts are charged with the authority to pass, determine and impose sentences. I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18-106; 18-107. In addition to the charge, our legislature has given courts the exclusive authority to suspend or revoke licenses upon conviction for DUI. I.C. \u00a7 49-325(l)(b). DMV has the authority to suspend licenses when a court fails to order a mandatory suspension. I.C. \u00a7 49-326(l)(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, such was not the case here, as the district court ordered a mandatory suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Rather than failing to order a mandatory suspension, in this instance the district court incorrectly applied the provisions of I.C. \u00a7 18-8005(5)(d) when sentencing Hedges for DUI by failing to begin the mandatory suspension after Hedges\u2019s incarceration ended. However, this mistake does not give DMV the authority to apply the provisions of I.C. \u00a7 18 \u2014 8005(5)(d) in derogation of the court\u2019s later statement regarding the start date, nor does it give DMV the authority to refuse to apply the start date later indicated by the judge to Hedges\u2019s suspension. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 49-328 (the DMV <em>shall </em>reinstate a license when the period of suspension has ended). The DMV could not disregard the judge\u2019s clear statement as to the start date. <em>See Fullmer v. Collard, </em>143 Idaho 171, 174, 139 P.3d 773, 776 (Ct.App.2006) (stating that the IDOC is not justified in refusing to apply to a defendant\u2019s sentence credits incorrectly calculated by the sentencing judge); <em>see also In re Weick, </em>142 Idaho 275, 279, 127 P.3d 178, 182 (2005) (noting that a party may not knowingly violate a court order he believes to be incorrect or he risks contempt and noting that public policy dictates that parties obey court orders).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Here, DMV relied on the information provided in the district court\u2019s order and temporary license. DMV had a copy of the temporary license prior to the date they reinstated Hedges\u2019s license, and they used the date on the temporary license to recalculate the end date of Hedges\u2019s suspension. The require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ments of I.C. \u00a7 49-326A, which apply only when a suspension begins after releases from imprisonment, were not applicable here because Hedges\u2019s suspension began prior to his imprisonment according to a later, explicit statement by the district court. DMV was entitled, then, to rely only on the provisions of I.C. \u00a7 49-328 when reinstating Hedges\u2019s license. Therefore, as a matter of law, DMV\u2019s reinstatement of Hedges\u2019s license using the requirements of I.C. \u00a7 49-328 but not those in I.C. \u00a7 49-326A was not grossly negligent or reckless, willful and wanton. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the negligence claim based on I.C. \u00a7 18-8005(5)(d) and I.C. \u00a7 49-326A on summary judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">We turn now to Cafferty\u2019s argument that DMV was grossly negligent in issuing Hedges a license because DMV has a mandatory duty to not issue licenses to either habitual drunkards or to those whom DMV should have known would be harmful to the public\u2019s safety if allowed to drive on our highways. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 49-303(6), (10).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, there are genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment on the issue of DMV\u2019s immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">At the time DMV reinstated Hedges\u2019s license, he had eight previous DUIs, and DMV\u2019s records show a total of seven DUIs, three being felony DUIs. While our case law and statutes fail to define habitual drunkard, a reasonable jury could find that a person with seven DUI convictions is a \u201chabitual drunkard,\u201d and that DMV acted with gross negligence or recklessly, willfully and wantonly by reinstating the unrestricted license of a person with such a large number of DUIs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Likewise, a jury could also find that DMV should have known that Hedges would be harmful to the public if allowed to drive on the highways of this state. Hedges had a lengthy history of DUI arrests, had served the full aggregate sentence for his last felony DUI and had received the maximum suspension sentence allowed under Idaho law. All of these facts suggest that he would be a danger to the public if allowed to drive. Therefore, because there is a question of fact as to whether DMV acted with gross negligence or recklessly, willfully and wantonly, we remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">We reverse the district court\u2019s decision that Cafferty had not raised the issue of negligence under I.C. \u00a7 49-303 in her complaint and hold that there is a question of fact as to whether DMV\u2019s reinstatement of Hedges\u2019s license was grossly negligent or reckless, willful and wanton pursuant to the mandatory duties proscribed in I.C. \u00a7 49-303 and remand. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to DMV on Cafferty\u2019s negligence claims based on I.C. \u00a7 18-8005(5)(d) and I.C. \u00a7 49-326A. Neither party requested attorney fees. Costs are awarded to the prevailing party.</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-11\">Chief Justice SCHROEDER and Justices TROUT, EISMANN and JONES, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-12\">. Hedges was charged with his ninth DUI on August 2, 2004, in Meridian. He pled guilty to these charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-13\">. In her brief, Cafferty claims this letter contains a typographical error, and was meant to inform Hedges that his license was suspended until April 26, 2006. She does not provide any authority indicating that the letter does contain a typographical error as to the date. However, the record does show that DMV\u2019s records initially indicated a reinstatement date of April 26, 2006. Regardless of which date is correct, the analysis remains the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b359-11\">.
