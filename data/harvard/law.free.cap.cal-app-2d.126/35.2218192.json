No other sums were paid by the respondents or credited to their account. In February, 1952, the remaining equipment was repossessed by appellant, removed to the business premises of one V. P. Hunt at Redlands, and sold to Hunt for $12,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">This lawsuit was then commenced to recover the unpaid balance on the contract, less credits for the aforementioned $2,100 and $12,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Paragraph 2 of the conditional sales contract executed by the parties provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">\u201cShould Purchaser fail or neglect to comply with any term or condition of this contract, or to make any payment provided for herein, when due or payable, or violate any of the provisions hereof, or should Purchaser become financially involved, or if Seller should feel insecure or deem the property in danger of misuse or confiscation, or in case of any unusual or unreasonable depreciation in the value thereof, or in case Purchaser has made any misrepresentation as to his name, address or occupation, Seller at his option, and without notice to Purchaser, may declare the whole amount unpaid hereunder immediately due and payable, or Seller may, without notice to Purchaser, declare all of Purchaser\u2019s rights under this contract terminated, and without demand first made, and with .or without legal process, immediately take possession of said property, together with all additions, equipment and accessories thereto, wherever the same may be found, using all necessary force so to do, and hold the same, together with title thereto, and Purchaser waives all claims for damages due to or arising from, or connected with any such taking. Should Seller take possession of such property, all the rights of Purchaser under this contract shall immediately terminate, and all payments theretofore made hereunder shall belong absolutely to Seller, and Purchaser shall pay to Seller all instalments then delinquent upon this contract; upon any such termination, Seller may, if he so desires, but shall not be obliged so to do, sell said property at public or private sale, <em>with or with notice </em>to Purchaser (if given, notice by mail to Purchaser\u2019s address as given on this contract being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>sufficient), with or without having such property at the place of sale, and upon the terms and in such manner as Seller, or his assigns, may determine, and Seller or his assigns, may bid at any such sale. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be the remainder after deducting from the Selling price all expenses for re-taking and conditioning, keeping and selling such property, including the attorney\u2019s fees aforesaid. In case the net proceeds from such sale, added to the payments theretofore made hereunder, do not cover the total payments required to be made by Purchaser hereunder, then Purchaser agrees to pay to Seller, on demand, such difference, with interest thereon from the date of sale at highest rate for which parties may lawfully contract in the State in which this contract is executed. Purchaser hereby waives all statutes of limitation in any way affecting the time within which Seller may enforce its rights hereunder and the defense thereof.\u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The contract in its entirety, except for typed insertions, was a printed form. At the bottom thereof was a notation, \u201cNo. 152\u2014Law Ptg. Co., 4505 W. 1st, L.A. . . .,\u201d indicating it to be a form commonly available in stationery stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">At the conclusion of appellant\u2019s case respondents moved for a nonsuit on the ground that no notice of sale to the purchasers had been given as required by the language of the conditional sales contract: \u201cSeller may, if he so desires, but shall not be obliged so to do, sell said property at public or private sale, <em>with or with notice </em>to Purchaser . . .\u201d (Italics ours.) The trial court sustained the position of respondents and granted the motion for nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Appellant urges that the letters \u201cout\u201d were inadvertently omitted from the printed form of contract, that they should be read into the instrument by the court so that the crucial phrase would become \u201cwith or without notice,\u201d that pursuant thereto no notice of sale was required, but that in any event there was sufficient testimony indicating oral notice to respondents to require denial of the motion for nonsuit. He has therefore appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Ordinarily it is presumed that the parties read and understood the import of their contract and that they had the intention which its terms manifest. As a general rule, the office of interpretation or construction is to ascertain the intention of the parties exclusively from the words which they have used, and not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>But the words employed and the purpose of a writing must be ascertained solely from a common-sense meaning of them as a whole.  A contract, and its component parts, must be given a reasonable rather than an unreasonable construction. <em>(Broome </em>v. <em>Broome, </em>104 Cal.App.2d 148, 157 [231 P.2d 171].) In so doing we must bear in mind that words should be employed merely as a means and not as an end. Language, it has been said, is but the dress of thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Therefore, as stated by the court in <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Graner, </em>91 Cal.App.2d 858, 863-864 [206 P.2d 38] : \u201cThe general rule which should be applied is stated in 17 Corpus Juris Secundum, page 725, as follows: \u2018Where it is clear that a word or term has been used inadvertently, and it is clearly inconsistent with, and repugnant to, the meaning of the parties, it will be rejected altogether. Conversely, where, by inadvertence, words are plainly omitted from a contract, they may be supplied by construction if the context indicates what they are.\u2019 Mr. Williston says, volume 3, revised edition, page 1781: \u2018The court will if possible give effect to all parts of the instrument and an interpretation which gives a reasonable meaning to all its provisions will be preferred to one which leaves a portion of the writing useless or inexplicable; and if this is impossible an interpretation which gives effect to the main apparent purpose of the contract will be favored. Indeed, in giving effect to the general meaning of a writing, particular words are sometimes wholly disregarded, or supplied, or transposed. . . .\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">This rule appears to be universally accepted.  If necessary to carry out the intention of a contract, words may be transposed, rejected, or supplied, to make its meaning more clear. <em>(Potthoff </em>v. <em>Safety Armorite Conduit Co., </em>143 App.Div. 161 [127 N.Y.S. 994, 995].)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In this field, the use of the words \u201cor\u201d and \u201cand\u201d interchangeably in legislation and contracts has been the subject of frequent animadversion on the part of courts. In fact, so often has this particular problem arisen, it was said in <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>203 Cal. 553, 563 [265 P. 223], that the solution \u201chas come to depend almost wholly upon the context in which one or the other of these words appears . . .\u201d To the same effect are <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>97 Cal. 314 [32 P. 310], and <em>Abbey </em>v. <em>Board of Directors, etc. Irr. Dist., </em>58 Cal.App. 757 [209 P. 709]. Also see <em>Kasun </em>v. <em>Todevich, </em>71 Mont. 315 [229 P. 714], in which \u201cor\u201d was substituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>for \u201cin\u201d because a phrase with the latter was \u201cmeaningless in the connection in which it is employed.'\u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">There are numerous examples of substitution of words in order to arrive at an intelligible text. In <em>Schroeder </em>v. <em>Griggs, </em>80 Kan. 357 [102 P. 469], a negative was read as an affirmative. In <em>Butter </em>v. <em>Bohn, </em>31 Minn. 325 [17 N.W. 862], \u201celeven hundred\u201d became \u201celeven hundred dollars.\u201d In <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>Green, </em>95 P. 334, \u201cnorth\u201d was read to be \u201csouth.\u201d In <em>Marion </em>v. <em>Faxon, </em>20 Conn. 486, \u201cme\u201d was construed to mean \u201chim.\u201d In <em>Nusbaum </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>276 Pa. 526 [120 A. 481], \u201cof\u201d became \u201cthereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">There are also a great many illustrations of additional words being inserted to complete a phrase. In <em>Gran </em>v. <em>Spangenberg, </em>53 Minn. 42 [54 N.W. 933], \u201cone\u201d was placed before \u201chundred and fifty dollars.\u201d In <em>Wallis Iron Works </em>v. <em>Monmouth Park Assn., </em>55 N.J.L. 132 [26 A. 140, 19 L.R.A. 456, 39 Am.St.Rep. 626], the crucial word \u201cfail\u201d was added. In <em>Pacific Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Toye, </em>224 Mass. 98 [112 N.E. 653], the amount of yearly premium was judicially written into a blank space. In <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Wead, </em>122 Neb. 854 [241 N.W. 556, 559], the words \u201cthen\u201d or \u201cthereafter\u201d were said to be implied. In <em>Mondou </em>v. <em>Lincoln Mut. Casualty Co., </em>283 Mich. 353 [278 N.W. 94, 96], the word \u201cby\u201d was included to complete an important sentence. In <em>Kaifer </em>v. <em>Georgia Cas. Co., </em>(9th Circ.) 67 F.2d 309, \u201cadditional\u201d was inserted in front of \u201cassured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Factually comparable to the instant case is <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Nichols, Dean </em>&amp; <em>Gregg, 87 </em>Ark. 97 [112 S.W. 209], particularly in that an omitted word completely altered the contractual obligation. There a letter relied on as a contract of employment read (p. 209) : \u201cWe are willing to allow you 10 hours for each day that we work a full day both winter and summer but we can promise to give you work at $2.50 per day when the mill is not running ...\u201d The court held omission of the word \u201cnot\u201d before the word \u201cpromise\u201d was a plain inadvertence, correction of which the contract itself readily and naturally accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Missing words supplied in the cases generally fall into two categories. The first are those words, the omission of which through ellipsis is sanctioned by usage for the sake of brevity, and which are necessarily understood to complete grammatical construction. An apt illustration is this quotation from <em>Hamilton </em>(p. 559): \u201cTwo things cannot be first. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>sentence \u2018We will first go to the opera and to supper\u2019 the word \u2018then\u2019 is understood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The second category are those in which the omission is patently an inadvertence or clerical misprision. A splendid example of this is <em>Lincoln Joint Stock Land Bank </em>v. <em>Bexten, </em>129 Neb. 422 [261 N.W. 845], in which to the phrase \u201cpart of the second part\u201d the letters \u201cies\u201d were supplied to make it read \u201cparties of the second part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The instant case falls into the latter class. It should be obvious to all reasonable men that the letters \u201cout\u201d were inadvertently omitted from the end of the third word in the printed, expression \u201cwith or with notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The interpretation of terms in any particular case is controlled by the context of the writing, and the whole instrument must be examined. <em>(Universal Sales Corp. </em>v. <em>California etc. Mfg. Co., </em>20 Cal.2d 751, 768 [128 P.2d 665].) As respondent insists, in so doing we employ an objective, not a subjective test. <em>(King </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>32 Cal.2d 584, 591 [197 P.2d 321].)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Paragraph 2 of the conditional sales contract involved herein uses the expressions \u201cwith or without legal process\u201d and \u201cwith or without having such property at the place of sale.\u201d The same paragraph twice uses the word \u201cwithout\u201d immediately preceding the word \u201cnotice\u201d and once additionally preceding the word \u201cdemand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The foregoing suggests a pattern of phraseology with which \u201cwith or without notice\u201d would have been consistent, \u201cwith or with notice\u201d an inexplicable redundancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">It might be contended, though respondent has not done so, that it is just as conceivable the words \u201cwith or\u201d were erroneously included as it is the letters \u201cout\u201d were erroneously excluded. If that were the situation, however, and notice was thus necessary, the clause in parentheses following the one in question would indeed be strange: \u201c <em>(if given,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">notice by mail to Purchaser\u2019s address as given on this contract being sufficient).\u201d That language appears to be more consistent with optional rather than required notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">Were we to adopt respondent\u2019s strict interpretation of words we would be subverting the only reasonable interpretation of the instrument as a whole. No court should slavishly bow before meaningless words. The terms employed in a writing' must be made the servants and not the masters of a perspicuous intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">Having read into the contract the phrase \u201cwith or without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>notice,\u201d we find it unnecessary to discuss at length whether there was prima facie evidence of actual notice given by appellant. Bearing in mind that on motion for nonsuit, however, \u201cthe rule is almost axiomatic that the court is bound for the purpose of the motion to accept and treat as true every piece of evidence which tends to establish the plaintiff\u2019s case and to reject all which tends to disprove it\u201d <em>(Williamson </em>v. <em>Pacific Greyhound Lines, 78 </em>Cal.App.2d 482, 485 [177 P.2d 977]), there was sufficient indication of notice to have required a denial of the motion for nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Respondents have raised several affirmative defenses which merit consideration on the retrial of this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The judgment of nonsuit is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
