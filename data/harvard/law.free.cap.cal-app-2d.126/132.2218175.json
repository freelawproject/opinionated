The trial court found in favor of the appellant wife in reference to the divorce issue, and found \u201cThat none of the allegations in paragraph IV of the complaint is true except that the 1950 Buick automobile and certain furniture and furnishings in possession of the defendants as hereinafter set forth are community property.\u201d Paragraph IV of the complaint continued the conspiracy, allegations hereinbefore referred to in reference to the ownership of an apartment house claimed to be community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">An interlocutory divorce, granted to the wife, gave to the respondent husband the Buick automobile, and to the wife certain designated items of household furnishings. Cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>tody of the two minor children was awarded to the parties jointly, physical possession of the children being given to the wife subject to the husband\u2019s right to have said children on alternate weekends and during one-half of vacation periods. The husband was ordered to pay $120 per month for support of the children, $1.00 per month alimony, and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Appellant complains \u201cThat the plaintiff did not receive a fair and impartial trial, and justice did not prevail.\u201d  Among other points appellant contends that \u201cThere is an incomplete judgment,\u201d in that although the action was brought against the husband\u2019s father and mother, Victor B. and Ruth K. Tonnesen, no judgment was rendered for or against these parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Answering this contention respondents\u2019 brief points out that, as hereinbefore mentioned, the trial court found that paragraph IV of the complaint related to these defendants was not true. Moreover, as appears from the clerk\u2019s transcript, the interlocutory judgment of divorce from which plaintiff now appeals, was prepared by appellant\u2019s attorneys.  As respondents state, \u201cIt would therefore be a very odd rule that would permit counsel for an appealing party to prepare a judgment and leave out some phase, submit the same to the Court without an approval as to form, and then base an appeal upon the fact that counsel left out a portion thereof.\u201d  It is a well established rule that an interpretation upholding the validity of a judgment is favored, and that to clarify any uncertainty, \u201cresort may be had to the findings of fact.\u201d <em>(Goldworthy </em>v. <em>Dobbins, </em>110 Cal.App.2d 802, 810 [243 P.2d 883].)  In the present case, the findings of fact make it clear that plaintiff\u2019s allegations concerning a conspiracy involving the husband\u2019s father and mother, were not true, and that the only judgment intended was that which was rendered, namely an interlocutory judgment of divorce. Appellant has suffered no prejudice in the instant situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The appellant further contends that \u201cThe husband disposed of community property in fraud of the wife\u2019s rights, and the greater part of said property ended up in the possession of his mother and father.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief culls from the record certain items of testimony by the wife and by the husband\u2019s mother alleged to support this contention. A review of the entire record, however, discloses substantial evidence in suppo'rt of the trial court\u2019s finding that plaintiff\u2019s allegations concerning these matters were not true. The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>community property found to exist was a Buick automobile awarded to the husband, and certain household furnishings given to the wife. Such being the ease, the well established rule prevents a further review of the evidence or a retrial of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Certain pieces of real estate had been purchased with money supplied by the husband and wife, which properties were later sold, the parties receiving back the amount of equities therein. What is referred to as the Berwick property was sold to the husband\u2019s parents for $12,000, a part of the consideration being the cancellation of two notes in the amount of $7,500 which had been given to the parents, and a cash payment by the parents of $4,500.  Another complaint relates to certain money received as damages in a personal injury action and paid over to the husband\u2019s parents. There is substantial evidence, however, indicating that in this transaction, the parents were only being reimbursed for doctor bills and expenses for which money had been furnished. Appellant\u2019s contentions that in these and other transactions the trial court should have found that the wife was being defrauded, present no matter requiring or justifying a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Other contentions made by appellant are likewise without merit. The record does not support the assertion that \u201cThe husband obtained the signature of the wife to community real property while she was incompetent.\u201d In refusing to allow plaintiff to file an amended complaint, the trial court exercised its discretion, and there is no showing that in so doing, there was any abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The same may be said in reference to appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in awarding the plaintiff wife only a dollar per month alimony.\u201d Considering the fact that there was no property other than the husband\u2019s earnings, from which the husband was ordered to pay $120 per month for support of the children, plus a fee for the wife\u2019s attorney, the trial court by making an alimony award of $1.00 per month, left the matter of alimony open for modification should conditions change. This is not an uncommon practice, and no reversible error is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Appellant further complains that the wife was not awarded half or more of the community property. It appears that the trial court gave a Buick automobile to the husband, purchased in 1950 for $3,000 but value at time of trial not shown. The wife was awarded the household furnishings, valued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>at $640. The husband was further ordered to pay a community medical bill of $1,500. These matters were doubtless taken into consideration by the trial court in dividing the property, and the record presents no reversible error in reference thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">There is no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cThe Court committed reversible error when it erroneously excluded certain evidence, and . . . refused to allow the plaintiff to make an offer of proof. \u2019 \u2019 These alleged errors relate to a refusal to admit evidence concerning injuries received by plaintiff in a automobile accident, total sales price of the Berwick property, cross-examination of the husband in regard to a doctor <em>bill; </em>and as to when the wife had been permitted to see the children, in regard to which latter item an offer of proof was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">It appears that the excluded evidence related largely to irrelevant and immaterial matters, and that both parties were accorded a fair and impartial trial with adequate latitude in respect to all relevant evidentiary matters. After hearing the evidence, the trial court found on all material issues, granted an interlocutory divorce to appellant wife, divided the existing community property, made an award for child support, and left the matter of alimony open by granting nominal alimony to the wife. The evidence supports the findings and judgment, and no reversible error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
