In August, 1946, appellant employed respondent to determine whether a machine could be designed which would assemble fruit baskets with tin protected edges. As a result of the report made by respondent the parties entered into two written agreements on March 8, 1947. One agreement (hereinafter called Agreement A) bound respondent to manufacture successively three similar machines for assembling tin-edged fruit baskets. The other agreement (hereinafter called Agreement B) was for the manufacture of a machine for folding Y-shaped strips of tin into half squares, to be used as edging for the boxes. The machine to be manufactured under Agreement B was thus described in that agreement: \u2018\u2018 a machine for folding half square metal frames for Tin Top Fruit Baskets from cut lengths of straight 'V\u2019 groove metal strip. This machine will be an attachment to be added to and driven from an existing machine, now Mir. Mainieri\u2019s property, which produces three straight \u2018Y\u2019 groove metal strips simultaneously in each operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Respondent produced under Agreement A a machine which the court found met all the terms and provisions of that agreement. It is not disputed that the evidence supports this finding. Respondent was unable, however, to manufacture a satisfactory machine under Agreement B, because the machine furnished by appellant, to which the one to be manufactured by respondent under Agreement B was to be attached, did not in fact produce <em>straight </em>Y-groove metal strips. It is undenied in the evidence that respondent made every reasonable effort to readjust appellant\u2019s machine so that it would produce straight metal strips, and that no adjustment of it could be made which would bring about this result. It is also established by the evidence that without a machine which would fold Y-groove metal strips into half squares, the basket assembling machine manufactured under Agreement A would not be commercially useful to appellant. For this reason appellant refused to accept the completed machine or to pay the balance due thereon, and sued to recover back the payments already made under both agreements. Respondent cross-complained for the balance due him under Agreement A and was given judgment therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The parties devote much time to the discussion of whether the two agreements should be construed as a single contrae!. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1642.) The trial judge in a memorandum filed at the time that he ordered judgment, said: \u201cWhether the two writings are considered as one contract or as two contracts they are interrelated, and as the Court views the evidence the result would be the same whether they are considered as one contract or as two contracts.\u201d We agree with this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The whole case hinges on the proper construction of the language above quoted from Agreement B. By the first sentence above quoted respondent agreed to manufacture \u201ca machine for folding half square metal frames . . . from cut lengths of <em>straight </em>\u2018V\u2019 groove metal strip.\u201d By the second sentence it was provided that this machine was to be an attachment to an existing machine belonging to appellant \u201cwhich produces . . . <em>straight </em>. . . strips. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Appellant\u2019s position is that the parties agreed upon the fact that appellant\u2019s machine does produce <em>straight </em>strips. Por this reason he objected in the court below to the evidence which showed that the machine in fact did not produce <em>straight </em>strips and could not be made to produce them.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">It is respondent\u2019s position that appellant bound himself to supply a machine which produces <em>straight </em>strips and that his failure to do so excused respondent\u2019s performance of his agreement to produce the machine called for by Agreement B.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The contract itself makes it perfectly clear that respondent only bound himself under Agreement B to manufacture a machine for folding half squares \u201cfrom cut lengths of straight . . . strip.\u201d The first sentence of the agreement quoted is explicit on that. By the second quoted sentence this machine which was to fold half squares from <em>straight </em>strips was to be an attachment to appellant\u2019s existing machine \u201cwhich produces . . . straight . . . strips. \u201d It is clear that the machine called for by the contract, i.e. one which folds half squares from straight strips, could only be successfully attached to appellant\u2019s machine if appellant\u2019s machine does produce straight strips. The court, we think, correctly found that the machine to which the one to be manufactured was to be attached \u201cwas represented as producing straight . . . strips,\u201d that it did not do so and that respondent could not produce a machine to fold into half squares the metal strips produced by appellant\u2019s machine because they were not straight.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>This brings into play the rule of the Restatement of Contracts, section 262: \u201cWhere a promise cannot be performed in accordance with its proper interpretation without some precedent or concurrent act or forbearance by the promisee, the act or forbearance is a condition.\u201d <em>(Lapp-Gifford Co. </em>v. <em>Muscoy Water Co., </em>166 Cal. 25, 30 [134 P. 989]; <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>New York Cent. &amp; H. R. R. Co., </em>102 N.Y. 205 [6 N.E. 386, 388] ; <em>Mill Dam Foundery </em>v. <em>Hovey, </em>21 Pick. (Mass.) 417, 439; 3 Corbin on Contracts, \u00a7 640, pp. 546-548; 3 Williston on Contracts, rev. ed. 1936, \u00a7 887A, pp. 2494-2497.)  The failure of appellant to perform this condition precedent excused respondent\u2019s performance which was dependent on it. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1439, and cases cited <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">It thus becomes immaterial whether the two agreements are regarded as one contract or not. In either case respondent\u2019s failure to perform the particular obligation was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Appellant\u2019s complaint of the delay of the trial judge in deciding the case affords no ground for reversal. The other points made have to do with the claim that the two agreements were one contract, a question which we have concluded is immaterial under the facts found.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Nourse, P. J., and Kaufman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
