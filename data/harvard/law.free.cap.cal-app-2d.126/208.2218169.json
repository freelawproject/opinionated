The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>appeal has been well briefed and argued by counsel appointed by this court at appellant\u2019s request. The sole ground relied upon is that the failure of the trial court to require a report of the probation officer before sentencing appellant was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Penal Code, section 1203, so far as here pertinent provides: \u201cprobation shall not be granted ... to any defendant convicted of the crime of . . . violation of section . . . 288 ... of this code . . . unless the court shall be satisfied that he has never been previously convicted of a felony in this State nor previously convicted in any other place of a public offense which would have been a felony if committed in this State . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">On cross-examination during the trial of the charge against him appellant admitted that he had previously been convicted of a felony, grand theft. This fact, under the quoted provision of section 1203, rendered appellant ineligible for probation and no prejudice could have been suffered by him through the court\u2019s refusal to order a report from the probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Appellant argues that under sections 969, 969% and 1025 of the Penal Code the prior convictions must be charged in the indictment or information in order to be considered by the court in applying the provision of section 1203 above quoted. The court ruled otherwise in <em>People </em>v. <em>Leach, </em>22 Cal.App.2d 525 [71 P.2d 594]. We are satisfied of the correctness of the reasoning and conclusion of the court in that case. The very language of section 1203, \u201cunless the court <em>shall he satisfied </em>that he has never been previously convicted of a felony,\u201d shows on its face that the court is entitled to go beyond the issues framed by the indictment or information . in determining whether the defendant is entitled to probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Nourse, P. J., and Kaufman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
