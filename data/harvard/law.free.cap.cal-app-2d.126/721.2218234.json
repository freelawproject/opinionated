It is argued that since the testator did not sign his name immediately after the words and figures: \u201cI witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand to this my Last Will and Testament. January 11th 1952,\u201d the will was incomplete and that decedent\u2019s name appearing prior and subsequent thereto was not intended by him as his signature. We cannot agree with this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In <em>Estate of Bloch, </em>39 Cal.2d 570 [248 P.2d 21], the sole question was whether the decedent\u2019s name, which appeared only in the body of the will, constituted a signature within the meaning of the statute (Prob. Code, \u00a753). The court held that the signature need not be located at the end but may appear in another part of the document provided the testator wrote his name there with the intention of authenticating or executing the instrument as his will; that where a decedent\u2019s signature is found only in the body of a document which is claimed to be a will, the court must determine from an inspection of the instrument\u2019s language, form and relative position of its parts whether or not there is a positive and satisfactory inference that the decedent\u2019s name was placed in that location with the intention of executing the instrument, and if such an inference appears, the execution is considered proven; and that the courts of this state have been very liberal in sustaining the validity of holographic wills which appear to be complete testamentary documents although signed elsewhere than at the end.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">In <em>Estate of Kinney, </em>16 Cal.2d 50 [104 P.2d 782], it is said: \u201cAs to a holographic will the statute requires that it be ' entirely written, dated, and signed by the hand of the testator himself.\u2019 (See. 53, Prob. Code, formerly see. 1277, Civ. Code.) Unlike a witnessed will, which must be \u2018subscribed at the end thereof\u2019 (see. 50, Prob. Code, formerly see. 1276, Civ. Code), the authenticating signature of the testator is not required to be at the end, but may be found elsewhere in the body of the testamentary document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">In <em>Estate of Tonneson, </em>81 Cal.App.2d 703 [185 P.2d 78], appellant\u2019s main contention was that the end of the will involved was above the attestation clause and that the decedent\u2019s signature appearing in that clause was a part thereof and not a subscription to the instrument which preceded that clause, and that section 50 of the Probate Code was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>complied with. In that case as in the ease before us the attestation clause stated that the foregoing instrument, which immediately preceded it, was signed, published and declared to be his last will by the deceased in the presence of the witnesses who, at his request and in his presence, subscribed their names as witnesses. The only signature of the deceased which appeared in that document was the signature near the beginning of the attestation clause, and this court there said (p. 707) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\u201cIt is a reasonable inference that this signature is the one to which the witnesses referred and attested, and that it was placed there for the purpose of executing that instrument as a will. In our opinion, a substantial compliance with this statute sufficiently appears in this case to support the judgment and order appealed from.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In the instant ease the will was entirely in the handwriting of the deceased and Ms signature appears in two places, to wit, at the beginning of the will, which was held to be a sufficient signing in <em>Estate of Wallace, </em>100 Cal.App.2d 237, 239 [223 P.2d 284], and again in the attestation clause which recites that the instrument bears the signature of the testator. The will is a complete testamentary document and discloses the intent of the testator to dispose of all of his property. Substantial compliance with section 53 of the Probate Code was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Barnard, P. J., and Griffin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
