Some of the alleged agreed facts consist of conflicting statements of what various representatives of the parties, and others, said they saw and what they are said to have told each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">The facts, other than such statements, which are agreed are that a tenant in the plaintiff\u2019s building had an oil -burning portable stove for heating purposes which she lighted and left in one of the rooms of her apartment. Smoke from that stove damaged the building to the extent of $45. The flame of the stove ignited nothing outside the stove \u201cand nothing burned except the wick and the oil in the stove\u201d. There was conflicting evidence as to whether the stove was found lying on its side, and a statement by one person that \u201che saw marks on the floor which might have been made by contact of the hot-side of the stove with the floor\u201d was contradicted by other people who said \u201cthat they looked for such marks and found none.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Such a statement of \u201cagreed facts\u201d does not constitute a case stated. But a report to this division of a decision on facts agreed as evidence (as seems to \"be the ease here) is to he treated as raising the question of law whether on all the evidence the finding (in this case for the plaintiff) was warranted as matter of law. <em>Frati v. Jannini, </em>226 Mass. 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\">The trial judge instructed himself, as requested by the defendant, that the burden was upon the plaintiff to bring her case within the terms of the policy and, further, that there was no evidence from which he could find that the plaintiff sustained any loss by reason of any fire separate and distinct from the flame of the stove. In so ruling we think he was right. The law in this commonwealth is that if damage is done by a fire intentionally lighted and maintained for a useful purpose in connection with the occupation of premises and which does not pass beyond the limits assigned to it there can be no recovery. <em>Way v. Abington Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>166 Mass. 67; <em>Ellis v. Norwich Union Fire Ins. Socy. Ltd., </em>259 Mass. 450. It seems that in order for one insured against fire to recover there must be proof that there was damage from a fire which starts from a useful and intentional <em>fire </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>a friendly fire in a place where fires are never lighted nor maintained. Therefore, in order to recover in this ease, the burden is upon the plaintiff to show damage from a fire other than the flame in the oil stove. The \u201cagreed facts\u201d, however, recite that \u201cnothing burned except the wick and the oil in the stove.\u201d The question remains whether the \u201cagreed facts\u201d contain evidence which would warrant a finding that there was a fire outside of the stove. The only scintilla of evidence to this effect is that \u201cA representative of the plaintiff stated that he saw marks on the floor which might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>been made by contact of the hot-side of the stove with the floor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\">It was open to the trial judge to believe this evidence and find that the \u201chot-side\u201d of the stove charred or scorched the floor. The law seems to be, however, that in order for a fire to exist there must be a flame or glow. Mere heat without a flame or glow is not enough. See \"The Meaning of Fire in an Insurance Policy Against Loss or Damage by Fire\u201d by Edwin H. Abbott, Jr., in 24 Harvard Law Review, 119, and the cases therein collected and discussed. It is common knowledge that charring or scorching may be accomplished by heat alone without the presence of any flame or glow as, for example, by a flatiron, which, although not red-hot and without causing any flame, can cause charring or scorching. We are of opinion that the \u201cagreed facts\u201d contain no evidence which would warrant a finding that there was a \u201cfire\u201d in the insured premises Within the meaning of that word as used in a fire insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Even if there were such a \u201cfire\u201d in this case the \u201cagreed facts\u201d state flatly that \u201cthe smoke emanating from said stove had damaged said building\u201d to the amount of $45. Thus it seems that the whole damage claimed, and found, was caused by smoke coming from the friendly fire in the stove and there is no evidence that any of said damage was caused by smoke from the charring or scorching of the floor. Consequently, even if said charring or scorching be held to constitute a \u201cfire\u201d, there is no evidence that any smoke from it caused any of the damage complained of. It seems that in order to recover the plaintiff must prove that the damage was done by smoke or flame from a fire separate and distinct from the fire in the stove. <em>Ellis v.
