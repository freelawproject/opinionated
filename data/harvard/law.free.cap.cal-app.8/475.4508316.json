J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOe\">This action was brought to recover $350 for services alleged to have been rendered and performed by the assignors of plaintiff for defendant at his special instance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>and request. The complaint alleges that defendant promised and agreed to pay to plaintiff\u2019s assignors the said sum of $350 for such services. The answer denies that the plaintiff\u2019s assignors ever rendered or performed any services for defendant at his special instance or request or otherwise, or that defendant ever promised to pay $350 or any other sum for any such services or for any services.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The case was tried before the court with a jury duly impaneled.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Plaintiff, in order to prove his case, introduced without objection an agreement in writing, signed by defendant, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">\u201cSan Francisco, California, August 27, 1906.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">\u201cI hereby authorize Sullivan, Feder <em>&amp; </em>Kahn exclusively for the term of five days from date to sell and enter into and sign a writing contract in my name and for me, for the sale and conveyance of the following described property: Situate in the City and County of San Francisco, State of California, to wit, on the north line of Geary street 141 3/12 feet east of Fillmore street 25 by 127 6/12 feet, with the improvements thereon in course of alteration; leased for -five years from Oct. 1, 1906, at $300 per month. Cost of alterations to be paid by purchaser. And I agree to accept the sum of fourteen thousand dollars ($14,000.00) in U. S. gold coin, and I agree to pay Sullivan, Feder &amp; Kahn <em>2y2 </em>per cent commission on the sale price thereof. G. M. ROY.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Mr. Feder was called by plaintiff as a witness, and testified that on the twenty-ninth day of August, 1906, the defendant came into the office and asked that no further efforts be made to sell the property under the contract, and that defendant then and there said to witness: \u201cDan O\u2019Callaghan has an' offer for this property. He has a deposit of $500, and I believe that he will sell it, and therefore if he does sell it I will get $500 over and above what your price calls for.\u201d While this witness was on the stand and plaintiff\u2019s counsel was further examining him, the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">\u201cQ. After getting that contract, what did you do? A. I immediately proceeded to find a purchaser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\">\u201cMr. Schlesinger: Q. Did you and members of the firm submit it to several prospective purchasers about town?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-12\">, \u201cMr. Countryman: We object to that as leading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">\u201cMr. Schlesinger: While this contract was in force did you have any talk with Mr. Roy, any further talk? A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">\u201cMr. Schlesinger: May be the position we assume and my statements are not quite clear. Sullivan, Feder &amp; Kahn made for the sale of this property a five days\u2019 contract. Roy went to them and said, \u2018I want to withdraw the property from you people; I will withdraw, the property and pay you your commission. \u2019 That is our ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>The Court: Nothing to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">\u201cMr. Schlesinger: Now, I hope\u2014I don\u2019t think that is proper to the plaintiff at all. Your honor is in the wrong on this proposition. We have a written contract in evidence, but you let it go. We sue for services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">\u201cThe Court: Why don\u2019t you bring a different action then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">\u201cMr. Schlesinger: We cannot sue upon the contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-11\">\u201cThe Court: There is no use in talking to me upon a proposition of law like that. Gentlemen of the jury, I instruct you to bring in a verdict for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-12\">\u201cMr. Schlesinger: I protest against the judgment going for the defendant. Will your honor allow us to submit offer of proofs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-13\">\u201cMr. Countryman: We object to these offers of proofs, and ask for judgment for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-14\">\u201cMr. Schlesinger: We have not closed our case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-15\">\u201cThe Court: You don\u2019t have to. This gentleman has proved himself out of court. Take your exceptions if you wish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-16\">\u201cMr. Schlesinger: We certainly do take an exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-17\">\u201cThe Court: Gentlemen of the jury, select a foreman. (Mr. P. H. Flood chosen as foreman.) Now, gentlemen of the jury, I will instruct you to bring in a verdict for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">The jury accordingly returned a verdict for the defendant upon which judgment was entered. This appeal is from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">The ruling of the court was to the effect that, although the plaintiff\u2019s assignors had a contract in writing authorizing them to sell the defendant\u2019s land, and agreeing to pay them a commission therefor, the plaintiff would not be allowed to prove that his assignors performed services for defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>under the contract before it was withdrawn, nor to prove the reasonable value of such services, nor the agreement of the defendant to pay for the services. In this we are of opinion that the court was in error. The foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim was the written contract. Under that contract his assignors would have been entitled to recover commissions if they had found a purchaser ready, willing and able to pay the price named in the contract. If in good faith they performed services, or expended money in endeavoring to obtain a purchaser, while the contract was in force, and the defendant under such circumstances went to them before the time named in the contract had expired, and promised to pay for those services and being permitted to withdraw the contract, and upon such promise the contract was withdrawn, we can see no reason either in law or in morals that would preclude a recovery. The performance of the contract having been prevented by the defendant, the action was brought in the form of <em>indebitatus assumpsit, </em>and not directly upon the contract. This might be done, as the contract was the basis upon which the cause of action arose, and was admissible in evidence. <em>(Reynolds </em>v. <em>Jourdan, </em>6 Cal. 108.) In fact the contract was admitted in evidence without objection. No objection was made to the form of the action. The ruling then went to the very essence of the case. In effect, it held that, conceding the facts to be true which the plaintiff was attempting to prove, yet he could not recover. It is said in Mechem on the Law of Agency (section 620): \u201cThus, if, after a broker employed to sell property had in good faith expended money and labor in advertising for and finding a purchaser, and was in the midst of negotiations which were evidently and plainly approaching to success, the seller should revoke the authority with the purpose of availing himself of the broker\u2019s efforts, and avoiding the payment of his commissions, it could not be claimed that the agent had no remedy. In these cases it might well be said that there was an implied contract on the part of the principal to allow the agent a reasonable time for performance; that full performance was wrongfully prevented by the principal\u2019s own acts, and that the agent had earned his commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In the case of <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Albright, </em>49 Ind. 279, where the owner of the real estate sold it pending negotiations in making a sale, and prior to the expiration of the time given by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>owner to the agent, and where the agent within the time given did find a purchaser, the court said: \u201cThe appellant performed all that he was required by the contract to do, and was prevented by the appellee from selling the land. The appellee disabled himself from carrying out the contract of sale made by the appellant. The fact that the appellee had authorized the appellant to sell his land did not deprive himself of the power of selling it, but he could not thereby avoid his liability to appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In <em>Kimmell </em>v. <em>Skelly, </em>130 Cal. 561, [62 Pac. 1067], it is said: \u201cThe brokers here did not agree to find a purchaser, but being employed to find one they were agents of defendant to that end, and were legally bound to use their time and labor for the benefit of their principal; and it is the use of this tim\u00e9 and labor that forms the consideration to support her promise to pay them the compensation mentioned in the agreement.\u201d (See, further, <em>Toomy </em>v. <em>Dunphy, </em>86 Cal. 639, [25 Pac. 130]; <em>Maze </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>96 Cal. 61, [30 Pac. 962] ; <em>Blumenthal </em>v. <em>Goodall, </em>89 Cal. 251, [26 Pac. 906].)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The plaintiff was entitled to prove, if he could do so, the facts claimed by him to exist. Of course if the court had heard the evidence, and the jury had concluded that the assignors of plaintiff performed no services or earned no commissions, and that the defendant made no promise to pay as claimed by plaintiff, these would have been matters for the jury to pass upon. It was error for the court to take the ease from the jury and to preclude plaintiff from introducing his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Kerrigan, J., and Hall, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on August 27, 1908.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
