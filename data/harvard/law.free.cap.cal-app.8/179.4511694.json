The only interest in said records which plaintiff alleges she has, and the only damage averred in her petition that she will suffer by their temporary removal, are set forth as follows: \u201cThat plaintiff and all other citizens and taxpayers of the State of California will be deprived of the use of said records and of the right to inspect the same\u201d; and also that \u201cplaintiff desires to examine and inspect said records in order to show the deraignment of title to said lands, and that there is no other method or means known whereby the plaintiff can secure the facts and information contained in said records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">It may well be doubted whether, under any circumstances, this court should interpose to arrest, in the way here proposed, the orderly procedure in a United States court, acting within its powers conferred by the constitution of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>States and the laws of Congress. But however this may be, we are fully satisfied that we should not do so upon the showing here made.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The writ is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
