J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYT\">Defendant was convicted of the crime of robbery. He appeals from the judgment of conviction and from the order denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The sufficiency of the evidence to warrant the verdict of the jury is not questioned. A reversal is asked on the ground that the court erred in giving a certain instruction, proposed by the people, and in refusing to give instructions asked by defendant, marked 3, 7 and 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The instruction given at the request of plaintiff was upon the doctrine of reasonable doubt. That part of the instruction complained of reads as follows: \u201cBy this term \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 is not meant every possible or fanciful doubt or conjecture that may suggest itself or be suggested to your minds. It is not a mere guess or surmise, because everything relating to human affairs and dependent upon moral evidence is open to some fanciful doubt or conjecture. <em>A reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon reason, and growing out of the testimony and evidence in the case. </em>A reasonable doubt is that state of the case, which, after an entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves your minds in that condition that you cannot say you feel an abiding conviction, to a certainty that the accused committed the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The objection is thus stated in the brief: \u201cIt requires the jurors to give a reason for their doubt, based upon the evidence introduced.\u201d It is further urged that the instruction is \u201cambiguous and abstruse\u201d; that while the last part of the instruction conforms to that given in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster </em>by Justice Shaw (5 Cush. 320, [52 Am. Dec. 711]), it gives but a part of that instruction, and the court erred in refusing defendant\u2019s instruction marked 3, which was the instruction given in the Webster case, and in holding that it was elsewhere given. So far as this latter instruction attempted to state the doctrine of reasonable doubt, it is substantially the same as the one given, except the sentence italicized, as shown above.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Some point is made that upon the authority of <em>People </em>v. <em>Paulsell, </em>115 Cal. 6, [46 Pac. 734], it was the duty of the court to give instruction 3, even though the court had given a similar instruction elsewhere. We do not understand this to be the rule. The trial court is not required to repeat instructions once given. Besides, there were some other rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>for the guidance of the jury stated in the proposed instruction which were elsewhere given correctly. The only objection, therefore, is to that part indicated by italics. In it we discover no error. If a reasonable doubt growing out of the evidence in the case is not to be based upon reason, we are at a loss to discover a foundation for it, unless it be based upon mere conjecture and irrational speculation, and this is not permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Instruction marked 7 stated the rule as to the presumption of innocence, and that \u201cit is the duty of the jury, if possible, to reconcile the evidence with this presumption.\u201d It is claimed that the part of the instruction above quoted was not elsewhere given. An instruction at folio 53 was as follows: \u201cAll presumptions of law are in favor of innocence, and every person accused of crime is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established to a moral certainty and beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a substantial right given by the law to every person accused of crime, and this defendant is entitled to this presumption of innocence until your minds are convinced of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The court, at defendant\u2019s request, instructed the jury that if \u201cthey believe that the evidence upon any essential point in the case admits of any reasonable doubt, the prisoner is entitled to the benefit of it.\u201d The court did not use the language requested by defendant, but an intelligent application of the instructions given, which we must presume was given by the jury, must necessarily have led the jury to consider the evidence with this presumption present in their minds. Where followed by \u201cwith\u201d or \u201cto,\u201d the word \u201c.reconcile\u201d means\u2014 to make consistent, to bring to agreement. (Webster\u2019s Dictionary.) The jury could not have reached a verdict of guilty, having the instructions as given in mind, without having found that the evidence could not be reconciled\u2014i. e., made consistent with the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Instruction 13 was refused because elsewhere given. It was framed to caution the jury against allowing their judgment to be influenced by bias or prejudice, or their judgment \u201cto be swayed by any popular feeling that may exist on the outside; the multitude are not the judges in this case.\u201d The court fully instructed the jury on this point, but did not caution the jury against being swayed by \u201cpopular feeling,\u201d nor did it inform the jury that \u201cthe multitude are not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>judges of this ease.\u201d There is nothing in the ease to suggest that \u201cpopular feeling\u201d had in any manner been aroused or had manifested itself in any way, or that there was anything in the ease calculated to arouse popular feeling \u201con the outside\u201d or elsewhere, and certainly it was not necessary to instruct the jury that \u201cthe multitude are not the judges in this case,\u201d nor was it prejudicial to refuse to so instruct the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Burnett, J., and Hart, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
