Such power cannot be delegated to the electors (1 Abbott on Municipal Law, see. 110, p. 195; <em>City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Carpenter et al., </em>13 Cal. 544; <em>Ex parte Wall, </em>48 Cal. 279, [17 Am. Rep. 425]); nor does the ordinance in question attempt to do so, it being admitted by both petitioner and respondent that its object is merely in this way to ascertain whether it is the desire of the electors of the municipality that the common council shall by proper ordinance prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquor. The question for decision then is, Has the common council the power to adopt this method for ascertaining the electors\u2019 wishes <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u201cThe powers of a municipal corporation are such as are granted in express words, or are necessarily or fairly implied in or incident to the powers expressly granted, or indispensable to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation.\u201d (20 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 1139; <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>148 Cal. 585, [84 Pac. 41].) Section 1 of chapter II, article III, of the charter of San Jose enumerates the subjects of \u25a0 legislation; and when this provision is examined with the rule just noticed in mind, it is found to vest no power in the common council to pass the ordinance in question. The ordinance is therefore void, and affords no authority whatever for the threatened action of the city clerk complained of in this proceeding, and as no other authority is relied upon, it follows that the ballot and the voting machines should be prepared according to the provision of the charter governing city elections, and that the matter to which objection is made should be omitted therefrom. A writ of mandate will issue to compel an officer to omit from a ballot anything placed thereon not authorized by law. <em>(Partridge </em>v. <em>Devoto, </em>148 Cal. 167, [82 Pac. 775].)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">It follows that the writ should issue as prayed for, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Cooper, P.
