That the court had no jurisdiction of the offense charged; 2. That the information does not substantially conform to the requirements of sections 950, 951 and 952 of the Penal Code; 3. That more than one offense is charged; 4. That the facts stated do not constitute a public offense. The demurrer to the information was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>After conviction, and before sentence was pronounced, the defendant moved in arrest of judgment upon all the grounds set forth in the demurrer, and two additional grounds, namely: 1. That the information contains matters which, if true, would constitute a legal justification or excuse of the offense, and a legal bar to the prosecution; and 2. That it does not appear from the information that the offense was committed in Sacramento county.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The motion in arrest of judgment was by the court denied, and sentence pronounced, hence this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The evidence is not brought up, and the only question presented to the court for its consideration is the sufficiency of the information. Section 507 of the Penal Code, under which the foregoing information was framed, provides that \u201cevery person intrusted with any property as bailee, tenant, or lodger, or with any power of attorney for the sale or transfer thereof, who fraudulently converts the same, or the proceeds thereof to his own use, or secretes it, or them, with a fraudulent intent to convert to his own use, is guilty of embezzlement.\u201d It is contended that the information is insufficient, in that it fails to allege that the defendant was acting as agent, or in any other confidential capacity toward Ward, when he received the money which he is charged with having embezzled, or that the money was the property of Ward, and that he is not charged with having embezzled the certificate of deposit. It is alleged that Ward was the owner of the certificate of deposit payable to himself; that he intrusted the same to the defendant as bailee; that it was of the value of $250, lawful money of the United States; that he had cashed it, received and took into his care and control as the proceeds thereof the said sum of $250 in lawful money of the United States, for and on account of said Ward, and that he fraudulently converted the said sum of $250 so received by him to his own use without the consent of said Ward. It having been alleged in the language of the statute that the defendant received the certificate of deposit as bailee, it was not necessary for the pleader to allege the nature of the bailment, nor the particulars or circumstances thereof. As was said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>133 Cal. 328, [85 Am. St. Rep. 174, 65 Pac. 746], and affirmed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>142 Cal. 216, [75 Pac. 796] : \u201cThe essential elements of embezzlement are the fiduciary relations arising where one intrusts property fo another, and the fraudulent appropriation of the property by the latter. The origin or particulars of the relation need not be stated.\u201d Stating that the property was intrusted to defendant as bailee sufficiently showed the creation of a fiduciary relation, and it was not necessary to allege the circumstances of the felonious conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The fact that the defendant is charged with having embezzled the money instead of the certificate will not, in our opinion, avail him. The money was the proceeds of the certificate, and came into his care by reason of his cashing it, and since it is provided by said section 507 of the Penal Code that \u201cevery person who embezzles property intrusted to him or the proceeds thereof, is guilty of embezzlement,\u201d he is, in either event, liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The statement that Ward was the owner of the certificate at the time he intrusted it to the defendant, that defendant cashed it and received the proceeds thereof, coupled with the allegation that he did so for and on account of Ward, is a sufficient allegation of Ward\u2019s ownership of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">It is further contended that the place of the embezzlement is not alleged with sufficient certainty, because the county of Sacramento in the state of California, and Butte City in the state of Montana, are both mentioned in the information previous to the words \u201cthen and there\u201d and \u201caforesaid\u201d; that the reference through the word \u201csaid\u201d and \u201caforesaid\u201d does not identify with any more certainty the county of Sacramento, state of California, than it does Butte City in the state of Montana. While the information is not as explicit in this regard as it should be, nevertheless we think it sufficient to support the judgment of conviction. The words \u201cButte City\u201d as used in the information do not refer to that city as a locality or place where any transaction with the defendant occurred, but constitutes a portion of the name of the bank issuing the certificate, and the state of Montana, following the name of the bank, is descriptive only of the bank\u2019s location, and, in our opinion, has no reference to the venue necessary to be charged in the information. The word \u201ccounty\u201d is not mentioned in connection therewith, and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>found only referring to Sacramento wherein it is positively alleged defendant was ..intrusted with the certificate, the proceeds of which he embezzled. The inforlnation was dealing with the alleged act of the defendant, and inasmuch as no more than one time or place had been mentioned in the information previous to the use of these words which related to the act of the defendant, the information is not open to the objection which might prevail if more than one time or place was mentioned prior to the use of said words when so referring to his acts. The subsequent use of the word \u201ccity\u201d cannot be held to refer to Butte City as a place descriptive of the venue of the alleged crime, and can be totally disregarded since, as above stated, Butte City was used only as a part of the name of the bank therein mentioned, and not as a place at which occurred any act charged against the defendant. Therefore, the words \u201cthen and there\u201d and \u201cin the city, county and state aforesaid\u201d must be construed as having reference only to Sacramento county, California. And the use of the word \u201ccity\u201d as mentioned in said latter phrase must be treated as surplusage which can in no way vitiate the said information.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">It is also urged that the information fails to state that the Silver Bow National Bank of Butte City is a corporation, or whether the certificate was issued by the bank, or whether it covered money which said Ward had on deposit in said bank. We think these objections are equally untenable. It is not charged that the bank was a party to the transaction with this defendant, or that it was in any wise an injured party, or had any relation to the certificate except by way of description thereof. It would be true, that if it were charged that the bank was the party defrauded, it would be necessary to allege its corporate capacity and prove the same at the trial. And it was equally unnecessary to allege whether the certificate was issued by the bank or covered money belonging to said Ward there on deposit. These allegations would be directed to the question of value, and inasmuch as the certificate is alleged to be of the value of $250, so likewise the money embezzled, the information is, therefore, sufficient in that regard, and whether the certificate was of the alleged value was a matter of proof at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>No other points are urged in behalf of appellant except that it is stated generally in the brief on file that he relies upon all other errors appearing in the record. No other claimed errors have been pointed out. We have examined the record and find the instructions full and fair. The information conforms to the requirements of section 950 of the Penal Code, and contains a statement of the acts constituting the offense in such a manner as to enable a person of common understanding to know what was intended, and is therefore sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Chipman, P. J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on October 13, 1908.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
