The testator intended the gift over to take effect only in case of an indefinite failure of heirs in tail. The devise over was in fee, not in tail. 4 Kent, 276 &amp; following &amp; notes; 1 Jarman on Wills, 222, 223, 488, 490; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Tankerville, </em>19 Ves. 170; <em>Machell </em>v. <em>Weeding, </em>8 Simons, 4; <em>Ide </em>v. <em>Ide, </em>5 Mass. 500; <em>Hawley </em>v. <em>Northampton, </em>8 Mass. 3. From these cases the following rules may be deduced. 1. An estate tail is never raised by implication, except it be to bridge over or prevent a possible chasm between the first devisee and the devise over. Here there could be no chasm, for Michael Malcolm, 2d, took an estate for life. <em>Seaward </em>v. <em>Willock, </em>5 East, 198; <em>Somerville </em>v. <em>Lethbridge, </em>6 T. R. 213. 2. Nor can an estate tail be implied, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the worls following the devise to the first taker be words of limitation, and not of purchase, and be so used in the wil itself. 3. A limitation cannot be grafted upon a limitation ; in other words, where there is a subsequent limitation, the words which are at first supposed words of limitation, are really words of purchase. <em>Jesson </em>v. <em>Wright, 2 </em>Bligh, 1; <em>2 </em>Jarman, 388, 427. Lastly, the words \u201c failure of issue \u201d mean at the parent\u2019s death, where the parent\u2019s dying refers to a particular age, or where it is combined with any event personal to the individual. <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Monckton, </em>3 Bing. 13 ; 2 Jarman, 428, 429. Here it was until twenty-one, in the will, and in the codicil until twenty-two; then to leave a male heir; if not, then devise over to his brother: two contingencies must come to pass; he must leave a male heir, and must die after twenty-two years of age.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-5\"><em>W.

And the decision of the case depends on the construction of the will. The clause in the will by which the premises were devised is as follows : \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">\u201cI give and bequeath to my said grandson Daniel my dwelling-house in Middle street, wherein I now live, he to take possession of the same at the age of twenty-one years; to hold the same to him during his life; and at and upon his decease, I give the same dwelling-house and land to the eldest male heir of his body lawfully begotten, and upon the decease of such male heir, to the male heir of said deceased and his heirs forever. And in case my said grandson shall not leave any male heirs, I then give said house and land to his next eldest brother during his life, and upon his decease, to his eldest male heir, lawfully begotten, and to his heirs forever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">It has been argued for the demandant, that by this clause the said Daniel and his eldest son Michael took estates for life in succession; and that the remainder over to the male heir of the latter was void, as tending to a perpetuity. And if such is to be the construction of the will, the argument is undoubtedly well founded, unless the last remainder can be supported by the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, or by the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine, as laid down in the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The rule is, that any limitation <em>in futuro, </em>or by way of remainder, of lands of inheritance, which in its nature tends to a perpetuity, even although there be a preceding vested freehold, so as to take it out of the description of an executory devise, is considered as void in its creation; as in the case of a limitation of lands in succession, first to a person in <em>esse, </em>and after his decease to his unborn children, and afterwards to the children of such unborn children; this last remainder is absolutely void. 1 Fearne, 502. This is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>important rule of real property, and is applicable to the present case, if Daniel and Michael took only estates for life, for all the children of Daniel were bom after the death of the testator; and, although a limitation to an unborn child is good, the limitation to his children tends manifestly to a perpetuity ; it being a limitation of a possibility upon a possibility, which by another rule of law is not to be allowed <em>Chapman </em>v. Oliver, 3 Burr. 1626, 1634.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">But if either Daniel or Michael took an estate in fee tail, these rules of law are not applicable, as the tenant in tail may bar the estate and alienate the property. The question then is, whether the will can, according to the established rules of interpretation, be so construed as to give an estate in fee tail either to Daniel or Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In the first place, it has been argued, for the tenants, that Daniel took an estate tail, although the devise is in express terms to him for life ; such appearing to have been his intention frcm the subsequent language of the will; second, and if not, ;hat his son Michael took an estate tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">It is a familiar rule, in the construction of wills, that the intention of the testator is to govern, although it may be opposed to some of the words of the will; and that the general intention is to control any particular intention, especially when the particular intention relates to the manner by which the general intention is to be effectuated. If the intention of the testator can be carried into effect by the rules of law, the will is to be so construed as to accomplish his intention. And this rule of construction is decisive, if the intention can be clearly ascertained. It is true, as judge Story remarks, in the case of <em>Sisson </em>v. <em>Seabury, </em>1 Sumner, 239, \u201cthat nat only rules of interpretation, but expositions of certain phrases, founded in certain connections, in wills, are entitled to great influenc3 in deciding other cases similarly circumstanced.\u201d But such expositions and decisions are to yield, if opposed to the manifest intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The first question then is, whether the testator\u2019s intention was to give to Daniel an estate tail, notwithstanding the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>part of the clause by which an estate for life only is given. In <em>Wild\u2019s </em>case 6 Co. 17, b, lord Coke lays it down as good law, and as so resolved by all the judges in England, that if A devises his land to B, and to his children or issue, and he hath not any issue at the time of the devise, that the same is an estate tail. And this rule of law has been frequently confirmed in subsequent cases. <em>Nightingale </em>v. Burrell, 15 Pick. 104, 114; Willes, 353. But it has been argued, for the demandant, that by the devise to the first devisee for life, and at and upon his decease to his eldest male heir, the testator plainly intended that the latter should take a remainder, and that \u201c male heir \u201d were not intended as words of limitation, but merely as a <em>designatio persones. </em>On this point there are conflicting decisions. <em>Wild\u2019s </em>case, above cited; Willes, 348 ; Moor, 397 ; Doug. 431. But we have not found it necessary to decide the case upon this point; for admitting that if the will had stopped here, Daniel, the first devisee, would have taken an estate for life only; yet taking into consideration the subsequent words of the will, it is manifest, that the testator intended that all the male issue of Daniel should take in succession ; and this intention cannot be effectuated unless he took an estate tail. The material words are, \u201cAnd in case my said grandson shall not leave any male heirs, I then give said house and land to his next eldest brother during his life, and upon his decease to his eldest male heir lawfully begotten, and to his heirs forever.\u201d This clause clearly shows the intention of the testator to have been, that the eldest brother of Daniel should not take until after the failure of all the male issue of Daniel. The effect of this clause is, to enlarge the estate given in terms to him for life to an estate tail, in order to carry into effect the intention of the testator: <em>Ut \u00edes magis valeat quam per eat.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The intention of the testator, being manifest, is to be followed, if it may be without clashing with.any rule of law; and it certainly may be, if the will is to be construed so as to give an estate tail to Daniel, the first devisee, with a contingent remainder over, after an indefinite failure of his male <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>issue, to his eldest brother. And we are of opinion, that upon the rules of construction, well established by the authorities, which are numerous, the clause may be so construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In the case of <em>Dodson </em>v. <em>Grew, 2 </em>Wils. 322, the devise was to George Grew for life, and after his decease to the use of his issue male, and the issue of such issue male, and for want of such issue male, then over. And it was held, that by the words of the gift over, the estate given to George Grew in terms for life was enlarged to an estate tail. Chief justice Wilmot remarked, in delivering the opinion of the court, that the intention of the testator clearly was to give George Grew an estate for life only; but his intention also clearly was, that all the sons of George Grew should take in succession: both these intentions cannot take place ; therefore the court must put themselves in the place of the testator, and determine as he would have done. If he had been told that both of his intentions in the will, by the rules of law, could not take place, and had been asked which of them he desired should take effect and stand, as both could not, he certainly would have answered, that so long as George Grew had any issue male, the premises should not go to the lessor of the plaintiff; and if we balance the two intentions, the weightiest is, that all the sons of George Grew should take in succession.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In <em>Brice </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>Willes, 1, the chief justice lays down the rule of construction, in cases like the present, as then well established. He says, it cannot be doubted now, after so many solemn resolutions, but if a man devise an estate'to A and his heirs, and afterwards in his will give his estate to another, in case A dies without issue, the subsequent words reduce A\u2019s estate to an estate tail, and restrain the general word <em>\u201c </em>heirs \u201d to signify only \u201c heirs of the body.\u201d \u201c So, likewise, if a man devise an estate to A, or to A for life, without saying more, and afterwards in the same will devise the estate to another in case A dies without issue, these subsequent words will enlarge A\u2019s estate by implication, and give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>him an estate tail. And this is founded upon these known rules, that the intention of the testator shall always take place in the construction of wills, so far as it can be collected from the will itself, and if it be not contrary to the rules of law ; and that the priority or posteriority of words in a will is not at all regarded, but that the whole will must be taken together to find out the intent of the testator.\u201d This rule of construction, and the reasons on which it is founded, have never since been questioned, but have frequently been con firmed by subsequent decisions. In <em>Ellis </em>v. Ellis, 1 East, 382, the devise was to the testator\u2019s son Joseph, his heirs and assigns forever ; but in case he should die without issue, then over. It was argued for the tenant, that Joseph took a fee simple, determinable on a particular event, not on an unlimited failure of issue, but on his dying without issue at the time of his death; which event did not happen, and therefore the devise over never took effect. But it was decided that the words, \u201c in case my said son Joseph shall die without issue,\u201d must be construed to mean a general failure of issue. Lord Ellenborough said, \u201c The general rale is clear.\u201d And he refers to the case in Willes, \u201c as deciding that the word <em>then, </em>which was merely a word of relation, and not an adverb of time, made no difference.\u201d That, he says, \u201c is extremely decisive against the only word upon which originally any argument could have been built.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">This rule of construction, therefore, is well settled, and the only question on this point is, whether it is applicable to the construction of this will. The words in the will are, \u201c in case my said grandson shall not leave any male heirs,\u201d then over. In <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>3 T. R. 143, the devise was to A, his heirs and assigns forever, and if he shall happen to die leaving no issue behind him, then over. All that was decided in that case was, that the limitation over was good by way of an executory devise. The remarks of lord Kenyon, therefore, are not material in this case : as the construction given to the will in that case was in no respect inconsistent with the intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>In <em>Daintry </em>v. <em>Daintry, </em>6 T. R. 307, 313, the words were, <em>\u201c </em>If my said son J. Daintry shall happen to die without <em>leaving </em>issue of his body,\u201d then over; and lord Kenyon held, and the court so decided, that the words were sufficient to raise an estate tail by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In <em>Tenny </em>v. <em>Agar, </em>12 East, 253, the devise was to the testator\u2019s son and his right heirs forever, and then, on a contingency, to his daughter and her heirs forever; \u201cand in case his said son and daughter both happen to die without leaving any child or issue lawfully begotten, or to be begotten,\u201d then over, to R. Agar. It was argued for the plaintiff, that the devises to the son and daughter were not restrained to estates tail, but that the devise over was good by way of executory devise. But the court, without hearing the counsel for the defendant, held that the devise over was not an executory devise, but a remainder limited after successive estates tail of the son and daughter by implication ; this being the only construction which could give effect to the intention of the testator, consistently with the whole will taken together. Lord Ellenborough remarked, <em>\u201c We </em>have heard a laborious \"and ingenious argument, which has endeavored to cloud an intention as distinctly and plainly expressed as a testator could have done, and which, if not expressed in terms, is plainly to be inferred from the whole will. Nothing can be clearer than that R. Agar was not intended to take any thing until the issue of the testator\u2019s son and of his daughter were all <em>extinct; </em>and that intent can only be effected by giving to the son and daughter successive estates tail.\u201d And Le Blanc, J., says : \u201c It is a known rule of law, in the construction of wills, that if a devise over can take effect as a remainder, it shall not be taken to be an executory devise. There is no case where the words \u201c die without leaving issue,\u201d simply, have been adjudged to mean \u201c without leaving issue at the time of the death; \u201d in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>there were also the words \u201c behind him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In the case of <em>Nightingale </em>v. <em>Burrell, </em>15 Pick. 104, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>words were, \u201c But if my aforesaid daughters should die and leave no children,\u201d then over. And it was held, that the contingency of dying and <em>leaving </em>no issue was precisely equivalent to dying <em>without </em>issue, and looked to the general failure of issue before the devise over was to take effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">So in <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Shrieve, </em>3 Mason, 391, the devise was to the testator\u2019s son and <em>to his male </em>heir, (in the singular,) and his heirs and assigns forever; but if it should so be, that the said son should depart this life <em>leaving </em>no male heir, then to one of the testator\u2019s grandsons in fee. This in all respects is similar to the will in the present case. And it was held, that the son took an estate tail with remainder over to the grandson in fee. Judge Story said, if the case were entirely new, he should not hesitate to give that construction as the only one which would effectuate the general intention of the testator, but that he considered the question hardly open ; and so it appears to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">There are numerous other cases, which have been decided upon the rules of construction of devises, many of which are cited in the case of <em>Osborn </em>v. Shrieve, and in <em>Sisson </em>v. <em>Sea</em>bury, 1 Sumner, 235, and in 2 Crabb on Real Property, 27-41. But in all the cases, there has been no dispute as to the rules of construction. The great difficulty has been in the application of these rules to the various cases, and to ascertain the intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Now, we think there can be no doubt of the intention of the testator, in the present case. He clearly intended, that Daniel and his male heirs, meaning issue, should have the property so long as any issue remained, and that the eldest brother of Daniel should take nothing until the extinction of the whole line of the male issue of Daniel; and this intention cannot be carried into effect unless Daniel took an estate tail, with remainder over to his eldest brother. And we have no doubt, that upon the undisputed rules of construction, the will is to be so construed as to give an estate tail to Daniel; and that upon his decease, the same descended to Michael, his eldest son, and by the Rev. Sts. c. 60, \u00a7 29, was liable to be taken on execution for his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>This being the opinion of the court, it becomes unnecessary to consider the tenant\u2019s second ground of defence, or the able argument of the demandant\u2019s counsel, as to the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, and the doctrine of <em>cy pres, </em>as laid down in the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"AEm\">\n<em>Judgment for the tenants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
