The record makes it clear that the parties and the trial court intended that the order be considered as a final judgment and no procedural question is raised here. In view of Section 4 of the Civil Practice Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1969, ch. 110, par. 4) we are so treating it.</p> <p id=\"b145-6\" pgmap=\"145\"> The cases cited by plaintiff are inapposite. None of them involved an express provision relieving the lessor from liability from damage by water. Where a lease contains an express provision no contrary covenant may be implied. In Rubens v. Hill, 213 Ill. 523, 539, the Illinois Supreme Court said: \u201cExpress covenants abrogate the operation of implied covenants in accordance with the rule of interpretation, that the expression of one thing in a contract is the exclusion of another. * * * Where the minds of the parties have met and made an express agreement, the law does not enlarge and qualify this express agreement by implication.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b145-7\" pgmap=\"145\">Therefore, the judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b145-8\" pgmap=\"145\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b145-9\" pgmap=\"145\">GUILD, P. J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b145-10\" pgmap=\"145\">Mr. JUSTICE THOMAS J. MORAN</author> <p id=\"Ak\" pgmap=\"145\">specially concurring:</p> <p id=\"b145-11\" pgmap=\"145\">Contrary to the opinion of the majority, I believe that plaintiffs only issue before us is one of procedure.</p> <p id=\"b145-12\" pgmap=\"145\">In light of the Rial court\u2019s finding that the second amended complaint stated a cause of action, plaintiff argues that it was error to allow defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, contending that the dismissal summarily disposed of its case on the merits, a disposition which could not properly be reached by a motion to dismiss.</p> <p id=\"b145-13\" pgmap=\"145\">Plaintiff\u2019s position would have merit if the court relied only upon Section 45 of the Civil Practice Act. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1969, ch. 110, sec. 45.) The cause of action herein, however, is founded upon a lease attached as an exhibit of the pleadings. Paragraph nine of the lease expressly defeats the allegation set forth in the second amended complaint and subjects the cause of action to dismissal under Section 48 (1) (i) of the Civil Practice Act. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1969, ch. 110, sec. 48(1) (i).</p> <p id=\"b145-14\" pgmap=\"145\">It is on this basis that I join in the affirmance of the judgment appealed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
