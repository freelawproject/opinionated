Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 415, 417 (5th Cir.2003). \u201c[T]his Court must affirm the decision if there is no error of law and if reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record, considered as a whole, supports the decision\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under this standard, \u201cthe alien must show that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). This court \u201ccannot substitute [its] judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to the credibility of the witnesses or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78. \u201c[G]reat deference\u201d is given to \u201can immigration judge\u2019s decisions concerning an alien\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 904 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-18\">The Attorney General, in his discretion, is authorized to grant asylum to aliens who qualify as refugees. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). An alien is a refugee when he is outside his country and \u201cis unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The alien must prove some nexus between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>persecution and one of the five enumerated grounds. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Ali contends that he is eligible for asylum because he is a victim of past persecution and has a well-founded fear of persecution in Pakistan because of his membership in a particular social group. The IJ declined to exercise his discretion to grant asylum because he found that Ali\u2019s testimony was not credible and because the testimony was not corroborated by other evidence. The IJ\u2019s credibility determination was based on discrepancies between Ali\u2019s written application and credible-fear interview and his testimony at the asylum hearing. The IJ gave cogent reasons for finding that Ali was not credible, and his determination that Ali was not credible is amply supported by the record. <em>See Moin, </em>335 F.3d at 417. As the IJ\u2019s credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, we do not address the IJ\u2019s alternative holding that Ali\u2019s testimony, if believed, did not demonstrate eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">To be eligible for withholding of deportation, an alien must demonstrate a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution on return, a standard more stringent than that needed to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 306 (5th Cir.1997). As Ali did not present credible evidence sufficient to establish his eligibility for asylum, no reversible error is presented with respect to the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">A claim under the CAT is a separate claim from withholding of deportation and should receive separate analytical attention. <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 906-07. The CAT requires an alien to show \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). The torture need not be inflicted because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 907. \u201cTorture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person ... by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). \u201cTorture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(2). The petitioner has the burden of proving \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Ali testified that he had been arrested and detained several times by Pakistani authorities and that he had been beaten during those detentions. The IJ found that Ali had not shown that the physical mistreatment during those arrests was so severe that Ali was entitled to withholding of removal under the CAT. As Ali\u2019s testimony was not considered to be credible, there was no credible evidence showing that Ali was likely to be tortured on his return to Pakistan. <em>Id. </em>The record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78. The petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
