The IJ denied Laverde\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. Laverde contends the IJ erred because there was unequivocal evidence that he will be persecuted due to his membership in a particular social group if he is returned to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Laverde\u2019s petition for review was timely only as to, and sought review only of, the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen and for reconsideration. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 395, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review only whether BIA\u2019s denial was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 113 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Laverde has not addressed the reasons advanced in the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen and for reconsideration. Review of this issue is, therefore, waived. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-34\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
