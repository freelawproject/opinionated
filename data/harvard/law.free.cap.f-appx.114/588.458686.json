The Petitioners sought to reopen the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying their application for cancellation of removal. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-21\">The Attorney General may cancel removal of an alien from the United States if the alien: (1) has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than ten years immediately preceding the date of such application; (2) has been a person of good moral character during this period; (3) has not been convicted of certain enumerated offenses; and (4) establishes that removal would result in \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) (2000). The immigration judge denied the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>tion after finding Ssekamwa failed to demonstrate his and his wife\u2019s removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to their daughter who was born in the United States. The Petitioners filed a motion to reopen or reconsider submitting evidence regarding their daughter\u2019s health. The motion was denied. On appeal, the Board found the Petitioners failed to show an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship with respect to their daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae (2000), \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229b,\u201d cancellation of removal. We are without jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s finding that the Petitioners failed to show an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">We have not considered the new evidence the Petitioners submitted to this Court in the joint appendix. Our review is limited to the administrative record. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">We find the Petitioners\u2019 argument that the appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen and reconsider was also timely as to the decision denying asylum, withholding of removal and cancellation of removal is without merit. We are without jurisdiction to review the immigration judge\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding of removal and cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
