At jury selection, Lewis challenged the defendants\u2019 use of peremptory strikes under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). Defense counsel stated that he struck two jurors on \u201cinstinct.\u201d The magistrate judge denied Lewis\u2019s <em>Bat-son </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Following a verdict for the defendants, Lewis sought a new trial based on an asserted <em>Batson </em>violation. Over Lewis\u2019s objection, the magistrate judge conducted an evidentiary hearing to allow defense counsel to put on the record additional reasons for striking two jurors. Defense counsel stated that the jurors had been struck because they were from an area of Louisiana that was notoriously plaintiff-friendly, and because they held lower income, traditionally subservient jobs. The magistrate judge determined that there had been no <em>Batson </em>violation and denied Lewis\u2019s motion. Lewis timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Lewis argues that the magistrate judge erred by accepting \u201cinstinct\u201d as an explanation for the peremptory strikes. He also contends that the magistrate judge erred in permitting defense counsel to put additional reasons on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The \u201cdecisions of this court have made it plain that the process of choosing a jury may be influenced by the \u2018intuitive assumptions\u2019 of the attorneys.\u201d <em>United States v. Bentley-Smith, </em>2 F.3d 1368, 1374 (5th Cir.1993). As no discriminatory intent is inherent in defense counsel\u2019s explanation that he relied on \u201cinstinct,\u201d the explanation must be deemed race-neutral. <em>See Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 767-68, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995). In addition, the magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion in conducting an evidentiary hearing to allow defense counsel to further specify on the record additional reasons for his peremptory challenges. <em>See United States v. Romero-Reyna, </em>889 F.2d 559, 561 n. 6 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited, circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
