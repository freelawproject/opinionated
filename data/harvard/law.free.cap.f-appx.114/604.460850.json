However, authority abounds for the proposition that front-pay calculations are matters inherently within the discretion of the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \"When reviewing awards of front-pay for an abuse of discretion, we have considered such factors as whether the time period used to calculate the award was overly speculative, whether the court discounted the final award to present value, whether the court accounted for interim earnings in making its calculation, and whether the award is reasonable under the facts of the case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We have never held, however, that consideration of any one factor or group of factors is mandatory when calculating front-pay awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In the present case, Webster fails to point to any evidence that the district court neglected to take these or any other factors into consideration. Rather, she relies solely upon her contention that the court was obligated to rigidly employ a sequential analysis. As no such requirement exists, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in making its calculations. Furthermore, her argument regarding the amount of front-pay owed her under the sequential method is unsupported by any legal or factual analysis, and therefore cannot be considered on review.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the front-pay award is AFFIRMED, and Webster\u2019s motion to supplement the record and file an amended brief is DENIED.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">Webster also argues that the court\u2019s award of $11,000 in back pay was erroneous because it failed to encompass her lost earnings during the relevant time period. The record reflects that Webster filed no post-judgment motions. Failure to challenge a back pay award in a post-judgment motion will result in waiver of the issue on appeal unless exceptional circumstances exist.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Exceptional circumstances exist when a pure question of law is asserted, and the error is so obvious that the failure to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Calculation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>of back pay awards is a highly fact-bound inquiry. In addition, the record contains evidence that Webster\u2019s back pay loss was $10,000. Given these considerations, we find that exceptional circumstances are not present in this case. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court regarding back pay is AFFIRMED. Because we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling in full, Webster\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees is DENIED.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED, and all MOTIONS are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
