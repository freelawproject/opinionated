For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-24\">The decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). We have reviewed the immigration judge\u2019s decision and the administrative record. We are without jurisdiction to review the decision that the application for asylum was untimely. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000); <em>see also Castellano-Chacon v. INS, </em>341 F.3d 533, 544 (6th Cir.2003); <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 185-86 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1231, 1235 (10th Cir.2003). We further find no due process violation as a result of the Board\u2019s affirmance under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5) (2004). In addition, Abdullahi failed to establish review was warranted by a three judge panel under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6). Finally, we find the denial of withholding from removal was supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>INS v.

We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b589-19\"> Abdullahi abandoned his challenge to the Board\u2019s denial of his application for withholding under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
