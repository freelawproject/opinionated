Lyons appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his complaint filed pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). The Government has moved to dismiss on the basis that the sole claim advanced by Lyons\u2019 counsel is rendered moot by amendments to the federal regulations controlling smoking in the Bureau of Prisons. We agree that the amended regulations render this claim moot. Accordingly, we grant in part the motion to dismiss, and we dismiss this claim. <em>See Leonard v. Hammond, </em>804 F.2d 838, 842 (4th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-23\">We deny, however, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to Lyons\u2019 remaining pro se claims. Having considered these remaining claims on the merits, we nonetheless find them unpersuasive. Accordingly, we affirm as to the remaining claims on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Lyons v. Beeler, </em>No. CA-02-467-5-F3 (E.D.N.C. Apr. 23, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
