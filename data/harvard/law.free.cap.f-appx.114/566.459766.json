Carter appeals from the district court\u2019s orders dismissing without prejudice his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000) and denying his motion for reconsideration. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Carter\u2019s petition. Because, however, the district court\u2019s dismissal was without prejudice, Carter may refile his petition in the place of his incarceration. We deny Carter\u2019s motion to seal his records. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
