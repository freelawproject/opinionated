He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. We find there has been no undue delay in the district court. Accordingly, we deny the mandamus petition, deny Fredrick\u2019s motion to expand the record, and deny his motion to expedite. Although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
