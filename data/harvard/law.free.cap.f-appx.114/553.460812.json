(J.A. at 100-01.) Because there was no basis for the departure, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">In 1998, at the age of 28, Brett M. Gold had sex with a thirteen-year-old girl whom he had met and pursued during internet chat sessions. Gold was arrested and convicted of carnal knowledge of a minor in violation of Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-63 (Michie 2004). After serving a year in jail, Gold was released on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-15\">While still on probation, Gold began having online communications with an undercover FBI agent, who was posing as a thirteen-year-old girl named Emma. Eventually, Gold, who lived in Virginia, made plans to visit Emma in Maryland so the two could have sex. Gold missed the first scheduled tryst when he encountered heavy traffic on his way from Virginia to Maryland. Gold and Emma continued chatting and e-mailing each other, and eventually the two arranged another meeting. When Gold arrived at the scheduled meeting place, he was arrested. At the time of his arrest, Gold was carrying a backpack containing, among other items, condoms, Vaseline jelly, a pair of earrings, and an envelope bearing the name Emma.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-17\">Gold was indicted for and pleaded guilty to a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2423(b) (1996) (current version at 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2423(b) (West Supp.2004)), which makes it illegal to travel across state lines with the intent to engage in a sexual act with a minor after having been convicted of a sex offense. At sentencing, the district court departed downward two levels from the applicable guideline range because of the \u201celement and ... degree of enticement,\u201d which gave the case a \u201ccoercion aspect.\u201d (J.A. at 100-01.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-19\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s factual determinations made in connection with sentencing for clear error, and review the ultimate decision to depart de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Stockton, </em>349 F.3d 755, 764 (4th Cir.2003) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, Stockton v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 1695, 158 L.Ed.2d 385 (2004); 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West Supp. 2004). \u201cUnder the Sentencing Guidelines, a district court must ordinarily impose sentences within the range specified by the applicable guideline.\u201d <em>United States v. Rybicki, </em>96 F.3d 754, 757 (4th Cir.1996). \u201cEach guideline attempts to anticipate a broad range of typical cases \u2014 a \u2018heartland\u2019- \u2014 that is representative of the circumstances and consequences of ordinary crimes of the type to which the guideline applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOnly if the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>determines that the circumstances and consequences of a case are \u2018atypical\u2019 or \u2018unusual\u2019 and, therefore, that the case does not fall -within the guideline\u2019s heartland may it ... depart from the specified sentencing range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo determine whether a circumstance or consequence is \u2018atypical\u2019 or \u2018unusual,\u2019 and, therefore, capable of taking a case out of the applicable guideline\u2019s heartland, district courts should consider not only the Guidelines themselves, but also the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements and official commentary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018Encouraged\u2019 factors are usually appropriate bases for departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757-58 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">If a defendant commits an offense \u201cbecause of serious coercion, blackmail, or duress,\u201d the Guidelines encourage a court to sentence that defendant below the applicable guideline range. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guideline Manual </em>\u00a7 5K2.12 (2002). Nonetheless, \u201ccoercion will be sufficiently serious to warrant departure only when it involves a threat of physical injury, substantial damage to property or similar injury resulting from the unlawful action of a third party or from a natural emergency.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">In this case, the district court believed that the \u201cdegree of enticement\u201d by the FBI agent posing as a victim removed this case from the guideline\u2019s heartland and allowed the court to depart on the \u201cencouraged\u201d factor of \u201ccoercion\u201d and \u201cduress.\u201d This was error. <em>See United States v. Russell, </em>917 F.2d 512, 516 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201c[Djefendant has introduced no evidence that [his] co-defendant ... engaged in anything more substantial than run-of-the-mill persuasion \u2014 just words and enticing, as opposed to threatening, words at that \u2014 in enlisting [the defendant] in the crime....\u201d). None of the agent\u2019s communications with Gold threatened him with \u201cphysical injury, substantial damage to property or [a] similar injury.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12. Indeed, a review of the communications between the two shows that the agent did nothing more than play the role of a thirteen-year-old girl who was willing to meet and have sex with an older man. <em>(See, e.g., </em>J.A. at 39-40, 69-75.) The agent did not threaten, coerce, or blackmail Gold in any way. This simply is a run-of-the-mill case of an internet predator seeking out a victim who desired to engage in sexual activity with him. There is nothing \u201catypical\u201d or \u201cunusual\u201d about this case warranting a departure. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s downward departure and remand for resentencing within the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
