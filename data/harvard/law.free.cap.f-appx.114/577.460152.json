The district court sentenced Breton-Pichardo to 262 months of imprisonment followed by eight years of supervised release. Breton-Pichardo appeals his conviction and sentence. Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Finding no error, we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-27\">Counsel first questions whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing properly to advise Breton-Pichardo of the application of the sentencing guidelines regarding career offender status. Claims of ineffective assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>generally are not cognizable on direct appeal, but should be asserted on collateral review. Only if ineffective assistance is conclusively established on the face of the record should such claims be entertained on direct appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Because ineffective assistance is not conclusively shown on the face of the record, BretonPichardo must assert his claim on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Next, counsel raises as a potential issue that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to argue that the career offender provision in the presentence report\u2019s offense level computation overstated Breton-Pichardo\u2019s criminal history. However, ineffective assistance is not conclusively shown on the face of the record in this regard either; therefore, Breton-Pichardo\u2019s claim should be asserted on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Breton-Pichardo\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Corut of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b605-16\"> Counsel for Breton-Pichardo has filed a motion seeking permission to provide supplemental argument to challenge the sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We grant the motion and construe the motion as the supplemental brief attacking the sentence under <em>Blakely. </em>In light of the opinion issued by the en banc court in <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004) (No. 03-4253), <em>petition for cert. </em>filed,-U.S.-, -- S.Ct. -, - L.Ed.2d -, 2004 WL 2153053 (2004) (No. 04-193), we find no <em>Blakely </em>error in Breton-Pichardo's sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
