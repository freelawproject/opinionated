Because the BIA summarily affirmed without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency determination for our review. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Escobedo-Esperanza argues that the IJ violated his rights to due process by not granting him a continuance and by accepting counsel\u2019s proffer rather than hearing Escobedo-Esperanza\u2019s testimony. Both of these contentions fail because EscobedoEsperanza has not shown any error, much less any substantial prejudice to his case. <em>Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">Escobedo-Esperanza argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without written opinion. The summary review procedures under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) are essentially the same as those approved by this court in <em>Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 831. In light of this precedent and Escobedo-Esperanza\u2019s failure to show that his case did not meet the criteria for affirmance without opinion or that his case was not properly reviewed, his argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">Escobedo-Esperanza filed petitions for review with respect to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motions to reopen and for reconsideration. As noted by the respondent, Escobedo-Esperanza does not mention these motions in his brief and has abandoned any issues with respect to their denial. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-16\">Escobedo-Esperanza\u2019s three petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s final orders of removal are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">PETITIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b189-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
