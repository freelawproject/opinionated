The 150-month term of imprisonment imposed by the district court represents an upward departure from the 77-96 month range determined under the Sentencing Guidelines. Ordones argues that the district court abused its discretion in upwardly departing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-26\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s compliance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(3)(A) &amp; (B). <em>See United States v. Bell, </em>371 F.3d 239, <em>242-43 </em>(5th Cir.2004). Here, the district court provided a written statement of reasons for its departure as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). Based on that statement, as well as our review of the record, we are satisfied that the district court\u2019s sentence (1) advanced the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), (2) was authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b), and (3) was justified by the facts of the case. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(3)(A) &amp; (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-27\">We agree with the district court that a departure was justified under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, because Ordones\u2019s criminal history score did not adequately reflect his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>criminal background. Ordones\u2019s contention that the district court improperly considered his arrests and pending charges is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">We review the extent of a departure for abuse of discretion. <em>See Bell, </em>371 F.3d at 243. Under that standard, we will affirm if the degree of the departure is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Ashburn, </em>38 F.3d 803, 807 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">An upward departure is warranted when the criminal history category significantly underrepresents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that he will commit further crimes. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. In light of Ordones\u2019s criminal history and likelihood of recidivism, as discussed by the district court, as well as the need to punish Ordones and deter future criminal activity, the district court\u2019s departure to a sentence of 150 months\u2019 imprisonment was not an abuse of discretion, <em>see Ashbum, </em>803 F.2d at 807, and does not represent an unreasonable departure above the applicable guidelines range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">As we have determined that the sentence of 150 months\u2019 imprisonment does not unreasonably depart above the applicable guidelines range, factoring in the district court\u2019s use of an incremental procedure to structure the departure, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, we reject Ordones\u2019s argument that the district court failed to justify the extent of its departure. <em>See United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d 658, 662-63 (5th Cir.1993) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b621-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
