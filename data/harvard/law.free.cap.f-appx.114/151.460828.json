Warner argues that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint because the prison custodian of his trust account failed to perform its obligation to make the payment. He further argues that the district court did not give him an adequate opportunity to comply with the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-21\">Although the district court dismissed Warner\u2019s suit without prejudice, he is effectively barred from refiling by the two-year statute of limitations. <em>See Burrell v. Newsome, </em>883 F.2d 416, 418 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-22\">The record does not show that Warner\u2019s failure was the result of contumacious behavior or an attempt to delay the proceedings. <em>See McNeal v. Papsan, </em>842 F.2d 787, 790-92 (5th Cir.1988). The record also does not show that the court considered lesser sanctions before dismissing Warner\u2019s lawsuit. <em>See Long v. Simmons, </em>77 F.3d 878, 880 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-23\">The judgment of the district court dismissing Warner\u2019s complaint is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings. Warner is cautioned that this opinion does not excuse him from compliance with the orders issued by the district court if the court elects to reinstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>those orders upon remand. Warner is further cautioned that a failure to comply with the district court\u2019s orders in the future may result in dismissal of his lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b179-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
