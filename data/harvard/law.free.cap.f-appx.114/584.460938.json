For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). We have reviewed the Board\u2019s decision and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and the administrative record and find the record supports the conclusion that Sozonov failed to establish eligibility for asylum on a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish his eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Because the decision in this case is not manifestly contrary to law, we cannot grant the relief Sozonov seeks.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-25\"> Sozonov fails to challenge the Board's denial of his applications for withholding from removal and withholding under the Convention Against Torture.
