He first argues that the evidence produced at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict for Count Two because there was no evidence proving that the firearm he used during the robbery was real. West properly preserved this issue for appeal. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational trier of fact could have found that the Government proved all of the essential elements regarding Count Two. <em>See United States v. Lankford, </em>196 F.3d 563, 575-76 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-23\">West also contends that the district court erred by increasing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 based on its finding that he committed perjury at trial. Because the record supports the district court\u2019s finding regarding this issue, the district court did not clearly err by applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 adjustment for obstruction of justice. <em>See United States v. Storm, </em>36 F.3d 1289, 1295 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
