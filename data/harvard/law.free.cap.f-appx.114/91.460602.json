Tewelde petitions this court for review of the denial of her applications of asylum from Eritrea, asylum from Ethiopia, and withholding of removal to Ethiopia. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denied her applications, and Tewelde now seeks review of the adverse rulings. For the reasons that follow, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Tewelde was born in 1969 in the part of Ethiopia that is now known as Eritrea. Tewelde claims that she is a native and citizen of Eritrea and faced persecution there because of her religious beliefs as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. In 1996, Tewelde lived in Ethiopia for approximately five months, obtained a valid Ethiopian passport and exit visa, and traveled to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Tewelde entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor for pleasure and later filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal. The INS referred Tewelde\u2019s case to an Immigration Judge by filing a Notice to Appear charging Tewelde with removability for having overstayed her visa. Tewelde conceded removability and renewed her request for asylum and withholding of removal, arguing that she had a well-founded fear of persecution in Ethiopia and Eritrea based on her religious beliefs. The Immigration Judge denied relief and ordered Tewelde\u2019s removal but granted voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">On appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision, the BIA granted withholding of removal to Eritrea based on Tewelde\u2019s religious beliefs as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness and the current country conditions in Eritrea. Although Tewelde met the higher threshold for withholding of removal to Eritrea, the BIA denied Tewelde\u2019s asylum claim, apparently finding it barred by her firm resettlement in Ethiopia. With regard to Tewelde\u2019s claims of asylum and withholding of removal to Ethiopia, the BIA determined that Tewelde could safely return to Ethiopia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ultimately, the BIA granted Tewelde\u2019s request for withholding of removal to Eritrea but dismissed Tewelde\u2019s challenges to the Immigration Judge\u2019s orders concerning Ethiopia.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Along with her petition for review filed in this Court, Tewelde filed a Motion to Reconsider Dismissal of Appeal with the BIA. Tewelde attached new evidence to the motion to reconsider both denying that she was firmly resettled in Ethiopia and rebutting the 2001 Report on the safe conditions in Ethiopia. The BIA denied the motion under the standards applicable both to motions to reconsider and to motions to reopen. Tewelde did not file a petition for review of that order; therefore, Tewelde\u2019s petition for review before this Court involves only the BIA\u2019s denials of her applications for asylum from Eritrea, asylum from Ethiopia, and withholding of removal to Ethiopia.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Attorney General has authority to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b). To qualify as a refugee pursuant to the INA, an alien must be unwilling or unable to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d standard contains both subjective and objective components. <em>Chen v. U.S. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 201 (4th Cir.1999). To satisfy the subjective component, an applicant must \u201cpresent[ ] candid, credible, and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). The objective component requires \u201cspecific, concrete facts that a reasonable person in like circumstances would fear persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202. The applicant for asylum bears the ultimate burden of proving her status as a refugee. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004). The applicant will be barred from asylum, however, if she has \u201cfirmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate a \u201cclear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). This is a more stringent standard than that for asylum. <em>Chen, </em>195 F.3d at 205. Unlike the grant of asylum where an alien is entitled to remain in the United States, withholding of removal merely bars the deportation of an alien to a particular country. <em>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 419, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999). Further, while asylum is discretionary, if an alien establishes eligibility for withholding of removal, the grant is mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Our review of an administrative decision regarding an order of removal is limited to the \u201cadministrative record on which the order of removal is based.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (2004). Further, we give great deference to the factual findings by the BIA, as those factual findings \u201care conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). For this reason, the substantial evidence test for review of the BIA\u2019s conclusions mandates affirmance if the evidence is not \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could\u201d agree with the BIA\u2019s factual conclusions. <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. BIA, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992). We must apply the substantial evidence test in turn to Tewelde\u2019s claims of asylum from both Eritrea and Ethiopia and withholding of removal to Ethiopia.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">For Tewelde\u2019s claim of asylum from Eritrea, the BIA found that asylum was barred by Tewelde\u2019s \u201cfirm resettlement\u201d in Ethiopia. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi). In support of this conclusion, the BIA recognized that Tewelde obtained a valid Ethiopian passport and exit visa, lived in Ethiopia for five months without incident, and was a citizen or national of Ethiopia. Tewelde now argues that she falls within a narrow exception to the \u201cfirm resettlement\u201d bar, claiming that the Ethiopian passport was fraudulently obtained and was one of mere convenience with which to flee the country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.15 (2004). In reviewing the evidence on record before the BIA at the time of its decision, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusions that Tewelde was firmly resettled in Ethiopia. The conclusion is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, the evidence on the administrative record for review is insufficient to compel a conclusion otherwise. <em>Huaman-Cornelio, </em>979 F.2d at 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">In its decision regarding Tewelde\u2019s claims of asylum and withholding of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>moval to Ethiopia, the BIA found that Tewelde could safely return to Ethiopia. As the basis of this finding, the BIA took administrative notice of the 2001 Country Report prepared by the Department of State.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This document reveals that conditions for Eritreans in Ethiopia significantly improved after Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a cessation of hostilities agreement in 2000. We believe that this report constitutes substantial evidence that the Ethiopian government was no longer deporting Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses who might face religious persecution in Eritrea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In reviewing the administrative record on which the order of removal is based, we find insufficient evidence to compel a finding of the requisite \u201cfear of persecution\u201d under the asylum standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny Tewelde\u2019s petition to review the BIA\u2019s decision to deny asylum with respect to Eritrea and Ethiopia, as well as its decision to withhold removal to Ethiopia.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-9\">. In making its decision, the BIA took administrative notice of The Department of State's 2001 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Ethiopia, which states that the Ethiopian government no longer deports Eritrean Jehovah's Witnesses facing religious persecution in Eritrea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-8\">. As the BIA took administrative notice of a report that had not been released at the time the briefs of the parties were submitted and there was no oral argument, Tewelde claims that she was denied due process because she lacked the opportunity to rebut the report. Indeed, the report was first raised in the BIA\u2019s order. However, Tewelde did have the opportunity to rebut the Report in her motion to reconsider filed after the BIA's decision. A motion to reconsider provides an opportunity to rebut sufficient to satisfy due process. See <em>Gebremichael v. INS, </em>10 F.3d 28, 38 (1st Cir. 1993); <em>Gutierrez-Rogue v. INS, </em>954 F.2d 769, 773 (D.C.Cir.1992); <em>Rivera-Cruz v. INS, </em>948 F.2d 962, 968 (5th Cir. 1991); <em>Kaczmarczyk v. INS, </em>933 F.2d 588, 596-97 (7th Cir.1991); <em>but see Castillo-Villagra v. INS, </em>972 F.2d 1017, 1029 (9th Cir.1992) (holding that a motion to reopen is not adequate to satisfy due process).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AFA\">. To the extent that Tewelde challenges the BIA\u2019s reliance on the Report, she has waived this argument by not appealing the BIA's denial of her motion to reconsider. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(6) (contemplating two filings for consolidation); <em>see also Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 393-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (construing the predecessor statute \u00a7 1105a(a)(6) to require two filings).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
