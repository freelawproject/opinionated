Garry Okpala appeals the district court\u2019s orders accepting the recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>tions of the magistrate judge and denying relief on Okpala\u2019s complaint filed pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and the court's order denying Okpala\u2019s motions to reconsider. Okpala also challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s order denying additional discovery. We have reviewed the record and the opinions of the district court and magistrate judge and find no reversible error in the denial of Okpala\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claims, reconsideration, or discovery. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court and magistrate judge. <em>See Okpala v. Gal, </em>No. CA-01-4252-025BD (D.S.C. filed June 28, 2002 &amp; entered July 1, 2002; filed Nov. 12, 2002 &amp; entered Nov. 13, 2002; filed Apr. 26, 2004 &amp; entered Apr. 27, 2004; filed May 25, 2004 <em>&amp; </em>entered May 26, 2004; May 27, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">With regard to Okpala\u2019s claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), the magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Okpala that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Okpala failed to specifically object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommended disposition of his FTCA claim. The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Okpala has waived appellate review by failing to file objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b136-5\"> Okpala asserted on appeal that he never received the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation recommending that the district court dismiss certain of his claims under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) (West Supp.2004) and \u00a7 1915A (West Supp.2004), and that the district court therefore erred in adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations. We have reviewed de novo the claims the magistrate judge recommended the district court dismiss, and find that the district court did not err in dismissing those claims. <em>See Veney v. Wyche, </em>293 F.3d 726, 730 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that de novo standard of review applies under \u00a7 1915A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
