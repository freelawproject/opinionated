Walker argues that the deprivation of his watch and wedding band constituted a due process and equal protection violation as well as cruel and unusual punishment. He has abandoned on appeal his argument that the appellee\u2019s actions constituted malfeasance in office and armed robbery and that he is entitled to injunctive relief. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), a district court \u201cshall\u201d dismiss a case if it determines that the case is frivolous or fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. A dismissal as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) is reviewed for abuse of discretion, while a dismissal under that statute for failure to state a claim is reviewed <em>de novo. Newsome v. E.E.O.C., </em>301 F.3d 227, 231 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1049, 123 S.Ct. 660, 154 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Even employing a <em>de novo </em>standard of review, Walker fails to establish a constitutional violation with respect to his claims. Walker\u2019s due process argument fails because Louisiana provides a post-deprivation remedy for property loss. <em>See Parrott v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 541-44, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981); <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); La. Civ.Code Ann. art 2315 (West 1997). Walker argues that he did not follow the proper post-deprivation procedures due to ineffective assistance of inmate counsel. This argument will not be considered for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Walker\u2019s equal protection challenge fails on the ground that it is conelusional in nature. <em>See Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 530 (5th Cir.1990). Walker does not allege facts to support a claim of cruel and unusual punishment. His allegation that the appellee forcefully removed his property raises only a <em>de minimus </em>use of force. <em>See Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). Walker\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>see also Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). In <em>Walker v. Louque, </em>No. 99-31026, 213 F.3d 637 (5th Cir. Apr.12, 2000) (unpublished), this court dismissed a prisoner civil rights appeal by Walker and issued a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) sanctions warning. With this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal, Walker has now accumulated three \u201cstrikes\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Walker is now barred from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) SANCTIONS IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
