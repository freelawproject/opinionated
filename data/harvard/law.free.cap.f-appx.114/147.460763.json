He argues that his three prior uncounseled misdemeanor convictions were ineligible for use in calculating his criminal history score because the waivers of his right to counsel in those cases were invalid. He asserts that, without the usage of these prior convictions, he should have been awarded a downward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Barron has failed to meet his burden to show that those waivers were invalid. <em>See Iowa v. Tovar, </em>541 U.S. 77, 124 S.Ct. 1379, 1390, 158 L.Ed.2d 209 (2004). The district court\u2019s use of Barron\u2019s prior convictions for purposes of determining his criminal history score was therefore proper. Because Barron\u2019s criminal history score exceeded one, he was ineligible for the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a) adjustment. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
