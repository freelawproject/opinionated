Rapides Healthcare System, LLC, </em>277 F.3d 757, 763 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D)). Under the FMLA, an employer may not penalize an employee for exercise of FMLA rights. <em>Id. </em>(citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a)(l)-(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-22\">The district court\u2019s conclusions that Edmonsond had established a prima facie case for retaliation under the FMLA and that Brookwood has articulated legitimate nonretaliatory reasons for its adverse employment decision are not at issue. <em>See Chaffin v. John H. Carter Co., Inc., </em>179 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>F.3d 316, 319-20 (5th Cir.1999). Because Brookwood has rebutted Edmonsond\u2019s prima facie case, to avoid summary judgment, Edmonsond \u201cmust produce substantial probative evidence that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision and that the real reason was the plaintiffs participation in the protected activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320. Edmonsond\u2019s excessive absenteeism and poor job performance provided legitimate reasons for his discharge. <em>See Hypes ex rel. Hypes v. First Commerce Corp., </em>134 F.3d 721, 726-27 (5th Cir.1998). Edmonsond has not presented substantial probative evidence showing that there is a genuine issue whether Brookwood retaliated against him for taking FMLA-protected medical leave. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b176-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
