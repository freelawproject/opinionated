The evidence in the record, including circumstantial evidence and the testimony of accomplices, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, is a sufficient basis upon which a rational jury could have found the essential elements of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Villarreal, </em>324 F.3d 319, 322 (5th Cir.2003). We decline Gutierrez\u2019s request to reweigh the evidence or to assess the credibility of the Government\u2019s witnesses. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>995 F.2d 556, 561 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, it was not necessary for the Government to disprove every hypothesis of innocence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>264 F.3d 561, 576 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Gutierrez contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of a prior marijuana-trafficking conviction, uncharged drug-trafficking, and drug use. The conviction and other drug-trafficking evidence was properly admitted under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) to show Gutierrez\u2019s intent, knowledge, preparation, motive, and plan to transport marijuana. The evidence of drug use was slightly probative of the witness\u2019s relation with Gutierrez, but it was merely a brief passing remark with no prejudicial effect. The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the evidence. <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 911 (5th Cir.1978) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Gutierrez contends that the Government committed misconduct by making certain remarks during the trial. The offending comments were neither improper nor prejudicial to the defense. <em>See United States v. Lankford, </em>196 F.3d 563, 574 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"A85\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
