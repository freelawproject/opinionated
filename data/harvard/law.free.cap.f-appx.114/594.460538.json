A defendant may waive his right to appeal as part of a valid plea agreement if the waiver is knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999). A court applies \u201cgeneral principles of contract law in order to interpret the terms of a plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantu, </em>185 F.3d 298, 304 (5th Cir.1999). A waiver-of-appeal provision is to be construed against the Government, <em>United States v. Somner, </em>127 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir.1997), as the drafter of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">The waiver provision in Williams\u2019s agreement specifically reserved to him the right to appeal <em>\u201cany </em>sentence in excess of <em>a </em>statutory maximum.\u201d (emphasis added). Williams\u2019s plea agreement noted that he faced two alternative statutory maximum prison terms: a ten-year maximum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) or a maximum of life imprisonment under the enhancement provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Because the 15-year prison term imposed upon Williams was \u201cin excess\u201d of \u201ca statutory maximum,\u201d Williams reserved the right to appeal the sentence. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-18\">For the first time on appeal, Williams raises a rather convoluted chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>lenge to his ACCA-enhanced sentence under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The ACCA requires that the prior convictions used for enhancement be based on offenses \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Williams maintains that <em>Apprendi </em>required that the \u201cseparateness\u201d of such offenses be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, although <em>Apprendi </em>excepts from such requirement \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction.\u201d <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. He admits that this is an issue of first impression in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Because Williams failed to inform the district court of the specific grounds of his objection to the ACCA enhancement, this court\u2019s review of his <em>Apprendi </em>arguments is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Burton, </em>126 F.3d 666, 671 (5th Cir.1997). Under the plain-error standard of review, the defendant bears the burden of showing that (1) there is an error (2) that is clear or obvious and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these conditions are satisfied, this court has the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Williams\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument would require an extension of this court\u2019s precedent, he cannot show that any error was \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hull, </em>160 F.3d 265, 272 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">To the extent that Williams challenges the ACCA enhancement under the standard that normally applies to sentencing issues, he has preserved the challenge for review. Williams has not, however, shown that the five judgment orders from prior convictions that the district court relied on to enhance his sentence were \u201cmaterially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Morrow, </em>177 F.3d 272, 304 (5th Cir.1999). That the dates of offenses entered upon the judgments may have been only an \u201cadministrative convenience\u201d under Texas law does not mean that the judgments lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to establish those dates in a federal sentencing proceeding. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b623-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
