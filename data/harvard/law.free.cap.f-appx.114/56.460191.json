We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-27\">Rufus argues the district court abused its discretion when it found there was a factual basis for his guilty plea as to the firearm charge under former Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(f). We review the district court\u2019s determination that a sufficient factual basis exists for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Carr, </em>271 F.3d 172, 179 (4th Cir.2001). The court \u201cneed only be subjectively satisfied that there is a sufficient factual basis for a conclusion that the defendant committed all of the elements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d 649, 652 (4th Cir.1997) (internal citation omitted). \u201c[I]f the evidence presented is sufficient to demonstrate that the defendant committed the elements of the charged offense, acceptance of the plea clearly does not constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">To establish a violation of \u00a7 924(c), the Government must prove the firearm \u201cfurthered, advanced, or helped forward a drug trafficking crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.2002). Factors that might lead a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that the requisite nexus existed between the firearm and the drug offense include: \u201c \u2018the type of drug activity that is being conducted, accessibility of the firearm, the type of weapon ..., whether the gun is loaded, proximity to drugs or drug profits, and the time and circumstances under which the gun is found.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Ceballos-Torres, </em>218 F.3d 409, 414-15 (5th Cir. 2000)). Accordingly, because Rufus admitted he moved the firearm from a table that held cocaine and hid it under a bed just before answering the door to law enforcement officers, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found there was a sufficient factual basis for Rufus\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Rufus also moves to remove his appellate counsel, file a pro se supplemental brief, file a pro se reply brief, supplement the record, and proceed on appeal pro se. Rufus does not have a constitutional right to proceed on appeal pro se. <em>See Martinez v. Court of Appeal of California, </em>528 U.S. 152, 163, 120 S.Ct. 684, 145 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000); <em>United States v. Gillis, </em>773 F.2d 549, 560 (4th Cir.1985). We therefore deny Rufus\u2019s motion to remove appellate counsel and proceed on appeal pro se. We also deny Rufus\u2019s motions to supplement the record and file a pro se reply brief. However, because we permitted the defendant in <em>Gillis </em>to submit a supplemental pro se brief, concluding that this provided him with \u201cany \u2018right\u2019 he has to self-representation on appeal,\u201d we grant Rufus\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief. <em>See Gillis, </em>773 F.2d at 560. Nevertheless, we have carefully considered the issues Rufus asserts pro se and conclude that they are meritless. We further conclude that because the record does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Rufus\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is not cognizable in this appeal and should be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Rufus\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
