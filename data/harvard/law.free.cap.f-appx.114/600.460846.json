Cain challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that he failed to state a claim of either retaliation or excessive use of force against defendant Capt. Ambriz. He also challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his retaliation claims against members of the McConnell Unit grievance staff for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">On appeal, Cain concedes that he defied repeated requests from Capt. Ambriz that Cain step back into his cell. Cain remained in his doorway and Capt. Ambriz was unable to close Cain\u2019s cell door. The action taken by Capt. Ambriz, using his open hand to push Cain\u2019s face and force him into his cell, was not objectively unreasonable given Cain\u2019s admitted refusal to comply with Capt. Ambriz\u2019 requests. We therefore conclude that Cain\u2019s allegations did not state a claim for excessive use of force against Capt. Ambriz. <em>See Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992); <em>Williams v. Bramer, </em>180 F.3d 699, 703 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">The magistrate judge rejected Cain\u2019s claim that Capt. Ambriz\u2019s act of striking Cain was a retaliatory act. At his <em>Spears</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing, Cain stated that he did not believe that Capt. Ambriz struck him in retaliation for filing grievances against Capt. Ambriz. Instead, Cain stated that he believed that Capt. Ambriz simply did not like inmates. Because Cain\u2019s allegations did not show that Capt. Ambriz intended to retaliate against Cain for exercising a constitutional right, his complaint failed to state a claim of retaliation against Capt. Ambriz. <em>See McDonald v. Steward, </em>132 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-12\">The magistrate judge dismissed without prejudice Cain\u2019s claims of retaliation against members of the prison unit grievance staff because Cain was unable to identify any individual members of the grievance staff and because his allegations of motive were based solely on his personal beliefs. On appeal, Cain does not argue that the magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal of his claims was improper given the information available in the district court. Instead, Cain has named several members of the grievance staff that he considers to be defendants in the case and he has made specific factual allegations relating to those newly-named individuals. The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure do not permit Cain to amend his original complaint in this appeal. If Cain wishes to make specific allegations of retaliation against individual members of the McConnell Unit grievance staff, he should re-file his claims. <em>See Gartrell v. Gaylor, </em>981 F.2d 254, 256 (5th Cir.1993) (applicable statute of limitations in Texas is two years).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">The dismissal of Cain\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim is AFFIRMED. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Cain\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Cain is WARNED that if he accu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>mulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b629-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
