The district court dismissed Hailey\u2019s civil rights action as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-25\">Hailey does not argue that the district court erred in determining that his appeal was taken in bad faith, and he does not argue that the district court erred by dismissing his action as barred by <em>Heck. </em>As Hailey has failed to brief the sole dispositive issue for appeal, his IFP motion is denied and the appeal is dismissed as friv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>olous. <em>Brinkmann v.
