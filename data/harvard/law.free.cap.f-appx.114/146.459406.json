Williams challenges the district court\u2019s increase in his base offense level by four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), arguing that no evidence existed that he used or possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We address the merits of Williams\u2019s sentencing claim, despite the waiver-of-appeal provision in Williams\u2019s plea agreement, in the light of the Government\u2019s explicit assertion that it chooses not to rely on the appeal waiver. <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>253 F.3d 800, 804 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The district court did not clearly err in determining that Williams used or possessed a firearm in connection with a counterfeiting offense. <em>See United States v. Armstead, </em>114 F.3d 504, 512 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1193, 1199-1200 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Williams seeks leave to file a supplemental brief in which he contends that the adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because it was based on facts not charged in his indictment, not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and not admitted by him at his plea hearing. Williams has submitted his supplemental brief, and his motion to file it is GRANTED. As Williams concedes, his <em>Blakely </em>argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004) (holding that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(U.S. July 14, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b174-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
