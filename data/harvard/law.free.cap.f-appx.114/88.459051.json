INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Gidey failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2004) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Next, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Gidey\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Gidey failed to establish refugee status, she cannot satisfy the higher standard necessary for withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Furthermore, we conclude substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Gidey did not establish it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to Ethiopia, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (2004), and thus, the IJ properly denied her petition for protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Finally, Gidey\u2019s claim that the Board\u2019s use of the summary affirmance procedure under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2004) violated her due process rights is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2004). In <em>Blanco de Belbruno, </em>we held that \u201cthe BIA\u2019s streamlining regulations do not violate an alien\u2019s rights to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Accordingly, we deny Gidey\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
