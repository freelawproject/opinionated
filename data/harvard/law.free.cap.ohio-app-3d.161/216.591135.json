Afterwards, an investigation occurred to decide whether plaintiff should be terminated from the Section 8 program. At some point during the investigation, plaintiff spoke with Kevin Zapior, a CMHA compliance officer. Because she was still having problems with her neighbor and landlord, plaintiff asked Zapior what she could do.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 4} When the investigation was completed, Zapior issued a written decision in which he determined that plaintiff should not be terminated from the CMHA Section 8 housing program. At the end of that letter, plaintiff was told to \u201ccontact the Section 8 Customer Service Department to receive your moving papers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 5} Thereafter, on December 10, 2001, plaintiff signed a statement that she would like to withdraw from the Section 8 program, effective January 31, 2002. Plaintiff believed that by signing the statement, she would be able to leave her present apartment and then move to another Section 8 property, all the while remaining a participant in the Section 8 program. On or about January 31, 2002, CMHA stopped plaintiffs Section 8 rent subsidy payments. CMHA subsequently refused to reinstate plaintiff into the Section 8 program.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">{\u00b6 6} Plaintiff filed suit, alleging that CMHA violated her rights as a disabled or handicapped person under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), the Fair Housing Amendments Act (\u201cFHAA\u201d), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\u201cRHA\u201d). She further alleged that CMHA violated her rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In her amended complaint, plaintiff alleged that CMHA knew or should have known that she is disabled or handicapped under the various acts and the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">{\u00b6 7} On February 20, 2004, CMHA filed its motion to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint. The basis of its motion was failure to state a claim, Civ.R. 12(B)(6). On April 2, 2004, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. That request was denied on the same day that the trial court granted CMHA\u2019s motion to dismiss, May 21, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">{\u00b6 8} Plaintiff appeals and presents two assignments of error. Because plaintiffs second assignment of error is dispositive of this appeal, we address it first.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>II. The trial court erred, as a matter of law, in denying plaintiffs motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 9} Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred when it denied her motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 10} Civ.R. 15(A)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that leave to file an amended pleading \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d The decision \u201cto allow a party leave to amend a complaint is within the discretion of the trial court and the ruling should not be disturbed on appeal absent an affirmative showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Schweizer v. Riverside Methodist Hosps. </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 539, 545, 671 N.E.2d 312, citing <em>Edmondson v. Steelman </em>(1992), 87 Ohio App.3d 455, 457, 622 N.E.2d 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">{\u00b6 11} Though Civ.R. 15(A) encourages liberal amendment, such motions will be denied if made in bad faith, with undue delay, or undue prejudice to the opposing party. <em>Turner v. Cent. Local School Dist. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 95, 706 N.E.2d 1261. The primary consideration is whether there is actual prejudice to the opposing party because of the delay. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">{\u00b6 12} In the case at bar, plaintiff argues that, had she been allowed to file her second amended complaint, CMHA\u2019s motion to dismiss her amended complaint would have been moot. According to plaintiff, her second amended complaint would have cured all the pleading deficiencies CMHA complained about in its motion to dismiss.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">The standard of review for a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion is consistent with Civ.R. 15(A), which allows a pleader to rectify a poorly pleaded complaint. If a motion for failure to state a claim is sustained, \u201cleave to amend the pleading should be granted unless the court determines that allegations of other statements or facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the defect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-10\"><em>State ex rel. Hanson v. Guernsey Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 545, 549, 605 N.E.2d 378, quoting McCormac, Ohio Civil Rules of Practice (2 Ed.1992) 150, Section 6.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>{\u00b6 13} CMHA filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint for the following reasons</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">Jordan has failed to assert a valid cause of action under Section 1983 because she cannot establish (1) that she was deprived of a right secured by the United States Constitution or federal law, and (2) that any deprivation resulted from an official custom or policy of CMHA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 14} Jordan has failed to assert a valid cause of action under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or the Fan-Housing Act because (1) she has not adequately pled a disability substantially limiting one or more major life activities and (2) she has not alleged any discriminatory conduct by CMHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 15} In order for a plaintiff to successfully state a discrimination claim under the ADA and the FHAA for failure to reasonably accommodate, she must allege that (1) \u201c[s]he suffers from a handicap as defined by the FHAA,\u201d (2) defendant \u201cknew or reasonably should have known of\u2019 plaintiffs handicap, (3) \u201caccommodation of the handicap \u2018may be necessary\u2019 to afford an equal opportunity to use and enjoy [her] dwelling,\u201d and (4) defendant \u201crefused to make such accommodation.\u201d <em>McGary v. Portland </em>(C.A.9, 2004), 386 F.3d 1259, 1262, citing <em>Giebeler v. M &amp; B Assoc. </em>(C.A.9, 2003), 343 F.3d 1143, 1146-1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">{\u00b6 16} CMHA claims that Jordan did not sufficiently state a claim under Section 1983 because she cannot establish that she was deprived of a right protected by the United States Constitution or federal law or that such deprivation resulted from an official custom or policy of CMHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">{\u00b6 17} Under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), plaintiff does not have to \u201cestablish\u201d anything; she merely needs to sufficiently \u201callege facts which would support the existence of an unconstitutional policy or custom[ ]\u201d under Section 1983. <em>Crumpley-Patterson v. Trinity Lutheran Hosp. </em>(C.A.8, 2004), 388 F.3d 588, 591, citing <em>Doe v. Norfolk School Dist. </em>(C.A.8, 2003), 340 F.3d 605, 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">{\u00b6 18} In the case at bar, while the parties were still briefing the issues raised in CMHA\u2019s motion to dismiss, plaintiff filed her motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. In that motion, plaintiff implicitly conceded that her amended complaint contained the pleading defects discussed in CMHA\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff attempted to file a second amended complaint, which addressed those defects by adding the following paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>With respect to each allegation in this complaint concerning the action (or failure to act) of CMHA or a CMHA employee or agent, CMHA or the employee or agent acted (or failed to act) as a result of a CMHA policy or custom. The relevant CMHA policies are set forth in the CMHA Administrative Plan for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">Ms. Jordan\u2019s disability under the RHA and ADA, and her handicap under the FHA, is a major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe, not psychotic, and a post-traumatic stress disorder. Among other things, (i) it causes her to become panicky in bad situations and, consequently, to misconstrue matters related to those situations and (ii) it prevents her from engaging in any substantial, gainful activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 19} When we compare the changes plaintiff proposed in her second amended complaint with her amended complaint, we conclude that the paragraphs she added would have ameliorated the pleading deficiencies discussed in CMHA\u2019s motion to dismiss. The collective purpose of Civ.R. 12(B)(6) and Civ.R. 15(A) is to encourage such amendments so that a plaintiff can correct pleading deficiencies and thereby proceed to have the case decided on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 20} Nonetheless, CMHA opposed plaintiffs motion for leave to file a second amended complaint for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">[Requiring CMHA to respond to a second amended complaint would cause undue prejudice, hardship, and delay. * * * CMHA would be required to analyze Jordan\u2019s allegations for a third time and either answer her complaint or move to dismiss again. Further, the briefing schedule set in the Court\u2019s Case Management Order would be disrupted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">{\u00b6 21} In order to determine whether CMHA would have been prejudiced as it claims, we review the trial court\u2019s scheduling orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">{\u00b6 22} The docket shows that the trial court held a case management conference on March 4, 2004, with briefing on CMHA\u2019s motion to dismiss to be completed by April 26, 2004. Plaintiffs motion for leave to file a second amended complaint was filed on April 2, 2004. The next pretrial was set for May 18, 2004. The trial court never set a discovery cutoff date or a trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">{\u00b6 23} On the record before this court, CMHA does not dispute that plaintiffs proposed second amended complaint addressed the problems discussed in its motion to dismiss. Therefore, CMHA\u2019s motion to dismiss would have been moot and CMHA would have had to answer the second amended complaint well before the May 18 pretrial date. We, therefore, reject CMHA\u2019s claim that it would have been prejudiced by plaintiff filing her second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Even if CMHA wanted to file another motion to dismiss, we still do not find any undue hardship, delay, or prejudice, because the trial court never set a discovery cutoff or a trial date. Without a discovery deadline or even a trial date, we cannot agree with CMHA that the second amended complaint would have disrupted the court\u2019s briefing schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 25} First, arguing that the court\u2019s briefing schedule may be disrupted is the classic example of elevating form over substance, particularly when the second amended complaint would have made the court\u2019s briefing schedule superfluous. Second, the second amended complaint effectively corrected the pleading deficiencies that CMHA complained about and that resulted in the dismissal of plaintiffs amended complaint. A properly pled second amended complaint would have made it far more likely that plaintiffs case would be decided on its merits, rather than on pleading defects. Such a result is, of course, always preferable. <em>National Mut. Ins. Co. v. Papenhagen </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 14, 30 OBR 21, 505 N.E.2d 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 26} For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied plaintiffs motion for leave to file a second amended complaint in this case. Plaintiffs second assignment of error is sustained. Because we sustain plaintiffs second assignment of error, her first assignment of error is now moot.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 27} The judgment of the trial court is hereby reversed and this matter remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-9\">Kilbane and McMonagle, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-14\">. Plaintiff's original complaint was filed on December <em>9, </em>2003. The first amended complaint was subsequently filed February 4, 2004. Originally, there were two other party defendants, George A. Phillips and Cathy Pennington. Both parties were, however, voluntarily dismissed by plaintiff on April 2, 2004.
