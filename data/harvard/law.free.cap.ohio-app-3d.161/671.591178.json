Taylor cross-appeals from that portion of the judgment entry in favor of Kemp.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">{\u00b6 2} Prior to their marriage on September 28, 1992, Ralph E. Kemp and Doris Kemp executed a prenuptial agreement on July 10, 1992. No children were born of the marriage, but Ralph had a stepson, Ronald Taylor, from a previous marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">{\u00b6 3} On September 22, 2000, Ralph, who was in poor health, executed a power of attorney, giving Doris the authority to act on his behalf. On September 26, 2000, Doris used the power of attorney to close three bank accounts titled in Ralph\u2019s name, which held a total of approximately $82,000. She deposited the money in a separate bank account solely in her name.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">{\u00b6 4} Ralph died on September 26, 2000. However, prior to his death and prior to executing the power of attorney, Ralph established or changed the beneficiary designations on several payable-on-death bank accounts, making Doris the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">{\u00b6 5} On October 2, 2000, Doris applied to the probate court to be appointed as administrator of Ralph\u2019s estate, alleging that Ralph had died intestate. Doris did not inform the probate court of the premarital agreement, nor did she report the $82,000 that she had taken from Ralph\u2019s bank accounts on September 26, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">{\u00b6 6} On February 11, 2001, Taylor filed a motion to remove Doris as administrator and to appoint a successor. On April 16, 2001, the court removed Doris as administrator and appointed attorney Timothy France. On August 24, 2001, Taylor applied to probate a lost, spoliated, or destroyed will. On February 28, 2002, a copy of a 1956 will of Ralph Kemp was admitted to probate. The 1956 will named Ralph\u2019s first wife, Ethel, as his sole heir and Taylor as the sole contingent beneficiary. As a result, Taylor was appointed executor of Ralph Kemp\u2019s estate on March 25, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">{\u00b6 7} On March 28, 2002, Taylor filed a statutory action pursuant to R.C. 2109.50 against Doris. On July 25, 2002, the probate court entered judgment on the petition, ordering that the $82,000 withdrawn by Doris be returned to the estate. The probate court denied Taylor\u2019s remaining requests for recovery, including $229,000 from the payable-on-death accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">{\u00b6 8} On May 3, 2002, Taylor, individually, and Floyd Kemp filed a civil action in the court of common pleas seeking damages caused by Doris as a result of fraud, fraudulent conveyance, conversion, and intentional interference with the expectancy of inheritance. On February 10, 2003, they amended their complaint, adding Karma Miller and Allen Bickel as defendants. On November 17, 2003, Floyd Kemp voluntarily dismissed his claims against all parties, leaving Taylor as the sole plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>{\u00b6 9} On January 16, 2004, and January 22, 2004, the matter proceeded to a bench trial. On April 21, 2004, the trial court granted judgment in favor of Taylor against Doris in the amount of $270,000 and dismissed the complaint as to Bickel and Miller. The trial court further denied Taylor\u2019s demand for punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. On July 23, 2004, the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law, which both parties stipulated to being transmitted to this court for inclusion in the appellate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">{\u00b6 10} It is from the April 21, 2004 judgment entry of the Coshocton County Court of Common Pleas that both parties now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">{1\u00cd11} Appellant and cross-appellee, Doris, assigns as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cI. The trial court committed prejudicial error when it permitted hearsay testimony about Ralph Kemp\u2019s \u2018probate avoidance and tax avoidance plan.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cII. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that Doris Kemp\u2019s breach of promise related to the [payable-on-death] bank accounts is not supported by the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIII. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that Doris Kemp committed fraud by her promise of future conduct regarding the [payable-on-death] accounts is error as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTV. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that Ronald Taylor had a reasonably certain expectation of \u2018inheritance\u2019 as it relates to the $229,000 in [payable-on-death] accounts is not supported by the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cV. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff can recover non-probate assets by demonstrating the tort of \u2018intentional interference with expectancy of inheritance\u2019 is error as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">Assignment of Error No. I</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">{\u00b6 17} In the first assignment of error, Doris maintains that the trial court committed prejudicial error when it permitted attorney Paul Miller\u2019s hearsay testimony concerning Ralph Kemp\u2019s \u201cprobate avoidance and tax avoidance plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">{\u00b6 18} Doris cites the following exchange at trial during examination of attorney Paul Miller:</p>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cQ. Did you participate in the implementation of the probate avoidance and tax avoidance plan in any respects with regard to the Belmont County real estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA. Yes. That was then a second item of discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-17\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cQ. All right. And what was the plan there? Was it any different from the plan with Nellie, or was it the same?</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>{\u00b6 22} \u201cA. No, that was very different in that that property \u2014 he wanted that property to eventually\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cMR. WRIGHT: Object.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cTHE COURT: What is the basis for your objection Mr. Wright?</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cMR. WRIGHT: Hearsay. I think the court\u2019s ruled and this would go back to the testimony of any statements made by the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cTHE COURT: The question was: \u2018Did he express an intent as to what he wanted done with the Belmont property?\u2019 The witness may testify as to what he heard. The objection is overruled. You may answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cA. He wanted the Belmont property to go to his stepson, Ron Taylor, whom I had never met before but I saw his name in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cQ. And that understanding was based on the conversations you had with him and directives that you had received from him?</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA. That\u2019s true.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cQ. Were there any discussions in your presence about the plan with the Belmont County property and the ultimate beneficiary and what was to happen as far as the transfer of the property?</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cA. Yes, we did discuss that and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cQ. \u2014 I would caution you not to say what Mr. Kemp said but what your understanding of the arrangement was to be as far as transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA. My understanding was that the property was jointly titled with the specific understanding that at some time in the future if Pauline Kemp survives him, that it would be surveyed and transferred to Ronald Taylor, the stepson.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-16\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cQ. To what extent did you hear any discussions between Mr. and Mrs. Kemp regarding this arrangement, and I\u2019m interested in any comments Mrs. Kemp might have made to Mr. Kemp in that setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-17\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cA. I was reluctant with this option that they chose, and we had extensive discussion. And Mrs. Kemp expressed no interest whatsoever in his property and also convinced me that she understood what her role would be as a fiduciary in carrying out this plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-18\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cQ. Did she make any comments to Mr. Kemp about this plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b713-19\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cA. Yes, she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-20\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cQ. What did she say?</p>\n<p id=\"b713-21\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cQ. T will do whatever you ask me to do.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ. During this process, did Mrs. Kemp make any statements to you out of the presence of Mr. Kemp?</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cA. Yes, she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cQ. And what were the circumstances there?</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cA. As I specifically recall, he excused himself from my conference room and went to the restroom. And it was on that occasion that I took the opportunity to talk to Mrs. Kemp about the decision he is about to make. And, at least from my perspective, I tried to emphasize the weightiness of the responsibility and to which I received affirmation, at least to my satisfaction, that she would do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cQ. Now, then did these discussions occur, again, just in general time, the discussions about the Nellie and the Belmont County? Is this all happening at the same time?</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cA. Yes. Approximately the same time. See, one of the issues in the Nellie life estate was that I think there was also discussion with regard to Mrs. Kemp\u2019s estate, which was, from my perspective, always considered a separate situation. But there was discussion, as I recall, on the part of Mrs. Kemp, about transferring her assets, of which I didn\u2019t know what all the details were, but I was led to believe that it\u2019s real estate near Fender\u2019s Fish Hatchery and so forth, that she may be transferring it to her children. And if they live together in Nellie, well, at least my discussion with her with them was maybe she would be out of a home or something if he would die or whatever. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons that we began to discuss that that should just be transferred to her outright.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cQ. And, as I recall, you said those discussions were in the spring of 2000?</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cA. Yes, they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cQ. And did you participate in the implementation of any probate and tax avoidance plan by assisting Mr. Kemp with any other assets?</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cA. No, I did not. Other than just a discussion \u2014 I think we did discuss forms of ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cQ. Did you inquire as to whether you were to assist with the probate and tax avoidance plan with any other assets, like bank accounts?</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cA. I don\u2019t know whether I specifically asked whether he wants my services, but I was advised that there were other assets, but I did not know the extent or know the dollar amount of those or the value.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>{\u00b6 53} \u201cQ. In your discussion, did you advise how those assets could also be set up as nonprobate type transfers?</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cA. I think we talked about that, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">{\u00b6 55} Doris claims that Evid.R. 802, 804, and 805 support her argument that Miller\u2019s testimony constitutes inadmissible hearsay. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">{\u00b6 56} Generally, the admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. Therefore, we will not disturb a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling unless we find that the trial court abused its discretion. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">{\u00b6 57} Evid.R. 801(C) defines \u201chearsay\u201d as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d When an out-of-court statement is offered without reference to its truth, it is not hearsay. <em>State v. Lewis </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 125, 132-133, 51 O.O.2d 209, 258 N.E.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">{\u00b6 58} We conclude that the trial court did not err in admitting Miller\u2019s testimony. The statements at issue were not offered by Taylor to prove the truth of the matters asserted but were offered to explain the actions of Ralph Kemp. The statements were therefore not hearsay, see Evid.R. 801(C), and they were relevant, as they pertained to the actions preceding Ralph Kemp\u2019s death. See <em>Williams v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(2001), 145 Ohio App.3d 530, 763 N.E.2d 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">{\u00b6 59} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">Assignments of Error Nos. II, III, and IV</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">{\u00b6 60} Appellant\u2019s second, third, and fourth assignments of error raise common and interrelated issues; therefore, we will address the assignments together.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">{\u00b6 61} Doris maintains that there is insufficient evidence that she breached a promise related to the payable-on-death bank accounts and that the trial court erred in finding that she had committed fraud by her promise of future conduct regarding those accounts. Therefore, Doris maintains, the conclusion that Taylor had a reasonable expectation of inheritance in the payable-on-death accounts is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">{\u00b6 62} We agree with Doris that there is insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that she breached a promise with regard to the payable-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>on-death bank accounts. We find no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding regarding the payable-on-death accounts, nor does Taylor point to any evidence apart from the evidence set forth supra. Ralph changed the beneficiary designations in June and July 2000. The power of attorney naming Doris was not executed until September 2000. Accordingly, Doris did not use her power of attorney to change the beneficiary designations, and there is no evidence that she otherwise fraudulently induced Ralph into making the changes relative to the payable-to-death accounts. Despite the trial court\u2019s findings of fraud due to Doris\u2019s other actions, there is no evidence of fraud with regard to the payable-to-death accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">{\u00b6 68} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second, third, and fourth assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Assignment of Error No. V</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">{\u00b6 64} Based upon our disposition of Doris\u2019s second, third, and fourth assignments of error, the fifth assignment of error is overruled as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">{\u00b6 65} We now turn to Taylor\u2019s assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cI. The trial court\u2019s failure to award the reduction of stock value from the date of Ralph Kemp\u2019s death to the date of delivery to Ronald Taylor as executor of the estate is error as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cII. The trial court\u2019s failure to award punative [sic] damages and attorney fees is not supported by the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cIII. The trial court\u2019s failure to find Allen Bickel and Karma Miller jointly and severally liable to plaintiff is error as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">Cross-Assignments of Error Nos. I and II</p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">{\u00b6 69} Taylor\u2019s first and second assignments of error raise common and interrelated issues; therefore, we will address the assignments together.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">{\u00b6 70} Taylor maintains that the trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to award him monetary damages for the reduction in stock value from the date of Ralph Kemp\u2019s death to the date of delivery. He further maintains that the trial court erred in failing to award him punitive damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">{\u00b6 71} Taylor asserts that the reduction in the value of the stock due to a declining market was foreseeable and due to Doris\u2019s fraud. He further asserts that there is clear and convincing evidence that Doris\u2019s acts or failure to act demonstrated malice, aggravated or egregious fraud, oppression, or insult and that he has presented proof of actual damages resulting from those acts or failure to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>{\u00b6 72} \u201cWe will not disturb a decision of the trial court as to a determination of damages absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Roberts v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 630, 634, 665 N.E.2d 664, citing <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. Again, in order to find an abuse of discretion, we must determine that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. Id. at 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. It is possible that, in awarding an amount of compensatory damages less than that requested by Taylor, the trial court found Taylor\u2019s claimed damages to be speculative and not supported by the evidence. The value of stock often goes up or down over time. As a result, damages based on a reduction in value because of delay are inherently speculative. Therefore, upon review of the record, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in its award of compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">{\u00b6 73} The decision whether to award punitive damages is within the trial court\u2019s discretion and, absent an abuse of discretion, the court\u2019s ruling will be upheld. Ohio law provides that an award of punitive damages is available only upon a finding of actual malice. <em>Berge v. Columbus Community Cable Access </em>(1999), 136 Ohio App.3d 281, 316, 736 N.E.2d 517. The \u201cactual malice\u201d necessary for purposes of an award of punitive damages has been defined as \u201c \u2018(1) that state of mind under which a person\u2019s conduct is characterized by hatred, ill will or a spirit of revenge, or (2) a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons that has a great probability of causing substantial harm.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Preston v. Murty </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 334, 512 N.E.2d 1174, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">{\u00b6 74} In its decision, the trial court concluded that punitive damages were not warranted in this case. Upon review, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">{\u00b6 75} Taylor\u2019s first and second assignments of error on cross-appeal are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Cross-Assignment of Error No. Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">{\u00b6 76} In his third assignment of error, Taylor argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to find Allen Bickel and Karma Miller jointly and severally liable. Initially, we note that we cannot reweigh the evidence and must defer to the findings of the trial judge, who is best able to weigh the credibility of the evidence by viewing the witnesses and observing their demean- or.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">{\u00b6 77} A review of the trial record indicates that Karma Miller merely assisted her mother by driving her to financial institutions. Accordingly, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>court did not err in refusing to find Karma Miller jointly and severally liable, because the evidence does not demonstrate that she engaged in tortious activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">{\u00b6 78} As to Allen Bickel, the record is again insufficient to demonstrate his involvement in tortious conduct. Again, it is for the trial court to weigh the evidence and to judge the credibility of witnesses. The trial court certainly could have deemed Bickel\u2019s testimony credible regarding his not being involved in burning Ralph\u2019s will and did not err in failing to find him jointly and severally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">{\u00b6 79} Therefore, we conclude that the,trial court did not err as a matter of law in failing to find Bickel and Miller jointly and severally liable, as a review of the record demonstrates there is insufficient evidence to support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">{\u00b6 80} The third assignment of error on cross-appeal is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">{\u00b6 81} The judgment entry of the Coshocton County Court of Common Pleas is reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Judgment reversed in part' and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b718-10\">Boggins, P.J., and Gwin, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
