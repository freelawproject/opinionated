Logan Trucking Company (\u201cLogan\u201d), Norman Munnal, and their insurers, Great West Casualty Company (\u201cGreat West\u201d) and Gulf Insurance Group (\u201cGulf\u2019), appeal from a judgment by the Ohio Court of Claims that determined that Munnal\u2019s and Logan\u2019s negligence was partly to blame for a truck collision in an Ashland County construction zone. The court also held that appellee, the Ohio Department of Transportation (\u201cODOT\u201d), negligently planned and implemented a hazardous temporary road design that contributed to the accident. ODOT has filed a cross-appeal asserting that the court erred in finding ODOT partially liable and that, instead, Munnal\u2019s negligent driving was the proximate cause of the fatal accident that gave rise to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>{\u00b6 2} The accident occurred on U.S. Route 80 between Interstate 71 and Wooster, Ohio. In order to undertake four miles of road improvements on one side of the four-lane divided highway, ODOT developed a design whereby both eastbound lanes would be closed and traffic rerouted to one lane of the westbound portion of the road. ODOT used signage and double yellow lines of reflective tape to separate the two lanes of traffic, thus turning the four-lane divided highway into a two-lane, two-way operation (\u201cTLTWO\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">{\u00b6 3} On June 19, 1998, Munnal was driving a tractor-trailer on U.S. 30 in the scope of his employment as a driver for Logan. Munnal\u2019s truck left its lane of travel and drove into oncoming traffic, forcing David Dunlap\u2019s vehicle off the road and striking Reganne Heffelfinger\u2019s vehicle head-on. Although Dunlap and his passenger, Pamela Grimm, sustained minor injuries, Heffelfinger\u2019s injuries were fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">{\u00b6 4} Heffelfinger\u2019s estate and Dunlap and Grimm initiated two separate actions against Munnal and Logan in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas. Munnal and Logan responded with a third-party complaint against ODOT, which resulted in the consolidation of the separate actions and removal of the matter to the Ohio Court of Claims. Eventually, Munnal, Logan, and their insurers settled the Heffelfinger claim for $1.4 million, of which Logan paid a $10,000 deductible. The Dunlap and Grimm claims were eventually settled for $7,500. The parties stipulated that the Heffelfinger, Dunlap, and Grimm settlements extinguished any potential liability of ODOT to Heffelfinger\u2019s estate or to Dunlap and Grimm. Thus, the only remaining claim to be tried before the Court of Claims was appellants\u2019 third-party action against ODOT for reimbursement of the insurance sums paid to Dunlap, Grimm, and the Heffelfinger estate. This action rested on the assertion that ODOT was at least partially liable for negligently designing and maintaining a hazardous road condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">{\u00b6 5} In its April 2003 decision, the Court of Claims addressed the issue of ODOT\u2019s negligence. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">After considering the totality of the circumstances, the evidence adduced at trial, and the relevant case law, the court finds that ODOT breached its duty to the traveling public by failing to keep the roadway free from an unreasonable risk of harm to motorists. While ODOT considered a variety of designs which called for the use of channelizing devices, it eventually decided not to implement any of them. The court finds that defendant failed to utilize some method to physically separate adjacent lanes of travel which thereby created an unreasonable risk of harm to motorists utilizing the roadways. The court further finds that such negligence was a proximate cause of the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2\">{\u00b6 6} The court additionally determined that Munnal had failed to sustain his burden of proof regarding his claimed defense of having been suddenly stricken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>by a period of unconsciousness. Instead, the court determined that Munnal knew or should have known that he had a propensity to fall asleep at unpredictable times:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">This court is convinced that whether or not Munnal was aware that he suffered from sleep apnea, he was certainly aware that he had repeatedly experienced episodes of excessive sleepiness which, standing alone, would seem to this court to be an unsafe state for any commercial truck driver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">{\u00b6 7} Concluding that the doctrine of respondeat superior rendered Logan liable for Munnal\u2019s negligence, the court determined that Logan should receive contribution from ODOT and reduced damages by 50 percent to account for Logan\u2019s own negligence. The court thus determined that ODOT owed Logan $5,025, which was one-half of the $10,000 deductible plus Logan\u2019s filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">{\u00b6 8} An additional issue before the court involved ODOT\u2019s argument that sovereign immunity precluded Logan and Munnal from recovering from ODOT any money paid on their behalf by Great West and Gulf. The court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">Under R.C. 2743.02(D) and <em>Community Ins. [Co. v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 376, 750 N.E.2d 573], Logan and Munnal\u2019s recovery in this contribution action against the state must be reduced, as a matter of law, by the insurance proceeds paid on their behalf. Such a ruling is consistent with the legislative intent to preserve public funds while providing reimbursement for an uninsured claimant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">However, with regard to the $10,000 payment made by Logan, R.C. 2743.02(D) does not apply. See <em>Heritage Ins. Co. v. Dept. of Transp. </em>(July 10, 2002), Franklin Ct. of Cl. No. 99-01250.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Axj\">{\u00b6 9} Appellants now assign the following as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\">1. The Court of Claims erred in concluding that Great West and Gulf were not entitled to recover against ODOT for its proportionate share for the settlements paid to the plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">2. The Court of Claims erred in concluding that W.L. Logan and Norman Munnal were contributorily negligent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">{\u00b6 10} ODOT\u2019s cross-appeal assigns the following as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-13\">Cross-Assignment of Error No. 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-14\">The trial court erred by failing to find that ODOT was immune from liability in making a discretionary decision on whether to use a channelizing device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-15\">Cross-Assignment of Error No. 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The trial court erred in finding that ODOT negligently maintained the roadway and that it was not reasonably safe for the traveling public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">Cross-Assignment of Error No. 3:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">The trial court erred for failing to find that W.L. Logan is liable for negligent hiring and entrustment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">Cross-Assignment of Error No. 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">The trial court erred by using the wrong legal standard to weigh the evidence and failed to properly apportion negligence between all parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">{\u00b6 11} We will address ODOT\u2019s first and second assignments of error on cross-appeal first, as they both involve the threshold question of ODOT\u2019s liability. As we explain below, we sustain ODOT\u2019s first and second cross-assignments of error and, on these grounds, reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">{\u00b6 12} In 1975, the state of Ohio enacted R.C. 2743.02, which provides, with certain exceptions, \u201cThe state hereby waives its immunity from liability * * * and consents to be sued, and have its liability determined * * * in accordance with the same rules of law applicable to suits between private parties * * R.C. 2743.02(A)(1). In <em>Reynolds v. State </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 68, 14 OBR 506, 471 N.E.2d 776, at paragraph one of the syllabus, however, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the state\u2019s consent to be sued preserved the state\u2019s immunity \u201cfor its legislative or judicial functions or the exercise of an executive or planning function involving the making of a basic policy decision which is characterized by the exercise of a high degree of official judgment or discretion.\u201d Accordingly, with respect to actions of ODOT, Ohio courts have since held: \u201cThe issue of whether an act constitutes a mandatory duty or a discretionary act determines the scope of the state\u2019s liability because ODOT is immune from liability for damages resulting from not performing a discretionary act.\u201d <em>Gregory v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 30, 33-34, 667 N.E.2d 1009, citing <em>Winwood v. Dayton </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 282, 525 N.E.2d 808; accord <em>Garland v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 10, 548 N.E.2d 233, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">{\u00b6 13} Further, while acknowledging the state\u2019s immunity for discretionary decision making, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that once the state makes such a basic policy decision and the state decides to engage in a certain activity or function, \u201cthe state may be held liable, in the same manner as private parties, for the negligence of the actions of its employees and agents in the performance of such activities.\u201d <em>Reynolds, </em>14 Ohio St.3d 68, 14 OBR 506, 471 N.E.2d 776, at paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus, although ODOT is immune from suit for decisions characterized by the exercise of engineering judgment or discretion, once ODOT decides to use a particular traffic control device, it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>held liable for negligence in implementing its plans. See id.; <em>Cushman v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(Mar. 14, 1996), Franklin App. No. 95API07-844, 1996 WL 117234. To prove actionable negligence against ODOT, a plaintiff must demonstrate that ODOT owed a duty to the plaintiff, ODOT breached its duty, and the breach proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">{\u00b6 14} With these principles as our guide, we look first to whether ODOT\u2019s actions at issue in this case were discretionary. In its decision, the trial court determined, as a matter of law, that ODOT was required to refer to the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (\u201cMUTCD\u201d) in designing the methods to be used to reroute traffic during the construction project. Appellants assert that because U.S. 30 qualified as a freeway and the project was partially financed with federal funds, the corresponding federal manual, which expressly required the use of concrete barriers to separate lanes of traffic, controlled. We agree with the trial court that the MUTCD was the pertinent guide. As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>White v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 39, 41, 564 N.E.2d 462: \u201cThe Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways * * * has been adopted as the state\u2019s official specifications for highway signs and markings pursuant to the mandate of R.C. 4511.09.\u201d See, also, <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(June 28, 2001), Franklin App. No. 00AP-1119, 2001 WL 721988.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">{\u00b6 15} Former Section ID of the MUTCD reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">The decision to use a particular device at a particular location should be made on the basis of an engineering study of the location. Thus, while this Manual provides standards for design and application of traffic control devices, the Manual is not a substitute for engineering judgment. Except for sections of this Manual that mandate the installation of a traffic control device, it is the intent that the provisions of this Manual be standards for traffic control device installation, but not a requirement of installation. Qualified engineers are needed to exercise the engineering judgment inherent in the selection of traffic control devices, just as they are needed to locate and design the roads and streets which the devices complement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">{\u00b6 16} Where ODOT chooses to act, it is under a duty to conform to requirements in the MUTCD; however, the manual leaves some decisions up to the reasonable engineering judgment of ODOT\u2019s agents. <em>Perkins v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 487, 584 N.E.2d 794. The key to determining what type of decision is discretionary is the manual\u2019s use of the word \u201cshould\u201d rather than \u201cshall.\u201d Id. Thus, while the word \u201cshall\u201d establishes a mandatory duty, the word \u201cshould\u201d requires ODOT to use its discretion and engineering judgment. See <em>Jeska v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(Sept. 16, 1999), Franklin App. No. 98AP-1402, 1999 WL 717320. When the manual does not prescribe the duty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>or standard of care, the proper standard is that of a reasonable engineer using accepted practices at the time. <em>Madunicky v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 418, 421, 672 N.E.2d 253, citing <em>Lunar v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 143, 147, 572 N.E.2d 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">{\u00b6 17} Here, ODOT chose to use double yellow lines, rather than concrete barriers, to channel traffic. Regarding that decision, former MUTCD, 7F-12.1 stated: \u201cBarriers may serve an additional function of channelizing traffic; however, their use should be determined by engineering analysis and the protective requirements of the location, not the channelizing needs.\u201d As detailed below, the evidence shows that ODOT carefully considered its options and then chose the channelizing device most likely to minimize risks to motorists using U.S. 30, recognizing that no option was completely risk-free.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">{\u00b6 18} Michael Weiler, ODOT production administrator for the District 3 office in Ashland, testified that U.S. 30 in this area is an expressway and that ODOT had only two options for channelizing traffic through this construction zone: a concrete barrier or the yellow reflective tape. He said the difference between an expressway and a freeway is that an expressway has direct access from the side, intersecting at-grade roadways, and a 60 m.p.h. versus a 65 m.p.h. posted speed limit. Weiler testified that the big consideration on this project was the high volume of truck traffic, which made it crucial to maintain sight distances at intersections.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">{\u00b6 19} Tom Culp, ODOT\u2019s plan-preparation manager, supervised the design team involved with the U.S. 30 project, working within the guidelines <em>given him </em>by Weiler, the requirements of the Location and Design Manual, Standard Drawings and Application Standards, and the MUTCD. He stated that while the federal manual is used on occasion, ODOT did not use it here. Disagreeing with Weiler\u2019s assessment of U.S. 30 as an expressway, Culp stated that this road was not an expressway or a freeway, but a four-lane divided highway with all at-grade intersections. He indicated that concrete barriers were not an option because of the at-grade intersections. The problem, as Culp outlined it, is that people driving with concrete barriers do not expect traffic to be crossing in front of them at intersections and that they cannot see and will not slow down for vehicles entering the intersection. This problem, combined with the inability of drivers approaching from the side to see oncoming traffic on U.S. 30, made concrete barriers a poor choice. Culp stated that he also rejected the use of plastic pylons to separate lanes of traffic on U.S. 30 because they also can present sight-distance problems, because they are not effective in preventing lane changes, and because when they break, they are difficult to replace while still maintaining traffic flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Christopher Runyan, who was at the time ODOT\u2019s assistant director for transportation policy, assisted in the planning of the U.S. 30 construction project. He stated that concrete barriers would have impeded the goal of maintaining a safe traffic situation and that although they would have mitigated certain types of accidents, their use had a negative side that outweighed the positives. The following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">Q. You, in fact, were recommending using double yellow lines. Did you believe that that was safe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">Q. And why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">A. The double yellow lines delineated the traffic. I believe that there are tens of thousands of miles of two-lane highway that are effectively delineated and are traveled safely by trucks and cars every day * * *. So I felt that because of those reasons it would be a safe application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">A. Obviously, concrete barriers being a solid obstruction also obstructs sight distance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">Q. We talked about the balancing of the safety of the public with the convenience to the travelers and you also talked about the options that could apply. Tell me about how you weighed the options and did that balancing in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">A. Well, again, based on the limited information that was available here, I looked at the ADT count, the average daily traffic, which was 12,600. I knew that a two-lane facility could handle that type of volume of traffic. I knew that a two-lane configuration, again, was used all over the state and is safely traversed by all different types of vehicles. I knew that to provide access through and around the construction zone there would be a desire for people to continue to want to use the side roads. And we had, I believe, an effective way to allow that to continue to happen and still have a safe facility out there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">A. * * * And by not providing that sight distance, if concrete barriers were in place, would be a hazard. If we kept the side roads open.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">{\u00b6 21} To contradict ODOT\u2019s opinion, appellants presented expert testimony by A1 Klais, a civil engineer from a Wisconsin safety-engineering consulting firm. Klais opined that because this was a federally funded construction project, ODOT was required to use the federal manual in rendering its design and, therefore, ODOT had to use concrete barriers. In response to ODOT\u2019s evidence regarding sight distances at the intersections, Klais testified that there was 1,200 feet of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>sight distance without any barriers and that drivers would need at least 700 feet of sight distance for a 50 m.p.h. roadway. By Klais\u2019s calculations, concrete barriers would have reduced the sight distance below 700 feet at only one intersection. Klais\u2019s solution to that problem would have been to hold the barrier back on the approach to the intersection and use pylons in the intersection and up to the start of the barrier. Klais further testified that even if the MUTCD controlled this project, ODOT lacked a good reason to avoid concrete barriers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUzU\">[T]he safety considerations for \u2014 and the requirements for installing channelizing devices and barrier on this expressway, are far more important than \u2014 than the need to keep these intersections open, especially given the availability of alternate routes in close proximity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">{\u00b6 22} As we have previously held, however, it is not our role or that of the trial court to second-guess ODOT\u2019s discretionary choice of one reasonable option over another. In <em>Pottenger v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(Dec. 7, 1989), Franklin App. No. 88AP-832, 1989 WL 147998, this court addressed a case in which the plaintiff argued that ODOT had negligently designed an intersection. Affirming the Court of Claims\u2019 conclusion that ODOT was immune because it was exercising its discretionary, planning-type function, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">In the present case, it is true that defendant had several available options which could have been utilized to diminish the possibility of accident of which defendant chose one. Perhaps the implementation of one of the other options would have prevented the accident in this case. However, we will not impose liability upon defendant in exercising its discretion to select one available reasonable option over another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Id., relying, in part, on <em>Winwood. </em>Thus, despite the preference of appellants\u2019 expert, it was within ODOT\u2019s discretion to determine the best alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, despite appellants\u2019 expert\u2019s testimony to the contrary, at least one ODOT official testified that the federal manual did not control Ohio projects. And more important, not only did ODOT\u2019s constructability committee review and approve the project plans, the Federal Highway Administration approved them as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">{\u00b6 24} In short, under the MUTCD, the choice of a channelizing device was a discretionary decision, which ODOT made after significant consideration of the competing risks and benefits. Therefore, ODOT is immune from liability arising from its discretionary decision to use double yellow lines, instead of any other device, to channel traffic through this construction zone. On these grounds, we sustain ODOT\u2019s first assignment of error on its cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">{\u00b6 25} We turn now to ODOT\u2019s second cross-assignment of error, and to ODOT\u2019s implementation of its design, to determine whether ODOT was negligent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>As noted, to prove actionable negligence against ODOT, a plaintiff must demonstrate that ODOT owed a duty to the plaintiff, ODOT breached its duty, and the breach proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries. <em>Cushman, </em>Franklin App. No. 95API07-844. ODOT has a duty to maintain its roadways in a reasonably safe condition for the motoring public; however, ODOT is not an insurer of the safety of its roadways. <em>Leskovac v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1990), 71 Ohio App.3d 22, 26-27, 593 N.E.2d 9; <em>Knickel v. Dept. of Transp. </em>(1976), 49 Ohio App.2d 335, 339, 3 O.O.3d 413, 361 N.E.2d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">{\u00b6 26} According to the trial court, ODOT created an unreasonable risk of harm to motorists because, \u201cdespite having a high-speed, high-volume TLTWO, ODOT chose to forgo the use of any channelizing device and elected to rely on yellow reflective tape, reduced speed, and signage.\u201d The court additionally stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">While ODOT considered a variety of designs which called for the use of channelizing devices, it eventually decided not to implement any of them. The court finds that defendant failed to utilize some method to physically separate adjacent lanes of travel which thereby created an unreasonable risk of harm to motorists utilizing the roadways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The court finally concluded: \u201cODOT\u2019s failure to utilize a channelizing device effectively eliminated the errant driver\u2019s last opportunity to realize that he must remain in his lane of travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">{\u00b6 27} We disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion that ODOT used <em>no </em>channelizing devices. As one ODOT witness testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">A. A channelizing device is anything that gives guidance to a driver of a vehicle to keep them within prescribed boundaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">A. A yellow line is a channelizing device. A white line is a channelizing device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">A. Because they outline boundaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">Neither the Ohio Revised Code nor the Ohio Administrative Code defines the term \u201cchannelizing device.\u201d Nor does the former version of the MUTCD, but it does refer to several types of devices that may be used in channeling traffic. The following statements from the MUTCD suggest that the phrase \u201cchannelizing device\u201d includes yellow reflective tape used in conjunction with signage and speed reduction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-14\">7F-1 Function</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The functions of barricades and channelizing devices are to warn and alert drivers of hazards created by construction or maintenance activities in or near traveled way, and to guide and direct drivers safely past the hazards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">In fulfilling these two functions, barricades and channelizing devices are often required to satisfy two opposing requirements. For example, a channelization installation should be constructed in a substantial manner to provide protection for men working in the roadway. At the same time, however, the channelization devices should provide a smooth and gradual transition which reduces the width of the traveled way, and in this case the channelizing devices should not inflict any severe damage to a vehicle that inadvertently strikes them. The objective should be the development of a traffic control plan which uses a variety of traffic control measures in whatever combination necessary to assure smooth, safe vehicular movement past the work area and at the same time provides maximum safety for the equipment and the workmen on the job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">7F-5 Cone Design</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">Included under this heading are a group of devices whose primary function is the channelization of traffic. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">Hi H: Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">7F-7 Drum Design</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">Drums used for traffic warning or channelization shall be approximately 36\u201d in height and a minimum of 18\u201d in diameter. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-13\">7F-9 Vertical Panel Design</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-14\">Vertical panels used as channelizing or warning devices shall be 8 to 12 inches in width and a minimum of 24 inches in height. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-15\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-16\">7F-11 Delineator Application</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-17\">As used herein, delineators mean all types of reflector units that are capable of reflecting light from either the upper or lower beam of automobile headlamps.

In fact, sections 7F-1 and 7F-12.1 suggest that a barricade and a channelizing device are not one and the same and that while barricades may be used as a channelizing device, they are not the only option available to \u201cwarn and alert drivers of hazards created by construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">{\u00b6 29} In light of both the depositional evidence and the contents of the MUTCD, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that ODOT chose to use no channelizing device whatsoever is erroneous, since the yellow reflective tape was, in fact, a channelizing device.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\"> {\u00b6 30} As we consider whether ODOT breached its duty to the public, we must take into account that this was a construction zone. As we have indicated on several occasions, ODOT cannot guarantee the same level of safety during a highway construction project as it can under normal traffic conditions. <em>Feichtner v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1995), 114 Ohio App.3d 346, 354, 683 N.E.2d 112; <em>Roadway Express, Inc. </em>The test is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, \u201cODOT acted sufficiently to render the highway reasonably safe for the traveling public during the construction project.\u201d <em>Basilone v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(Feb. 13, 2001), Franklin App. No. 00AP-811, 2001 WL 118602, citing <em>Feichtner, </em>and <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1988), 49 Ohio App.3d 129, 551 N.E.2d 215. In our view, the evidence shows that ODOT acted appropriately to render this construction zone reasonably safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">{\u00b6 31} First, there was evidence concerning the implementation of the double yellow lines to channel traffic. Culp testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">A. We wanted to make sure that we had the best center line that was possible, so we chose to use a manufactured tape that\u2019s very bright in daytime and has highly reflective beads on it so that it would be very visible at night. So it was the best material that we could find for the center line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Q. Did you think that that was a reasonably safe option?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">Q. And why did you think that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">A. Well, because of the character of the roadway along U.S. 30 and the fact that drivers are expecting different types of roadway on that section, because it was consistent from one end to the other. In other words, once we crossed drivers over in the two-lane section, then it would stay two-lane until they got out of the construction zone. We wouldn\u2019t be popping back and forth between a section that had barrier or didn\u2019t have barrier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">The intersections were unobstructed, as far as sight distance was concerned, and we installed a system of warning and regulatory signs to tell drivers that they were not to pass, and that we \u2014 we would give them indication that there would be two-way traffic, and instructions at the intersections and the side road approaches to the intersections that we\u2019d changed the character of the roadway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">(\u00b6 32} By using the double yellow lines, ODOT made this construction zone similar to other two-lane rural roadways in Ohio with similar traffic volume. Those two-lane roadways include portions of U.S. 30 that are permanently configured as two-lane roadways \u2014 including roadways Munnal drove just prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">{\u00b6 33} Second, there was significant testimony about the signage ODOT implemented, including notification of a change in the speed limit. Culp testified about the signage a driver would have encountered as he or she approached the construction zone:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">A. As you approach the project going westbound on U.S. 30, we had a \u2014 an informational sign that said \u201cRoad Construction Next Five Miles,\u201d then a series of signs to close the left lane of U.S. 30. There was a \u201cLeft Lane Closed Ahead,\u201d and there was a sign on each side of the westbound lanes, another sign that said \u2014 and these were warning signs \u2014 another sign that said, \u201cWatch For Stopped Traffic,\u201d another pair of signs that said \u201cRoad Construction Ahead One Mile,\u201d another pair of signs that said, \u201cLeft Lane Closed Ahead.\u201d Those were all warning signs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">Then there was a \u201cDo Not Pass\u201d sign, which is a regulatory sign. And then a \u201c50 Mile Per Hour Speed Limit\u201d sign.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">{\u00b6 34} Trooper Michael Vinson, who investigated the crash, testified that as part of his accident report, he drove the portion of the construction zone Munnal had driven just prior to the accident and documented the posted signs and warnings in that stretch of roadway. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>A. The crash occurred in a construction zone. The investigation of the crash revealed that the vehicle, which was a semi that was traveling westbound, traveled completely left of center, striking the other vehicle that was coming eastbound head-on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">Since it was a construction zone and the severity of the crash, I thought it best to go back through and \u2014 and document all the signs and warnings that were there for the traffic on westbound 30 to indicate that it went from a four-lane divided highway to a two-lane non-divided highway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">Q. Okay. And so this list of 21 \u2014 I think there\u2019s about 21 items on here. Those are things that you actually observed at the scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">A. That\u2019s correct. What I did is * * * I went back through * * * and proceeded in a westbound fashion as the driver that was driving the semi would have been, and I documented with photographs, and then also wrote on this what we call an OH-2, a supplement form, all the signs and what they were.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">{\u00b6 35} Trooper Vinson also testified regarding the visibility of those signs on the day of the crash:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">Q. And you mentioned it was a clear day. Did you notice any problems with visibility as you went to the crash site?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">A. No, it was * * * almost a perfect summer evening. It was warm. There was \u2014 you know, there wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t overcast. It was sunny. No rain, fog, or anything like that. It was a clear evening.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">\u25a0 {\u00b6 36} When asked specifically about four signs giving notice of the change in traffic flow, Trooper Vinson testified that \u201call the signs were clearly visible from the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">{\u00b6 37} David Dunlap testified that on the day of the accident, he observed signage that alerted him to the construction zone, and he testified that the signage did not confuse him. Dunlap also testified that the day before the accident, he had driven west through the construction zone, that is, the same direction and route Munnal traveled on the day of the accident. He testified that on that day as he traveled west, he saw no one passing; he saw no one go left of center; and he had no trouble staying on the roadway. In fact, even Munnal testified that he understood what similar roadway signs mean and that they are not confusing to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">{\u00b6 38} Appellants\u2019 own expert, Al Klais, admitted that the double yellow lines and signs were all visible, that they were clues to a driver not to go left of center, and that they should not have been ignored. He also admitted that such pavement markings are commonly used on the nation\u2019s roadways and that he has designed roads using them.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>{\u00b6 39} There was evidence that drivers were passing in the construction zone despite the \u201cNo Passing\u201d signage. However, it did not appear from the evidence that ODOT was aware of that issue before the accident occurred, and in any event, upon learning of the passing problem, ODOT asked the Ohio State Highway Patrol for increased enforcement to minimize passing within the zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">{\u00b6 40} There also was evidence that other accidents had occurred in the construction zone. Specifically, accidents occurred at intersections, and one other head-on collision occurred after the accident at issue here. But even given the evidence concerning these accidents, ODOT officials still considered the construction zone to have been \u201creasonably safe\u201d for the traveling public.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">{\u00b6 41} Culp testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">So we try and balance the risks to the people on the highway itself * * * with the risk of how do the people trying to get across U.S. 30 make that maneuver safely, and we picked the best options available to us for the project, and it turned out to be reasonably safe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">We had 12,000 people a day driving through that project on U.S. 30, in addition to those crossing the roadway, and they did a * * * reasonably good job of negotiating that roadway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">{\u00b6 42} Admittedly, we cannot say with certainty whether any additional or alternate safety devices would have prevented the accident at issue here, or whether those devices would have caused additional or different problems. We can say, however, that a reasonable and alert driver could have driven \u2014 and on a daily basis thousands of drivers did drive \u2014 through this construction zone safely. Given the reflective, double yellow lines, the reduced speed, the high number of clearly visible signs (including the 21 signs Munnal passed just prior to the accident) to alert drivers to the construction and to the change in traffic conditions, and the lack of evidence showing that the number of accidents or other incidents within the zone was unusual or unreasonably high, we find that ODOT acted sufficiently to render the roadway reasonably safe for the traveling public during the construction project. Therefore, we find that ODOT was not negligent in its implementation of the construction project, and we sustain ODOT\u2019s second cross-assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">{\u00b6 43} Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in finding Logan and Munnal contributorily negligent because the evidence supported a finding that Munnal\u2019s sudden unconsciousness caused the truck to move left of center, and Munnal cannot be liable for losing control under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">{\u00b6 44} The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized a sudden-medical-emergency defense, which holds that a driver suddenly stricken by an unantic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ipated period of unconsciousness is not chargeable with negligence for losing control of his vehicle. <em>Roman v. Estate of Gobbo, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 260, 2003-Ohio-3655, 791 N.E.2d 422, reaffirming <em>Lehman v. Haynam </em>(1956), 164 Ohio St. 595, 59 O.O. 5, 133 N.E.2d 97. To qualify for the defense, the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he had no reason to anticipate or foresee the sudden loss of consciousness. <em>Lehman, </em>165 Ohio St. at 600, 59 O.O. 5, 133 N.E.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">{\u00b6 45} Addressing the evidence presented at trial, the Court of Claims determined that Munnal failed to sustain his burden of proof regarding the defense of sudden medical emergency. The court specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">Munnal knew or should have known that over the course of his adult life, he had a propensity to fall asleep at unpredictable times; e.g., when standing up and leaning against a wall, while playing cards, or while conversing at parties. Although Munnal insisted at trial that prior to the accident he had slept well at night and that he usually slept eight hours per night, his fianc\u00e9e, Christine Natale, testified that Munnal slept poorly; that he was restless and jerky while sleeping; and that he slept, on average, only three hours per night. While Munnal testified that he knew when he was tired and that he often needed to pull over and rest for a few hours before he could proceed on his route, he also acknowledged that on at least one occasion he had fallen asleep while driving, only to wake up after his vehicle had gone off the road onto the berm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1\">{\u00b6 46} Disputing this view of the evidence, appellants direct us to the deposition testimony of Robert W. Clark, M.D., a sleep-disorder specialist who evaluated Munnal after the accident. Clark testified that his examination of Munnal indicated that Munnal had a heavy body build, elevated blood pressure, and nasal congestion, and that he was sleepy and lethargic, all common characteristics of someone with sleep apnea. He recommended that Munnal spend the night at the sleep clinic for observation. As a result of his evaluation, Clark diagnosed Munnal with severe obstructive sleep apnea, a serious illness that Clark confirmed can lead to stroke and/or death. Clark testified that many sleep-apnea sufferers engage in automatic behavior during which they can be conducting tasks such as driving while unconscious and that many sufferers do not even realize they have a problem. Clark opined that at the time of the accident, Munnal was unconscious: not \u201cblacked out,\u201d like someone who has fainted, but, rather, engaged in automatic behavior. One of the signs of this, Clark stated, was that Munnal said he did not remember anything about the time period surrounding the accident. Clark stated that distance truck-driving was not the right profession for someone with untreated sleep apnea.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">{\u00b6 47} Munnal himself testified that prior to the accident, he did not know he had sleep apnea, although he had seen a doctor in November 1997 for dizzy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>spells. At that time, he underwent tests that resulted in a diagnosis of a bleeding ulcer and migraine headaches, for which he was on medication. His physician, Barry E. Marged, M.D., testified that a follow-up visit after Munnal had been on the medication showed that he was \u201c90 percent improved\u201d with no more dizziness. Marged testified that Munnal did not give a history of any sleep disorder and that people with sleep apnea often are unaware of any problems. Another doctor, Kevin Mikesell, D.O., testified that he examined Munnal in the emergency room after the accident and that Munnal had reported to him that he had had a coughing spell after which he briefly lost vision and that Munnal had given a history of dizziness.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">{\u00b6 48} According to appellants, this physician testimony all pointed toward a finding that Munnal was not aware of his condition prior to the accident and thus had no reason to anticipate that he would lose consciousness while driving. Appellants specifically object to the court\u2019s apparent reliance upon testimony by Christine Natale that Munnal had previously exhibited signs of sleep apnea because, according to appellants, her testimony does not indicate that she communicated her suspicions to Munnal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">{\u00b6 49} Regardless of exactly what the diagnosis was, and regardless of whether Munnal specifically knew that he had sleep apnea, the record does indicate that Munnal knew he had some sort of health problem that could interfere with his safe operation of a truck. In November 1997, he was having trouble with dizziness, and Marged testified that he told Munnal not to drive until the problem was resolved. In the questionnaire Munnal completed prior to visiting Clark, Munnal answered yes to the question \u201cDo you have trouble staying awake and alert?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">{\u00b6 50} He then checked the following boxes as applying to him: \u201cConstantly fatigued,\u201d \u201cSleepy on night shift,\u201d \u201cPull off road to nap,\u201d \u201cOthers say I\u2019m too sleepy,\u201d \u201cFeel alert but fall asleep without warning,\u201d \u201cTake naps but am still sleepy,\u201d \u201cFall asleep only if inactive,\u201d \u201cShould pull off road to nap but don\u2019t,\u201d \u201cOthers accuse me of falling asleep when I didn\u2019t think I did.\u201d Even considering that some of these answers may have been influenced by the fact that Munnal was filling out the questionnaire after the accident, some of the answers clearly indicate that he had had a problem with fatigue and sleepiness for some time prior to the accident. Other parts of the questionnaire indicate that Munnal would stay home to sleep rather than attend social events and that he had fallen asleep while standing, talking, taking tests, or attending movies and parties. During Natale\u2019s testimony, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">Q. So he knew when he was tired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">A. Uh-huh. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Q. Sometimes, though, you had to tell him \u2014 sometimes he would fall asleep and you\u2019d see him sleeping and he wouldn\u2019t believe you when you told him he was sleeping, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">Q. What would he tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">A. \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping, I\u2019ve just got my eyes closed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">Q. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">A. But he\u2019d be sleeping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">Q. And in those instances, you would tell him he was sleeping and he wouldn\u2019t believe you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\">A. Uh-huh. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">{\u00b6 51} Based upon the contents of the questionnaire and Natale\u2019s testimony, the trial court justifiably concluded that, despite the fact that Munnal\u2019s sleep apnea was not specifically diagnosed until after the accident, Munnal was aware of excessive fatigue and aware of falling asleep at inopportune or unusual moments prior to the accident. Thus, the court did not err in concluding that Munnal failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his loss of consciousness was not foreseeable, and so Munnal did not qualify for the sudden-medical-emergency defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">{\u00b6 52} Because we find that Munnal was responsible for his conduct and could be found negligent for failing to operate his truck in a safe manner, we also conclude that the trial court properly held Logan responsible for Munnal\u2019s acts while in the scope of his employment. With regard to this issue, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-14\">In the instant case, it is undisputed that when Munnal traveled left of center he was driving a tractor-trailer for Logan in the ordinary course of business. Since Munnal\u2019s negligence is not excused, Logan is necessarily liable for the acts of its employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-15\">{\u00b6 53} Thus, we overrule appellants\u2019 second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-16\">{\u00b6 54} ODOT\u2019s third assignment of error on cross-appeal claims that the trial court erred in failing to find Logan liable for negligent hiring and entrustment. The trial court\u2019s decision does not discuss this issue, and we have no indication that the court even considered it. ODOT concedes that if we reverse the trial court on the issue of ODOT\u2019s contributory negligence, we need not reach the issue of Logan\u2019s liability for negligent hiring and entrustment. Given our conclusion that ODOT is not liable and the fact that the trial court never addressed this claim, we overrule this cross-assignment of error as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>{\u00b6 55} Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in finding that the two insurers could not recover ODOT\u2019s proportionate share of the settlements paid to appellants. Because ODOT was not liable, the insurers are not entitled to reimbursement from ODOT, and so we overrule as moot appellants\u2019 first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">{\u00b6 56} ODOT\u2019s fourth assignment of error on cross-appeal alleges that the court erred in using the wrong legal standard in weighing the evidence and apportioning negligence among the parties. Given our disposition of all other assignments of error, we find it unnecessary to reach this question, and so we overrule ODOT\u2019s fourth cross-assignment of error as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">{\u00b6 57} Based upon these considerations, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled as moot, appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is overruled, ODOT\u2019s first and second assignments of error on cross-appeal are sustained, ODOT\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error on cross-appeal are overruled as moot, and the judgment of the Ohio Court of Claims is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded with instructions to enter judgment in accordance with the opinion rendered herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-8\">Brown, P.J., and Lazarus, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-16\">.
