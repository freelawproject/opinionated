Appellant contends that some of the firearm specifications should have been merged, that consecutive sentences were improperly imposed, that his substitute counsel at sentencing was ineffective, and that three counts of complicity to rape should have been merged. As will be more fully explored below, we find merit in two of appellant\u2019s assignments of error on appeal. The record reflects that some of the firearm specifications covered the same acts and transactions and therefore should have been merged. Appellant is also correct that there were errors in the manner in which consecutive sentences were imposed. Finally, there is plain error in the wording of the conspiracy charge in the indictment. None of appellant\u2019s other arguments are persuasive. The judgment of the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part, and the cause is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">{\u00b6 2} On August 21, 2001, Jason Cosa pulled into his driveway and was confronted by appellant, who pushed a gun into Jason\u2019s face and demanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>money. Appellant was 15 years old at the time. The other two passengers in Jason\u2019s car were Christine Hammond and Jason\u2019s grandfather. After the victims handed over their possessions, appellant fled down the driveway and entered a dark, noisy, older-model automobile that was waiting for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">{\u00b6 3} That same evening, appellant approached M.K., a 21-year-old student at Youngstown State University. As she was opening the trunk of her car, appellant put a gun into her stomach and demanded money. Appellant was wearing a mask, but removed the mask during the robbery. He began telling M.K. how beautiful she was and forced her to the passenger side of her car. Appellant entered the driver\u2019s seat and began following a dark, older-model vehicle. M.K. had noticed this vehicle stopping nearby prior to the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">{\u00b6 4} As they drove, appellant continued commenting on M.K\u2019s beauty. He demanded that she turn over any jewelry, and she complied. M.K. asked to be released, but appellant refused. Soon afterward, appellant stopped the car and codefendant Chaz Bunch entered M.K.\u2019s car through the back door. Bunch put a gun to M.K\u2019s head and demanded money. Throughout the ordeal M.K. pleaded with them not to kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">{\u00b6 5} As they continued to follow the other vehicle, appellant inserted his fingers into M.K.\u2019s vagina several times. At this point, M.K. tried to memorize the license plate of the dark vehicle they were following, which she remembered as CTJ 6423.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">{\u00b6 6} The cars turned down a dead-end street and stopped on a gravel lot. Bunch and appellant ordered M.K. to get out of the car and pointed their guns at her. They grabbed her by the hair and forced their penises into her mouth, taking turns holding her head and orally raping her. This was repeated two or three times. Again M.K. pleaded that they not kill her, and they then took M.K. to the trunk of her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">{\u00b6 7} Once at the trunk, codefendant Jamar Callier began going through M.K\u2019s possessions in the car. Some items taken were a green Nike bag, tennis shoes, clothes, a bag from Old Navy, jewelry, and a purse. As M.K. faced the trunk of her car, appellant and Bunch told her to pull her pants down and turn around. M.K. resisted, and told her attackers she was pregnant, in an attempt to avoid being raped again. Appellant and Bunch pushed her, face forward, against the car and one of them anally raped her. Bunch then put his gun into her back and forced her to the front of the ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">{\u00b6 8} Bunch threw M.K. to the ground. While she was on the ground, appellant and Bunch took turns vaginally and orally raping her. While one was vaginally raping her, the other would perform an oral rape, and vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>{\u00b6 9} At some point, codefendant Callier came over and forced them to stop. Bunch stated that he wanted to kill her, but Callier would not let him. Appellant put his gun in M.K.\u2019s mouth and told her, \u201cSince you were so good, I won\u2019t kill you.\u201d Callier helped M.K. back into her car. They threatened to kill her and her family if she told anyone what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">{\u00b6 10} M.K. drove to the home of her boyfriend\u2019s uncle and began screaming out the license plate number of the car she had seen. It later was discovered that she had inverted two numbers; the license plate was actually CTJ6243. M.K. was immediately taken to the hospital, and the Youngstown Police Department was contacted. Officer Colleen Lynch was at the hospital on an unrelated call and followed M.K. into the emergency room. She observed bruises, scrapes, and swelling. A sexual-assault nurse completed a rape examination of M.K\u2019s mouth, vagina, and rectum and recorded several injuries including bruises, bite marks, scratches, and abrasions and injuries to her vagina and anus.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">{\u00b6 11} After leaving the scene of the crime, the assailants went to a Dairy Mart on Mahoning Avenue. Officer Anthony Vitullo had heard a broadcast of the license plate of the suspects\u2019 vehicle (with two numbers transposed) and noticed a similar vehicle in the Dairy Mart parking lot. Officer Vitullo observed and followed the vehicle, which soon ran a stop sign and pulled into a driveway on Edwards Street in Youngstown. Codefendant Bunch, who was driving, stopped the car and ran. Officer Vitullo radioed for backup assistance and arrested the other occupants of the car. Items found in the car included M.K\u2019s bag from Old Navy, a stuffed animal, a leather purse, tennis shoes, female clothing, a vehicle-registration card, and a credit-union card belonging to victim Jason Cosa, a .38-caliber handgun, a black face mask, blue and black caps, bullets, and shotgun shells. Police also found a piece of paper in the pocket of appellant\u2019s pants that stated \u201cProperty of [M.K.].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">{\u00b6 12} After the police took appellant into custody, juvenile proceedings were initiated against him in the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division. The case was transferred to the general division, and a 12-count complaint, with 11 firearm specifications, was filed against appellant on May 16, 2002. The counts included three counts of aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), three counts of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), three counts of complicity to rape in violation of R.C. 2923.03(A)(2) and 2907.02(A)(2), one count of kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2923.01(A)(1) and 2911.01(A)(1), and one count of aggravated menacing in violation of R.C. 2903.21(A). Counts one through 11 were first-degree felonies, count 12 was a first-degree misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>{\u00b6 13} On September 11, 2002, the trial court joined appellant\u2019s case with that of the other three codefendants. Trial began on September 23, 2002. The jury-found appellant guilty on all 12 counts on October 2, 2002. Sentencing was scheduled for October 23, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">{\u00b6 14} On October 17, 2002, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion to continue the sentencing hearing due to personal matters. The court overruled the motion on October 21, 2002. Appellant was represented at the sentencing hearing by another attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">{\u00b6 15} On October 29, 2002, the trial court filed its judgment. The court sentenced appellant to the maximum prison term for each count, to be served consecutively (except for the misdemeanor menacing charge, which was to be served concurrently with the other sentences). The court also sentenced appellant to 11 firearm-specification penalties, also to be served consecutively. The aggregate sentence amounted to 141 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant filed this timely appeal on November 20, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant presents four assignments of error and one supplemental assignment of error in this appeal. They will be presented slightly out of order to aid our analysis. There is also a preliminary matter concerning the conspiraey-to-commit-aggravated-robbery charge that we must address prior to reviewing appellant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE INDICTMENT FOR THE CHARGE OF CONSPIRACY</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">{\u00b6 18} On review of appellant\u2019s assignments of error, along with our review of the appeals submitted by appellant\u2019s codefendants, it was brought to our attention that the portion of the indictment dealing with the appellant\u2019s conspiracy charge appeared to be defective in light of the holding in <em>State v. Childs </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 194, 724 N.E.2d 781. In <em>Childs, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court was asked to determine \u201cwhether an indictment for conspiracy pursuant to R.C. 2923.01, which fails to allege at least one specific, substantial, overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, is fatally defective for such failure.\u201d Id. at 197, 724 N.E.2d 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2923.01 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(B) No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a <em>substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged </em>and proved to have been done by the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the accused\u2019s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">{\u00b6 21} <em>Childs </em>acknowledged that an indictment is usually sufficient when it tracks the language of the criminal statute that gives rise to the charge. Id. at 199, 724 N.E.2d 781. This is not the case, however, when charging a defendant with conspiracy. In a conspiracy charge, as defined by R.C. 2923.01(B), the criminal statute itself requires that a \u201csubstantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy <em>is alleged </em>and proved.\u201d (Emphasis added.) According to <em>Childs, </em>a specific substantial overt act must be set forth in the indictment itself for the conspiracy charge to be valid. Id. In <em>Childs </em>the Supreme Court held as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c[W]hile the state may satisfy its burden by reciting the exact words of a criminal statute in an indictment for some offenses, an indictment for conspiracy to commit aggravated trafficking pursuant to R.C. 2923.01 must allege some specific, substantial, overt act performed in furtherance of the conspiracy. The state\u2019s failure to allege a specific, substantial, overt act committed in furtherance of the conspiracy in count fourteen of the indictment against Childs renders the indictment invalid.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">{\u00b6 23} In the instant case, the conspiracy charge in the indictment merely tracks the language of the conspiracy statute rather than setting forth specific facts that describe substantial, overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, as required by R.C. 2923.01(B) and <em>Childs. </em>Therefore, the indictment is insufficient to charge appellant with conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery. We have been forced to reach this same conclusion in the appeals of codefendants Bunch and Bundy. Thus, we must vacate appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence for conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery and dismiss count 11 of the indictment. We also vacate and dismiss the concomitant firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">{\u00b6 24} The Rules of Criminal Procedure contemplate the retrial of a defendant when a court grants a motion to dismiss an indictment based on defects therein. See, e.g., <em>State v. Broughton </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 253, 266, 581 N.E.2d 541; <em>State v. Duncan, </em>154 Ohio App.3d 254, 2003-Ohio-4695, 796 N.E.2d 1006; <em>State v. Childs </em>(Sept. 11, 1998), 2nd Dist. No. 16325, 1998 WL 598102. For example, Crim.R. 12(J) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cIf the court grants a motion to dismiss based on a defect in the institution of the prosecution or in the indictment, information, or complaint, it may also order that the defendant be held in custody or that the defendant\u2019s bail be continued for a specified time not exceeding fourteen days, pending the filing of a new indictment, information, or complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>{\u00b6 26} If the state so chooses, it may refile the conspiracy charge against appellant, provided that the new indictment is consistent with the requirements explained in <em>Childs </em>and in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe court erred when it refused to merge firearm specification [sic] which arose out of a single transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">{\u00b6 28} At the sentencing hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel requested that the court merge all 11 firearm specifications into two, based on counsel\u2019s understanding of the requirements of the sentencing statutes. The court at one point determined that nine of the firearm specifications were committed with separate animus and would be imposed individually. The court subsequently sentenced appellant to all 11 firearm specifications, to be served consecutively, again finding that the specifications were committed with separate animus and were not eligible to be merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">{\u00b6 29} Again, appellant was charged with 11 firearm specifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.145(A), which requires an indictment to state that \u201cthe offender had a firearm on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control while committing the offense and displayed the firearm, brandished the firearm, indicated that the offender possessed the firearm, or used it to facilitate the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">{\u00b6 30} R.C. 2929.14(D)(l)(a)(ii) imposes a mandatory three-year prison term when a defendant is convicted of the firearm specification in R.C. 2941.145.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">{\u00b6 31} R.C. 2929.14(E)(1)(a) requires that convictions for firearm specifications be served consecutively to any other convictions imposed on the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cSubject to division (E)(1)(b) of this section, if a mandatory prison term is imposed upon an offender pursuant to division (D)(1)(a) of this section for having a firearm on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control while committing a felony, if a mandatory prison term is imposed upon an offender pursuant to division (D)(1)(c) of this section for committing a felony specified in that division by discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle, or if both types of mandatory prison terms are imposed, the offender shall serve any mandatory prison term imposed under either division consecutively to any other mandatory prison term imposed under either division or under division (D)(1)(d) of this section, consecutively to and prior to any prison term imposed for the underlying felony pursuant to division (A), (D)(2), or (D)(3) of this section or any other section of the Revised Code, and consecutively to any other prison term or mandatory prison term previously or subsequently imposed upon the offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Appellant correctly argues that pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(D)(1)(b), a court is not permitted to impose more than one sentence for multiple firearm specifications if the specifications refer to the same criminal act or transaction:</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cIf a court imposes a prison term on an offender under division (D)(1)(a) of this section, the prison term shall not be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20, section 2967.193, or any other provision of Chapter 2967. or Chapter 5120. of the Revised Code. <em>A court shall not impose more than one prison term on an offender </em>under division (D)(1)(a) of this section <em>for felonies committed as part of the same act or transaction.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">{\u00b6 35} Appellant contends that it is irrelevant whether the firearm specifications refer to acts that were committed with separate animus and that the trial court failed to consider which counts were part of the same criminal act or transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\"> {\u00b6 36} The issue that appellant raises is a mixed issue of law and fact. Appellant argues that the trial court used the wrong legal standard, but also argues that the court erred in finding that there was enough evidence to support the imposition of 11 consecutive firearm-specification penalties. When the record presents a mixed issue of law and fact, a reviewing court should uphold the trial court\u2019s findings of fact unless those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 548, 552, 679 N.E.2d 276. Any purely legal issues, and the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts, are subject to de novo review. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cTransaction,\u201d as used in the firearm specification statutes, has been defined as \u201ca series of continuous acts bound together by time, space and purpose, and directed toward a single objective.\u201d <em>State v. Wills </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 690, 691, 635 N.E.2d 370 (reviewing former R.C. 2929.71(B), containing substantially similar language to R.C. 2929.14(D)(1)(b)). Other courts have stated that a \u201ctransaction\u201d is a \u201csingle criminal adventure.\u201d <em>State v. Stilson </em>(Dec. 13, 1996), 4th Dist. No. 95CA28, 1996 WL 735246. The First District Court of Appeals has adopted the following definition: \u201c \u2018a series of criminal offenses which develop from a single criminal adventure, bearing a logical relationship to one another, and bound together by time, space, and purpose directed toward a single objective.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Godfrey </em>(Aug. 14, 1998), 1st Dist. Nos. C-970531 and C-970577, 1998 WL 472021, quoting <em>State v. Crawford </em>(Feb. 6, 1986), 10th Dist. No. 85AP-324, 1986 WL 1715.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cAnimus,\u201d in contrast, has been described as \u201cpurpose, intent, or motive.\u201d <em>Newark v. Vazirani </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 81, 84, 549 N.E.2d 520. It has also been defined as \u201cimmediate motive.\u201d <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 131, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>{\u00b6 39} Whether crimes were committed with separate animus most often arises when a court is considering an allied offense of similar import as set forth in R.C. 2941.25:</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a <em>separate animus </em>as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">{\u00b642} Most appellate courts have held that the test for merging firearm specifications found in R.C. 2929.14(D)(1)(b) is distinct from the \u201cseparate animus\u201d test for determining allied offenses of similar import as found in R.C. 2941.25(B). For example, the Eleventh District Court of Appeals held that the Ohio Supreme Court, in <em>Wills, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 690, 635 N.E.2d 370, impliedly rejected the \u201cseparate animus\u201d test in reference to merging firearm specifications. <em>State v. Salinas </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 379, 388, 706 N.E.2d 381. The Second and Fourth District Courts of Appeals have held that the test for merging firearm specifications is a broader concept than the \u201cseparate animus\u201d test found in R.C. 2941.25(B). <em>State v. Walker </em>(June 30, 2000), 2nd Dist. No. 17678, 2000 WL 873222; <em>State v. White </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 550, 554, 594 N.E.2d 1087. The Ninth and Tenth District Courts of Appeals have also concluded that the \u201cseparate animus\u201d test does not apply when determining whether firearm specifications should merge. <em>State v. Brown, </em>(Aug. 19, 1998), 9th Dist. No. 18591, 1998 WL 487039; <em>State v. Jones </em>(Mar. 18, 1999), 10th Dist. No. 98AP-639, 1999 WL 155703.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">{\u00b6 43} The only appellate court that has consistently used the \u201cseparate animus\u201d test with respect to firearm specifications is the Twelfth District. See <em>State v. Kehoe </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 591, 617, 729 N.E.2d 431; <em>State v. Throckmorton </em>(May 15, 2000), 12th Dist. No. CA99-08-081, 2000 WL 628210.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">{\u00b6 44} This court has not explicitly ruled on this issue. Furthermore, we have not found a case in which we applied the separate-animus test when reviewing the merger of firearm specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">{\u00b6 45} In one fairly recent case, we held that firearm specifications for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery should have merged because the defendant had one overall common objective, which was to commit suicide by inducing the police to shoot him. <em>State v. Burch </em>(Mar. 15, 2000), 7th Dist. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>97-JE-57, 2000 WL 288607. On the other hand, in <em>State v. Makone </em>(Aug. 8, 1996), 7th Dist. No. 92 CA 27, 1996 WL 451373, we held that an aggravated murder and an aggravated robbery had no common objective, and affirmed the imposition of two separate firearm specifications. In both cases, though, our focus was on the defendant\u2019s overall criminal objectives, not on the specific animus for each crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">{\u00b6 46} The caselaw on this subject indicates that it would be much too simple to merely impose separate penalties for firearm specifications because the defendant had separate animus for each corresponding criminal act. Whether or not a defendant had a common purpose or objective in committing multiple crimes is broader than the concept of animus and is also highly dependent on the factual circumstances of each case. Therefore, appellant is correct that the trial court relied on the wrong legal standard when imposing separate penalties for every gun specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">{\u00b6 47} Even if the trial court used the wrong legal standard, appellee argues, the aggravated robbery of two separate victims constitutes two separate criminal transactions and warrants separate penalties for the corresponding firearm specifications, citing <em>Wills, </em>supra, 69 Ohio St.3d at 691, 635 N.E.2d 370. Appellee contends that appellant held a gun to Jason Cosa\u2019s face, with the objective of robbing Jason, and then turned his attention to Christine Hammond, with the objective of robbing her. Appellee argues that appellant could have turned and fled after robbing Jason, but did not, and that this failure to flee indicates a distinct purpose to commit a second and distinct robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">{\u00b6 48} Appellee\u2019s argument is not persuasive, because it is nothing more than an application of the separate-animus test discussed earlier. While it is certainly possible that the presence of two victims could mean two different criminal objectives, the factual context of the crime must support such a conclusion. In the instant case, Jason\u2019s testimony indicated that a gunman ran up the driveway, pointed a gun at him, and demanded money from everyone in Jason\u2019s car. Christine testified that she was sitting in the back of Jason\u2019s car and saw the gunman get out of a dark car, run up Jason\u2019s driveway, and demand money from her, from Jason, and from Jason\u2019s grandfather (who was also in the car). The entire incident took place in approximately 90 seconds. There is no indication of any purpose other than a robbery of the passengers in Jason\u2019s car. Therefore, the trial court should have imposed only one three-year prison term for the charges stemming from the robbery of Jason and Christine. Appellant may be sentenced to only one prison term for the combined firearm specifications contained in counts two and three of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>{\u00b6 49} Appellee also contends that each of the crimes against M.K. had a separate purpose and objective, warranting separate firearm-specification penalties for each crime. Appellee argues that the objective of kidnapping is to restrict a person\u2019s freedom, that the objective of rape is to force sexual contact on another person, and that the objective of complicity to rape is to aid and abet another to commit rape. Furthermore, appellee contends that each count of rape and complicity to rape had a separate objective. Appellee submits that the objective of oral rape is different from anal rape and digital vaginal rape. Appellee asserts that appellant raped M.K. at least three times and that each time appellant had a specific objective to commit that particular rape. Appellee also contends that each time he assisted codefendant Bunch in raping M.K., appellant had a separate objective to specifically assist Bunch in committing that specific act of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">{\u00b6 50} Using appellee\u2019s reasoning, an \u201cact or transaction\u201d justifying multiple firearm specifications is no different than proving that separate crimes have been committed. Appellee\u2019s argument shows only that nine punishable crimes were committed against M.K. The evidence, though, demonstrates only three overall objectives in appellant\u2019s rampage against M.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">{\u00b6 51} Appellant first approached M.K. to rob her. At some point during the robbery, appellant began staring at M.K. and complimenting her. Appellant then told her to get into her car, and they started following the car being driven by the other assailants. At this point, the objective appears to have changed from robbery to kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">{\u00b6 52} While appellant was driving M.K\u2019s car, he carried on a conversation with her and told her that she was beautiful. Appellant carried on this type of conversation for some time. At some point in the car, appellant began raping M.K. by inserting his fingers into her vagina. From this point on, appellant\u2019s objective centers on the multiple rape crimes committed against M.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">{\u00b6 53} These facts give rise to only three criminal transactions for purposes of firearm specifications: the robbery, the kidnapping, and the rape crimes. Furthermore, although appellant was also convicted of three counts of complicity to rape, the complicity occurred during the same time period and as part of the same transaction as the rape crimes for which appellant was convicted. In fact, it was appellant\u2019s acts of rape that aided and abetted, in part, codefendant Bunch in his commission of separate rape crimes against M.K. The record indicates that appellant\u2019s acts of rape and acts of complicity to rape were part of the same criminal transaction and so do not give rise to additional prison terms for the firearm specifications attached to the three complicity charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">{\u00b6 54} Based on the evidence in the record, the trial court should have imposed only three prison terms for the gun specifications attached to the crimes relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>to M.K., which consist of one count of aggravated robbery, three counts of rape, three counts of complicity to rape, and one count of kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">{\u00b6 55} Based on the aforementioned reasoning, we sustain appellant\u2019s first assignment of error in part. Upon remand for resentencing, the trial court is limited to imposing, at most, one prison term for the combined firearm specifications contained in counts two and three of the indictment (relating to the aggravated robbery of Christine Hammond and Jason Cosa), and three separate prison terms for the combined firearm specifications in counts one, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten (relating to the aggravated robbery, rape, conspiracy to rape, and kidnapping of M.K.). We have already determined that count 11 must be dismissed, and it does not play a role in our analysis of this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cThe court erred when it sentenced appellant to consecutive sentences without making the necessary finding pursuant to O.R.C. 2929.14(E)(4)(a)(b)(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">{\u00b6 57} Appellant argues that consecutive sentences may only be imposed if the trial court follows the requirements of R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), which states (in the version of the statute in effect at the time appellant\u2019s crimes were committed):</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c(4) If multiple prison terms are imposed on an offender for convictions of multiple offenses, the court may require the offender to serve the prison terms consecutively if the court finds that the consecutive service is necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender and that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public, and if the court also finds any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c(a) The offender committed the multiple offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under post-release control for a prior offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c(b) The harm caused by the multiple offenses was so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of a single course of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c(c) The offender\u2019s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender.\u201d Am.Sub.S.B. No. 222, eff. 3-22-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">{\u00b6 62} Appellant asserts that the trial court must make all of the findings required by R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and that failure to make those findings requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>that the sentence be vacated and the case remanded for a new sentencing hearing. Appellant contends that the trial court failed to make any of the three required findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">{\u00b6 63} Appellant correctly states the law regarding consecutive sentences. According to the recent case of <em>State v. Comer, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-4165, 793 N.E.2d 473, a trial court must make the required findings on the record at the sentencing hearing in order to properly impose consecutive sentences pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(E)(4). Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. The trial court must also give reasons to support those findings, as required by R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(c). As stated in <em>Comer:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cWhile consecutive sentences are permissible under the law, a trial court must clearly align each rationale with the specific finding to support its decision to impose consecutive sentences. These findings and reasons must be articulated by the trial court so an appellate court can conduct a meaningful review of the sentencing decision.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">{\u00b6 65} R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) requires the trial court to make the following four findings and to give reasons supporting each finding in order to properly impose consecutive prison sentences. The court must find that:</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">{\u00b6 66} (1) Consecutive terms are necessary to:</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">{\u00b6 67} (a) protect the public from future crime; or</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">{\u00b6 68} (b) punish the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">{\u00b6 69} (2) Consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">{\u00b6 70} (3) Consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the danger the offender poses to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">{\u00b6 71} (4) The court must make at least one of the following findings as well:</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">{\u00b6 72} (a) the offender committed the multiple offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing; or</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">{\u00b6 73} (b) the offender committed the multiple offense while under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code; or</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">{\u00b6 74} (c) the offender committed the multiple offense while under postrelease control for a prior offense; or</p>\n<p id=\"b829-17\">{\u00b6 75} (d) the harm caused by the multiple offenses was so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of a single course of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct; or</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>{\u00b6 76} (e) the offender\u2019s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">{\u00b6 77} The court must also provide reasons to support every finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">{\u00b6 78} The trial court made some, but not all, of the findings required by R.C. 2929.14(E)(4). The trial court clearly stated that consecutive terms \u201care necessary to punish you and to protect the public,\u201d which satisfies the first required finding. The sentencing record, though, does not contain specific reasons that correspond to the stated finding. Although the court did give many reasons to support its overall sentence, the reasons do not align with the findings made by the court. Under <em>Comer, </em>this is the standard we are now forced to apply when determining whether consecutive sentences were properly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">{\u00b6 79} The trial court did not clearly make the second and third required findings outlined in R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), namely, that consecutive sentences are proportionate to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and proportionate to the danger that the offender poses to the public. The trial court did make one of the five possible remaining findings, namely, that the harm cause by the crimes \u201cis so great and unusual, that a single term does not adequately reflect the seriousness of your conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">{\u00b6 80} In some sense, the findings required by R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) overlap with each other and are redundant. See <em>State v. Kimbrough </em>(Mar. 2, 2000), 8th Dist. Nos. 75642, 75643, and 75644, 2000 WL 235760. For example, if the court finds that \u201cconsecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender,\u201d then it has also found that consecutive sentences are \u201cnecessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender.\u201d The statute lists these as two separate findings, when one finding clearly encompasses the other. There is also a high degree of overlap between the finding that \u201cconsecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct\u201d and the finding that \u201cno single prison term * * * adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct.\u201d Due to this overlap in the language of the statute, it is theoretically possible for a trial court to make the appropriate findings, even without tracking the precise language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">{\u00b6 81} Once again, though, the trial court did not align its findings with the reasons supporting the findings as required by <em>Comer. </em>When a trial court does not make its findings in the form provided by R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), it makes it doubly difficult for the court to align the findings with supporting reasons, as required by statute. We have previously held that the trial court is not required to recite the exact language of R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) when imposing consecutive sentences, as if the statutory language was some sort of magic or talismanic formula. <em>State v. Howard, </em>7th Dist. No. 02 BA 9, 2003-Ohio-804, 2003 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>403364. Now, in light of the recent <em>Comer </em>decision, it is becoming increasing difficult to affirm the imposition of consecutive sentences when the trial court does not mimic the language and format of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">{\u00b6 82} We are aware that the trial court in this case rendered its sentence approximately ten months prior to the release of the <em>Comer </em>decision. Nevertheless, <em>Comer </em>is retrospective in its application, in keeping with the rule set forth in <em>Peerless Elec. Co. v. Bowers </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 209, 210, 57 O.O. 411, 129 N.E.2d 467, that \u201ca decision of a court of supreme jurisdiction overruling a former decision is retrospective in its operation, and the effect is not that the former was bad law, but that it never was the law.\u201d See, also, <em>State v. Evans </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 185, 186, 61 O.O.2d 422, 291 N.E.2d 466. Although the trial court\u2019s sentence may have been valid under former interpretations of R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), it does not meet the current requirements of the statute as interpreted by <em>Comer. </em>For this reason, we must sustain appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 4</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cThe trial court erred when it failed to merge counts seven, eight, and nine for the purpose of sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">{\u00b6 84} Appellant contends that the three counts of complicity to rape contained in counts seven, eight, and nine constituted one continuous course of action and should not have been divided into three separate crimes. Appellant concedes that his own direct actions qualified as separate acts of oral, anal, and vaginal rape. Appellant asserts, though, that his complicity in the similar acts of rape committed by codefendant Bunch was only one act of complicity, regardless of how many times Bunch raped M.K. Appellant does not present any further explanation of his position, other than a brief mention that aiding and abetting another to commit multiple acts of rape should be merged as allied offenses of similar import under R.C. 2941.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">{\u00b6 85} Appellee contends that this argument has been waived because no objection was made at the sentencing hearing concerning allied offenses of similar import. Appellee is correct that questions regarding allied offenses of similar import are waived if not properly raised before the trial court. <em>State v. Comen </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 206, 211, 553 N.E.2d 640. Appellant, though, later asserts that his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this issue at trial. For this reason, we need to review appellant\u2019s assignment of error because our answer may affect our review of one of the remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">{\u00b6 86} As stated earlier, allied offenses of similar import are governed by R.C. 2941.25, which provides a two-tiered analysis for determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>whether multiple punishments can be imposed for similar crimes. First, the elements of the crime are compared in the abstract, to see if the elements are such that commission of one offense will necessarily result in the commission of the other. <em>State v. Rance </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 632, 636, 710 N.E.2d 699. Second, if the crimes do overlap so as to be allied offenses of similar import, a court must determine whether the crimes were committed separately or with separate animus. If the crimes were committed separately or with separate animus, multiple punishments may be imposed for each separate crime. <em>State v. Jones </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 12, 14, 676 N.E.2d 80. The overall facts and circumstances of a case, rather than any specific factor, determine whether crimes were committed with separate animus. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">{\u00b6 87} Both appellant and appellee argue that the three counts of complicity to rape contain the same elements and are allied offenses. This is not technically correct, because they are actually the same offenses, not allied offenses. Nevertheless, whether the crimes are exactly the same or are allied offenses of similar import, the remaining issue to be resolved under R.C. 2941.25(B) is whether the crimes were committed separately or with separate animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">{\u00b6 88} Appellant admits that oral rape is distinct from anal rape, which is also distinct from vaginal rape. It is well-settled law that entry into separate orifices, or entry with separate body parts, constitutes separate acts of rape. <em>State v. Barnes </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 13, 14, 22 O.O.3d 126, 427 N.E.2d 517; <em>State v. Duffey </em>(Nov. 13, 1990), 7th Dist. No. 90-B-1, 1990 WL 176818. As stated in <em>Barnes:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">{\u00b6 89} \u201c \u2018Repeated acts of forcible sexual intercourse are not to be construed as a roll of thunder, \u2014 an echo of a single sound rebounding until attenuated. One should not be allowed to take advantage of the fact that he has already committed one sexual assault on the victim and thereby be permitted to commit further assaults on the same person with no risk of further punishment for each assault committed. Each act is a further denigration of the victim\u2019s integrity and a further danger to the victim.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 19, 22 O.O.3d 126, 427 N.E.2d 517 (Celebrezze, J., concurring), quoting <em>Harrell v. State </em>(1979), 88 Wis.2d 546, 565, 277 N.W.2d 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">{\u00b6 90} Appellant was charged with three counts of aiding and abetting another in the rape of M.K. in violation of R.C. 2923.03(A)(2) (the complicity statute) and R.C. 2907.02(A)(2) (the rape statute). This aiding and abetting consisted of holding M.K\u2019s head while another person orally raped her, holding her against her car while another person anally raped her, pointing a gun at her while another person raped her, orally raping her to aid another in vaginal rape, and vaginally raping her to aid another in oral rape. For the same reasons set forth in <em>Barnes, </em>supra, a person should not be permitted to aid another in committing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>one denigration after another against a person simply because the rape crimes are committed in rapid succession. Each act appellant committed to aid a codefendant in another act of rape, whether it be a forceful grab of the head, a shove to the car, a push to ground, or the wave of a gun, furthered each successive criminal act committed against M.K. and warranted its own separate criminal punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">{\u00b6 91} For these reasons, we find appellant\u2019s reasoning unpersuasive, and we overrule his fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to continue the sentencing hearing and denied appellant effective assistance of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">{\u00b6 93} Appellant argues that the trial court should have sustained counsel\u2019s motion for a continuance of the sentencing hearing. The jury rendered its verdict on October 2, 2002, and the sentencing hearing was scheduled for October 23, 2002. On October 17, 2002, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion to continue the sentencing hearing because he was attending to the needs of his newborn child in the neonatal intensive care unit of Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s Hospital in Cleveland. The court overruled the motion, without additional comment or explanation, on October 21, 2002. Appellant was represented at the sentencing hearing by another attorney. The record of the sentencing hearing indicates that this attorney had only 24 hours to review the case prior to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">{\u00b6 94} The error alleged by appellant in this assignment of error is not clear. Appellant presents the error as one made by the trial court (possibly a due-process error in denying the continuance), but cites only one case, <em>McMann v. Richardson </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763, which deals with ineffective assistance of counsel. Appellee has approached this assignment of error as if appellant is arguing ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing, and this approach appears to be the most reasonable one for us to take in reviewing the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">{\u00b6 95} The law governing ineffective assistance of counsel was succinctly summarized in <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 144, 25 OBR 190, 495 N.E.2d 407:</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">{\u00b6 96} \u201cIn <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674], the court determined the standard to be used in reviewing claims of ineffectiveness. \u2018The benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u2019 Id. at 686 [104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674], The court proceeded to devise a two-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>part test for reviewing claims of ineffectiveness: \u2018A convicted defendant\u2019s claim that counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction or death sentence has two components. First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\u2019 Id. at 687 [104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674]. This court in <em>State v. Lytle </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 391 [2 O.O.3d 495, 358 N.E.2d 623], devised a substantially similar test: \u201cWhen considering an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, a two-step process is usually employed. First, there must be a determination as to whether there has been a substantial violation of any of defense counsel\u2019s essential duties to his client. Next * * * there must be a determination as to whether the defense was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\u2019 Id. at 396-397 [2 O.O.3d 495, 358 N.E.2d 623].\u201d Id. at 147-148, 25 OBR 190, 495 N.E.2d 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">{\u00b6 97} Appellant first contends that his attorney failed to make an effective argument as to why some or all of the firearm specifications should have been merged. We have already addressed and corrected the error raised in appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, dealing with the firearm specifications. It would be difficult to see how appellant could have been prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s actions at the sentencing hearing when the matter was preserved for review and corrected on appeal. Counsel properly objected to multiple firearm specifications, and his actions do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">{\u00b6 98} Appellant also argues that his counsel should have made a more effective argument to convince the trial judge to merge the sentences for counts seven, eight, and nine (complicity to rape). As explained in the analysis of assignment of error four above, the trial court did not err in imposing separate sentences for counts seven, eight, and nine, because each separate count of complicity to rape was committed with separate animus and could be separately punished. Counsel did not err by failing to assert at trial what would have been erroneous legal arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">{\u00b6 99} Appellant has failed to show that his counsel was ineffective or that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s actions, and therefore the third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>SUPPLEMENTAL ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">{\u00b6 100} \u201cThe trial court erred when it sentenced appellant, who had never been to prison to maximum terms of imprisonment. The court deprived appellant of his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">{\u00b6 101} On November 2, 2004, appellant filed a supplemental assignment of error. There is no indication that appellant sought leave from this court to file and assert this additional assignment of error, which was filed long after the briefs were submitted for this appeal. Appellant is now attempting to raise an issue relating to the recent United States Supreme Court case of <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, which was decided on June 24, 2004. <em>Blakely </em>held that part of Washington\u2019s felony sentencing scheme violated the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial because it allowed the trial judge to impose an exceptional sentence based on facts that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by a jury. Appellant argues that the holding in <em>Blakely </em>prevented the trial court from imposing any sentence other than the minimum possible sentence under Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">{\u00b6 102} This court recently held that a criminal defendant could not raise a <em>Blakely </em>argument on appeal if it had not first been raised at the trial court level:</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">{\u00b6 103} \u201cAny sentencing challenge available to the defendant under <em>Blakely </em>is waived, because he did not object at trial to what he now contends is a violation of his constitutional right to a jury trial. See, e.g., <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 123, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E.2d 277; <em>State v. Ireson </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 235, 240, 594 N.E.2d 165; cf. <em>Gibson v. Meadow Gold Dairy </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 201, 204, 724 N.E.2d 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">{\u00b6 104} \u201cThe fact that <em>Blakely </em>was decided after Appellant had submitted his brief on appeal, and after oral argument had been held, is not determinative in our analysis. The issues that were under review in <em>Blakely </em>were previously reviewed many times by the United States Supreme Court and by legions of lower federal court and state court decisions. <em>Blakely </em>is only the most recent progeny of a line of cases that includes the seminal case of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to firearm possession charges as part of a plea agreement. During sentencing, the trial court determined that the crime was committed with the purpose to intimidate because of race, in violation of New Jersey\u2019s hate-crime statute. The finding by the trial court elevated the penalty from a maximum of 10 years to a period of 10 to 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">{\u00b6 105} <em>\u201cApprendi </em>held that, \u2018it is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed. It is equally clear that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 Id. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435; see also <em>Ring v. Arizona </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556; <em>Harris v. United States </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">{\u00b6 106} \u201cThe argument that Appellant is now attempting to assert under the authority of <em>Blakely </em>is essentially the same argument raised in <em>Apprendi. </em>The <em>Apprendi </em>case was decided on June 26, 2000, long before Appellant was convicted and sentenced * * *. <em>Apprendi </em>was decided three and one half years before Appellant\u2019s substitute counsel submitted his first supplemental brief on appeal, and any issues related to the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s sentencing scheme certainly could have been, and should have been, raised at that time. Furthermore, <em>Blakely </em>dealt with well-established, rather than novel, constitutional rights, which must be timely raised at trial in order to be preserved as issues on appeal. See <em>Awan, </em>supra, 22 Ohio St.3d at 123 [489 N.E.2d 277], We are not in the habit of allowing parties to raise additional arguments in the eleventh hour on appeal that could have been raised at trial or within the time limits set forth in the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure. In fact, this would violate one of the most basic tenets of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">{\u00b6 107} \u201cFurthermore, it does not appear [that] Ohio\u2019s felony sentencing scheme would run afoul of the holdings in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely. Blakely </em>stands for the proposition that, under the Sixth Amendment, \u2018any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 <em>Blakely, </em>[542 U.S. 296] 124 S.Ct. at 2536, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. In <em>Blakely, </em>the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the longest term the defendant can receive under any set of circumstances. Instead, it is, \u2018the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u2019 Id. [542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct.] at 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. In Ohio, the trial judge does not have the discretion to impose a sentence greater than the sentence prescribed for each crime as listed in the indictment. For example, Appellant was charged and convicted on two counts of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C. \u00a7 2911.11(A)(1). Aggravated burglary is designated as a first degree felony, which is punishable by three to ten years in prison. R.C. \u00a7 2929.14(A)(1). Once a jury makes the findings that establish that the crime of aggravated burglary has been committed, the trial court has discretionary power to impose a punishment within the statutory range for a first degree felony. Unlike the statutes at issue in <em>Blakely, </em>Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme does not provide exceptions to give the trial court power to exceed the maximum punishment allowed by the aggravated burglary statute. Any sentencing enhancements, such as gun specifications, must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>also be included in the indictment, and the jury must find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of those enhancements as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">{\u00b6 108} \u201cWe agree with those Ohio courts that have already concluded that the Ohio felony sentencing scheme does not violate the holdings in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely. </em>See, e.g. <em>State v. Scheer, </em>4th Dist. No. 03CA21, [158 Ohio App.3d 432] 2004-Ohio-4792 [816 N.E.2d 602]; <em>State v. Sour, </em>2nd Dist. No. 11913, 2004-Ohio-4048 [2004 WL 1728579]; <em>State v. Bell, </em>1st Dist. No. C030726, 2004-Ohio-3621 [2004 WL 1531904].\u201d <em>State v. Barnette, </em>7th Dist. No. 02 CA 65, 2004-Ohio-7211, 2004 WL 3090228, \u00b6 102-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">{\u00b6 109} Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has recently released yet another decision in the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases that clarifies some aspects of the <em>Blakely </em>case. In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, decided on January 12, 2005, the Supreme Court held that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines were unconstitutional to the extent that they imposed a mandatory duty on federal trial judges to impose criminal sentences based on findings of fact that were not previously determined by a jury, or that had not been previously admitted by the defendant. The Supreme Court held that it was the mandatory aspect of the Guidelines that offended the requirements of the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial. <em>Booker </em>held:</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">{\u00b6 110} \u201cWe have never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range. See <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S., at 481 [120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435]; <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 246 [69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337] (1949). Indeed, everyone agrees that the constitutional issues presented by these cases would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the SRA the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges; it is that circumstance that makes the Court\u2019s answer to the second question presented possible. For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.\u201d Id., 543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. at 750, 160 L.Ed.2d 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">{\u00b6 111} <em>Booker </em>would seem to confirm this court\u2019s holding in <em>Barnette </em>that Ohio\u2019s felony sentencing scheme does not violate the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial as long as the trial judge imposes a sentence within the statutory range established for each crime as set forth in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">{\u00b6 112} Furthermore, <em>Booker </em>also agrees with this court\u2019s conclusion that when a defendant raises <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>issues on appeal, the normal rules of appellate interpretation and review apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">{\u00b6 113} \u201c[W]e expect reviewing courts to apply ordinary prudential doctrines, determining, for example, whether the issue was raised below and whether it fails the \u2018plain error\u2019 test. It is also because, in cases not involving a Sixth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>ment violation, whether resentencing is warranted or whether it will instead be sufficient to review a sentence for reasonableness may depend upon application of the harmless-error doctrine.\u201d Id., 543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. at 769, 160 L.Ed.2d 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">{\u00b6 114} Appellant did not raise his constitutional jury-trial issue with the trial court and failed to raise it in his initial brief on appeal. Likewise, he was deficient in failing to request and receive permission to assert these claims out of rule. The issue now asserted by appellant is not significantly different than the constitutional issue raised in <em>Apprendi, </em>which was decided on June 26, 2000, and could have been raised at an earlier point in the proceedings. Just as this court decided in <em>Barnette, </em>because appellant failed to correctly raise these procedurally, he has waived this issue for purposes of appeal. For all the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s supplemental assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">CONCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">{\u00b6 115} We sustain appellant\u2019s first and second assignment of errors, and thus the judgment of the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed and vacated in part, and the cause is remanded for resentencing. Because of a fatal error in the indictment, we hereby reverse and vacate appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence for conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery, along with the concomitant firearm specification, and dismiss count 11 of the indictment. All other convictions are affirmed. As to sentencing, the trial court failed to comply with the statutory requirements for imposing consecutive sentences, as interpreted by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Comer. </em>Therefore, we reverse and vacate the remaining sentences and remand this case for resentencing. As stated earlier, if the trial court determines upon resentencing that consecutive sentences are warranted, the court must comply with the requirements of R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) and 2929.19(B)(2)(c), as interpreted by <em>Comer. </em>Furthermore, in sustaining appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, we direct the trial court to impose, at most, one penalty for the firearm specifications in counts two and three of the indictment (referring to the aggravated robbery of Jason Cosa and Christine Hammond) and, at most, three penalties for the firearm specifications in counts one, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten. We remand this case to the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b838-10\">Vukovich, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b838-11\">DeGenaro, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b839-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>DeGenaro, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AVV\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">{\u00b6 116} I agree with much of the majority\u2019s opinion. Moore\u2019s indictment did not sufficiently allege the charge of conspiracy against him, so that conviction must be vacated. The trial court did not make the findings necessary to support consecutive sentences, so the case must be remanded for resentencing. The trial court did not err when refusing to merge the three counts of complicity to commit rape, since each offense was committed with a separate animus. And the trial court did not err by refusing to continue Moore\u2019s sentencing hearing. I write separately for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">{\u00b6 117} First, I disagree with the manner in which the panel deals with Moore\u2019s first assignment of error. I agree with the majority that the trial court erred when it refused to merge some of the firearm specifications when sentencing Moore, but disagree with its decision to limit the trial court by saying that it can impose, at most, four consecutive prison terms for the various firearm specifications. I believe that the decision over exactly how many firearm specifications should be imposed when this case is remanded should be left to the trial court. What constitutes a transaction is fact-driven, and we should leave that decision as much as possible to the trial court in its role as fact-finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">{\u00b6 118} Second, and more important, I disagree with the majority\u2019s resolution of Moore\u2019s supplemental assignment of error. In that assignment of error, Moore argues that his sentence violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial as that right has been interpreted in <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. The majority rejects this argument, primarily relying on this court\u2019s prior decision in <em>State v. Barnette, </em>7th Dist. No. 02 CA 65, 2004-Ohio-7211, 2004 WL 3090228. I dissented from that decision and will continue to do so whenever appropriate until the Ohio Supreme Court has resolved the issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moore did not waive his Sixth Amendment argument, and his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by <em>Blakely. </em>The trial court could not sentence him to more than the minimum sentence for any of his separate offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">{\u00b6 119} Nevertheless, I cannot simply cite my prior decision as support for this dissent. The majority cites <em>United States v. Booker </em>(2005), 543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, as further support for its position that Moore waived this argument and that Blakely-type analysis does not apply in Ohio. But this conclusion ignores the substance of the <em>Booker </em>decision. First, as the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>quotes, <em>Booker </em>states that courts should \u201capply ordinary prudential doctrines, determining, for example, whether the issue was raised below and whether it fails the \u2018plain error\u2019 test.\u201d Id., 543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. at 769, 160 L.Ed.2d 621. By concluding that Moore waived the issue without conducting a plain, error analysis, the majority clearly is not following the court\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">{\u00b6 120} But just as important is the majority\u2019s failure to recognize that <em>Booker </em>does not offer it support in its conclusion that <em>Blakely-type </em>analysis does not apply to Ohio. As the First District recognized in <em>State v. Bruce, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 562, 2005-Ohio-373, 824 N.E.2d 609, and <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 752, 2005-Ohio-1018, 825 N.E.2d 250, <em>Booker </em>demonstrates that <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>analysis applies to Ohio\u2019s sentencing structure. <em>Booker </em>does not change or alter in any way <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>fundamental contribution to the law, the definition of \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for Sixth Amendment purposes. The majority\u2019s cursory analysis to the contrary does not do the issue justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">{\u00b6 121} In conclusion, I cannot fully concur with the majority\u2019s opinion for two reasons. First, I do not believe that we should tell the trial court how many consecutive gun specifications it may give in this case. Second, I believe that the trial court could not constitutionally sentence Moore to more than the minimum sentence for each of his separate offenses.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-10\">.
