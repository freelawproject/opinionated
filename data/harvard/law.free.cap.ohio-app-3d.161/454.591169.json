Bryan, to pay the attorney fees and expenses of plaintiff-appellee, Dina M. Bryan, under R.C. 2323.51, as a sanction for filing a legally groundless motion for the reallocation of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">{\u00b6 2} The Bryans\u2019 three-year marriage ended with a decree of dissolution in July 1998. Dina was designated the residential parent and legal custodian of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>their son, Tanner. Dina and Tanner, initially with Craig\u2019s permission, and ultimately with court authorization, moved to Florida in late 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 3} In March 2000, Craig filed a motion for a reallocation of parental rights and responsibilities, seeking to become the residential parent. An agreed entry resolved the issue by providing for extensive visitation for Craig, a two-week custody period during the summer, and frequent telephone contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">{\u00b6 4} Three years later, Craig filed a second motion for a reallocation of parental rights and responsibilities based upon a \u201csubstantial and continuing change in circumstances that have occurred since the last Court order\u201d and supported by his affidavit. The trial court held a hearing on the motion on February 12, 2004. At the conclusion of Craig\u2019s argument, Dina moved to dismiss the motion to reallocate. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss and then proceeded to hear testimony on Dina\u2019s motion for an award of costs, attorney fees, and expenses incurred as a result of Craig\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 5} In its February 18, 2004 decision and order, the trial court, in dismissing Craig\u2019s second motion to reallocate parental rights and responsibilities, held that the motion constituted frivolous conduct under R.C. 2323.51 and awarded Dina $20,956.70 in attorney fees. Craig has not appealed the dismissal of his motion, but he does contest the sanctions for frivolous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Frivolous Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">{\u00b6 6} Craig argues that his second motion to reallocate parental rights and responsibilities was not frivolous under R.C. 2323.51 and that the trial court erred by ordering him to pay attorney fees and costs to Dina.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 2323.51 allows a court to award court costs, reasonable attorney fees, and expenses to any party who has been adversely affected by frivolous conduct. See R.C. 2323.51(B)(1). The statute defines \u201cconduct\u201d as <em>\u201cthe filing </em>of a civil action, the <em>assertion </em>of a claim, defense, or other position in connection with a civil action, * * * <em>or the taking of any other action </em>in connection with a civil action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2323.51(A)(1)(a). Frivolous conduct is defined, in part, as conduct that is legally groundless, that is, conduct that \u201cis not warranted under existing law and cannot be supported by a good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\u201d R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii). If the court finds that a party has been adversely affected by frivolous conduct, the court may award court costs, reasonable attorney fees, and other reasonable expenses incurred in connection -with the civil action. See R.C. 2323.51(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">{\u00b6 8} If the facts underlying a claim for sanctions are not in dispute, only questions of law are presented for review, and an appellate court reviews de novo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the conclusion that a party\u2019s conduct was legally groundless. See <em>Riston v. Butler, </em>149 Ohio App.3d 390, 2002-Ohio-2308, 777 N.E.2d 857, at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"> {\u00b6 9} But if, as here, \u201cthe facts under a \u2018legally groundless claim\u2019 are in dispute, a mixed question of law and facts exists.\u201d Id. Thus the trial court\u2019s factual findings \u201c[will] not be disturbed if they [are] supported in the record by competent, credible evidence.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20, citing with approval <em>Wiltberger v. Davis </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 46, 52, 673 N.E.2d 628; see, also, <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus; <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(Jan. 8, 2002), 7th Dist. No. 99-CO-48, 2002 WL 46988. Affording some deference to the trial court\u2019s factual findings in a child-custody case is consistent with the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding that a trial judge, as the trier of fact, must be given wide latitude to consider all issues bearing upon whether there has been a change of circumstances. See <em>Davis v. Flickinger </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 415, 674 N.E.2d 1159, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 10} If an appellate court accepts the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, it then independently determines the propriety of the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that the claim was legally groundless. See <em>Riston v. Butler </em>at \u00b6 21 and 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Factual Findings on Change of Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">{\u00b6 11} A party seeking to modify custody under R.C. 3109.04 must initially demonstrate that a change in circumstances has occurred. See <em>Davis v. Flickinger, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 415, 674 N.E.2d 1159, paragraph one of the syllabus. The change of circumstances claimed must be \u201csubstantiated, continuing, and [have] a materially adverse effect upon a child.\u201d <em>Schaeffer v. Schaeffer, </em>1st Dist. Nos. C-020721, C-020722, C-020723, C-030255, and C-030385, 2004-Ohio-2032, 2004 WL 869359, at \u00b6 21, quoting <em>Wyss v. Wyss </em>(1982), 3 Ohio App.3d 412, 416, 3 OBR 479, 445 N.E.2d 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">{\u00b6 12} In its February 18, 2004 entry, the trial court made factual findings that the circumstances had not changed, as there was no substance to Craig\u2019s allegation that he was being denied parenting time or that Tanner was struggling socially, emotionally, and academically.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court\u2019s factual finding on parenting time was supported by competent, credible evidence. Craig\u2019s own testimony, the testimony of the parenting specialist, and phone records revealed that Craig filed this motion to reallocate largely to increase his visitation time, that he had consistent telephone contact with Tanner, and that he had received all of the visitation time permitted by the trial court\u2019s earlier rulings. There was no evidence to contradict the trial court\u2019s finding on Craig\u2019s parenting-time allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>{\u00b6 14} In support of his initial allegations that Tanner was suffering from emotional distress, Craig stated that when his son visited him in Cincinnati, Tanner had great difficulty sleeping alone and would wake up during the night. Craig stated that Tanner told him that he would often sleep with his mother. Craig also alleged that Tanner had reading difficulties and had had one incident of a dispute with another child while playing a video game. Craig also contended in support of his second motion to reallocate parenting rights and responsibilities that Dina was causing distress in Tanner\u2019s life by exposing him to the stress of court litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 15} The trial court heard evidence that Tanner had been evaluated by a psychologist, a parenting specialist, and his guardian ad litem. The psychologist agreed that Tanner had \u201canxious concerns\u201d associated with ongoing parental conflict but found \u201cno indications of serious psychopathology, a learning disability or related problems.\u201d Both the parenting specialist and the guardian ad litem found Tanner to be happy, engaging, and well adjusted. He participated in sports and scouting programs. They reported that Tanner was doing well in school, as verified by Tanner\u2019s report cards that were available for Craig\u2019s review. The trial court\u2019s factual finding that there was no substance to Craig\u2019s claim of emotional distress was supported by competent, credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 16} Accepting the trial court\u2019s factual finding that there was no substance to Craig\u2019s assertion of a change of circumstances, we now examine whether the findings of fact supported the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Craig\u2019s claim was legally groundless under R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(ii). This is an objective standard. See <em>Riston v. Butler </em>at \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 17} Craig\u2019s own testimony revealed that he was frustrated with Tanner\u2019s move to Florida in 1998 and that his purpose in filing the motion was to expand his visitation time. While he could have moved the court to modify his visitation periods, instead he alleged that a change of circumstances was sufficient to reallocate parental rights. He persisted in this strategy even after recanting many of his allegations and after the parenting specialist and the guardian ad litem had failed to find any support for his contentions. We hold that \u201cno reasonable lawyer would have brought [and maintained] the [motion] in light of the existing law\u201d that required a demonstration of a change of circumstances to prevail. See <em>Riston v. Butler </em>at \u00b6 31; see, also, R.C. 3109.04. Therefore, Craig\u2019s motion was legally groundless because the record confirms that it was not warranted under existing law and could not be supported by a good-faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 18} Where a trial court has found the existence of frivolous conduct, the decision to assess or not to assess a penalty lies within the sound discretion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the trial court. See <em>Riston v. Butler </em>at \u00b6 23-27. Under these facts, we cannot disturb the trial court\u2019s decision to award attorney fees as a sanction for pursuing a frivolous motion. The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The Fee Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 19} Craig next asserts that the trial court erred in conducting an attorney-fee hearing without proper notice and in improperly computing the amount of the fees awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 20} Craig\u2019s first claim is without merit. R.C. 2323.51 \u201cdoes not specify any particular form for the motion,\u201d a set procedure for the trial court to follow in hearing a motion for sanctions, or notice requirements. <em>Surface v. Grottlla-Kennedy, </em>2d Dist. No. 2002-CA-80, 2003-Ohio-3978, 2003 WL 21716183, at \u00b6 18. Rather, \u201cthe risk of a motion for sanctions under the statute is one that an attorney should anticipate when filing a complaint.\u201d <em>Ron Scheiderer &amp; Assoc. v. London </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 94, 97, 689 N.E.2d 552, quoted in <em>Broadnax v. Bowling, </em>1st Dist. No. C-030502, 2004-Ohio-1114, 2004 WL 442872, at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">{\u00b6 21} The record is replete with notice to Craig that the trial court intended to conduct an attorney-fee hearing. The trial court\u2019s scheduling entry, filed December 3, 2003, stated that on February 12, 2004, \u201cthe trial shall proceed on the issue of change of circumstances and attorney fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">{\u00b6 22} On February 3, 2004, Dina filed her motions to dismiss and for sanctions and attorney fees. On February 6, Dina filed a separate \u201cMotion for Attorney Fees and Legal Expenses\u201d with an attached affidavit and documentary evidence of time and expenses incurred in defending against Craig\u2019s second motion. The motion and accompanying affidavit were notice to Craig of the reasons for her request for fees and expenses. The motion included a \u201cNotice of Hearing\u201d that specified that the fee hearing was to occur before the trial court at 1:00 p.m., on February 12 \u2014 six days after the filing of the motion. On February 11, 2004, Craig filed a memorandum in opposition to Dina\u2019s sanction and fee motion. In this memorandum, he asked for sanctions and attorney fees against Dina for her frivolous conduct under Civ.R. 11 and R.C. 2323.51.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">{\u00b6 23} The trial court heard testimony about Craig\u2019s frivolous conduct during the hearing on the motion to reallocate. It also received the testimony of Dina\u2019s counsel on the fees and expenses incurred to defend against the frivolous motion. Craig cross-examined Dina\u2019s counsel. He had ample notice of the operative facts and the fees and expenses allegedly incurred due to his frivolous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">{\u00b6 24} As the trial court carefully evaluated the evidence of Craig\u2019s frivolous conduct and the fees and expenses incurred to defend against it, this court cannot disturb the decision to award a monetary sanction supported by evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>record. See <em>Evans v. Bossin </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 544, 546, 669 N.E.2d 87; see, also, <em>Riston v. Butler </em>at \u00b6 23-27. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">{\u00b6 25} Therefore, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-6\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Painter, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
