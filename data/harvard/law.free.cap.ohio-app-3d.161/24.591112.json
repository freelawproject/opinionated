Abele, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">{\u00b6 1} This is an appeal from a Ross County Common Pleas Court judgment of conviction and sentence. The jury found Kirk A. Evans, the defendant below and appellee herein, guilty of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor in violation of R.C. 2907.04 and sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">{\u00b6 2} The state of Ohio, plaintiff below and appellant herein, assigns the following error for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">Did the trial court err in issuing a nunc pro tunc judgment entry modifying the original sentence imposed?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">{\u00b6 3} The sole issue in this appeal involves the trial court\u2019s review and modification of sentence following appellee\u2019s unsuccessful appeal. On July 30, 2003, the trial court ordered appellee to serve a 12-month prison sentence for unlawful sexual conduct with a minor (fourth-degree felony) and a concurrent 30-day county-jail sentence for sexual imposition (third-degree misdemeanor). In sentencing appellee to prison, the trial court determined that a community-control sanction would demean the seriousness of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">{\u00b6 4} Appellee appealed that judgment and asserted that the jury\u2019s verdicts were inconsistent. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>State v. Evans </em>(March 31, 2004), Ross App. No. 03CA2697. Appellee sought further review, but the Ohio Supreme Court declined appellee\u2019s invitation to consider the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-15\">{\u00b6 5} On April 21, 2004, appellee requested the trial court to reconsider its previously ordered sentence. Notably, the presentence investigation report\u2019s recommendation had changed during the interim period. At the first sentencing hearing the PSI report recommended a prison sentence. At the subsequent hearing, however, the PSI recommended a community-control sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>{\u00b6 6} After considering the evidence and counsels\u2019 arguments, the trial court opted, over appellant\u2019s objections, to issue a \u201cJudgment Entry of Sentence Nunc Pro Tunc\u201d and modified appellee\u2019s sentence to a community-control sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">{\u00b6 7} On September 22, 2004, appellant requested leave to appeal the trial court\u2019s judgment. We granted that request, and this matter is properly before us for review and determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">{\u00b6 8} In its sole assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court\u2019s decision to modify appellee\u2019s sentence by a nunc pro tunc entry constitutes reversible error. Appellee notes that <em>State v. Henson </em>(2002), 97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, explicitly provides that a nunc pro tunc entry may not be used to modify a previously ordered sentence. Rather, appellant contends that nunc pro tune or corrective entries are limited in use to situations that reflect what a court actually decided but failed to properly recite or include in a judgment entry, not what a court might or should have decided or what the court might have intended to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">{\u00b6 9} We agree with appellant concerning the use of nunc pro tunc entries. In <em>State v. Greulich </em>(1988), 61 Ohio App.3d 22, 24, 572 N.E.2d 132, the court wrote the following with respect to a nunc pro tunc order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">A nunc pro tunc order may be issued by a trial court, as an exercise of its inherent power, to make its record speak the truth. It is used to record that which the trial court did, but which has not been recorded. It is an order issued now, which has the same legal force and effect as if it had been issued at an earlier time, when it ought to have been issued. Thus, the office of a nunc pro tunc order is limited to memorializing what the trial court actually did at an earlier point in time. <em>State, ex rel. Phillips v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1927), 116 Ohio St. 261, 155 N.E. 798. It can be used to supply information which existed but was not recorded, to correct mathematical calculations, and to correct typographical or clerical errors. <em>Jacks v. Adamson </em>(1897), 56 Ohio St. 397, 47 N.E. 48.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">A nunc pro tunc order cannot be used to supply omitted action, or to indicate what the court might or should have decided, or what the trial court intended to decide. Its proper use is limited to what the trial court actually did decide. <em>Webb v. Western Reserve Bond &amp; Share Co. </em>(1926), 115 Ohio St. 247, 153 N.E. 289. That, of course, may include the addition of matters omitted from the record by inadvertence or mistake of action taken. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.1979) 964. Therefore, a nunc pro tunc order is a vehicle used to correct an order previously issued which fails to reflect the trial court\u2019s true action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">{\u00b6 10} Thus, a nunc pro tunc entry may be used only in situations to correct a previous order that failed to reflect a court\u2019s true action. Although, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>we discuss below, we agree with appellant as an abstract proposition of law that the trial court\u2019s use of a nunc pro tunc entry may have been technically improper, we do not agree with appellant that the trial court was prohibited from modifying appellee\u2019s sentence. Additionally, the label or title placed on a document generally is not, standing alone, determinative of what the document actually represents. See, e.g., <em>St. Vincent Charity Hosp. v. Mintz </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 121, <em>515 </em>N.E.2d 917. Rather, the content of the entry or document determines the nature of that document.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">{\u00b6 11} In the case sub judice the trial court decided to modify its previously imposed sentence. In <em>State v. Meister </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 15, 17, 600 N.E.2d 1103, the court discussed the conditions under which a trial court may resentence a criminal defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">Both historically and as a matter of policy, a trial court may resentence a defendant who has not begun to serve the sentence to a more severe sentence without violating the multiple-sentences protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The reason is that, before its execution, a sentence lacks the constitutional finality of a verdict of acquittal. <em>United States v. DiFrancesco </em>(1980), 449 U.S. 117, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328; <em>State v. Vaughn </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 314, 10 OBR 520, 462 N.E.2d 444. Cf. <em>Whalen v. United States </em>(1980), 445 U.S. 684, 703, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1443, 63 L.Ed.2d 715, 731 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">{\u00b6 12} As a general rule, the execution of a criminal sentence commences when a defendant has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment and the defendant has been delivered to a penal institution of the executive branch. <em>State v. Addison </em>(1987), 40 Ohio App.3d 7, 530 N.E.2d 1335. Thus, once a defendant has been delivered into the custody of the penal institution in which he is to serve his sentence, a trial court\u2019s authority to suspend or to modify a sentence is limited to those instances specifically provided by the General Assembly. <em>State v. Gilmore </em>(Apr. 6, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 67575, 1995 WL 168748, citing <em>Addison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>State v. Lambert, </em>Richland App. No. 03-CA-65, 2003-Ohio-6791, 2003 WL 22950390, \u00b6 14, our colleagues in the Fifth Appellate District also spoke to this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">While a trial court maintains authority to amend its sentence at any time before the execution of sentence is commenced, absent statutory authority to do so, a court has no authority to amend a valid sentence which has been put into execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">{\u00b6 14} See, also, <em>State v. Wilburn </em>(Dec. 22, 1999), Lawrence App. No. 98-CA-47, 1999 WL 1281507; <em>Columbus v. Messer </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 266, 268, 7 OBR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>347, 455 N.E.2d 519, citing <em>Beatty v. Alston </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 126, 72 O.O.2d 70, 330 N.E.2d 921, and <em>State v. Papp </em>(1978), 64 Ohio App.2d 203, 18 O.O.3d 157, 412 N.E.2d 401; <em>State v. Greulich </em>(1988), 61 Ohio App.3d 22, 572 N.E.2d 132; <em>In re Zilba </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 258, 673 N.E.2d 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">{\u00b6 15} We believe that the trial court possessed the authority to modify appellee\u2019s sentence. At the time the court modified appellee\u2019s sentence, the sentence had not yet commenced, as he had not been delivered to the custody of a penal institution. Although the cases cited above generally involve a court resentencing a defendant to a harsher sentence, we believe that prior to the commencement of the execution of sentence, trial courts also retain the authority to resentence defendants to less harsh sentences. This is a matter for which trial courts should have discretion. From time to time, facts and evidence may come to light prior to the commencement of execution of a sentence that may have a significant bearing in fashioning an appropriate sentence. Trial courts should retain the authority to modify a sentence under appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant asserts that <em>Henson, </em>supra, presents the same situation as the instant case. We disagree with appellant\u2019s assessment. In <em>Henson </em>a trial court judge attempted to use a 2001 nunc pro tunc entry to modify a 1983 sentence. In the case sub judice, in contrast, appellee had not yet commenced the execution of his sentence at the time the trial court modified the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">{\u00b6 17} Additionally, we do not believe that a trial court\u2019s authority is limited by the fact that a judgment of conviction and sentence had been previously appealed and affirmed on appeal. Although unusual in timing and sequence, this fact does not diminish a trial court\u2019s authority to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence prior to the commencement of execution of that sentence if the court sees fit to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">{\u00b6 18} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons we hereby overrule appellant\u2019s assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b65-10\">Kline, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AW\">McFarland, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
