The trial court found that this exclusion expressly bars coverage for the claims filed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">{\u00b6 6} The policy also contains a provision titled \u201cExpected or Intended Injury,\u201d which states that \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured is excluded from coverage but that \u201cthis exclusion does not apply to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 resulting from the use of reasonable force to protect persons or property.\u201d The employees, who were also named defendants in this case, have filed affidavits claiming that they were acting to protect the wife of the patron who claims to have suffered injuries. A claim that, if proven, could allow coverage under the aforementioned policy provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">{\u00b6 7} We find that these two provisions cited by the trial court and in the briefs of the parties are in conflict and, thus, facts may be developed that require coverage in this case. For that reason, we find that summary judgment in this case was inappropriate. Thus, as appellant argues, the claim of the patrons here \u201cpotentially or arguably falls within the coverage provided by the Policy, and Alea is required to provide a defense for the entire action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">{\u00b6 8} Moreover, appellant is correct in pointing out that once a duty to defend is recognized, speculation about the insurer\u2019s ultimate obligation to indemnify is premature until facts excluding coverage are revealed during the defense of the litigation and the insurer timely reserves the rights to deny coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">{\u00b6 9} We are further persuaded in our decision for the following reasons: First, the trial court construed the policy provisions <em>against </em>the insured, whereas we now know from <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, that policy provisions are to be construed in <em>favor </em>of the insured, who in this case is WAS, Inc. Second, as this court has noted, \u201ca general presumption arises to the effect that that which is not clearly excluded from the operation of such contract is included in the operation thereof.\u201d <em>Batteiger v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(Feb. 15, 2002), 2d Dist. No. 2001-CA-37, 2002 WL 242513. Finally, we note that insurance-policy provisions should be construed, if possible, to be in harmony, and here it is at least arguable that the injuries are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>covered under the contract if the insured can prove that the injuries resulted from its employees\u2019 reasonable-force effort to protect persons, protection that, by law, is not an assault or battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">{\u00b6 10} The judgment is reversed and this cause is remanded for further proceedings that shall include developing the facts of the matter to determine whether or not the insurer must indemnify the insured. But at a minimum, the insurer must defend the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-6\">Brogan, P.J., Grady and Young, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b150-7\">Frederick N. Young, retired from the Court of Appeals, Second Appellate District, sitting by assignment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
