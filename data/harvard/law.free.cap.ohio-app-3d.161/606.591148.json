Richter, M.D., that it intended to determine whether to suspend or revoke his medical license as the result of his conduct. On September 29, 1995, the board held an administrative hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Appellant did not attend; however, he submitted a written affidavit, and his attorney appeared on his behalf. On February 14, 1996, the board voted to permanently revoke appellant\u2019s medical license to practice in Ohio, effective March 4, 1996. Appellant filed a notice of appeal to the common pleas court but voluntarily dismissed the appeal on June 18,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">{\u00b6 2} On March 4, 1997, appellant wrote a letter to the board asking it to reconsider the permanent-revocation order. The board responded that its ability to reconsider the permanent-revocation order expired when appellant filed his appeal to the common pleas court. In October 1997 and February and March 1998, appellant and his counsel wrote to the board seeking an application form for a new medical license. The board declined to send the application form and to consider appellant\u2019s request for a new medical license. Appellant filed an original action in this court seeking a writ of mandamus compelling the board to release the licensure-application forms and to consider his application, but this court denied the writ. See <em>State ex rel. Richter v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio </em>(June 15, 2000), Franklin App. No. 98AP-1640.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant then filed a complaint for declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that the board should send and consider his application for a new license. The common pleas court denied his request. Appellant filed a notice of appeal and raises the following assignment of error: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">First assignment of error: the trial court abused its discretion and erred to appellant\u2019s prejudice when it refused to render declaratory relief to appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">{\u00b6 4} By the assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to render declaratory relief to appellant. R.C. 2721.03 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">[A]ny person interested under a * * * written contract, or other writing constituting a contract or any person whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a constitutional provision, statute, [or] contract * * * may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument, constitutional provision, statute, rule, [or] contract * * * and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations under it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">{\u00b6 5} To be entitled to declaratory relief, appellant must demonstrate that (1) a controversy within the scope of R.C. 2721.01 et seq. exists between the parties, (2) the controversy is justiciable in character, and (3) speedy relief is necessary to preserve the rights of the parties. <em>Burger Brewing Co. v. Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 93, 63 O.O.2d 149, 296 N.E.2d 261, paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cA \u2018justiciable controversy\u2019 is a \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018actual\u2019 controversy.\u201d <em>Voinovich v. Ferguson </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 198, 217, 586 N.E.2d 1020. In <em>Burger, </em>the court quoted <em>Peltz v. S. Euclid </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 128, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>131, 40 O.O.2d 129, 228 N.E.2d 320, stating that, for a real controversy to exist, it is not necessary that the plaintiffs violate the regulation as long as there is a controversy \u201cbetween parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\u201d The United States Supreme Court developed a two-fold test to determine whether a controversy is justiciable in character:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">[FJirst to determine whether the issues tendered are appropriate for judicial resolution, and second to assess the hardship to the parties if judicial relief is denied at that stage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\"><em>Toilet Goods Assn. v. Gardner </em>(1967), 387 U.S. 158, 162, 87 S.Ct. 1520, 18 L.Ed.2d 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">{\u00b6 6} In this case, appellant seeks an application for a medical license, and the board contends that appellant has no right to a licensure application because his license was permanently revoked in 1996. Thus, a controversy exists between parties having adverse legal interests. The conflict is justiciable in nature and appropriate for judicial resolution. Appellant would suffer hardship if judicial relief were denied. Therefore, a real controversy within the scope of the Declaratory Judgment Act exists, the controversy is justiciable, and speedy relief is necessary for the preservation of appellant\u2019s rights that might otherwise be impaired or lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">{\u00b6 7} The parties agreed on the facts in this case, and the issue is whether the board had the authority in 1996 to permanently revoke appellant\u2019s medical license and impose a lifetime ban from medicine. The board found that appellant had violated R.C. 4731.22(B)(5), (10), (12), (15), and (26). R.C. 4731.22 provided in 1996:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">(B) The board, pursuant to an adjudicatory hearing under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code and by a vote of not fewer than six members, shall, to the extent permitted by law, limit, revoke, or suspend a certificate, refuse to register or refuse to reinstate an applicant, or reprimand or place on probation the holder of a certificate for one or more of the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">(5) Soliciting patients or publishing a false, fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-12\">(10) Commission of an act that constitutes a felony in this state regardless of the jurisdiction in which the act was committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>(12) Commission of an act that constitutes a misdemeanor in this state regardless of the jurisdiction in which the act was committed, if the act was committed in the course of practice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\"><em>* </em># #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">(15) Violation of the conditions of limitation placed by the board upon a certificate to practice or violation of the conditions of limitation upon which a limited or temporary registration or certificate to practice is issued;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">(26) Impairment of ability to practice according to acceptable and prevailing standards of care because of habitual or excessive use or abuse of drugs, alcohol, or other substances that impair ability to practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Am.H.B. No. 144, 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2164, 2165-2168.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant is not seeking a reinstatement of his medical license, but is instead seeking to apply for a new medical license. In <em>Bouquett v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 203, 598 N.E.2d 762, the board revoked the medical license of a physician based on his felony conviction in federal court, but there was no indication in the order that the revocation was permanent. Approximately two years later, the physician asked the board to either reconsider its decision to revoke his medical license or permit him to apply for a new license. Since \u201crevocation\u201d is not defined in R.C. 4731.22(B), this court found that R.C. 4731.22(B) contemplates that an application might be made for reinstatement even if a medical license has been revoked.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>DeBlaneo v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 194, 604 N.E.2d 212, the board revoked the medical license of a physician based upon convictions for forgery, theft, and Medicaid fraud. This court found that R.C. 4731.22 was not facially unconstitutional because it did not preclude reinstatement of the licensure of a physician whose license had been revoked; a new license could be issued. However, DeBlaneo had not attempted reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Williams v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 743, 605 N.E.2d 1311, the appellant\u2019s medical license was revoked based upon felony convictions. This court again found that R.C. 4731.22(B) is not facially unconstitutional because it does not preclude reinstatement to the practice of medicine of a doctor whose license has been revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>Roy v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 352, 655 N.E.2d 771, the appellant\u2019s medical license was permanently revoked because of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>felony convictions. This court concluded that the board has the authority pursuant to R.C. 4731.22(B) to permanently revoke a medical license although, consistent with <em>Bouquett </em>and <em>State v. White </em>(1987), 29 Ohio St.3d 39, 29 OBR 388, 505 N.E.2d 632, some revocations are subject to reinstatement and, under some circumstances, a new license may be obtained following revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>White, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court considered similar statutory language under R.C. 4507.16(A). The court found that the General Assembly\u2019s use of both \u201csuspend\u201d and \u201crevoke\u201d implied that the terms are not synonymous. \u201cNeither \u2018suspend\u2019 nor \u2018revoke\u2019 is defined in the Revised Code. Thus, these terms should be afforded their common, everyday meaning. * * * The term \u2018suspend\u2019 ordinarily contemplates the temporary taking away of something. \u2018Revocation,\u2019 however, is a permanent taking without the expectation of reinstatement.\u201d Id. at 40, 29 OBR 388, 505 N.E.2d 632. The court acknowledged that there are circumstances under which a person may apply for a new driver\u2019s license following revocation, implying that all revocations may not be permanent. Id. at 41, 29 OBR 388, 505 N.E.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant also cites <em>State ex rel. Poignon v. Ohio Bd. of Pharmacy, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-178, 2004-Ohio-2709, 2004 WL 1171723, as authority that the board cannot forever bar an applicant. In <em>Poignon, </em>the relator filed an original action in this court seeking a writ of mandamus ordering respondent to process his application to be licensed as a pharmacist and to either grant his application or offer him the opportunity for a hearing. The relator had previously been licensed in Ohio as a pharmacist, and his license had been permanently revoked after proper notice and a hearing. Ohio Adm.Code 4729-9-01(E) defines \u201crevoke\u201d as a permanent action against the license and licensee. This court found that the pharmacy board was under no legal duty to either grant relator\u2019s application or provide him with a hearing in his attempt to regain his license, as he did not have a legal right to regain it. However, Ohio AdmuCode 4729-9-01(E) specifically provides that the pharmacy board can forever bar a person from holding a pharmacy license after revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">{\u00b6 14} In this case, the board permanently revoked appellant\u2019s medical license. In <em>Roy, </em>this court determined that the board has the authority, pursuant to R.C. 4731.22(B), to permanently revoke a medical license, although, consistent with <em>Bouquett </em>and <em>White, </em>some revocations are subject to reinstatement, and under some circumstances, a new license may be obtained following revocation. Thus, appellant is entitled to apply for a new medical license, and the board is obligated to provide, accept, and process appellant\u2019s licensure forms. Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Appellant also argues that the board\u2019s action in refusing to provide, accept, and process his application for a new medical license will deprive him of his due process rights. Since we are reversing the decision of the trial court, however, we need not address that issue. \u201cCourts decide constitutional issues only when absolutely necessary.\u201d <em>State ex rel. DeBrosse v. Cool </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 1, 7, 716 N.E.2d 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">{\u00b6 16} For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is sustained, the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and this cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings in accordance with law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Judgment reversed and case remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b648-7\">Petree, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b648-8\">French, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b648-9\">John McCormac, J., retired, of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-14\">. R.C. 4731.22 was amended by Sub.H.B. No. 606, effective March 9, 1999, which granted the board the power to levy permanent adverse actions against licensee and applicants and to prohibit the physician from applying for reinstatement or a new license. See R.C. 4731.22(L).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b648-10\">French, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A3p\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">{\u00b6 17} I concur in the majority opinion. However, I write separately to restate that the issue before the court is not whether the board had the authority in February 1996 to permanently revoke appellant\u2019s license. <em>Roy v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 352, 655 N.E.2d 771, answered that question in the affirmative. The question is whether the board has the authority to refuse to process an application for reinstatement by an applicant whose license was \u201cpermanently\u201d revoked in February 1996. The majority opinion answers that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">{\u00b6 18} R.C. 4731.22(L) currently states: \u201cAn individual subject to a permanent action taken by the board is forever thereafter ineligible to hold a certificate to practice and the board shall not accept an application for reinstatement of the certificate or for issuance of a new certificate.\u201d While that language makes abundantly clear that a permanent revocation results in permanent ineligibility to reapply, that language did not exist in February 1996 when the board \u201cpermanently\u201d revoked appellant\u2019s license. Rather, in February 1996, R.C. 4731.22(B) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-13\">The board, pursuant to an adjudicatory hearing under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code and by a vote of not fewer than six members, shall, to the extent permitted by law, limit, revoke, or suspend a certificate, refuse to register or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>refuse to reinstate an applicant, or reprimand or place on probation the holder of a certificate for one or more of the [listed] reasons * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Am.H.B. No. 144, 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2164, 2165. While <em>Roy </em>held that this language gave the board the authority to permanently revoke a license, <em>Roy </em>did not hold that permanent revocation included permanent ineligibility for reinstatement. Rather, <em>Roy </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">* * * Although the parties have raised both the issues of reinstatement and constitutionality if no opportunity for reinstatement of a permanently revoked license exists, neither of those issues is before us in this case. The record reveals no application for reinstatement, and thus we do not address that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4ph\">Id., 101 Ohio App.3d at 355, 655 N.E.2d 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">{\u00b6 19} Also, in <em>Bouquett v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 203, 598 N.E.2d 762, this court held that the board had the authority to reinstate or relicense a doctor whose license had been revoked, but it did not address whether board authority was the same following \u201cpermanent\u201d revocation. It is worth noting that, on appeal following remand, the court in <em>Bouquett v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1997), 123 Ohio App.3d 466, 704 N.E.2d 583, reviewed and affirmed the board\u2019s refusal to reinstate the doctor whose license had been revoked, a refusal that came <em>after </em>a proposed denial, hearing, and final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">{\u00b6 20} Here, the board took no action on appellant\u2019s requests for an application. This refusal to act apparently reflects the board\u2019s current policy of not processing or in any way acknowledging such a request from an applicant whose license has been permanently revoked. See <em>Hosseinipour v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-512, 2004-Ohio-1220, 2004 WL 503941 (citing testimony on board policy not to consider any petitions for reinstatement where the board had permanently revoked a physician\u2019s certificate). That policy appears consistent with express board power to deny reapplication under R.C. 4731.22(L) and explicit administrative rules that define \u201cpermanent revocation\u201d to include permanent ineligibility to reapply. See Ohio Adm.Code 4731-13-36(A) (effective February 28, 2004). However, R.C. 4731.22(L) did not exist in February 1996, and our record includes no such explicit administrative rules in effect at that time. Since former R.C. 4731.22(B) allowed the board to revoke a certificate only \u201cto the extent permitted by law\u201d and also required a board vote after an adjudication in order to refuse to register or reinstate an applicant, the board\u2019s permanent revocation in February 1996 did not include permanent ineligibility for reinstatement. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Mathur v. Ohio State Dental Bd., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-764, 2005-Ohio-1538, 2005 WL 736232 (enforcing consent-agreement provision precluding reapplication for a dental license).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">{\u00b6 21} Finally, I do not agree with appellee that allowing appellant to apply for reinstatement of his old certificate (or for a new one) means that appellant may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>continually reapply. In my view, if the board were to refuse to register appellant or to reinstate appellant\u2019s certif\u00edcate, under R.C. 4731.22(L), the board could \u201cspecify that its action is permanent\u201d and thereby make appellant \u201cforever thereafter ineligible\u201d to reapply.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">{\u00b6 22} For these reasons, I concur in the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
