Rocco, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, the state of Ohio, appeals from the trial court order that interpreted the previous decision of this court to mean that defendantappellee Delawrence Gray was entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">{\u00b6 2} The state argues that the trial court misunderstood the mandate of this court in <em>State v. Gray, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82045, 2003-Ohio-4670, 2003 WL 22053616 <em>(\u201cGray </em>/\u201d) and exceeded its authority in simply ordering a new trial. Upon a review of the mixed message conveyed in <em>Gray I, </em>this court agrees. Consequently, the state\u2019s assignments of error are sustained. To prevent further errors from occurring below, the trial court\u2019s order granting Gray a new trial is reversed. This case is remanded with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">{\u00b6 3} The circumstances surrounding Gray\u2019s convictions were recounted in <em>Gray I. </em>Gray was convicted after a bench trial of three counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. He challenged his convictions with two assignments of error, claiming that the weight of the evidence did not support them and that the trial court had erred in an evidentiary matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Paradoxically, in view of the concluding sentence of the first paragraph of the opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the outcome of the appeal, this court reviewed the first assignment of error. After determining that the trial court\u2019s finding of Gray\u2019s guilt on the <em>three </em>charges was supported by the weight of the evidence, this court considered Gray\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 5} Therein, Gray presented three interrelated arguments as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court erred in disallowing the review of the police officers\u2019 reports for inconsistencies, in not conducting an in camera inspection, and in not preserving said reports for appellate review.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">{\u00b6 7} The trial record reflected that Gray had requested pursuant to Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g) an in camera inspection of the police reports; he sought thereby to discover whether, in the trial court\u2019s opinion, the victim or appellant himself made any statements to the officers that could be used during Gray\u2019s cross examination of the officers. The trial court not only denied his request, but failed thereafter to provide the police reports for the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">{\u00b6 8} In considering Gray\u2019s argument, this court stated at \u00b6 22 that without the ability to review the reports at issue, it could not determine whether there were inconsistencies and thus could not state whether the trial court erred in declining to permit cross examination of the witnesses. This court\u2019s opinion reminded the trial court that the criminal rule \u201cmandate[d] that the trial court conduct an in camera review of any document, including a police report, which purports to be a prior statement of a witness and may be used upon cross examination, <em>prior to </em>making any ruling on admissibility.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">{\u00b6 9} This court, therefore, found Gray\u2019s second assignment of error to have merit. Since it was impossible to determine on appeal whether the trial court\u2019s ultimate decision on the admissibility of the evidence was correct, Gray\u2019s \u201csecond assignment of error [was] sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">{\u00b6 10} <em>Gray I </em>concluded at \u00b6 23 with the following sentence: <em>\u201cJudgment </em>reversed and case remanded <em>for the trial court to conduct an in camera inspection pursuant to Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g).\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">{\u00b6 11} The state thereafter attempted to appeal the order of remand; however, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to accept the appeal. <em>State v. Gray, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1546, 2003-Ohio-6879, 800 N.E.2d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">{\u00b6 12} Upon receiving this case once again on remand, the trial court requested the parties to instruct it as to what this court meant in <em>Gray I. </em>Both the state and Gray complied by submitting briefs on the issue. The state argued that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>court had been ordered only to review the police statements to determine whether Gray should have been allowed cross-examination of the officers. Gray, on the other hand, argued that this court had reversed all of his convictions so as to require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">{\u00b6 13} Ultimately, the trial court issued a journal entry that interpreted the opinion in <em>Gray I </em>to mean that \u201cthis case is reversed in its entirety.\u201d As a result of that interpretation, the \u201c \u2018judgment\u2019 of conviction has been reversed,\u201d and the case was ordered \u201creinstated on the court\u2019s docket\u201d for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">{\u00b6 14} The state has filed its notice of appeal from the foregoing order. It presents the following two assignments of error for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cI. The trial court erred when it failed to conduct an in camera inspection of the police reports pursuant to Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g) as mandated by the Eighth District Court of Appeals upon remand in <em>State v. Gray, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82045, 2003-Ohio-4670 [2003 WL 22053616].</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cII. The trial court erred when it granted defendant-appellee a new trial upon remand absent any showing of prejudice when the trial court failed to determine whether the police reports contained discoverable \u2018statements,\u2019 and, if so, whether there were inconsistencies between the \u2018statements\u2019 and the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">{\u00b6 17} Prior to addressing the state\u2019s arguments, a threshold matter of jurisdiction must be considered. Gray argues this appeal should be dismissed for lack of a final order. His argument is rejected as a result of the decision in <em>State v. Matthews </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 375, 691 N.E.2d 1041, and its aftermath.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Matthews, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court determined that the state has a right pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(A)(3) to request leave to appeal a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a defendant a new trial. After the case was remanded to this court \u201cfor further proceedings,\u201d the state\u2019s arguments were addressed on their merits in <em>State v. Matthews </em>(Mar. 11, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 70587, 1999 WL 135264, thus impliedly granting the state\u2019s motion for leave to appeal. Indeed, this court determined in that case that the trial court had erred in granting Matthews\u2019s motion for a new trial; consequently, the state\u2019s appeal was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">{\u00b6 19} Similarly, this court declines to dismiss this case and thus to overrule the state\u2019s request for leave to appeal the trial court\u2019s decision, since the trial court determined that Gray was entitled to a new trial based upon an understandably erroneous interpretation of the decision in <em>Gray I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">{\u00b6 20} The state argues in its assignments of error that the trial court exceeded its mandate by disobeying the law of the case as set forth in <em>Gray I </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>thereby circumventing Crim.R. 38(A). The state\u2019s argument perhaps is overstated, but is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">{\u00b6 21} The Ohio Supreme Court explained the doctrine of the law of the case in <em>Nolan v. Nolan </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 1, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d 410, to be a \u201crule of practice rather than a binding rule of substantive law,\u201d which \u201cfunctions to compel trial courts to follow the mandates of reviewing courts.\u201d Under this doctrine, \u201can inferior court has no discretion to disregard\u201d the superior court\u2019s mandate. Thus, \u201cwhere at a rehearing following remand a trial court is <em>confronted with substantially the same facts and issues </em>as were involved in the prior appeal, the court is bound to adhere to <em>the appellate court\u2019s determination </em>of the applicable law. Moreover, the trial court is <em>without authority to extend or vary </em>the mandate given.\u201d (Emphasis added; citations omitted.) Id. at 3, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Gray I, </em>this court reviewed the record and, with regard to Gray\u2019s initial challenge to his convictions, stated that <em>as the record stood, </em>all of his convictions found support in the weight of the evidence. Nevertheless, his second challenge <em>had </em>to be sustained, because it was <em>impossible to determine </em>whether his right to a fair trial had been compromised by the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with Crim.R. 16 by refusing to conduct an in camera inspection of the police statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 23} Although the concluding sentence of the first paragraph of the opinion indicated otherwise, therefore, the \u201cjudgment\u201d referred to in the concluding paragraph was the simple <em>denial </em>of Gray\u2019s request for an in camera inspection, not <em>the judgments </em>of all three of his convictions on the three charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 24} Any different meaning, as suggested in the concluding sentence of the first paragraph of the opinion, was a misstatement; indeed, this court erred in rendering the opinion in the manner that it did.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In actuality, there was no reason for this court to review the weight of the evidence before \u201cremand[ing] for the trial court to conduct an in camera inspection pursuant to Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 25} The appellate court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Dockery, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-000316, 2002-Ohio-189, 2002 WL 63437, at fn. 2, is instructive on this point. In <em>Dockery, </em>the Hamilton County Court of Appeals distinguished two earlier cases, <em>State v. Tuck </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 721, 610 N.E.2d 591, and <em>State v. Robertson </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 715, 630 N.E.2d 422, and held that when a defendant has raised a \u201cprima facie case\u201d with regard to his <em>assignment of error, </em>the case is remanded to the trial court \u201cfor an inquiry into\u201d the substance of the procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>issue. An order of new trial pursuant to Crim.R. 33(A) is appropriate only when that procedural issue is resolved in defendant\u2019s favor. See, also, <em>State v. Brock </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 656, 673-674, 675 N.E.2d 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 26} The trial court\u2019s confusion over the scope of the remand ordered in <em>Gray I </em>is understandable, since this court should not have addressed the issue of the weight of the evidence. Instead, this court should have declined to resolve that issue and simply remanded the case to the trial court to conduct an in camera inspection of the reports. See <em>State v. Davis, </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-579, 2002-Ohio-1920, 2002 WL 576077, \u00b6 74. Nevertheless, upon remand, the trial court should not have granted Gray a new trial without a formal motion having been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 27} This court seeks now, by following <em>State v. Robertson, </em>supra, to preclude any further misunderstanding. In <em>Robertson, </em>the appellate court informed the trial court in very specific terms, depending on the trial court\u2019s memory of the original proceeding and its consideration of the overall fairness of Robertson\u2019s trial, the procedures to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 28} The state\u2019s assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">{\u00b6 29} The order of the trial court that grants Gray a new trial is reversed. This case is remanded to the trial court with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">{\u00b6 30} The trial court is ordered to conduct pursuant to Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(g) an in camera inspection of the police reports to determine whether Gray should have been permitted to use them in his cross-examination of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">{\u00b6 31} If the trial court finds in the exercise of its discretion that Gray should have been permitted to use the statements, it must then determine whether the failure to permit the cross-examination compromised the fairness of Gray\u2019s trial. If the trial court determines that the failure constituted prejudicial error, it may grant Gray\u2019s request for a new trial. If the trial court decides otherwise, it must issue an order that thoroughly explains its decisions with regard to the Crim.R. 16 issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b655-12\">Kaepinski, P.J., and McMonagle, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-13\">. The opinion's sentence states that Gray\u2019s \"conviction [sic] and sentence\u201d are reversed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-9\">. For that error, this court now apologizes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
