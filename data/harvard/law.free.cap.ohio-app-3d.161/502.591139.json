Eight-year-old Eric was injured when another young student, Andrew Rizkallah, the son of Jihad and Joanne Rizkallah, admittedly pushed him into the deep end of the pool, and his foot became caught on an interior handrail. The Thompsons\u2019 complaint alleged negligence in the supervision of the students and the design of the pool, specifically the handrail, which allegedly posed a latently dangerous hazard. They further alleged that Andrew Rizkallah had acted negligently or recklessly or intentionally, and they asked that the trial court declare the rights of their insurance company, Humana Health Plan of Ohio, Inc., d.b.a. ChoiceCare, which had submitted a subrogation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">{\u00b6 2} In their three assignments of error, the Thompsons challenge the grant of summary judgment to the Coney Island defendants (the first assignment of error); to Lisa Keeling, the swimming instructor (the second assignment of error), and to the Rizkallah defendants (the third assignment of error). Choice-Care, which filed a cross-claim against the other named defendants, has filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>separate appeal and has adopted verbatim the assignments of error and arguments of the Thompsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">{\u00b6 3} For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\n<em>Coney Island Defendants and Keeling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 4} In support of their motion for summary judgment, the Coney Island defendants and Keeling asserted the lack of any evidence of their own negligence contributing to Eric\u2019s injuries. To support this contention, they presented the affidavits of both Keeling and Victor Nolting, the president of Coney Island, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">{\u00b6 5} <em>Nolting Affidavit: </em>Responding to the Thompsons\u2019 claim that the handrail posed a safety hazard, Nolting stated that the handrail was part of the Sunlight Pool\u2019s original installation in 1925 and that the handrail had not been materially altered since that date. He stated that the handrail was routinely inspected, maintained, and repaired in order to ensure its safe condition. According to Nolting, such inspections and maintenance had never revealed any concerns relating to the safety of the handrail, nor had Coney Island ever received any complaints from pool patrons relating to the handrail\u2019s safety</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">{\u00b6 6} <em>Keeling Affidavit: </em>Keeling stated that she had worked as a swimming instructor since the mid-1970s and had been intermittently employed in that capacity by Coney Island for almost 20 years. She further proffered that she had received a certificate of water-safety instruction at the beginning of her career and had \u201cmaintained all necessary and appropriate training and certifications since that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">{\u00b6 7} According to Keeling, the class in which Eric Thompson was injured began at 10:15 a.m. on June 24, 1999. She staked that she had not observed the events that led to Eric\u2019s ending up in the pool but that she had jumped in quickly to assist him. She stated that none of the students enrolled in the class participated in horseplay or roughhousing during instruction and that she was not aware of any previous behavior leading to the type of injury experienced by Eric. Indeed, she stated that during her career at Coney Island, she was unaware of any swimming-class student or pool patron injured on the handrail running the length of the deep end of the pool. She also stated that at no time during his enrollment in her class was Andrew Rizkallah acting under her control or direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">{\u00b6 8} In response to the motion for summary judgment by the Coney Island defendants and Keeling, the Thompsons submitted the affidavits of Diana Thompson, Jeffrey Thompson, Eric Thompson, and Allison Osinski, an aquatics expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>{\u00b6 9} <em>Diana Thompson Affidavit: </em>Diana Thompson stated that she had informed Keeling prior to Eric\u2019s swimming instruction that he suffered from spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). She stated that she had told Keeling that this condition created a weakness in Eric\u2019s muscles that would affect his coordination and the rate at which he might be able to perform certain functions. She stated that, on the morning of Eric\u2019s injury, she had entrusted Eric to Keeling\u2019s \u201ccare and custody\u201d and that Keeling had assumed \u201ccontrol and supervision\u201d of her son along with the other students in the class. She stated that she had left the vicinity of the pool but had returned when she heard her son screaming and an announcement over the public-address system requesting that she report to the pool\u2019s office. She stated that, as she got closer to the Sunlight Pool, she saw her son \u201cstruggling to stay afloat as his leg was entrapped in a handrail located at or just below the water line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 10} Diana Thompson also described and provided photographs of a barrier located \u201c[o]n the deck of the pool in the area where this handrail [wa]s located.\u201d She stated that in order for her son to overcome this barrier, he had to have climbed over the barrier and positioned himself on the inner lip of the deck. She stated that she subsequently learned that Keeling had \u201cinstructed the students in the class to position themselves inside the barrier on the lip.\u201d She further stated that on the evening of the accident, she spoke to Keeling, and Keeling told her that she, Keeling, had had to tell Andrew Rizkaflah \u201cto knock it off or to settle down on at least two occasions that day prior to the incident with Eric.\u201d She also stated that in the same conversation, Keeling told her that, after she jumped into the pool to assist Eric, she was not receiving sufficient aid and had to yell to the lifeguard, \u201cWe\u2019re both going to drown. I need help!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 11} <em>Jeffrey Thompson Affidavit: </em>Jeffrey Thompson stated that he personally inspected the Sunlight Pool within a week after his son\u2019s injury and that, aside from taking photographs (photocopies of which were attached), he noticed that the anchors of the handrail were \u201cheavily rustedf,] causing the handrail to pull away from the wall and increasing the gap between the wall and handrail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 12} <em>Eric Thompson Affidavit: </em>Eric Thompson stated that on the morning of his injury, Keeling had instructed the children to climb over the deck barrier and position themselves on the lip of the deep end of the pool. He stated that while on the ledge, he was \u201cpushed or otherwise caused to fall into the pool by another kid in the swimming class.\u201d He stated that while falling, his foot or lower leg became caught between the wall and the handrail. According to Eric, his foot was stuck for \u201ca long period of time,\u201d a situation that caused him \u201cgreat pain and agony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 13} Osinski <em>Affidavit: </em>Osinski identified herself as the principal and owner of Aquatic Consulting Services, located in San Diego, California. She stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>she specialized in providing consultation services for aquatic risk management and aquatic facility design, management, and operation. She stated that she had a Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, a master of sciences from Florida International University, and a bachelor of science in physical education with a specialty in aquatics from Hillsdale College. She stated further that she served on the advisory board to the National Swimming Pool Foundation and on the editorial advisory board for several aquatic publications and journals. She also stated that she held certifications from the National Swimming Pool Foundation, the Association of Underwater Instructors, and the Aquatic Council of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 14} According to Osinski, she had reviewed photographs of the Sunlight Pool. In her view, the handrail violated the standards of the American National Standards Institute (\u201cANSI\u201d), which she described as \u201ca private, non-profit organization that administers and coordinates the U.S. voluntary standardization and conformity assessment system,\u201d as well as the National Pool and Spa Institute (\u201cNPSI\u201d), which she described as \u201can international trade association of more than 5,300 manufacturers, distributors, retailers, service companies and builders in the pool/spa and hot tub industry.\u201d She quoted standards from these organizations that prohibited \u201cprotrusions, extensions, means of entanglement or other obstructions in the swimming area which can cause the entrapment or injury of the user\u201d and that also prohibited ledges beyond a certain size. She also cited swimming-pool design standards promulgated by the Ohio Department of Health in a 1995 publication entitled \u201cDesign Guide \u2014 Public Swimming, Wading, and Diving Pools,\u201d which prohibited \u201cunderwater or overhead projections, or obstructions, which would endanger user safety.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 15} Based upon her view that the Sunlight Pool\u2019s handrail violated ANSI and NPSI standards, Osinski opined that the handrail constituted an \u201cinherently dangerous condition that should have been discovered and recognized by a qualified aquatic safety inspector upon any inspection by a qualified aquatic inspector.\u201d She further stated that the handrail \u201ccould reasonably be foreseen to cause injury to anybody diving or otherwise entering the pool from over the handrail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 16} With regard to the student-instructor ratio of Eric\u2019s swimming class, Osinski stated that while she was aware that certain swimming-instruction programs, such as those provided by the Red Cross and the YMCA, had standards regarding the maximum allowable ratio, she was not able to obtain those standards prior to providing her affidavit. But she expressed her view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>based upon her own experience, knowledge, and training, that one instructor for 50 students \u201cwould not meet any acceptable standard for the instruction and supervision of children in the age range of 9 to 12 years old participating in a swimming instruction class.\u201d She stated that having only one instructor for 50 swimming students \u201cwould have inherently placed such students in a dangerous condition, especially considering that children are involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">(\u00b6 17} Finally, Osinski stated her opinion that \u201cpositioning students (and especially children) in a swimming class so as to dive into a pool over which a handrail is located at or just below the water line and which protrudes out from the wall (such as that at Sunlight Pool) falls below the standard to be expected of swimming instructors\u2019 responsibility for the safety of those in their charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 18} In response to the Thompsons\u2019 memorandum and affidavits opposing summary judgment, the Coney Island defendants and Keeling submitted a further affidavit from Nolting, specifically to rebut the affidavit of Osinski.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 19} <em>Second Nolting Affidavit: </em>Nolting stated that the Sunlight Pool had been inspected by the Ohio Department of Health on an annual basis and that the pool was \u201cnot in violation of the standards developed by the Ohio Department of Health during the summer of 1999.\u201d Attached to Nolting\u2019s affidavit was a copy of the 1999 Ohio Department of Health inspection report for Sunlight Pool. Nolting further stated that, to the best of his knowledge, the standards for public swimming pools developed by the American National Standards Institute, as cited by Osinski, were \u201cmerely instructive\u201d and that the Sunlight Pool was not required to comply with those standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">{\u00b6 20} The Ohio Department of Health inspection report attached to Nolting\u2019s affidavit had numerous points of inspection, including lifeguards, water clarity, water quality, safety, signs and enclosures, recirculation/filtration, structure and fixtures, sanitation, and records. Each category had a checklist, with the last box marked \u201cother\u201d and a direction for the inspector to include any comments. Furthermore, the inspection report had a separate section for any administrative-code violations, including those concerned with pool \u201cdesign requirements.\u201d One of the categories referred to providing or maintaining \u201cladders, treads, stairs, and/or handrails.\u201d Another category referred to providing \u201csafe for patrons\u201d a pool shape, design, \u201cand/or other features.\u201d The report, dated May 26, 1999, bore no negative marks or comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">\n<em>Rizkallah Defendants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">{\u00b6 21} The Rizkallahs filed both a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment. In their motion to dismiss, Jihad and Joanne Rizkallah argued that, pursuant to R.C. 3109.10, they were liable as parents for the conduct of Andrew only if he had \u201cwillfully and maliciously\u201d assaulted Eric \u201cby a means or force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>likely to produce great bodily harm.\u201d They asserted that they were entitled to a dismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) because the Thompsons\u2019 pleading failed to state such a claim and that even if such a claim could be gleaned from the pleadings, the applicable two-year statute of limitations had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">{\u00b6 22} In their contemporaneous motion for summary judgment, the Rizkallahs argued that there was no evidence that as parents they should have foreseen Andrew\u2019s act of pushing Eric into the pool. Consequently, they argued, they could be vicariously liable only under R.C. 3109.10, which did not apply, for the reasons stated in their motion to dismiss. With regard to Andrew\u2019s individual culpability, they argued that the swimming class was a recreational activity and that Andrew\u2019s conduct was neither reckless nor intentional but a foreseeable and natural part of a swimming class involving rambunctious children. In support of their summary judgment motion, the Rizkallahs submitted the affidavit of their son, Andrew.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 23} <em>Andrew Rizkallah Affidavit: </em>Andrew Rizkallah stated that on June 24, 1999, he and Eric Thompson were \u201cplaying around\u201d on the side of the pool, waiting their turn to jump in, when Eric first pushed him into the pool. He stated that being pushed into the pool did not injure him. According to Andrew, he got out and then pushed Eric into the pool without any intent to inflict injury or any idea that Eric might suffer an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">{\u00b6 24} In response to the Rizkallahs\u2019 motions, the Thompsons submitted a second affidavit from Eric Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">{\u00b6 25} <em>Second E\u00f1e Thompson Affidavit: </em>Eric Thompson stated that he was eight years old at the time of his injury. He stated that at no time during the swimming class on the day of his injury did he push anyone, including Andrew Rizkallah, into the swimming pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">ACTION BY THE TRIAL COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">{\u00b6 26} On July 8, 2004, the trial court granted the motions for summary judgment of the Coney Island defendants and Lisa Keeling, as well as that of the Rizkallahs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court stated that Eric Thompson had been a business invitee of the Coney Island defendants and that they had owed him a duty to notify him only of latent defects of which they were aware or should have been aware. Citing the lack of any evidence demonstrating that the handrail had caused any injury in the entire history of the pool, the court concluded that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>evidence that the Coney Island defendants were aware that the handrail posed an unreasonably dangerous hazard. Further, the court rejected the opinion of Osinski as evidence that the Coney Island defendants should have been aware of the hazardous nature of the handrail, stating that Osinski\u2019s opinion was \u201cbelied by the historical facts.\u201d The court determined that no reasonable minds could have concluded that the handrail was latently hazardous on the facts presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 27} The trial court also ruled that the Coney Island defendants and Keeling could not be considered negligent for not stopping Andrew Rizkallah from pushing Eric into the pool. In making this determination, the court noted that there was no evidence that Andrew had previously pushed anyone into the pool. Although the court acknowledged that Diana Thompson had stated in her affidavit that Keeling had told her that Andrew Rizkallah had previously acted up in class, the court reasoned that since there was no evidence that Andrew\u2019s previous horseplay had resulted in his pushing anyone into the pool, the Coney Island defendants were not negligent in failing to address such behavior. The court concluded that Andrew\u2019s act of pushing Eric into the pool was an \u201cintentional instantaneous act which [the Coney Island defendants and Keeling] could not have stopped without having foreknowledge it was about to happen.\u201d The court ruled that Osinski\u2019s opinion that the student-instructor ratio was too high to be safe did not alter this conclusion, because Osinski did not state that a lower ratio would have necessarily prevented Andrew from \u201cpushing Eric into the pool on the spur of the moment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 28} As for the liability of the Rizkallahs for Andrew\u2019s actions, the court ruled that the swimming class was a recreational rather than an educational activity. Citing <em>Marchetti v. Kalish </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 95, 559 N.E.2d 699, the court concluded that Andrew\u2019s act of pushing Eric into the pool could only be actionable, given the recreational nature of the class, if his actions were either reckless or intentional. Finding no evidence that Andrew had attempted to purposefully injure Eric, the court ruled that Andrew\u2019s actions were not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\"><em>First Assignment of Error </em>\u2014 the <em>Coney Island Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"AyG\">{\u00b6 29} In their first assignment of error, the Thompsons assert that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Coney Island defendants. They argue that the Coney Island defendants failed to meet their burden under <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264, to negate the questions of material fact raised by Osinski\u2019s opinion that the Sunlight Pool\u2019s handrail violated ANSI and NPSI aquatic standards. They also argue that questions of material fact were created regarding whether the Coney Island corporate defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>dants had violated their duty as business owners to discover the dangerous condition posed by the handrail in order to protect pool patrons from a latent hazard. Finally, they argue that Osinski\u2019s opinion created a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the Coney Island defendants had failed to provide a safe student-teacher ratio. We consider each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\n<em>ANSI and NPSI Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">{\u00b6 30} Initially, we note that the Thompsons asserted a negligence claim against the Coney Island defendants and not a products-liability claim. A products-liability claim is focused on design concepts and asks simply whether a safer pool could have been built. If a safer design was practicable and would have prevented injury, strict liability is imposed. A negligence claim, on the other hand, is focused away from the drawing board and onto the behavior of the defendants, asking whether such behavior violated a duty of reasonable care.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">{\u00b6 31} Under Ohio law, a business owner\u2019s duty to protect its customers from harm is predicated on the owner\u2019s superior knowledge of a specific condition that threatens injury. <em>Debie v. Cochran Pharmacy-Berwick, Inc. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 38, 40 O.O.2d 52, 227 N.E.2d 603; <em>McGuire v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1996), 118 Ohio App.3d 494, 497, 693 N.E.2d 807; <em>Kolsto v. Old Navy, Inc., </em>1st Dist. No. C-030739, 2004-Ohio-3502, 2004 WL 1486114. A business owner is not an insurer and is not liable based solely on the fact that the premises could have been made safer. See <em>Paschal v. Rite Aid Pharmacy, Inc. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 203, 204, 18 OBR 267, 480 N.E.2d 474. Rather, the business owner has a duty only to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn its customers of any unreasonably dangerous conditions of which it either has knowledge or should have knowledge. <em>Perry v. Eastgreen Realty Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 51, 53, 7 O.O.3d 130, 372 N.E.2d 335. The normative aspect of this requirement precludes a business owner from using willful ignorance to escape liability. The business owner has a duty to inspect the premises to discover possible unsafe conditions and to take reasonable precautions to protect its customers from dangers that are reasonably foreseeable in their use of the premises. Id.; <em>Stinespring v. Natorp Garden Stores, Inc. </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 213, 216, 711 N.E.2d 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">{\u00b6 32} There is absolutely no evidence of record that the Coney Island defendants actually knew that the handrail of the Sunlight Pool posed an unreasonable danger to pool patrons. Indeed, all the evidence is to the contrary. Nolting stated that the handrail had been in existence since the pool was built in 1925 and that it had never caused an injury similar to that suffered by Eric. In an interrogatory, the Coney Island defendants were asked to identify \u201call complaint, injuries, or incidents involving or relating to the Hand Bar.\u201d Their simple answer was \u201cNone.\u201d Additionally, Nolting stated that the pool was subject to yearly inspection by the Ohio Department of Health and that for the year 1999, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>evidenced by the report itself, the Sunlight Pool passed inspection without any negative comments in any area, including pool design.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">{\u00b6 33} As for the ANSI and NPSI standards referred to by Osinski, there is no evidence that the Coney Island defendants were aware of these standards in such a way that they actually caused them to doubt that the handrail was safe notwithstanding its spotless safety record and the pool\u2019s unblemished yearly safety inspection. These standards were relevant,, therefore, only to the extent that they could be used to show that the Coney Island defendants reasonably <em>should </em>have known that the handrail was unsafe. But the problem with this argument is that the record is replete with evidence that the Coney Island defendants had every reason to believe that the handrail was safe, including the fact that the state health department had not raised any issue about the handrail\u2019s safety during its yearly inspections of the pool. Although the standard is normative as to what the Coney Island defendants should have known, the norm is that of a reasonably prudent business owner, not an overly zealous business owner determined to guarantee the absolute safety of its patrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">{\u00b6 34} It should be pointed out that Ohio\u2019s own regulations regarding pool design are quite extensive and specific. See Ohio Adm.Code 3701-31-04. These regulations require handrails for all steps and ladders leading to competitive diving boards, see Ohio Adm.Code 3701-31-04(0(2) and (3), but they are silent as to handrails or handbars inside a pool. Even the most recent design requirements for swimming pools constructed, installed, renovated, or substantially altered after January 1, 1999, are devoid of regulations regarding handrails or handbars. See Ohio Adm.Code 3701-31-04.1. Significantly, the regulations applicable to newer pools adopt ANSI standards for skimmers, filters, and disinfectant filters, as well as ANSI and NPSI standards for recreational diving boards, but they do not make reference to the broader safety standards cited by Osinski in her affidavit. Ohio Adm.Code 3701-31-04.1(K)(1) and (3), and (N)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">{\u00b6 35} The Coney Island defendants cite as persuasive authority the decision of the Tenth Appellate District in <em>Bae v. Dragoo &amp; Assoc., Inc., </em>156 Ohio App.3d 103, 2004-Ohio-544, 804 N.E.2d 1007. In <em>Bae, </em>the plaintiff also employed Osinski as an expert, and she opined that the defendants in that case, despite meeting all administrative-code requirements, were nonetheless negligent for not having automated external defibrillators, electronic or video surveillance systems, and an emergency phone tied directly to rescue services. Rejecting the plaintiffs argument, similar to Thompsons\u2019 here, that Osinski\u2019s opinion was sufficient to create a triable issue of negligence, the court in <em>Bae </em>noted, \u201cContrary to Osinski\u2019s assertions, [the defendant] is simply not required to maintain a perfectly safe pool. Unfortunately, there is no such thing. Rather, [the defendant\u2019s] duty is to keep the premises in a <em>reasonably </em>safe condition.\u201d (Emphasis sic). Id. at \u00b6 24. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Elsewhere, the court stated, \u201cAlthough Osinski testified to numerous ways to make the pool safer than what is required under Ohio law, her testimony does not raise any \u2018genuine\u2019 issues of material fact in this case. Both random inspectors testified that this particular pool was a good pool and that there were no violations of the applicable code during any inspections.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">{\u00b6 36} Similar to the court in <em>Bae, </em>we are convinced that Osinski\u2019s statements regarding ASNI and NPSI aquatic standards were not sufficient to create a triable issue concerning whether the Coney Island defendants knew, or should have known, that the handrail posed a latent hazard. These standards suggest the possibility of a safer pool but do not alter the evidence that the Sunlight Pool was reasonably safe and that the Coney Island defendants had no reason to think otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\n<em>Duty to Discover</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 37} In their second argument under their first assignment of error, the Thompsons stress again their view that the record presented a triable issue concerning whether the Coney Island defendants breached their duty to discover what they allege was the inherently dangerous nature of the handrail. They argue that although the handrail had existed for decades without causing a single injury, the Coney Island defendants remained \u201cblissfully ignorant or blind to the dangerous condition\u201d that the handrail presented. They argue that the Coney Island defendants failed in their duty to inspect the pool for possible dangerous conditions, and they point to the photographic evidence that the handrail was rusting and its anchors loosening or becoming separated from the pool wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 38} As for the photographic evidence that the anchors of the handrail were rusted and had separated from the pool wall, there is nothing in the record that indicates that the condition of the handrail contributed in any way to Eric\u2019s injuries. Without such evidence, the condition of the handrail, as opposed to its existence, was immaterial. There is likewise no evidence that the Coney Island defendants chose to be \u201cblissfully ignorant\u201d of any danger posed by the handrail. Inspectors employed by the Ohio Department of Health inspected the pool yearly. There is no evidence that these inspectors were less than qualified. Likewise, there is no evidence that their inspections were cursory or that the Coney Island defendants had any reason to doubt the validity of their findings. The 1999 report, which is of record, shows that the inspection included pool design and allowed for any negative comments on any design feature that struck the inspector as unsafe or a code violation. There were no negative comments or marks to indicate an unsafe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\"> {\u00b6 39} Combined with the handrail\u2019s accident-free safety record, we do not discern any evidence that would have created a triable issue as to whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Coney Island defendants had failed in their duty to inspect the pool or to have it inspected. Based on the photographs provided by the Thompsons, the handrail, which looks to have protruded from the deck by only a matter of inches and to have been positioned just below, at, or even slightly above water level, appears quite conspicuous and should have been discerned immediately by anyone using or walking by the deep end of the pool. To the extent that it posed any risk, that risk was clearly not latent but open and obvious and easily avoidable. Osinski herself stated that the handrail \u201ccould reasonably be foreseen to cause injury to anybody diving or otherwise entering the pool from over the handrail.\u201d We interpret this to mean simply that anyone using the pool and exercising normal caution would have seen the railing and avoided injuring themselves on it. It is well settled that an owner of property has no duty to warn invitees of an open and obvious danger upon the assumption that invitees will discover such danger and take appropriate measures to protect themselves. <em>Armstrong v. Best Buy Co., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 79, 2003-Ohio-2573, 788 N.E.2d 1088. The open-and-obvious doctrine is viable even after the enactment of Ohio\u2019s comparative-negligence statute. Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\n<em>Student-Instructor Ratio</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 40} As noted, Osinski stated that one instructor for 50 students \u201cwould not meet any acceptable standard for the instruction and supervision of children in the age range of 9 to 12 years old participating in a swimming instruction class.\u201d She stated that having only one instructor for 50 swimming students \u201cwould have inherently placed such students in a dangerous condition, especially considering that children are involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 41} Initially, it should be pointed out that the record does not establish how many students were actually in attendance on the day that Eric Thompson was injured. Keeling was asked in an interrogatory to identify all individuals \u201cwho were registered to participate in or actually participated in the swimming class\u201d in which Eric was injured. Keeling responded by listing the names of 51 students. Because of the way the question was framed, it is unclear how many of the registrants were actually attending class on that day. In other words, as far as the record is concerned, the class could have been either fully or sparsely attended. Significantly, in their amended complaint, the Thompsons alleged that the actual class size was only 40 students. On this basis alone, the relevance of Osinski\u2019s opinion regarding the safety of a 1 to 50 instructor-to-student ratio is subject to debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 42} But even granting the Thompsons the benefit of all reasonable inferences and assuming that all 51 students who registered for the class were in attendance that day \u2014 in other words that no registrants had dropped out or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>decided simply not to come to class \u2014 we are convinced that Osinski\u2019s opinion was only evidence that such a high ratio was \u201cinherently unsafe.\u201d Again, similar to the rusty condition of the handrail, whether or not the student-teacher ratio was \u201cinherently unsafe\u201d was immaterial unless the size of the class could be said to have proximately caused Eric\u2019s injury. Osinski\u2019s opinion did not explain, or even attempt to explain, how the instructor-student ratio caused Eric\u2019s injuries, or how a smaller ratio would have prevented his injury. Critically, there was no evidence presented by either party as to what Keeling was doing, or where she was positioned, at the time Eric was pushed into the pool. As far as the record shows, Keeling could have been either ten feet away from young Eric and Andrew, or 100 yards away. Additionally, there is no evidence of record of how long the horseplay between Andrew and Eric continued \u2014 whether it lasted for minutes or was over as quickly as it began, precluding any sort of adult intervention, even by an adult standing fairly close to the two boys and giving full attention to the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 43} Whether there is a genuine issue of material fact depends on whether the evidence presents \u201ca sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury\u201d or whether it is so \u201cone-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Turner v. Turner </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 337, 340, 617 N.E.2d 1123. Here, the evidence presented by the Thompsons was insufficient to overcome the overwhelming evidence that the Sunlight Pool met all safety requirements under Ohio law, that it was reasonably safe for public use, and that the Coney Island defendants had no reason to suspect otherwise, particularly given the 1999 safety inspection by the Ohio Department of Health that gave no indication of any safety hazards. Furthermore, although the Thompsons presented evidence that the handrail was deteriorating and that a 1 to 50 instructor-student ratio was too high to be considered safe, they presented no evidence that either of these factors played even the slightest role in causing Eric\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 44} Accordingly, the Thompsons\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\n<em>Second Assignment of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b6 45} In their second assignment of error, the Thompsons assert that the record created genuine issues of material fact concerning Keeling\u2019s negligence (and that of the Coney Island defendants under a theory of respondeat superior). They identify three areas of dispute: (1) whether Eric Thompson pushed Andrew Rizkallah into the pool first, (2) whether Keeling had witnessed prior incidents of horseplay between Eric and Andrew on that particular day, and (3) whether, consistent with Osinski\u2019s opinion, Keeling was negligent in positioning the class along the deck of the deep end \u2014 in other words directly over the handrail.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>{\u00b6 46} Without doubt, there was a factual dispute as to whether Eric first pushed Andrew into the pool. Andrew said that he did \u2014 Eric said that he did not. The point was immaterial, however, to Keeling\u2019s negligence without some evidence to show how long the two were engaged in horseplay, regardless of who was doing what to whom. Although the trial court described the incident as \u201cinstantaneous\u201d and \u201cspur of the moment,\u201d the more correct statement is that the record simply does not allow any conclusion with respect to how quickly the boys\u2019 horseplay began and ended. Under these circumstances, without any evidence of the time available \u2014 if any \u2014 for Keeling to have reacted to the mischief between Andrew and Eric, there is simply no basis upon which a trier of fact could reasonably have concluded that Keeling was negligent for not doing more to stop it.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">{\u00b6 47} The evidence that Keeling was aware that Andrew had been involved in previous incidents of horseplay that morning did not change this result. As alluded to by the trial court, the severity of those earlier incidents of horseplay was not shown in the record. Indeed, it is not clear what sort of horseplay Andrew was alleged to have been earlier involved in: whether it was relatively innocuous \u2014 in other words, mostly play \u2014 or whether it involved such obstreperous misbehavior that it threatened class safety and should have resulted in Keeling\u2019s isolating him from the rest of the group, or at least keeping him under closer scrutiny. The trial court correctly reasoned that without evidence that Andrew\u2019s previous misbehavior included shoving a fellow classmate into the pool, there was no basis to conclude that Keeling should have foreseen such behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">{\u00b6 48} Finally, with respect to Osinski\u2019s opinion that it was negligent for Keeling to have positioned the students on the deck of the pool above the handrail, we have previously determined that there was insufficient evidence to create a factual issue as to whether any part or aspect of the Sunlight Pool\u2019s design, including the handrail, was unreasonably unsafe. This being so, it would be illogical to hold that there was evidence that Keeling was negligent simply by having her students line up over the deep end because of the existence of the handrail. Osinski\u2019s opinion, although that of an expert, was clearly premised upon her theory that the handrail was unreasonably dangerous, a theory that we have already determined under the first assignment of error to be insufficient to create a question of material fact, given the handrail\u2019s spotless safety record and inspection history.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\n<em>Third Assignment of Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">{\u00b6 49} As for Andrew\u2019s parents, we hold that they were properly dismissed as defendants for the reasons stated in their motion to dismiss as well as in their motion for summary judgment \u2014 that parental vicarious liability is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>controlled by R.C. 3109.10 and that, aside from the issue of the statute of limitations, there was simply no evidence of record to support a claim that their son Andrew had willfully and maliciously assaulted Eric \u201cby a means or force likely to produce great physical harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">{\u00b6 50} As for Andrew\u2019s individual liability, the parties continue to quarrel in their briefs over whether the swimming class was a recreational or an educational activity. The general rule is that where individuals engage in recreational or sports activities, they assume the ordinary risks of the activity and cannot recover for an injury unless it can be shown that the other party\u2019s actions were either reckless or intentional. <em>Marchetti, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 100, 559 N.E.2d 699. The rule is the same for children and adults. Id. at 99, 559 N.E.2d 699. The rule applies whenever the parties involved are \u201cengaging in some type of recreational or sports activity\u201d regardless of whether it is \u201corganized, unorganized, supervised, or unsupervised.\u201d Id. at 98, 559 N.E.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 51} In <em>Marchetti, </em>the children were engaged in a game of \u201ckick the can,\u201d which the court assumed without analysis fell into the category of either a sport or a recreational activity. Here the question is closer, but we agree with the trial court that swimming lessons, although certainly having safety and educational benefits, are best described as a type of supervised recreational activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">{\u00b6 52} When swimming lessons involve children between the age of 8 and 12, a certain amount of rambunctious behavior, jostling, pushing, and shoving, is perhaps to be expected. While not a contact sport, swimming for children is often an excuse for misbehavior. In any case, the court in <em>Marchetti, </em>and later in <em>Gentry v. Craycraft, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 141, 2004-Ohio-379, 802 N.E.2d 1116, made clear that it wanted to avoid an analysis that attempted to \u201cdelve into the minds of children to determine whether they understand the rules of the recreational or sports activity that they are engaging in\u201d and to focus instead on \u201cthe conduct or actions of the tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Marchetti, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 99, 559 N.E.2d 699. By requiring that a tortfeasor in a recreational activity be found to have acted either recklessly or intentionally before an injured party can recover damages, the court made clear that the tortfeasor must have actually intended the consequences of his act or have known or should have known that his conduct could cause such consequences, thus making his behavior substantially worse than mere negligence. Id. at 100, 559 N.E.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">{\u00b6 53} Here, there was no evidence that Andrew sought to deliberately injure Eric. Andrew denied having such intent. Nothing in the record contradicted this assertion. There is no evidence that the boys bore any particular animus toward each other. And it should be emphasized that there was no evidence that Andrew had singled out Eric for bullying because Eric was afflicted with MSA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Indeed, other than to note their son\u2019s condition, the Thompsons have not alleged any connection between his MSA and the accident. Presumably, all the students in the advanced-beginner class, including Eric, knew how to swim and thus would have been expected to escape injury even if suddenly shoved into the pool. In sum, there was no basis in the record to conclude that Andrew\u2019s conduct was anything but an ill-advised, childish prank that resulted in entirely unforeseen and unimagined consequences when Eric\u2019s foot unfortunately became caught on the handrail, causing the first injury of its kind in the entire history of the pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">{\u00b6 54} Finally, even if a simple negligence standard were to be applied in this case, as Justice Pfeifer noted in his dissent in <em>Gentry, </em>the law of negligence already \u201caffords protection for children from being found negligent for doing the things kids do.\u201d <em>Gentry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 141, 2004-Ohio-379, 802 N.E.2d 1116, at \u00b6 17. \u201cChildren are not chargeable with the same care as persons of mature years. Although children are required to exercise ordinary care * * *, such care, as applied to them, is that degree of care which children of the same age, education, and experience, of ordinary care and prudence, are accustomed to exercise under similar circumstances.\u201d <em>Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Grambo </em>(1921), 103 Ohio St. 471, 134 N.E. 648, paragraph one of the syllabus. In this case, we reiterate that there is no evidence that Andrew could have foreseen any injury to Eric by pushing him into the pool other than his getting suddenly and unwillingly wet. Absent any such evidence, Andrew\u2019s conduct could only be described as childish misbehavior typical of \u201cthe things kids do,\u201d but not, on this record, actionable negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 55} Based on the above analysis, we overrule the Thompsons\u2019 three assignments of error in their appeal, numbered C-040508, and the identical three assignments of error in ChoiceCare\u2019s appeal, numbered C-040544.
