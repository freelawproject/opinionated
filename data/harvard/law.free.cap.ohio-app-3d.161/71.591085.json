Lewis, appeals the July 14, 2004 judgment entry of Delaware Court of Common Pleas dismissing his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-17\">{\u00b6 2} Appellees are the Delaware County Joint Vocational School District (\u201cJVSD\u201d) Board of Education and Dr. Patricia Foor, superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-18\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b108-19\">{\u00b6 3} The relevant facts contained in plaintiff-appellant\u2019s complaint are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-20\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant was employed by the Ohio Department of Education as Methods of Administration, Office of Civil Rights Coordinator (\u201cMOA-OCR\u201d). As MOA-OCR, appellant\u2019s job was to ensure that all local school districts follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the federal guidelines requiring that equal educational opportunities and services be offered to all employees and students, regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, or disability. Appellant was employed in this position for 14 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">{\u00b6 5} As part of his job, appellant was to investigate allegations made by David L. Swoope Jr., Ph.D., regarding discrimination, harassment, and abuse of students with disabilities at Delaware JVSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">{\u00b6 6} On February 23, 2001, appellant sent a letter to appellee Foor, communicating the alleged discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant conducted an on-site interview with appellees, wherein appellant conducted individual interviews with coordinators, counselors, and other personnel at Delaware County JVSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">{\u00b6 8} On March 9, 2001, appellant submitted an on-site activity report to his immediate supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">{\u00b6 9} Foor had discussions with appellant\u2019s supervisors regarding appellant\u2019s ongoing investigation and audit of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">{\u00b6 10} On or about March 8, 2001, Foor solicited notarized statements from the coordinators and counselors and sent them to the Ohio Department of Education. The statements alleged the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">{\u00b6 11} (a) That on March 8, 2001, appellant urinated on her floor in both the morning and the afternoon;</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">{\u00b6 12} (b) That appellant made threatening statements, both verbally and in writing, concerning appellee\u2019s operation;</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">{\u00b6 13} (c) That appellant was on a witch hunt;</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">{\u00b6 14} (d) That appellant accused appellee Foor of \u201chiding problems\u201d and said that he questioned the honesty of each coordinator and counselor;</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">{\u00b6 15} (e) That appellant accused Foor of discriminating against Dr. Swoope, stating that \u201cat the very least they will have to pay back wages denied him because of the injury and allow him to go on disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">{\u00b6 16} (f) That appellant stated, \u201cWhen [we] release the information about the school, the district will not be able to pass a levy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">{\u00b6 17} As a result, appellant was removed from the investigation of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-18\">{\u00b6 18} On June 8, 2001, appellant resigned from his position with the Ohio Department of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-19\">{\u00b6 19} On May 14, 2003, appellant filed a complaint in Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-20\">{\u00b6 20} On October 16, 2003, appellant filed an Amended Complaint alleging slander and libel by appellees Delaware County JVSD Board of Education and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Dr. Patricia Foor, superintendent, claiming that the above statements and publications were defamatory in nature, were false, and were published willfully and with malice. Appellant further claimed that, by reason of their publication, he was injured in his professional career, was forced into retirement, suffered an irreversible and debilitating stroke, injured his credit and reputation, and suffered great pain and anguish. Appellant demanded judgment in the amount of $1,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">{\u00b6 21} On February 2, 2004, appellees filed a motion to dismiss, alleging insufficient service of process, improper venue, expiration of the statute of limitations, and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">{\u00b6 22} On February 27, 2004, appellant filed a motion to transfer venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">{\u00b6 23} On May 7, 2004, the case was transferred to Delaware County Common Pleas Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">{\u00b6 24} On July 14, 2004, the trial court granted the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s amended complaint on statute-of-limitations grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">{\u00b6 25} Appellant now appeals, assigning the following errors for review:</p>\n<p id=\"AHH\">ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cI. The trial court misapplied the rule of publication in the plaintiffs defamation action and thus misapplied the statute of limitations. The cause of action did not accrue until May 15, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cII. The trial court erred by failing to apply the discovery rule under R.C. 2305.11(A).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">{\u00b6 28} We will address appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error together as they both challenge the trial court\u2019s decision to grant appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss on statute-of-limitations grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">{\u00b6 29} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court misapplied the rule of publication, thus misapplying the statute of limitations. In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to apply the discovery rule under R.C. 2305.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">{\u00b6 30} The trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">{\u00b6 31} Civ. R. 12(B)(6) provides the trial court with an opportunity to review the complaint and avoid unnecessary litigation if, construing as true all the material allegations in the complaint, and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the nonmoving party, it nevertheless finds that the plaintiff could prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>her to relief. See <em>Hester v. Dwivedi </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 575, 733 N.E.2d 1161. The trial court\u2019s review is limited to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">{\u00b6 32} Our standard of reviewing a trial court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) is de novo, because it presents a question of law. <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs. Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981. A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is procedural and tests the sufficiency of the complaint. <em>State ex rel. Hanson v. Guernsey Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 545, 605 N.E.2d 378. Under a de novo analysis, we must accept all factual allegations of the complaint as true and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Byrd v. Faber </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 56, 565 N.E.2d 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">{\u00b6 33} To prevail on a libel claim, a plaintiff must prove five elements: \u201c(1) a false and defamatory statement, (2) about plaintiff, (3) published without privilege to a third party, (4) with fault of at least negligence on the part of the defendant, and (5) that was either defamatory per se or caused special harm to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Gosden v. Louis </em>(1996), 116 Ohio App.3d 195, 206, 687 N.E.2d 481. Defamatory matter is defined as that which is injurious to another\u2019s reputation. <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974), 418 U.S. 323, 345-346, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">{\u00b6 34} The trial court concluded that R.C. 2305.11 requires that a complaint for libel, slander, or malicious prosecution must be commenced within a year after the cause of action occurred. For this reason, the trial court dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">{\u00b6 35} Appellant argues that his cause of action did not accrue until May 15, 2002, the date the publication containing the allegedly defamatory remarks regarding appellant was released to appellant by the Ohio Civil Rights Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">{\u00b6 36} Upon review of the instant action, we find that appellant\u2019s complaint raises a claim of defamation that is subject to the statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.11(A). That statute provides: \u201cAn action for libel [or] slander * * * shall be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrued * * *.\u201d R.C. 2305.11(A). A cause of action for defamation accrues upon the date of publication of the defamatory matter. <em>Reimund v. Brown </em>(Nov. 2, 1995), Franklin App. No. 95APE04-487, 1995 WL 643939; <em>Hackney v. Community Journal </em>(Feb. 21, 1995), Clermont App. No. CA94-07-052, 1995 WL 70183.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">{\u00b6 37} We find that the allegedly slanderous statements were published in March 2001, more than one year before the original complaint was filed on May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>14, 2003. That was the only time appellees made the allegedly defamatory statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">{\u00b6 38} With regard to appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court should have applied the discovery rule, we find that the date of publication and not the discovery thereof is the time for accrual of such an action. <em>Snell v. Drew </em>(Nov. 1, 1985), Lucas App. No. L-85-074, at 4, 1985 WL 8216; <em>Rainey v. Shaffer </em>(1983), 8 Ohio App.3d 262, 8 OBR 354, 456 N.E.2d 1328; <em>Palmer v. Westmeyer </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 296, 549 N.E.2d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">{\u00b6 39} Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">{\u00b6 40} Accordingly, the judgment of the Delaware County Common Pleas Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-8\">Gwin and William B. Hoffman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
