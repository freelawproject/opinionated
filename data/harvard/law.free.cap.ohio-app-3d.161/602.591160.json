As part of her responsibilities, Morris worked with adolescents with drug and alcohol problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">{\u00b6 3} ODADAS conducted a formal hearing alleging that Morris had failed to meet the standards for continued licensure with the department. On April 7, 2004, ODADAS found that Morris had violated two CCDC rules of ethics, including fraudulently amending and knowingly making incorrect entries or failing to make timely essential entries into the client record and signing or issuing, in the CCDC\u2019s professional capacity, a document or statement that the CCDC knows to contain a false or misleading statement. ODADAS determined that Morris had committed these ethical violations by writing case notes for some counseling sessions that had never occurred, by purposefully changing the date that counseling sessions had occurred, in order to ensure that Medicaid would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>pay for the session, and by making false or incorrect entries into clients\u2019 records. As a result, ODADAS suspended Morris\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">{\u00b64} Morris appealed the administrative decision to the Richland County Court of Common Pleas. ODADAS moved the trial court to dismiss the appeal due to Morris\u2019s failure to perfect her appeal by filing a copy (i.e., not the original) of the notice of appeal with the agency. The original notice of appeal was filed with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">{\u00b6 5} By judgment entry, on July 26, 2004, the trial court determined that the administrative decision was based upon hearsay and that appellant had not been afforded the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses accusing her. The trial court concluded that Morris\u2019s suspension resulted from \u201cunreliable evidence and the hearing officer was in no position to judge the credibility of the reporter or the witnesses.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court ordered ODADAS to conduct a new hearing before the administrative agency and to give Morris the opportunity to confront and cross-examine the actual witnesses accusing her of failure to perform as required. The trial court reversed the administrative decision to suspend Morris\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant ODADAS now appeals the July 26, 2004 judgment entry of the Richland County Court of Common Pleas, assigning the following as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cI. The lower court incorrectly determined it had jurisdiction to hear Ms. Morris\u2019 appeal when she failed to strictly comport with R.C. 119.12\u2019s requirements as the Ohio Supreme Court and Fifth District precedent require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cII. The lower court abused its discretion in determining that ODADAS\u2019 order was not supported by reliable evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">{\u00b6 9} ODADAS maintains that Morris failed to follow the statutory guidelines set forth in R.C. 119.12 in perfecting her appeal by filing the original notice of appeal with the trial court and a copy with the agency. As a result, ODADAS concludes that Morris\u2019s failure deprives the trial court of jurisdiction to hear the administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 119.12 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cAny party desiring to appeal [any order of an agency suspending a license] shall file a notice of appeal with the agency setting forth the order appealed from and the grounds of the party\u2019s appeal. A copy of such notice of appeal shall also be filed by the appellant with the court. Unless otherwise provided by law relating to a particular agency, such notices of appeal shall be filed within fifteen days after the mailing of the notice of the agency\u2019s order as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>provided in this section. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a determination appealed pursuant to division (C) of section 119.092 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">{\u00b6 12} ODADAS maintains that the statute requires strict compliance with the conditions of the statute before an appeal is perfected. ODADAS argues that strict compliance with the statute requires that the <em>original </em>notice of appeal be filed with the administrative agency and a <em>copy of </em>the notice be filed with the appropriate common pleas court within 15 days after the mailing of the agency\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"ACn\">order. ODADAS relies upon this court\u2019s prior opinion in <em>Campbell v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 615, 2004-Ohio-1575, 808 N.E.2d 412. In <em>Campbell, </em>this court determined that filing a copy of the notice of appeal with the state agency does not meet the requirements set forth in R.C. 119.12 relative to filing the original with the agency. <em>Campbell </em>held that, in such cases, the trial court does not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">{\u00b6 13} Upon reconsideration of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Campbell, </em>we now find the opinion to be in error \u2014 it gives precedence to form over substance. It has been held many times in Ohio that all pleadings must be liberally construed to do substantial justice. The current Civil Rules were designed to permit a more simplified approach to pleading and evolved as a response to the earlier rules, which emphasized highly technical form over substance. We recognize that our decision conflicts with the opinions of the Eighth and Tenth District Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">{\u00b6 15} In the second assignment of error, ODADAS argues that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that ODADAS\u2019s order was not supported by reliable evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">{\u00b6 16} The Ohio Civil Rules are not applicable in administrative proceedings. Civ. R. 1(A). Therefore, the agency was not bound by the rules of evidence and could consider the alleged hearsay reports and testimony without affording Morris the opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">{\u00b6 17} We note, however, that had the administrative decision been based solely on hearsay evidence, we would not find that the trial court had abused its discretion in reversing ODADAS\u2019s decision. But the administrative determination was also based upon Morris\u2019s own testimony and admissions regarding violations. Morris testified at the hearing that she had admitted to her supervisors that she knowingly failed to keep accurate client records, and since Medicaid pays for only one counseling session per day per client, she knowingly changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>the date of some records to ensure that Medicaid would pay. She further admitted to falsifying two of her case notes. Upon review of the evidence, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in reversing the administrative decision and ordering ODADAS to conduct a new hearing. The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">(\u00b6 18} Accordingly, the July 26, 2004 judgment entry of the Richland County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and the administrative decision is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b642-7\">Boggins, P.J., and Gwin, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
