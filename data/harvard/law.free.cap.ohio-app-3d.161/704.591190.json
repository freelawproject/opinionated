The building permit application specified for the construction of a new residence without an attached garage. The land on which Briggs asked to build his residence was zoned an agriculture district; therefore, Briggs subsequently filed an application for a zoning permit. On this application, Briggs asked to construct a new residence with a garage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With the permits, Briggs submitted a sketch of where the residence and a garage would be located. Both permits were granted, and the residence was built; however, Briggs did not construct a garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">{\u00b6 4} Two years later, in 2001, the Dinsmore Township Zoning code was amended to prohibit the construction of garages and outbuildings in the front yards of residences. The amendment prohibited Briggs from building an at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tached garage at the location on his property according to Briggs\u2019s original residential sketch.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">{\u00b6 5} In 2004, Briggs decided to commence a metal-fabrication business on his property. Accordingly, on March 24, 2004, he filed an application for a zoning variance, which requested permission to build an \u201cAccessory Building (separate garage) built in front of residence which will operate as a small fabricating shop.\u201d A hearing was held on June 2, 2004, and on July 14, 2004, the board denied the application for a zoning variance, stating the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\n<em>Findings of Fact:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">1. Granting the variance is not in accord with the general purpose and intent of regulations in that the general intent and purpose is not keep all accessory buildings no nearer to [the] front line than the principal use of structure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">2. The granting of the variance would not permit the establishment of any use not otherwise permitted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">3(a) There are no special circumstances or conditions applicable to the land or structure sought which are peculiar to such land or structure which do not apply generally to land or structures in the area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">(b) Denial of the variance would not deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">4. The hardship complained of is self-created by the applicant in that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">(a) Landowner/applicant has made the decision to attempt the construction and use of accessory building in a location in front of the principal residence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-12\">(b) Landowner failed to timely construct building at time that had a building permit that might have contemplated the accessory building and failed to construct the building prior to changes in zoning for which he now makes a variance request;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-13\">5. The variance is not necessary for the reasonable use of the land for its primary purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-14\">6. The variance would not impair adequate supply of light or air to adjacent properties, substantially increase congestion, increase danger of fire, endanger public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values of adjacent areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-15\">Conclusions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-16\">1. An examination of the 1999 building permit application does not reflect a request for an accessory building as the only box checked was for the principal residence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>2. Applicant failed to timely construct any accessory building before current zoning went into effect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">3. Since the proposed variance is not within the general purpose of the area, there are no unique or special circumstances justifying the granting of a variance, it would not deny applicant the reasonable use of his property for its principal use, and the claimed hardship is self-created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">{\u00b6 6} Briggs appealed this ruling to the Shelby County Court of Common Pleas. The common pleas court reversed and vacated the board\u2019s decision, stating that \u201cBriggs has shown by a preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence that there is no reasonable basis for the board to have denied the application for the variance.\u201d The board appeals, alleging one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">No evidence was presented in this case to justify the granting of a variance so as to allow a business use on a residential property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">R.C. 2506.04 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">The court may find that the order, adjudication, or decision is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record. Consistent with its findings, the court may affirm, reverse, vacate, or modify the order, adjudication, or decision, or remand the cause to the officer or body appealed from with instructions to enter an order, adjudication, or decision consistent with the findings or opinion of the court. The judgment of the court may be appealed by any party on questions of law as provided in the Rules of Appellate Procedure and, to the extent not in conflict with those rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">{\u00b6 7} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that an appellate court has a limited standard of review in an R.C. 2506.04 appeal. <em>Henley v. Youngstown Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 142, 147, 735 N.E.2d 433. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-11\">Construing the language of R.C. 2506.04, we have distinguished the standard of review to be applied by the common pleas courts and the courts of appeals in R.C. Chapter 2506 administrative appeals. The common pleas court considers the \u201cwhole record,\u201d including any new or additional evidence admitted under R.C. 2506.03, and determines whether the administrative order is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-12\">The standard of review to be applied by the court of appeals in an R.C. 2506.04 appeal is <em>\u201cmore limited </em>in scope.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Kisil v. Sandusky </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 30, 34, 12 OBR 26, 465 N.E.2d 848. \u201cThis statute grants a more limited power to the court of appeals to review the judgment of the common pleas court only on \u2018questions of law,\u2019 which does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>include the same extensive power to weigh \u2018the preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence,\u2019 as is granted to the common pleas court.\u201d Id. at fn. 4. \u201cIt is incumbent on the trial court to examine the evidence. Such is not the charge of the appellate court. * * * The fact that the court of appeals, or this court, might have arrived at a different conclusion than the administrative agency is immaterial. Appellate courts must not substitute their judgment for those of an administrative agency or a trial court absent the approved criteria for doing so.\u201d <em>Lorain City School Dish Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 261, 533 N.E.2d 264.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">This court has held that in administrative appeals under R.C. 2506.04, \u201c[w]ithin the ambit of \u2018questions of law\u2019 for appellate court review would be abuse of discretion [sic] by the common pleas court.\u201d <em>Kisil, </em>supra, at fn. 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Id. at 147-148, 735 N.E.2d 433. An abuse of discretion implies that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">{\u00b6 8} Section 1111 of the Dinsmore Township Zoning Ordinance lists six factors that must be satisfied before a zoning board can grant a variance. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">1. The granting of the variance is in accord with the general purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this Resolution and the district in which it is located, and will not be injurious to the area or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">2. The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of any use not otherwise permitted in the district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-11\">3. There exists special circumstances or conditions applicable to the land or structures for which the variance is sought which are peculiar to such land or structures, which do not apply generally to land or structures in the area, and which are such that the strict application of the provisions of this Resolution would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of such land or structures. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance; there must be deprivation of the beneficial use of land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-12\">4. Hardship will be created by the strict application of this Resolution. It is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that greater profit would result if the variance were granted. The hardship complained of cannot be self-created, and must be suffered directly by the property in question. Evidence of variances granted under similar circumstances need not be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>5. The granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or structures, and the variance requested is the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">6. The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values of the adjacent area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">{\u00b6 9} In the instant case, the trial court relied on <em>Burkholder v. Twinsburg Twp. Bd. of Zoning </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 339, 701 N.E.2d 766, in reversing and vacating the board\u2019s decision to deny the application for a variance. <em>Burkholder, </em>which is essentially a reiteration and application of the Ohio Supreme Court opinion <em>Duncan v. Middlefield </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 83, 23 OBR 212, 491 N.E.2d 692, held that in order to grant an area variance to a zoning ordinance, a landowner must demonstrate \u201cpractical difficulties\u201d \u2014 i.e., an unreasonable deprivation caused by a zoning requirement \u2014 in complying with a zoning regulation. <em>Burkholder, </em>122 Ohio App.3d at 343, 701 N.E.2d 766. In determining whether a landowner has suffered an unreasonable deprivation in the use of his property, a reviewing court must weigh the seven factors established in <em>Duncan </em>to determine whether the private interests outweigh the public interest. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court in the case sub judice balanced the seven <em>Duncan </em>factors and concluded that \u201cBriggs has shown by a preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence that there is no reasonable basis for the board to have denied the application for the variance.\u201d After reviewing this decision, however, we conclude that the application of the \u201cpractical difficulties\u201d standard as outlined in <em>Duncan </em>and <em>Burkholder </em>constitutes an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>In re Appeal of Am. Outdoor Advertising, L.L.C., </em>3rd Dist. No. 14-02-27, 2003-Ohio-1820, 2003 WL 1835525, at \u00b6 8-9, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">In two cases involving municipal corporations, the Ohio Supreme Court adopted separate standards for determining the appropriateness of use and area variances, holding that a use variance should be granted whenever a property owner demonstrates that the literal enforcement of the zoning regulation to his property creates an \u201cunnecessary hardship,\u201d and an area variance should be granted whenever a property owner demonstrates that a zoning regulation causes \u201cpractical difficulties.\u201d <em>[Kisil, </em>12 Ohio St.3d at 32, 12 OBR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>26, 465 N.E.2d 848; <em>Duncan v. Middlefield </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 83, 86, 23 OBR 212, 491 N.E.2d 692.] However, unlike municipalities, the authority of townships to enact zoning ordinances is not inherent, nor does it derive from a constitutional provision; instead, the Ohio Legislature, pursuant to R.C. Chapter 519, grants townships the authority, as a police power, to adopt and enforce zoning regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">R.C. 519.14 does not distinguish between a use and an area variance and does not mention the practical difficulties standard. Rather, R.C. 519.14(B) explicitly authorizes the granting of variances from a township resolution where \u201ca literal enforcement of the resolution will result in an unnecessary hardship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">(Citation and footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">{\u00b6 12} It is clear that Dinsmore <em>Township </em>is a township subject to Title V of the Ohio Revised Code, and Section 1111 of the Dinsmore Township Zoning Ordinance encompasses approximately the same standard established in R.C. 519.14(B). Specifically, Section 1111 of the Dinsmore Township Zoning Ordinance requires that an applicant show, inter alia, necessity and hardship. Nevertheless, when reviewing the board\u2019s decision, the trial court in the instant case applied the \u201cpractical difficulties\u201d standard pursuant to <em>Burkholder </em>and <em>Duncan, </em>not the \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d standard outlined in R.C. 519.14 and Section 1111 of the Dinsmore Township Zoning Ordinance. Accordingly, this constitutes an abuse of discretion, and the assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">{\u00b6 13} In conclusion, we remand this case to the trial court for a determination whether pursuant to R.C. 519.14 and Section 1111 of the Dinsmore Township Zoning Ordinance, the board\u2019s decision to deny Briggs\u2019s application for a variance is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b746-10\">Cupp, P.J., and Bryant, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-15\">. The application for zoning permit did not state whether the garage was attached to the residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-9\">. See <em>Henley, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 148, 735 N.E.2d 433 (holding that an appeals court did not exceed the proper scope of review under R.C. 2506.04 when it sought to determine whether a local zoning regulation applied to the undisputed facts in the record, or whether the common pleas court abused its discretion by failing to apply the local zoning regulation).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
