Among the defendants named who may have or claim an interest in the property was appellant, Key Funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">{\u00b6 3} The summons and complaint in the matter were served on appellant by certified mail on April 1, 2004. When, on July 19, 2004, neither the Hulls nor appellant had answered or otherwise responded to the complaint, FNMA moved for and was granted a default judgment against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">{\u00b6 4} On July 28, 2004, appellant moved for leave to file an answer, stating that \u201cdue to inadvertence, the summons and complaint herein were misdirected and/or misplaced by defendant, Key Funding, and therefore not forwarded to counsel until recently.\u201d On August 27, 2004, appellant filed a motion to vacate the default judgment, pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B)(1). The motion reiterates appellant\u2019s assertion that the summons and complaint were \u201cmisdirected\u201d and asserts that it has a meritorious defense to present, namely a mortgage interest in the property as \u201cattached hereto as exhibit \u2018B\u2019 The record contains no exhibit associated with this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court set a nonoral hearing on the motion. Prior to the hearing, FNMA responded to appellant\u2019s motion, favoring vacation of the default judgment. On September 17, 2004, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c[Appellant] has made no showing justifying relief on the ground of mistake or inadvertence. There is no evidence before the Court from which the Court could draw such a conclusion. Counsel\u2019s statement that the summons and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>complaint were \u2018misdirected\u2019 is not evidence and, even if such statement were set forth in an affidavit of [an appellant] employee, it would be insufficient by itself to warrant relief from judgment. Neglect is conduct that \u2018falls substantially below what is reasonable under the circumstances.\u2019 To determine whether neglect is excusable or is the result of inadvertence or mistake, the Court must have before it the* circumstances from which to draw those conclusions. Because [appellant] failed to offer any evidence to the Court in support of its motions, it is not entitled to have the default judgment against it vacated and it is not entitled to leave to file its answer <em>instanter.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 7} From this order, appellant now brings this appeal. Appellant insists that without opposition to its motion by an opposing party, the trial court erred in denying the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cTo prevail on a motion brought under Civ. R. 60(B), the movant must demonstrate that: (1) the party has a meritorious defense or claim to present if relief is granted; (2) the party is entitled to relief under one of the grounds stated in Civ. R. 60(B)(1) through (5); and (3) the motion is made within a reasonable time, and, where the grounds of relief are Civ. R. .60(B)(1), (2) or (3), not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.\u201d <em>GTE Automatic Elec. v. ARC Industries, Inc. </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146, 1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113, paragraph two of the syllabus. If any of these elements are not met, the motion should be denied. <em>Svoboda v. Brunswick </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 348, 351, 6 OBR 403, 453 N.E.2d 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\"> {\u00b6 9} The decision as to whether relief should be granted rests in the sound discretion of the court, <em>Griffey v. Rajan </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 75, 77, 514 N.E.2d 1122, and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. An abuse of discretion implicates an attitude by the court that is arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">{\u00b6 10} Even though appellant omitted exhibit B from his motion, there is ample other evidence of its claim in the record. This is sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the <em>GTE </em>test. See <em>Moore v. Emmanuel Family Training Ctr. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 64, 67, 479 N.E.2d 879. Since appellant\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B)(1) motion was filed only a few weeks after the default judgment was entered, the third <em>GTE </em>prong also appears to be met.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">{\u00b6 11} At issue is whether appellant properly demonstrated to the court that its failure to timely answer the complaint was because of \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect,\u201d pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B)(1). Appellant\u2019s position seems to be that because no party opposes the motion and, indeed, FNMA expressly supported the motion, its unsupported assertion that the delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>was the result of \u201cmistake or inadvertence\u201d should be sufficient. The trial court clearly did not share this opinion, demanding evidence of the circumstances precipitating appellant\u2019s failure to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"> {\u00b6 12} Civ.R. 60(B) is a remedial rule and should be liberally construed. In so doing, the court should balance the sometimes conflicting principles that litigation should be timely concluded and effect a just result. <em>Colley v. Bazell </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 243, 248, 18 O.O.3d 442, 416 N.E.2d 605. The decision as to whether a party\u2019s ground for relief was the result of an excusable mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect \u201cmust of necessity take into consideration all the surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d Id. at 249, 18 O.O.3d 442, 416 N.E.2d 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 13} As to the measure of evidence sufficient to demonstrate the surrounding facts and circumstances, this case is similar to <em>Rose Chevrolet, Inc. v. Adams </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 17, 520 N.E.2d 564. In <em>Rose, </em>the auto dealer sued Adams on a debt. When Adams failed to timely answer the complaint, Rose sought and obtained default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 14} The day following the entry of the default, Adams moved for relief from judgment based on \u201cinadvertence and excusable neglect.\u201d Id. at 18, 520 N.E.2d 564. No evidence by affidavit or otherwise was submitted to support the motion. There was a hearing on the motion, following which the trial court denied relief, concluding that any inadvertence or neglect was inexcusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">{\u00b6 15} On appeal, the transcript of the motion hearing was not included in the record. Consequently, the court of appeals, relying wholly on Adams\u2019s motion and memorandum in support, concluded that, given the lack of evidentiary materials to support an allegation of excusable neglect, the trial court acted within its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">{\u00b6 16} The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[0]ur review of the trial court\u2019s judgment is restricted to appellant\u2019s memorandum in support of the motion. This memorandum recited that the motion is \u2018based upon inadvertence and excusable neglect\u2019 and that \u2018[cjounsel for defendant had previously prepared an answer* * *.\u2019 No explanation is provided for this assertion, and no facts are set forth to bolster appellant\u2019s position. In short, the trial judge is given no basis whatsoever to make a factual determination on the question of whether the neglect is excusable or inexcusable, or whether the failure to file an answer was inadvertent. It is true that neither Civ. R. 60(B) itself nor any decision from this court has required the movant to submit evidence, in the form of affidavits or otherwise, in support of the motion, although such evidence is certainly advisable in most cases. But the least that can be required of the movant is to enlighten the court as to why relief should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>granted. The burden is upon the movant to demonstrate that the interests of justice demand the setting aside of a judgment normally accorded finality. A mere allegation that the movant\u2019s failure to file a timely answer was due to \u2018excusable neglect and inadvertence,\u2019 without any elucidation, cannot be expected to warrant relief.\u201d Id., 36 Ohio St.3d at 20-21, 520 N.E.2d 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">{\u00b6 18} The <em>Rose </em>language quoted seems less than definitive. The submission of evidence is \u201cadvisable in most cases.\u201d In some circumstances, the submission of evidence may be omitted. We take this to mean that when the attorney submitting the memorandum also asserts his or her own responsibility for the mistake or neglect at issue, the memorandum operates as an affidavit substitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 19} In the present matter, the motion blames neglect on appellant\u2019s office procedures, even though it offers no explanation of what occurred. The trial court concluded that the summary assertion of neglect or inadvertence, without explanation \u2014 even if submitted in affidavit form from someone competent to testify \u2014 was insufficient for the movant to meet its burden. However, we must note the narrow circumstances in this case. Appellee FNMA in its response to Key Funding\u2019s motion to vacate stated that it had no objection to vacation of the default judgment to \u201cassert its mortgage lien in this action, which interest is junior in priority to Plaintiffs interest in the property.\u201d FNMA further submitted a proposed amended judgment entry vacating the default judgment and protecting <em>appellant\u2019s </em>interest in the property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, the trial court ignored the obvious wishes of the parties, which, to them, was to effect a just result. In our opinion, under these narrow circumstances, the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for relief from judgment was unreasonable and therefore an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is found well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 20} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Huron County Court of Common Pleas is reversed. This matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b479-9\">Arlene Singer, P.J., and Mark L. Pietrykowski, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b479-10\">Dennis M. Parish, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-13\">. We note that appellee did not file a brief in the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b479-11\">Parish, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">{\u00b6 21} I respectfully dissent. The Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that a trial court\u2019s decision should be found unreasonable only \u201cif there is <em>no sound </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>reasoning process </em>that would support that decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>AAAA Ent., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597. Further, \u201c[a]n appellate court is not permitted to find an abuse of discretion merely because it would have arrived at a different result if it had reviewed the matter <em>de novo.\u201d Swearingen v. Waste Tech. Indus. </em>(1999), 184 Ohio App.3d 702, 714, 731 N.E.2d 1229, citing <em>AAAA Ent., Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 22} In this case, the only evidence of inadvertence or excusable neglect before the trial court was appellant\u2019s own admission that it did not forward the complaint to its attorney in a timely manner. As stated by the majority, the record shows that the trial court took those circumstances into account and found the explanation lacking. Despite the adverse impact on appellant, I cannot say that the trial court engaged in unsound reasoning before denying appellant\u2019s motion to vacate. Accordingly, I would find no abuse of discretion and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
