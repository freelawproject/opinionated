On November 21, 2003, appellee voluntarily dismissed Alan Brown. On January 27, 2004, appellee filed its first amended complaint against defendants Aloha Sports, Inc., and appellant, asserting breach of contract. Appellee also contended that appellant so dominated and controlled Aloha Sports, Inc., that the corporation was appellant\u2019s \u201calter ego,\u201d thereby asserting appellee\u2019s intent to \u201cpierce the corporate veil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">{\u00b6 3} On April 24, 2004, trial was held before the magistrate. On July 7, 2004, the magistrate issued his findings of fact and conclusions of law. The magistrate concluded that both Aloha Sports, Inc., and appellant would be held individually, jointly, and severally liable in the amount of $14,833.17 plus interest and costs. On July 21, 2004, appellant objected to the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law; however, appellant failed to file a transcript or affidavit in support of his factual objections pursuant to Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(b). On August 12, 2004, the trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and conclusions. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Appellant asserts the following assignments of error for our consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[1.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant in piercing the corporate veil, and finding defendant liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c[2.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant in finding that Plaintiff satisfied Prong 1 of the \u2018Belvedere\u2019 test.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[3.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant-appellant in finding that Plaintiff satisfied Prong 3 of the \u2018Belvedere\u2019 test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant\u2019s three assigned errors relate, in sum, to the tripartite test set forth by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Belvedere Condominium Unit Owners\u2019 Assn. v. R.E. Roark Cos., Inc. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 274, 617 N.E.2d 1075. For the sake of continuity, therefore, we shall address them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">{\u00b6 9} Before addressing the merits of appellant\u2019s contentions, we must address a procedural concern alluded to above: Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(c) provides that \u201c[a]ny objection to a finding of fact shall be supported by a transcript of all the evidence submitted to the magistrate relevant to that fact or an affidavit of that evidence if a transcript is not available.\u201d The objecting party bears the burden of submitting a transcript or affidavit to the trial court. <em>Walther v. Newsome, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-P-0019, 2003-Ohio-4723, 2003 WL 22070723, at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">{\u00b6 10} Here, appellant filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision; the objections were both factual and legal in nature. However, the record includes neither a transcript of the proceedings nor a suitable substitute that would permit review of the evidence heard by the magistrate. Where an objecting party fails to provide the evidentiary statements contemplated by Civ.R. 53(E)(3)(c), she may not argue issues of fact on appeal. Id. Rather, \u201can appeal under these circumstances can be reviewed by the appellate court to determine whether the trial court\u2019s application of the law to its factual findings constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Duncan v. Chippewa Twp. Trustees </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 728, 730, 654 N.E.2d 1254. An abuse of discretion involves more than an error of law; it suggests that the court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>State ex rel. Edwards v. Toledo City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 106, 107, 647 N.E.2d 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">{\u00b6 11} With this standard in mind, the trial court\u2019s adoption of the magistrate\u2019s decision hinges on whether the magistrate properly applied the test set forth in <em>Belvedere, </em>supra. To the extent that the lower court did not act arbitrarily or unreasonably in its adoption of the magistrate\u2019s analysis, we will not disturb its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>{\u00b6 12} In <em>Belvedere, </em>67 Ohio St.3d 274, 617 N.E.2d 1075, the Supreme Court stated that a corporate form may be disregarded and its shareholders held liable for the wrongs of the corporation when \u201c(1) control over the corporation by those to be held liable was so complete that the corporation has no separate mind, will, or existence of its own, (2) control over the corporation by those to be held liable was exercised in such a manner as to commit fraud or an illegal act against the person seeking to disregard the corporate entity, and (3) injury or unjust loss resulted to the plaintiff from such control or wrong.\u201d Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">{\u00b6 13} The first element provides a succinct statement of the alter ego doctrine. Id. at 288, 617 N.E.2d 1075. To succeed, a claimant must demonstrate that the individual shareholder and the corporation are fundamentally indistinguishable. Id. With respect to this prong, appellant contends that the evidence adduced at the hearing demonstrated that persons other than appellant exercised management and decision-making authority. Hence, the magistrate erred in concluding that Aloha Sports, Inc. was merely appellant\u2019s alter ego.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant\u2019s argument entreats us to weigh the evidence submitted at the hearing regarding the amount of control appellant exercised over the company in question. As we have no transcript or affidavit providing a statement of the evidence, we cannot assess the specific merit of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">{\u00b6 15} That said, we must emphasize that <em>Belvedere </em>does not preclude nonparties to the litigation from exercising managerial or decisionmaking authority. Rather, the alter ego element of <em>Belvedere </em>requires a demonstration of control that would indicate the corporation has no \u201cseparate mind, will, or existence of its own.\u201d A corporation may still be functionally indistinguishable from its shareholder(s) even where the shareholder(s) delegate certain managerial or operative decisionmaking authority to other individuals. Thus, appellant\u2019s argument is neither logically nor conceptually inconsistent with a finding that Aloha Sports, Inc., was his alter ego. This argument, manifest in appellant\u2019s second assigned error, is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">{\u00b6 16} The second element of <em>Belvedere </em>requires the claimant to demonstrate that the control by those to be held liable was exercised in such a manner as to commit fraud or an illegal act against the person seeking to pierce the corporate shield. Appellant contends that the record fails to disclose any evidence of fraud or dishonesty, and hence the magistrate erred when he so found. Appellant further argues that the magistrate relied upon illegitimate or nonbinding authority to reach its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Again, appellant\u2019s contentions regarding the magistrate\u2019s findings of fraud and/or dishonesty rely on evidence from the hearing to which we have no access; therefore, in this respect, appellant\u2019s argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">{\u00b6 18} This conclusion notwithstanding, appellant argues that the magistrate\u2019s citation and use of two cases, <em>Bucyrus-Erie Co. v. Gen. Prod. Corp. </em>(C.A.6, 1981), 643 F.2d 413, and <em>E.S. Preston Assoc., Inc. v. Preston </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 7, 24 OBR 5, 492 N.E.2d 441, illustrate his attempt to ignore the controlling precedent of <em>Belvedere. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">{\u00b6 19} The test set forth in <em>Belvedere </em>is open-ended and versatile \u2014 i.e., it permits and encourages flexibility by its very definition. While <em>Belvedere </em>sets forth the formal test in Ohio for veil-piercing, the legal conception has historical antecedents in both federal and state law. Such cases may provide sound analogies or insightful analyses relating to the formal test set forth in <em>Belvedere </em>without usurping its authority. We believe the cases cited by the magistrate were supplementary in nature and do not function to undermine <em>Belvedere.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">{\u00b6 20} Specifically, the magistrate begins his analysis with the recognition that <em>Belvedere </em>is the controlling authority in Ohio for piercing the corporate veil. During his analysis of the second prong of <em>Belvedere, </em>the magistrate states:</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe second prong of the Belvedere test required that Mr. Rice\u2019s domination and control was used to commit fraud or wrong or other dishonest or unjust acts. While not controlling law, the Court notes that the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has specifically held that fraud, as an element of this test is not \u2018essential\u2019. Rather, [the] corporate fiction would be disregarded when its retention would produce injustice or inequitable consequences. <em>Bucyrus-Erie Co. v. Gen. Prod. </em>(C.A.6, 1981), 643 F.2d 413. Although the Supreme Court of Ohio has not expressly addressed this issue, it appears to agree that the perpetration of a fraud or illegality is not the sole ground for disregarding the corporate entity. <em>LeRoux[\u2019s Billyle Supper Club v. Ma </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 417] at 422 [602 N.E.2d 685]; <em>E.S. Preston Assoc. Inc. v. Preston, </em>24 Ohio St.3d 7, 11 [24 OBR 5, 492 N.E.2d 441] (1986).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">{\u00b6 22} We do not see how the magistrate\u2019s allusion to the above cases implies an infidelity to <em>Belvedere. </em>To wit, the magistrate\u2019s citation to <em>Bucyrus-Erie </em>indicates that the corporate shield may evaporate when its retention would <em>produce </em>\u201cinjustice\u201d or \u201cinequitable\u201d consequences. As <em>Belvedere </em>explicitly notes, the fraud or illegality alleged must produce an injury or unjust loss. The magistrate\u2019s statement essentially reiterates Belvedere\u2019s third prong. The magistrate also noted that fraud is not essential for piercing the corporate veil. Again, we agree: The second prong of <em>Belvedere </em>is disjunctive and requires proof of fraud <em>or </em>illegality. Fraud therefore is not sine qua non for disregarding the corporate structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Further, the court in <em>Belvedere </em>cites <em>Bucyrus-Erie Co. v. Gen. Prod., </em>643 F.2d 413, as providing the inspiration for its holding. In <em>Belvedere, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cIn <em>Bucyrus-Erie, </em>the Sixth Circuit applied Ohio law in reviewing jury instructions in a veil-piercing case. It held that the corporate form may be disregarded when \u2018(1) domination and control over the corporation by those to be held liable is so complete that the corporation has no separate mind, will, or existence of its own, (2) that domination and control was used to commit fraud or wrong or other dishonest or unjust act, and (3) injury or unjust loss resulted to the plaintiff from such control and wrong.\u2019 <em>[Bucyrus-Erie, </em>at 418.]\u201d <em>Belvedere, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 288, 617 N.E.2d 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">{\u00b6 25} The court continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cWe feel the Sixth Circuit\u2019s approach to piercing the corporate veil strikes the correct balance between the principle of limited shareholder liability and the reality that the corporate fiction is sometimes used by shareholders to protect themselves from liability for their own misdeeds.\u201d Id. at 289, 617 N.E.2d 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">{\u00b6 27} While the <em>Belvedere </em>test omits the equitable concepts of dishonesty and injustice from its formulation, the spirit of the test does not obviate their recognition. For these reasons, we do not think that the magistrate\u2019s use of or reference to <em>Bucyrus-Erie </em>was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">{\u00b6 28} Moreover, in <em>E.S. Preston Assoc., Inc. v. Preston, </em>24 Ohio St.3d 7, 11, 24 OBR 5, 492 N.E.2d 441, the Supreme Court of Ohio emphasized:</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cCourts have been reluctant to disregard the corporate entity and have done so only where the corporation has been used as a cloak for fraud or illegality or where the sole owner has exercised such excessive control over the corporation that it no longer has a separate existence. * * * It has also been stated that the corporate entity should be disregarded only when justice cannot be served in any other way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">{\u00b6 30} While released some seven years prior to <em>Belvedere, </em>we do not believe that the law announced in <em>Preston </em>is inconsistent with the controlling authority set forth in <em>Belvedere.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">{\u00b6 31} We do not believe that the magistrate redefined or restructured <em>Belvedere </em>by citing either <em>Bucyrus-Erie </em>or <em>Preston. </em>While factually dissimilar and not \u201ccontrolling,\u201d the above cases are in no way inconsistent with <em>Belvedere. </em>As far as we can discern, the magistrate used these cases to inform the discussion as to what, in fact, might constitute problematic conduct as it pertains to the veil-piercing exercise in <em>Belvedere. </em>This interpretation is bolstered by the findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>that the magistrate made immediately following his discussion of the noncontrolling cases at issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cIn this case, Mr. Rice clearly benefited from trades made with customers of plaintiffs stations, deposited funds in his personal account without proper accounting, misrepresented Aloha\u2019s ability to perform the terms of the contract entered into with plaintiff, and ceased operations without notice to plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">{\u00b6 33} Assuming these findings correspond to the evidence adduced at the hearing, they are adequate to meet the illegality test internal to <em>Belvedere\u2019s </em>second prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">{\u00b6 34} In sum, we do not believe that the magistrate\u2019s use of these cases runs afoul of <em>Belvedere. </em>Appellant\u2019s assigned error relating to <em>Belvedere\u2019s </em>second prong is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">{\u00b6 35} The final element of <em>Belvedere </em>is causal in nature; that is, it requires the claimant to demonstrate a causal connection between the shareholder\u2019s control of the corporation and the alleged injury or loss. Appellant argues that no evidence was offered indicating that appellee was injured as a result of appellant\u2019s control over Aloha Sports, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">{\u00b6 36} We must reiterate, one final time, that appellant\u2019s challenge is tied intimately to the evidence presented at the hearing. Without a transcript, we are unable to consider appellant\u2019s argument. Appellant\u2019s final assigned error is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">{\u00b6 37} In sum, we do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion in adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision. The magistrate set forth the relevant legal authority and properly applied it to the case before it. Thus, appellant\u2019s three assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">{\u00b6 38} For the above reasons, the decision of the Chardon Municipal Court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b780-13\">Ford, P.J., and Grendell, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
