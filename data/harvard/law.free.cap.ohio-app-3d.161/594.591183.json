We vacate the decision of the trial court and enter judgment on behalf of AMHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">{\u00b6 2} William L. Singfield (\u201cGrievant\u201d) was employed with AMHA from 1992 until he was suspended and eventually terminated in January 2002. At the time of his termination, Grievant was a member of Local 2517, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, and Ohio Council 8 (collectively referred to as appellees).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">{\u00b6 3} Appellees filed two grievances contesting Grievant\u2019s suspension and then his termination. The two grievances were processed together in an arbitration proceeding. The arbitration hearing was conducted before arbitrator Thomas Coyne on March 26 and 27, 2003. Coyne determined that AMHA had wrongfully discharged Grievant, and he ordered AMHA to reinstate him with back pay, benefits, and allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On August 13, 2003, AMHA filed a motion to vacate or modify the arbitration award. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to confirm the arbitration award on September 9, 2003. On October 8, 2004, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to vacate and ordered judgment upon the arbitration award in favor of appellees. Appellant appealed, raising three assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">The trial court erred in finding that the arbitrator\u2019s award reinstating the grievant did not violate the established public policy in favor of workplace safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 5} In its first assignment of error, AMHA argues that the trial court erred in confirming the arbitration award in favor of appellee. AMHA argues that the arbitrator\u2019s decision to reinstate Grievant despite substantial evidence of threatening and violent conduct, as well as an opinion from a licensed Ph.D. clinical psychologist that Grievant threatened safety, violates a strong public policy promoting workplace safety and the obligation of employers to take affirmative action to ensure a safe workplace for employees. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 6} A party may appeal a trial court\u2019s order that confirms, modifies, corrects, or vacates an arbitration award. <em>Warren Edn. Assn. v. Warren City Bd. of Edn. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 170, 173-174, 18 OBR 225, 480 N.E.2d 456, quoting <em>Lockhart v. Am. Res. Ins. Co. </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 99, 101, 2 OBR 112, 440 N.E.2d 1210. An appellate court reviews the trial court\u2019s order to discern whether an error as a matter of law occurred. <em>Union Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Fraternal Order of Police, Ohio Valley Lodge No. 112 </em>(2001), 146 Ohio App.3d 456, 459, 766 N.E.2d 1027, citing <em>McFaul v. UAW Region 2 </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 111, 115, 719 N.E.2d 632. We find that the trial court erred as a matter of law in holding that the reinstatement of Grievant did not violate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">{\u00b6 7} The issue in this case is a question of law \u2014 namely, whether reinstating Grievant is a violation of explicit public policy. Thus, we review the trial court\u2019s judgment under a de novo standard of review. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. A de novo review requires an independent review of the trial court\u2019s decision without any deference to the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 711, 622 N.E.2d 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">{\u00b6 8} Public policy is a question for resolution by the courts. <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Local Union 759, Internatl. Union of United Rubber </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 76 L.Ed.2d 298. Courts are obligated to refrain from enforcing an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the contract if that interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>violates explicit public policy. Id. To serve as a basis for vacating an arbitration award, the public policy must be well defined, dominant, and able to be ascertained \u201cby reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.\u201d Id., quoting <em>Muschany v. United States </em>(1945), 324 U.S. 49, 66, 65 S.Ct. 442, 89 L.Ed. 744. <em>Grace, </em>however, does not \u201cotherwise sanction a broad judicial power to set aside arbitration awards as against public policy.\u201d <em>United Paperworkers Internatl. Union v. Misco, Inc. </em>(1987), 484 U.S. 29, 43, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">{\u00b6 9} Workplace safety is a well defined and dominant public policy based on federal, state, and common law. The Ohio Supreme Court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">Ohio\u2019s public policy is clearly in keeping with the laudable objectives of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act. The public policy of this state demands that employees be provided with a safe work environment and that unsafe working conditions be corrected. This conclusion is supported by a host of statutes and constitutional provisions favoring safety in the workplace. See, e.g., Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution; R.C. 4101.11 (duty of employer to protect employees and frequenters); R.C. 4101.12 (duty of employer to furnish safe place of employment); R.C. 4121.13 (safety and investigative duties of the Administrator of Workers\u2019 Compensation); R.C. 4121.17 (duty of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation to investigate petitions concerning unsafe employment or places of employment); R.C. 4121.47 (no employer shall violate a specific safety rule adopted by the Administrator of Workers\u2019 Compensation or an Act of the General Assembly to protect the lives, health and safety of employees); and R.C. 4121.48 (occupational safety loan program to reduce employment hazards and promote health, and safety of employees).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-7\"><em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 134, 152-153, 677 N.E.2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court correctly found that there is a strong public policy favoring workplace safety and recognized that an employer has the responsibility to maintain a safe environment for its employees and frequenters. Further, the trial court stated, \u201cA place of public housing, such as AMHA, would be in such a position to be diligent as to the safety of its residents, employees, and frequenters.\u201d The court, however, concluded in error that the arbitrator\u2019s decision reinstating the Grievant did not violate public policy in favor of workplace safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">{\u00b6 11} Grievant was a maintenance worker at the AMHA. The facts leading up to Grievant\u2019s eventual termination began on August 8, 2001. On that date, Grievant\u2019s supervisor, Michael Reinhart, went to a vacant unit where Grievant was assigned to work. Grievant was outside on the balcony of the unit and refused to come inside to discuss his project with his supervisor. After repeated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>requests by Reinhart for Grievant to come inside to talk about his work, Grievant entered the unit and turned up the volume of his personal radio. Reinhart told Grievant that he was not going to shout over the radio, and Reinhart unplugged it. Reinhart testified that Grievant became angry, moved within half an inch of Reinhart\u2019s face, and yelled at Reinhart that \u201c[he\u2019d] be sorry\u201d if he touched his personal property again. Reinhart testified that Grievant was very angry. His eyes were enlarged, and Grievant was \u201cjust yelling at the top of his lungs at [him].\u201d Reinhart stated that he was concerned for his personal safety at that moment and left the unit and called his supervisor, Allan Thomas. Thomas showed up and escorted Reinhart back to the unit that Grievant was in. Thomas told Grievant to go home that day. After Grievant had left, Thomas and Reinhart noticed that he had left his keys in the door. Upon inspection, they realized that Grievant had six master keys that would open the doors to many AMHA units on his key chain. AMHA security was notified and took the keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 12} The next day, the AMHA Human Resources Director, Christine Yuhasz, arranged a meeting with the Grievant to discuss his altercation with Reinhart and to discuss his possession of the six master keys. Prior to Yuhasz\u2019s meeting with Grievant, she had met with Reinhart, O\u2019Leary, and Terry Meese. At that meeting, Reinhart stated that he was afraid of Grievant and that other employees had approached him after hearing of the altercation and told him to be careful because Grievant could be dangerous. Reinhart told the others at the meeting that Grievant had previously told him that Grievant had gone to a previous supervisor\u2019s house and had lain in the snow with a shotgun waiting for the supervisor to return. According to what Reinhart claims Grievant had told him, Grievant had been angry at the supervisor for disciplining him. By the time the supervisor had returned to his home, Grievant\u2019s hands were too cold from lying in the snow to pull the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 13} After learning of the altercation between Reinhart and Grievant, Spurlock, the union steward for Akron North and a maintenance employee for the company, approached Reinhart and told him that Grievant had told the union steward a similar story about a gun and going after a previous supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 14} Grievant then met with Yuhasz to discuss the altercation and his possession of the six master keys. Grievant admitted that he had had a disagreement with Reinhart, but he denied that he knew anything about the master keys. At the end of the meeting, Grievant was placed on paid administrative leave pending further investigation. Yuhasz told him that some sort of suspension would be involved and that he would have to attend anger-management training.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">{\u00b6 15} On August 17, 2001, at Grievant\u2019s request, Yuhasz met with him again. At that meeting, she asked him about why he had told Reinhart about his lying in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the snow waiting to shoot a supervisor. Grievant did not deny telling the story to Reinhart, nor did he state that it never happened. Following further investigation, on August 21, 2001, Grievant was suspended for 30 days and ordered to undergo anger-management treatment. The suspension letter stated: \u201cYou are also required to seek assistance for anger management. * * * You will be required to provide proof of treatment in order to be permitted to return to work, and as a condition of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 16} AMHA based its decision to suspend Grievant on the incidents that took place in August 2001. It also took into consideration Grievant\u2019s past behavior regarding the appropriateness of anger-management treatment. Testimony was introduced at the arbitration proceeding to show the purpose behind the request that Grievant undergo anger-management treatment. Martin, a public-housing manager for AMHA, testified that in May 1994, Grievant, who had been working on a floor, yelled at a tenant, \u201cGet the hell off the floor.\u201d Martin testified that the tenant \u201cjust looked at him and then he started saying things to her like, \u2018Get your black ass off the floor, Bitch.\u2019 * * * [T]he tenant started sobbing and went out the door * * The tenant had her five-year-old son with her, and the boy said hello to Grievant. Grievant stated to the child: \u201cBastard, get away from me.\u201d Martin called to Grievant, who responded, \u201cIf he touches me again, I\u2019m going to hit him.\u201d The boy then followed his mother out the door. Based on those verbal confrontations, Grievant had received a three-day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 17} In August 1995, Grievant was suspended for five days after he had engaged in a verbal altercation with a co-worker while they were on AMHA property painting a vacant unit. Grievant initially denied using profanity but then admitted that he had lied to the AMHA Human Resource Manager after a statement was produced from a tenant who was with a young child in the unit above who had both witnessed the whole incident. The tenant stated that profane language had been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 18} Also introduced were multiple performance evaluations in which Grievant had received poor scores: a rating of \u201cweak\u201d in the areas of \u201cconduct and cooperation with supervision\u201d and \u201cconduction and cooperation -with co-workers.\u201d Based on the above occurrences, AMHA felt that it was necessary for Grievant to undergo anger-management treatment and receive a return-to-work authorization before he would be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 19} On September 17, 2001, Grievant saw counselor Sara Seeley at Summit Psychological Associates. After two meetings, neither of which provided any anger-management counseling, Seeley called the Human Resources Director at AMHA prepared, at that time, to offer a return-to-work authorization. Summit Psychological Associates changed its report after speaking to the Human Resources Director and learning of information that conflicted with Grievant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>earlier responses regarding his background and reasons for counseling. Seeley never stated that she accepted the information as true, but she stated that she felt she needed more information to see whether there was an increased risk. After the conversation with the Human Resources Director and two telephone conversations and a session with Grievant, Seeley determined that she should involve others in her office in the evaluation and treatment of Grievant. Subsequently, Dr. James Orlando and Dr. James Frye became involved in the evaluation of Grievant.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 20} After conducting psychological testing and meeting with Grievant in several counseling sessions, Dr. Frye, in a letter that he sent to AMHA stated, \u201c[W]e believe that there continues to be a risk that his anger will lead to further, potentially explosive incidents.\u201d Dr. Frye stated, \u201cI do not believe that he can safely return to work at this time.\u201d Dr. Orlando thereafter called Yuhasz to warn her that a significant amount of Grievant\u2019s anger was directed toward her. Dr. Orlando and Dr. Frye both testified that in reaching their diagnosis and professional opinions regarding Grievant\u2019s safety in the workplace, they relied upon their own psychological testing data, their own interactions with Grievant, and their prior training and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 21} When Grievant did not receive a return-to-work authorization from Summit Psychological Associates, he terminated his counseling there and began counseling with a social worker at Jewish Family Service, to whom he was referred by his attorney. Despite numerous requests by both Grievant and his attorney, the social worker, a Ms. Williams, refused to provide a recommendation that Grievant return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 22} While Grievant was on suspension, AMHA continued its investigation. Several other incidents were brought to AMHA\u2019s attention. John Morris, an AMHA union employee, reported that Grievant had told him that Grievant had gone to an AMHA supervisor\u2019s house with a gun because Grievant was mad that he had been suspended. Morris saw Grievant\u2019s wife a few days after hearing Grievant\u2019s story and asked her whether the story was true. She confirmed its veracity, stating that she \u201cwas so glad that he came home and didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 23} An AMHA supervisor reported that during a meeting, Grievant threatened another employee, telling the other employee that he would \u201cjust bust [him] in the jaw.\u201d Further, AMHA learned that two individuals had filed police reports against Grievant for threatening them. A few employees had requested AMHA to provide bulletproof vests if Grievant was permitted to return to work, and Reinhart and Spurlock, Grievant\u2019s union steward, stated that they would quit working with AMHA if they were required to work with Grievant again because they were concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Based on the above evidence, all of which was introduced at the arbitration hearing, we find that the trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that Grievant\u2019s reinstatement with AMHA did not violate public policy in favor of safety in the workplace. We find it significant, as did the court in <em>Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Auth. v. Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 627 </em>(Sept. 28, 1994), 1st Dist. No. C-930423, 1994 WL 525543, that the arbitration award in this case was an unconditional reinstatement, not requiring any successful rehabilitative efforts for the Grievant\u2019s anger condition prior to his returning to work, despite the findings of the counselors and psychologists that stated that Grievant was not ready to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">{\u00b6 25} AMHA has a duty to protect its workforce against danger posed by Grievant. It is the opinion of this court that Grievant is a danger not only to his co-workers and supervisors, but also to the thousands of residents living in the public-housing units operated by AMHA. The trial court\u2019s holding for Grievant, despite the psychologists\u2019 recommendations and his known propensity toward violent statements, is clearly a violation of explicit public policy in favor of workplace safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 26} We affirm appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, vacate the decision of the trial court, and enter judgment in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">The trial court erred in finding that the arbitrator did not engage in arbitral misconduct by making repeated volatile statements, chastising counsel, and engaging in ex parte communications with the parties and counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">The trial court erred in finding that the arbitrator\u2019s award drew its essence from the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement where the arbitrator manufactured due process requirements and relied upon alleged past practice not introduced by either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">{\u00b6 27} Given this court\u2019s resolution of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, the second and third assignments of error are rendered moot, and we decline to address them. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">{\u00b6 28} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained, and the second and third assignments of error are moot. The judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas Court is vacated, and judgment is entered on behalf of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">Judgment vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b637-15\">Whitmore and Batchelder, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
