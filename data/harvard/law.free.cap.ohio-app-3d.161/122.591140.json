Avery, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b159-14\">Farmer, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">{\u00b6 1} On July 16, 2003, appellants, Carolyn Stinger and Robert Johnson, purchased a used 1997 Ford pickup truck from Lenherr Motors in Zanesville, Ohio. Appellants also purchased a warranty service contract issued by appellee, the Ultimate Warranty Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-16\">{\u00b6 2} On July 30, 2004, appellants filed a complaint against appellee claiming violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (\u201cCSPA\u201d), R.C. 1345.01 et seq. Appellants claimed that appellee had \u201cengaged in unfair, deceptive and unconscionable promotional and advertising practices in soliciting the purchase\u201d of its service contracts. Appellants sought class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>{\u00b6 3} On August 31, 2004, appellee moved to dismiss the complaint or compel arbitration pursuant to a clause in the service contract. By decision filed October 21, 2004, the trial court stayed the case and ordered the matter to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">{\u00b6 4} Appellants filed an appeal, and this matter is now before this court for consideration. Assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 action did not seek enforcement of rights or obligations under the service contract terms. Plaintiffs\u2019 action sought only CSPA remedies, and only for deceptive, unfair and unconscionable advertising and promotional practices constituting unlawful acts separate from the service contract terms. The trial court therefore erred as a matter of law by finding that plaintiffs* action came within the arbitration clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cBy the language appellee selected, its arbitration clause applies only to disputes \u2018regarding this service contract.\u2019 Consequently, as a matter of law the clause is not susceptible of an interpretation covering a class challenge to advertising and solicitation practices conducted prior to, separately from, and outside the terms of \u2018this\u2019 service contract. The trial court therefore erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion, since plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not fall within the limited scope of the clause as worded by appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in requiring plaintiffs to commence binding arbitration under forum rules that expressly allow the arbitrator to render a decision without regard to applicable law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">{\u00b6 8} Appellants challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that by the terms of the contract, the parties are bound to submit their dispute to binding arbitration. Appellants argue that the arbitration clause does not provide for arbitration of the issues sub judice within the limited scope of the clause and that the arbitration clause is contrary to public policy. We agree with appellants\u2019 position that the scope of the arbitration clause does not include the issues raised in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe issue of whether a controversy is arbitrable under an arbitration provision of a contract is a question of law for the court to decide\u201d; therefore, our standard of review is de novo. <em>Gaffney v. Powell </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 315, 319, 668 N.E.2d 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>{\u00b6 10} The arbitration clause states the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe parties to this agreement mutually accept that all disputes regarding this service contract must be submitted to the Better Business Bureau for binding arbitration. Such disputes include, but are not limited to: claims for breach of warranty, claims for terms of warranty, and claims for quality of repairs and workmanship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">{\u00b6 12} Appellants claim that our decision in <em>Williams v. J&amp;J Motors, Inc. </em>(September 29, 1997) Stark App. No. 1997CA00007, is applicable. In <em>Williams, </em>at 5-6, this court found, \u201cThus, where an action is brought challenging the validity, existence or requesting rescission of a contract* * *such action does not come within an arbitration clause of a contract and is a question for the trial court to decide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">{\u00b6 13} In order to determine whether the matter should be submitted to arbitration, we must first examine the scope of the arbitration clause and examine the nature of the claims set forth in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">SCOPE OF THE CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">{\u00b6 14} The arbitration clause clearly states that \u201call disputes regarding this service contract\u201d are subject to arbitration. The service contract is a warranty agreement checked \u201cPlatinum Protection.\u201d The designation \u201cPlatinum Protection\u201d determines what is covered under the warranty. In the definitions section of the contract, the term \u201cContract\u201d is defined as \u201cthis service agreement Contract\u201d and \u201cCoverage\u201d is defined as \u201ctype of coverage You have chosen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">{\u00b6 15} Therefore, from the very terms of the contract, we find that the arbitration clause controls on all issues involving the actual warranty chosen by the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">{\u00b6 16} The July 30, 2004 complaint alleges the following facts at \u00b6 13:</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c13. Common questions of fact include, but are not limited to, the precise nature of defendant Ultimate Warranty\u2019s products as marketed to consumers in this state; the customary marketing techniques by which defendant Ultimate Warranty an [sic] its agents routinely promote its products or the sale of its products in this state; and the standard, routine practices and marketing materials by which defendant instructs, or with which defendant Ultimate Warranty provides, those who regularly solicit, sell, or administer claims concerning these products, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>{\u00b6 18} The complaint further alleges that in offering the warranty protection, agents of appellee used \u201cstandard consumer advertisement and solicitation\u201d and that those \u201csales techniques\u201d did not properly disclose the \u201climitations, exclusions, conditions and exceptions to the coverage.\u201d The complaint further alleges that the marketing techniques used did not fully disclose the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">{\u00b6 19} Appellants claim that appellee\u2019s practices constituted multiple violations:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cDefendant\u2019s illegal acts and practices include, but are not limited to, violations of R.C. \u00a7 1345.02(A) and (B), sections (1), (2), (5), (8), and (10); R.C. \u00a7 1345.03(A) and (B), sections (1), (3), (5), and (6); and acts or practices declared to violate the CSPA by administrative regulation contained in Ohio Administrative Code \u00a7 109:4-3-02(A)(l), and/or by judicial decisions archived in the public inspection file of the Ohio Attorney General\u2019s Office prior to the events in question, non-exclusive examples of which include O.A.C. \u00a7 109:4-3-02; <em>Wrobel v. Carpets by Otto </em>(Toledo Muni.1998), (P.I.F. # 1691) and <em>State ex. rel Montgomery v. Household Products of Ohio, Inc. </em>(Hamilton CP 2001), (P.I.F. # 1968).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">{\u00b6 21} Appellants request \u201call remedies available under R.C. \u00a7 1345.09, including an award of attorney fees and litigation costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 1345.09 provides private remedies for CSPA violations, including in a class action rescission or damages, injunctive relief, or \u201cother appropriate relief\u2019 as determined by Civ.R. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">{\u00b6 23} The CSPA does not ban arbitration. <em>Eagle v. Fred Martin Motor Company, </em>157 Ohio App.3d 150, 2004-Ohio-829, 809 N.E.2d 1161. However, it is clear that the complaint sub judice is not based upon the coverage in the service contract but on appellee\u2019s method of marketing and sales pitch to the consumer. Therefore, because the arbitration clause is limited, the claimed CSPA violations prior to finalization of the warranty agreement are not covered by the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">{\u00b6 24} Assignments of Error I and II are well taken. Assignment of Error III is rendered moot. The matter is reversed and remanded to the trial court for further adjudication pursuant to Civ.R. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b162-12\">Wise and Edwards, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
