The Commonwealth appealed. This it had no right to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">In cases charging nuisance, forcible \u00a7ntry and forcible detainer, the Commonwealth is given the right of \u00e1ppeal by Act of 19 May 1874, P. L. 219. For error in quashing an indictment, arresting judgment, after verdict of guilty and the like, the Commonwealth may appeal. After a verdict of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d except in. the above enumerated cases, the Commonwealth cannot secure a review of the case. The rule is the same whether the result is an error committed by the trial court or a perverse finding of the jury. See Com. v. Weber, 66 Pa. Superior Ct. 180; Com. v. Preston, 92 Pa. Superior Ct. 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">The appeal is quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
