Ellis, Jr., the sole equity security holder of Chapter 11 Debtor Upland Partners, appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s civil contempt order against Ellis for violating the automatic stay, and imposing a sanction in the amount of $4,119.76. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo questions of jurisdiction. <em>Moore v. Jogert, Inc. (In re Jogert, Inc.), </em>950 F.2d 1498, 1501 (9th Cir.1991). We review for abuse of discretion the decision to impose contempt, and underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>Knupfer v. Lindblade (In re Dyer), </em>322 F.3d 1178, 1191 (9th Cir.2003). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-17\">Contrary to Ellis\u2019s contention, the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction over the property that Ellis attempted to convey on March 6, 2002. The bankruptcy court\u2019s termination of the automatic stay, on March 5 and March 6, 2002, for a limited purpose, did not constitute an \u201cabandonment\u201d of the property. <em>Catalano v. Comm\u2019r, </em>279 F.3d 682, 686 (9th Cir.2002). Ellis\u2019s reliance on <em>Wilson v. Bill Barry Enters., Inc., </em>822 F.2d 859 (9th Cir.1987), is unavailing because <em>Wilson </em>applied to facts and a statutory scheme that are markedly different from those found here. <em>Wilson </em>held that <em>\u201c[bjecause of this statutory structure, </em>the bankruptcy court\u2019s lifting of the automatic stay to allow the [creditor-lessor] to seek termination of the lease included [the debtor-Iessee]\u2019s right to petition for relief from termination, if declared.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 861 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-18\">Furthermore, contrary to Ellis\u2019s contention, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion when it ruled that Ellis violated the automatic stay because the record shows that Ellis knew of the stay, his actions were intentional, and he failed to cure. <em>See Dyer, </em>322 F.3d at 1190-92. In addition, even if \u2014 as Ellis contends\u2014 the land sale contracts were in escrow prior to the bankruptcy court\u2019s November 28, 2000 order, which decreed that the sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>of certain lots then in escrow could be consummated, Ellis lacked authority to convey the lots because the order gave only the Trustee authority to consummate the pending sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Again, contrary to Ellis\u2019 contention, the bankruptcy court had power to sanction Ellis under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a). <em>See Dyer, </em>322 F.3d at 1189-90 (\u201cthe Trustee may be entitled to recovery for violation of the automatic stay under section 105(a) as a sanction for ordinary civil contempt.\u201d (citation omitted)). The amount of the sanction ordered by the bankruptcy court, $4,119.76, was not clearly erroneous because the record supports the Trustee\u2019s claim that Ellis\u2019s violations of the automatic stay burdened the Trustee and the estate, the bankruptcy court limited the amount to the time and costs for the re-conveyance, the bankruptcy court gave Ellis the opportunity to submit objections, the sanction was for the benefit of the estate, and the sanction was not punitive. <em>See id. </em>at 1191-92; 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Ellis\u2019s remaining contentions also lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b191-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
