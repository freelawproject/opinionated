Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-21\">We conclude that Alvear waived his right to appeal the sentence imposed. The \u201cright of appeal may be waived as part of a plea agreement,\u201d and \u201c[s]uch a waiver is enforceable when the sentence imposed conforms to the parameters of a plea agreement entered into knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d <em>United States v. DeJesus, </em>219 F.3d 117, 121 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Chen, </em>127 F.3d 286, 289 (2d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Yemitan, </em>70 F.3d 746, 747 (2d Cir.1995). Further, \u201c[i]n no circumstance ... may a defendant, who has secured the benefits of a plea agreement and knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal a certain sentence, then appeal the merits of a sentence conforming to the agreement. Such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>remedy would render the plea bargaining process and the resulting agreement meaningless.\u201d <em>United States v. Salcido-Contreras, </em>990 F.2d 51, 53 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Alvear agreed that he would \u201cneither appeal, nor otherwise litigate ... any sentence within or below the stipulated Sentencing Guidelines range\u201d of four to ten months. Alvear was sentenced to four years\u2019 probation, including a special condition of six months\u2019 home confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide that \u201c[h]ome detention may be imposed as a condition of probation ... but only as a substitute for imprisonment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5F1.2. One day of home detention, where authorized, qualifies as a substitute for one day of imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.1(e)(3). Alvear\u2019s sentence of six months\u2019 home confinement thus corresponds to the sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment that could alternatively have been imposed; the term of six months, whether served in prison or by home detention, falls within the range of four to ten months stipulated to in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the appeal is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
