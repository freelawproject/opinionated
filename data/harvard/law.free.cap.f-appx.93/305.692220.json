The government argues that the district court erred in departing downward two levels on the ground of extraordinary family circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">As a preliminary matter, the parties debate the standard of review. The government contends that under the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\u201cPROTECT Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650 (2003), a district court\u2019s determination that certain facts justify a downward departure is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. Zadora counters that as before the enactment of the PROTECT Act, a district court\u2019s decision to depart downward is reviewed for abuse of discretion. We, however, need not resolve this question because even reviewing for abuse of discretion, we find that the departure was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-17\">In this case, the district court justified its decision to depart downward on the basis of Zadora\u2019s extraordinary family circumstances. While family circumstances are not a forbidden basis for a downward departure, they \u201care a discouraged basis for departure because the Commission has deemed them to be not generally rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>vant.\u201d <em>United States v. Galante, </em>111 F.3d 1029, 1034 (2d Cir.1997); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.6 (\u201cFamily ties and responsibilities are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure may be warranted\u201d). As we stated in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>964 F.2d 124 (2d Cir.1992), \u201cDisruption of the defendant\u2019s life, and the concomitant difficulties for those who depend on the defendant, are inherent in the punishment of incarceration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128. Therefore, a district court may depart downward on the basis of family circumstances only if the \u201chardship in a particular case is exceptional.\u201d <em>Galante, </em>111 F.3d at 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The district court justified its decision to depart downward, stating, \u201cI find that Mrs. Zadora\u2019s family circumstances are extraordinary to the extent that her family relies on her for care and support, especially her 86-year-old mother.\u201d We disagree with this reasoning. The record establishes that Zadora was not the only family member capable of caring for her mother, and that her children, who are grown and do not live in their parents\u2019 home, and her husband, who is healthy and employed, are not unusually dependent on Zadora for care and support. <em>Compare Johnson, </em>964 F.2d at 128-30 (finding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in departing downward for extraordinary family circumstances where the defendant \u201cwas solely responsible for the upbringing of her three young children, including an infant, and of the young child of her institutionalized daughter\u201d), <em>and United States v. Alba, </em>933 F.2d 1117, 1122 (2d Cir.1991) (finding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in departing downward for extraordinary family circumstances where the defendant toiled at two jobs to support his wife, their two daughters, aged four and eleven, his disabled father, and his paternal grandmother), <em>with United States v. Smith, </em>331 F.3d 292, 293-94 (2d Cir.2003) (reversing a family-circumstances departure for a defendant who \u201cplayed a major role\u201d in caring for his two-year old son where the defendant was \u201cnot the sole caregiver or financial supporter\u201d of the child), <em>and United States v. Madrigal, </em>331 F.3d 258, 260 (2d Cir.2003) (reversing a family circumstances departure premised on a female defendant\u2019s relationship with her six children where the defendant was not \u201cthe only person capable of proving adequate care for the youngest children\u201d). Accordingly, we find that the hardship in this case is not exceptional. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
