Martin, Jr., <em>Judge) </em>granting summary judgment to the defendants-appellees in his employment discrimination action against Gerald McEntee, president of A.F.C.S.M.E., Lee Saunders, Administrator of the union\u2019s D.C. 37, and Helen Greene, president of Local 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">In February 2001, the defendants entered an EEOC-negotiated and -enforced settlement agreement with De La Cruz that provided that \u201c[i]n exchange for satisfactory fulfillment by DC-37 ... of the promises in this agreement, ... De La Cruz ... agrees not to institute a lawsuit under the Americans with Disabilities Act, based on [two complaints filed earlier by De La Cruz].\u201d Settlement Agreement, Feb. 13, 2001, at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-17\">In April 2001, De La Cruz filed two new complaints with the EEOC followed by the present suit in district court, asserting the same facts as he had earlier. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants, agreeing with the EEOC that the settlement agreement had not been breached. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-18\">A settlement agreement may be enforced in federal court if the parties have waived claims under federal law as part of that agreement. <em>See Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 52, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974). Summary judgment is appropriate in a contract dis.pute only where the contract itself is clear and unambiguous; ambiguities or differing interpretations of the contract\u2019s provisions ordinarily preclude summary judgment. <em>See Lucente v. Int\u2019l Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>310 F.3d 243, 257 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-19\">The district court correctly determined that De La Cruz\u2019s claims could not be considered unless they indicated that the defendants breached the settlement agreement. The district court was correct in concluding that the settlement agreement did not require De La Cruz\u2019s reinstatement; rather, it provided only for a meeting to discuss that possibility. De La Cruz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>concedes that this meeting occurred. The district court also correctly concluded that the union was relieved of its responsibility to investigate (in an expedited manner) De La Cruz\u2019s grievances regarding \u201cout-of-title work by Senior Health Advisors\u201d because all such work ceased within six weeks of signing the settlement agreement. Any dispute regarding the union\u2019s handling of this investigation was thereby rendered moot. In light of the record, therefore, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in the defendants\u2019 favor was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
