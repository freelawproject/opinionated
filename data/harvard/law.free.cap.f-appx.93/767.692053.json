On June 16, 2003, he was sentenced as a career offender to 170 months of incarceration and three years of supervised release. It is from this judgment that Archer now appeals. The parties have waived oral argument, and the panel unanimously agrees that it is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">We review the sentencing court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>while examining its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>209 F.3d 614, 617 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The district court found that Archer was a career offender under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, because he had prior convictions for unarmed robbery and for mailing threatening communications. Archer now argues that his prior conviction for mailing threatening communications was not a crime of violence that would support his current sentence as a career offender.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-7\">(1) <em>has as an element the </em>use, attempted use, or <em>threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">USSG \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) (2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">We use a categorical approach to determine whether a prior offense meets this definition, looking only to the statutory elements of the offense. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>256 F.3d 381, 395-96 (6th Cir.2001). The federal statute under which Archer was convicted of \u201cMailing Threatening Communications\u201d provided in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">Whoever knowingly so deposits or causes to be delivered as aforesaid, any communication ..., addressed to any other person and containing ... <em>any threat to injure the person of the addressee or of another, </em>shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876 (West 1996) (emphasis added). This language shows that Archer\u2019s prior conviction was a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1), as it includes the element of threatening to use physical force against the person of another. <em>See United States v. McCaleb, </em>908 F.2d 176, 178 (7th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Left Hand Bull, </em>901 F.2d 647, 649 (8th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">Archer argues that his prior offense did not involve a serious risk of injury because it was less violent than the offenses that are specifically listed in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) and the commentary to the guideline. However, the two subsections of \u00a7 4B1.2(a) are written in the disjunctive. Thus, we need not consider whether Archer\u2019s prior offense involved a serious risk of injury under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), as it expressly included an element of threatening to use physical force under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">Finally, Archer argues that his prior conviction did not involve a threat within the meaning of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), because his incarceration greatly reduced any immediate risk to another. However, the courts have not required imminent danger to establish a threat for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l). <em>See McCaleb, </em>908 F.2d at 178 &amp; n. 6; <em>Left Hand Bull, </em>901 F.2d at 649. Moreover, consideration of this argument would require us to look beyond the plain language of \u00a7 876 and examine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>facts of Archer\u2019s prior offense. An examination of those facts shows that he made credible threats of extreme violence and repeatedly suggested that he would be patient in carrying them out.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
