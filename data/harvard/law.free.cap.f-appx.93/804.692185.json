Humphrey </em>decision, which held that a plaintiff is barred from bringing claims under \u00a7 1983 that would necessarily imply the invalidity of a criminal conviction or sentence. 512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). When the district court here issued its opinion, Shackleford was facing a careless driving charge stemming from the same circumstances that gave rise to her claim of false arrest. A Kentucky jury has since found Shackleford not guilty of the careless driving charge. Accordingly, we need not decide whether the district court correctly concluded that <em>Heck </em>barred Shackleford\u2019s claim while the careless driving charge was pending; the jury\u2019s acquittal means that a finding for Shackleford on her \u00a7 1983 claim would invalidate no pending or existing criminal charge or conviction. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Shackleford\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim and remand for further proceedings. Similarly, the district court\u2019s reason for denying Shackleford\u2019s motion to amend her complaint-that <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), would require federal court abstention so long as a state criminal proceeding was ongoing-no longer exists. Thus, we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Shackleford\u2019s motion to amend and remand for further consideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
