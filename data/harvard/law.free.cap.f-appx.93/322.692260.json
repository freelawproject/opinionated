Fox and dismissing Bolden\u2019s second amended complaint. Bolden brought a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that, after he filed a federal habeas petition, Charles Greiner, the Superintendent of the Sing Sing Correctional Facility, impeded his access to the courts by deliberately delaying service of an affidavit opposing Bolden\u2019s petition until after the deadline had passed to file a reply to that affidavit. Judge Fox recommended dismissal of Bolden\u2019s claim on the ground that Bolden had not raised any nonfrivolous claims that were improperly impeded by Greiner\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">For substantially the reasons stated in Judge Fox\u2019s Report and Recommendation, which was adopted by the District Court, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">We have considered all of the plaintiffs claims on appeal and we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
