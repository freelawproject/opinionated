In February, 2003 Cramer filed the underlying \u00a7 1983 action against the named attorney and law firm defendants alleging violations of his right to a fair trial and other constitutional torts. By order dated April 3, 2003, the district court dismissed the amended complaint on the grounds that (i) Cramer failed to allege state action as required for relief under \u00a7 1983, and (ii) Cramer failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted, necessitating dismissal of his complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). For substantially the reasons stated by the district court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In 1982, Cramer sold his bowling alley, \u201cBowlers Club,\u201d to an entity that went bankrupt before paying off the purchase money debt. <em>Cramer v. Englert, </em>262 A.D.2d 827, 692 N.Y.S.2d 212, 212 (N.Y.App.Div.1999) <em>(\u201cCramer </em>I\u201d). The attorneys who represented Cramer in the transaction, Eugene Spada and Martin Lazarow, evidently failed to perfect a security interest in the business assets. <em>Id. </em>at 828, 692 N.Y.S.2d 212. Cramer then retained attorneys Dennis Englert and Michael Kelley Maggs of Englert, Stillman, Coffey, McHugh &amp; Maggs, Esqs. (collectively, \u201cEnglert\u201d) to bring a malpractice suit against Spada and Lazarow, <em>id.; </em>Cramer lost his suit, chiefly because he could not show that he would have been able to realize the security interest, <em>see Cramer v. Spada, </em>203 A.D.2d 739, 610 N.Y.S.2d 662, 663-64 (N.Y.App.Div.1994). Cramer next sued Englert for malpractice. <em>Cramer I, </em>692 N.Y.2d at 213. In that action, Englert was represented by Alvin O. Sabo of Donohue, Sabo, Varley &amp; Armstrong, P.C. (collectively, \u201cSabo\u201d). On December 15, 1999, the New York State Supreme Court entered a judgment in favor of Englert; the judgment was affirmed. <em>See Cramer v. Englert, </em>289 A.D.2d 617, 734 N.Y.S.2d 275 (N.Y.App.Div.2001) <em>(\u201cCramer </em>II\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The underlying \u00a7 1983 action is filed against, <em>inter alia, </em>Englert and Sabo, alleging various constitutional torts. As the district court rightly held, however, Cram-er has failed to explain how the conduct of the attorneys named in this suit \u2014 only some of whom actually represented Cram-er in the private litigations described above \u2014 constitutes \u201cstate action\u201d; nor has Cramer identified any \u201cspecific deprivation of rights\u201d worked by Englert\u2019s representation of Cramer (or, for that matter, Sabo\u2019s representation of Englert). Absent credible allegations of state action and a deprivation of constitutional rights, Cramer cannot state a cognizable claim for relief under \u00a7 1983. <em>See, e.g., Tancredi v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>316 F.3d 308, 312-313 (2d Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>539 U.S. 942, 123 S.Ct. 2610, 156 L.Ed.2d 628 (2003) (explaining the state action requirement); <em>Davidson v. Mann, </em>129 F.3d 700, 701 (2d Cir.1997) (requiring specificity as to deprivation of constitutional rights); <em>Dahlberg v. Becker, </em>748 F.2d 85, 92-93 (2d Cir.1984) (noting that the \u201cmere invocation\u201d of New York legal procedures does not satisfy the \u201cstate actor\u201d requirement under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
