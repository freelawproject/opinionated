Comp. Stat, 205/0.01 <em>et seq. </em>He alleges that his continued confinement is the result of an unlawful conspiracy by the defendants, and he filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking damages and an order that would release him from confinement. The defendants are an assistant state\u2019s attorney, two of Ring\u2019s defense lawyers, the state judge who presided in his case, a court reporter, and two employees of the Illinois Department of Corrections. The district court dismissed the case on the ground that Ring\u2019s claims are not yet cognizable under \u00a7 1983. Ring appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-22\">Ring may not use \u00a7 1983 to obtain the relief he seeks. Ring first wants to be released from custody. But a writ of habeas corpus, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, is the sole federal remedy he may use to attack the fact or duration of his confinement. <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); <em>see also Adams v. Bartow, </em>330 F.3d 957 (7th Cir.2003) (action under \u00a7 2254 by civilly committed sex offender). Ring also seeks damages because he says his commitment is unconstitutional. But a state prisoner may not sue for damages arising out of allegedly unconstitutional confinement until his conviction is either invalidated by a state court or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Although Ring is civilly committed rather than incarcerated under a criminal sentence, similar policy concerns apply for persons held in other forms of confinement actively supervised by state courts. <em>See Nelson v. Murphy, </em>44 F.3d 497, 502 (7th Cir.1995). Accordingly, Ring may not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>cover damages under \u00a7 1983 until his commitment is either invalidated or he successfully petitions the district court for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Lastly, we note that persons committed under the Illinois Sexually Dangerous Persons Act are subject to the provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act. <em>Kalinowski v. Bond, </em>358 F.3d 978, 978-79 (7th Cir.2004). Ring has earned two \u201cstrikes\u201d under the PLRA because both his initial suit and this appeal were frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
