United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b863-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Carolyn Covington brought this action against her former employer. MCI World-corn Network Services (\u201cMCI\u201d), claiming race, sex, and age discrimination in refusing her a promotion. The jury found in her favor as to sex discrimination only. Defendant MCI WorldCom Network, Inc. (\u201cMCI\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial, on the grounds that the verdict was based on insufficient and/or inadmissible evidence, and in the alternative seeks remittitur and alteration of the awards granted by the jury and trial judge. For the following reasons, we remand for a new trial as to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Covington entered MCI\u2019s employ as a manager at the Memphis, Tennessee Call Center (the \u201cMemphis Center\u201d) in 1991. In 1992, she transferred to the Memphis Center\u2019s Customer Calling Department, where she reported to David Watson, the manager in charge of that department. When Watson was promoted to Regional Manager, Covington applied for his vacated former position. Four other employees, all male, also applied for that position. After interviews in November 1993. the promotion went to a junior manager named Mark Shelby. MCI\u2019s lead witness, former Center Manager Mark Anderson, testified that he had promoted Shelby rather than Covington because Shelby displayed terrific leadership potential in his interview, setting forth a big-picture vision for the department\u2019s future under his management, and Covington did not. Covington sued because she did not get the promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">We review the denial of MCI\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law de <em>novo, </em>using the same standard as did the district court. <em>Williams v. Nashville Network, </em>132 F.3d 1123, 1130-31 (6th Cir.1997). That is, we affirm if there is a \u201clegally sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find for\u201d Covington. Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1). We do not weigh the evidence, nor make credibility determinations; rather, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Covington, giving her the benefit of all reasonable inferences, and we reverse only if reasonable minds could find only for MCI. <em>Williams, </em>132 F.3d at 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">As usual at this stage, we do not review plaintiffs prima facie case, but only whether Covington proved discrimination. <em>Roh </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number><em>v. Lakeshore Estates, Inc., </em>241 F.3d 491, 498 (6th Cir.2001). Once MCI proffered an explanation for promoting Shelby rather than Covington, Covington had to prove that MCI\u2019s proffered justification was a mere pretext for intentional sexual discrimination. <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, </em>530 U.S. 133, 142-43, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Covington could meet her burden by showing that MCI\u2019s justification (1) was not based in fact, (2) did not actually motivate MCI, or (3) would not suffice by itself to motivate MCI\u2019s action. <em>Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Co., </em>29 F.3d 1078, 1083 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">If the jury disbelieved MCI, it could justly infer that the true motive was discriminatory, even without positive evidence of discriminatory motive. <em>Ibid.; Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 577, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 57 L.Ed.2d 957(1978) (\u201cwhen all legitimate reasons for rejecting an applicant have been eliminated as possible reasons for the employer\u2019s actions, it is more likely than not the employer, who we generally assume acts only with some reason, based his decision on an impermissible consideration\u201d). But because plaintiff bears the burden of proof, a jury\u2019s mere credibility determination unsupported by any evidence of falsity cannot support a verdict for plaintiff. <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 147-48, 120 S.Ct. 2097. Covington had to present some evidence going squarely to falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">MCI posted the position vacated by Watson as \u201cSenior Manager, Customer Calling.\u201d Covington and Karl Amelang, the Memphis Center\u2019s then-Human Resources Manager, testified as to the meaning of the title \u201cSenior Manager.\u201d Managers at MCI progressed in compensation level from Manager I to Manager II, Manager III, and finally Senior Manager. At each promotion, a manager\u2019s performance was reviewed and his or her compensation was increased accordingly. Covington testified that promotions came with seniority and satisfactory performance. Amelang testified more precisely that, as of 1993. MCI\u2019s Generic Job Summary for Senior Manager rank required nine to ten years related experience, including five years of supervisory experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Significantly, Amelang testified that Covington, a Manager III who had over five years of supervisory experience with various employers, was qualified to apply for the post vacated by Watson. Amelang also testified that Shelby did not have the years of experience required by the Generic Job Summary for even Manager III rank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In fact, Covington had been an MCI manager longer than any other candidate for the post. Shelby, in contrast, was a Manager I, and had been a manager for only nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">MCI urges that Title VII does not demand that a company promote by seniority. It is true that a trial court does not \u201csit as a super-personnel department\u201d in Title VII cases to second-guess the wisdom of an employer\u2019s standards. <em>Hedrick v. Western Reserve Care Sys., </em>355 F.3d 444, 462 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Krenik v. County of Le Sueur, </em>47 F.3d 953, 960 (8th Cir.1995)). But Covington is not saying that the jury could impose standards upon MCI. Rather, she offered evidence that in MCI\u2019s own opinion, Shelby did not have the requisite experience for the post, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>that MCI\u2019s proffered explanation was likely to be false.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">MCI insists, however, that Shelby\u2019s ineligibility for Senior Manager status was irrelevant. Anderson testified on cross-examination that he had posted the job as \u201cSenior Manager. Customer Calling.\u201d merely because Watson had been a Senior Manager, and to discourage applicants from outside the Memphis Center. But he never considered being a Senior Manager to be a requirement for the job. Senior Manager, MCI asserts, is a compensation description, not a job requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">There is considerable evidence that \u201cSenior Manager\u201d designated an experience requirement in this instance. Covington\u2019s and Amelang\u2019s testimony points that way. Anderson\u2019s own testimony, that he used the phrase to discourage some prospective applicants also necessarily implies that he expected the phrase to look like a requirement. Moreover, Anderson identified the position as \u201cSenior Manager\u201d in MCI\u2019s official log of the promotion process, and in a trial affidavit, and yet he did not give Shelby what he now says is only a compensation title. Instead, he gave Shelby the title of \u201cSegment Manager,\u201d a title unfamiliar to Covington and to Anderson\u2019s successor. The jury could readily infer that Anderson made up the title \u201cSegment Manager\u201d because Shelby did not have the seniority to be a Senior Manager but needed a similar-sounding title to lend him the authority associated with his new responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">MCI contends that the jury could not infer that Anderson considered substantial experience to be a job requirement if Anderson testified that he did not. We disagree. A decision-maker\u2019s self-interested testimony about his own thoughts is not unassailable; direct evidence of discriminatory intent is hardly ever available, so a plaintiff generally resorts to circumstantial evidence to show what the decision-maker had in mind. <em>Kline v. Tenn. Valley Auth., </em>128 F.3d 337, 348 (6th Cir.1997). Covington produced evidence reasonably implying that Senior Manager eligibility was a prerequisite for the post, and evidence that Shelby was not eligible to be a Senior Manager. These points reasonably imply that Shelby was disqualified for the post, and thus that MCI\u2019s explanation was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">We do not say that an employer can avoid trial only by blindly adhering to the terms of a job posting he created before the applicant field was known. Businesses do not and cannot work that way. An employer who claims he re-prioritized his original standards because no applicant perfectly fit the bill cannot be assumed to be lying. Such a claim would be an integral part of his required explanation of his decision, which the plaintiff must then prove false using independent evidence. But if an employer at trial describes his standards and his decision-making process in a way that is flatly inconsistent with his own prior statements, he may be impeached thereby. Covington satisfied her slight burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">In the alternative, MCI urges that much of Covington\u2019s evidence was so prejudicial as to require a new trial. In particular, MCI challenges Covington\u2019s testimony as to an incident in September 2003. She testified that Shelby (then her coworker) made misogynist remarks to her. including: \u201cwomen should be at home raising babies, they have no place in the workforce;\u201d \u201cwomen can\u2019t compete with young men in the workplace;\u201d and \u201cwomen are too emotional.\u201d Covington complained to her then-supervisor Watson, who brushed these comments off as \u201ca guy thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>By this testimony, Covington sought to prove that MCI\u2019s promotion decision was tainted by sexual stereotyping. Shelby and Watson\u2019s comments, she contends, lend context to interview notes taken by Anderson during the promotion process. According to these notes. Anderson was very impressed by Shelby\u2019s focus and lack of distractions. Although the notes do not mention it. Anderson knew that Shelby was childless, and knew Covington\u2019s son had recently been diagnosed with severe kidney disease and received a transplant. Covington concludes that Anderson improperly stereotyped her as a primary care-giver, whose workplace commitment could not be relied upon. <em>See Nev. Dep\u2019t of Human Resources v. Hibbs, </em>538 U.S. 721, 123 S.Ct. 1972, 1979 n. 5, 155 L.Ed.2d 953 (2003) (noting prevalent stereotype that \u201cwomen\u2019s family duties trump those of the workplace\u201d); <em>see also Los Angeles Dep\u2019t of Power and Water v. Manhart, </em>435 U.S. 702, 707, 98 S.Ct. 1370, 55 L.Ed.2d 657 (1978) (\u201cemployment decisions cannot be made on the basis of mere \u2018stereotyped\u2019 impressions about the characteristics of males or females\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">We review the denial of MCI\u2019s motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion, reversing only if we are firmly convinced that the district court made a clear error of judgment. <em>Barnes v. Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp., </em>201 F.3d 815, 820-21 (6th Cir.2000). The district court could have granted a new trial because the verdict was so against the weight of the evidence as to be unreasonable, the damages award was excessive, or the verdict was influenced by bias or prejudice or was otherwise unfair. <em>Conte v. General Housewares Corp., </em>215 F.3d 628, 637 (6th Cir.2000). We ask whether the challenged evidence was clearly admitted improperly, and if so, whether its introduction was harmless error, that is, whether we can say with \u201cfair assurance,\u201d that it did not substantially affect the verdict, considering the weight of all the evidence on that issue and the centrality of the issue to the verdict. <em>Schrand v. Federal Pacific Elec. Co., </em>851 F.2d 152, 157 (6th Cir.1988) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557(1946)).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Testimony as to Shelby and Watson\u2019s alleged comments should have been excluded. Evidence shall be excluded if irrelevant; and may be excluded if it is if much more prejudicial than relevant. Fed.R.Evid. 402, 403. There was no probative value to the comments, because they could not support an inference of discriminatory intent by MCI. Derogatory remarks by an immediate supervisor with meaningful influence on an employment decision may sometimes imply discrimination in the decision process. <em>Wells v. New Cherokee Corp., </em>58 F.3d 233, 238 (6th Cir.1995). But Shelby was not Covington\u2019s supervisor and had no influence on the decision. Watson could be considered a contributor to the promotion process, because he helped Anderson interview Covington and Shelby and discussed the decision with Anderson, and because Shelby\u2019s promotion was announced in a memo sent under Watson and Anderson\u2019s names. But Watson did not somehow adopt Shelby\u2019s remarks by saying \u201cit\u2019s a guy thing.\u201d <em>See Chappell v. GTE Products Corp., </em>803 F.2d 261, 268 n. 2 (6th Cir.1986) (evidence that age-discrimination plaintiffs supervisor once said \u201c[d]on\u2019t categorize me in that with you.\u201d in response to third-party\u2019s remark that \u201cwe old timers know the procedure,\u201d properly excluded as irrelevant and prejudicial). A single \u201c[i]solated and ambiguous\u201d remark unrelated to a suspect decision cannot establish discrimination. <em>Phelps v. Yale Sec., Inc., </em>986 F.2d 1020, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>1025 (6th Cir.1993).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, there is no apparent nexus between Watson\u2019s alleged misogyny and Anderson\u2019s private notes, so the one cannot explain the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The evidence was highly prejudicial, because this sort of irrelevant, apparent \u201csmoking gun\u201d can win a discrimination case. Thus, in <em>Smith v. Leggett Wire Co., </em>220 F.3d 752, 759-60 (6th Cir.2000), we reversed because the district court had admitted testimony as to graphic racial insults by co-workers of plaintiffs own rank. Similarly, in <em>Schrand, </em>851 F.2d at 156-57, we remanded for a new trial because plaintiffs most powerful evidence was that two co-workers had been told by them supervisors that they had been fired because of age: because those supervisors did not influence plaintiffs own termination, this evidence was unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">That the material was not merely potentially, but actually, prejudicial is strongly suggested by the fact that the jury found discrimination only on the basis of sex (rather than race or age). These inflammatory comments were nearly the only evidence going to sexual discrimination in particular-nothing else even purported to connect Anderson\u2019s notes to his supposed concerns about Covington\u2019s home life, nor was there evidence that MCI would not have had such concerns about the commitment of a male employee with a gravely ill child. <em>See Bickerstaff v. Vassar College, </em>196 F.3d 435, 448, 452 (2d Cir.1999) <em>(jury </em>may not infer that extremely negative assessment of black tenure candidate was <em>ipso facto </em>based upon racial animus). Therefore, we are firmly convinced that the verdict was substantially swayed by this material.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">We review the remaining challenged evidence only to the extent necessary to provide guidance on remand. Covington\u2019s counsel recited, from an email that Covington wrote when laid off in a June 1994 reduction in force, that Covington\u2019s discharge was a violation of her \u201ccivil rights\u201d which she, \u201cas a black female over 40,\u201d would not stand for, and that she had documentation of things that \u201cweren\u2019t right\u201d over the \u201clast few months\u201d preceding June 1994. Counsel cursorily questioned Amelang about these statements, purportedly in order to impeach Amelang\u2019s testimony that Covington had not previously complained about discrimination in the November 1993 promotion process. But Amelang\u2019s testimony did not open the door to vague accusations about later events; the email, or his acknowledgment that it existed, could not conceivably refute his prior testimony. The effect of counsel\u2019s recitation of plaintiffs own later, unrelated opinions must have been to make Amelang look like a liar, and to make Covington look persecuted. The relevance was nil, and the material was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the denial of MCI\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, reverse the denial of MCI\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>motion for a new trial as to liability, and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">HOOD, District Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur in the majority\u2019s finding that Covington satisfied her burden of proof that MCI\u2019s proffered explanation for promoting Shelby rather than Covington was a mere pretext for intentional sexual discrimination. I disagree with the majority\u2019s finding that the testimony as to Shelby and Watson\u2019s alleged comments should have been excluded as irrelevant and highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">As noted by the majority, Covington testified that Shelby, prior to his promotion to Segment Manager, made discriminatory comments to her, including: \u201cwomen should be at home raising babies, they have no place in the workforce;\u201d \u201cwomen can\u2019t compete with young men in the workplace;\u201d and \u201cwomen are too emotional.\u201d Covington testified she and other employees complained to Watson about Shelby\u2019s comments who responded with, \u201cDOt\u2019a a guy thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The majority cites <em>Phelps v. Yale Sec., Inc., </em>986 F.2d 1020, 1025 (6th Cir.1993) for the proposition that a single isolated and ambiguous remark unrelated to a suspect\u2019s decision cannot establish discrimination. Since the <em>Phelps </em>case, this Court has taken a closer look at discriminatory remarks and has set out a more comprehensive analysis than that made in the <em>Phelps </em>case to determine if such remarks should be admitted into evidence. In <em>Cooley v. Carmike Cinemas, Inc., </em>25 F.3d 1325 (6th Cir.1994), an age-discrimination case, this Court acknowledged the <em>Phelps </em>case but went on to engage in a further analysis of the statement made in that case. This Court noted that although comments were made not in the context of the plaintiffs termination and that the comments were made years prior to the termination, \u201cthe accumulated testimony is going beyond the vague, ambiguous, and isolated comments that have been held insufficient to support an age-discrimination claim.\u201d <em>Cooley, </em>25 F.3d at 1333. The comments were attributed to decision makers, related to the decision-making process, and quoted by co-workers who had discussions with Cooley\u2019s superiors during the course of their employment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">In <em>Ercegovich v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>154 F.3d 344 (6th Cir.1998). this Court set forth a two-step process to analyze whether a remark should be admitted into evidence. The first step is to look at the identity of the speaker and whether a reasonable jury could conclude that the speaker was in a position to influence the decision to terminate an employee. <em>Id. </em>at 355 <em>(citing Kelley v. Airborne Freight Corp., </em>140 F.3d 335, 347-48 (1st Cir.l998))(statement by head of human resources who \u201cparticipated closely\u201d in plaintiffs termination was admissible to show a discriminatory atmosphere.). Although, as the majority writes, the original comments were spoken by Shelby, a non-decision maker in the promotion. Covington testified she complained to Watson, the Senior Manager, about Shelby\u2019s comments. Watson brushed off her complaints stating it was a \u201cguy thing.\u201d These statements then are Watson\u2019s who participated in the interviewing process and whose name appeared in a memo announcing Shelby\u2019s promotion. As the majority found, there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Watson was involved in the employment decision not to promote Covington.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">The second step is to examine the substance of the remark to determine its relevancy to a plaintiffs claim that an impermissible factor motivated the adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>employment action against the plaintiff. <em>Ercegovich, </em>154 F.3d at 355. \u201cAlthough we believe a direct nexus between the allegedly discriminatory remarks and the challenged employment action affects the remark\u2019s probative value, the absence of a direct nexus does not necessarily render a discriminatory remark irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]hen assessing the relevancy of an allegedly biased remark where the plaintiff presents evidence of multiple discriminatory remarks or other evidence of pretext, we do not view each discriminatory remark in isolation, but are mindful that the remarks buttress one another as well as any other pretextual evidence supporting an inference of discriminatory animus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">In this case, the comment by Watson, in response to complaints about Shelby, is relevant. Watson at the time of the interviews had knowledge of the comments made by Shelby. It could be argued by Covington that Watson shared Shelby\u2019s views based on his response that it was a \u201cguy thing\u201d and because he failed to do anything about Shelby\u2019s comments. Although the majority does not find Anderson\u2019s (Center Manager and a decision maker) interview notes connected his supposed concerns about Covington\u2019s home life to Watson\u2019s comments, I find that Covington could argue that Anderson\u2019s interview notes, coupled with Watson\u2019s comments, show that Covington\u2019s gender was an issue in their promotion decision. Anderson\u2019s notes indicated that Shelby had a \u201cstronger commitment\u201d and had \u201cno distractions.\u201d By themselves, these notations would not be probative of gender discrimination. However, Covington submitted evidence that Anderson was aware that Covington\u2019s child was gravely ill. In addition to this cited testimony and evidence, there was other sufficient evidence to show Shelby\u2019s promotion was motivated by gender bias. As noted by the majority, the position title was changed from \u201cSenior Manager\u201d to \u201cSegment Manager.\u201d Covington could argue that the change in title, which was unfamiliar to others at MCI, was changed in order to accommodate Shelby\u2019s lack of experience for promotion to a Senior Manager position. Covington was more experienced and had received awards for her management skills and for exceeding sales goals, which Covington properly argued contradicted Anderson\u2019s interview notes that Covington was \u201cnot focused on goals or sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">I respectfully disagree that the testimony by Covington about the statements made by Shelby and Watson was not relevant and that the material was highly prejudicial. I would affirm the district court\u2019s denial of MCI\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial as to liability.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-7\">. The Generic Job Summary apparently allows an employee's educational degrees to substitute for experience, but as the record does not show how this apparent rule might apply to Shelby, we decline to read a caveat into Amelang\u2019s clear testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b867-7\">. In <em>Cooley v. Carmike Cinemas, Inc., </em>25 F.3d 1325 (6th Cir.1994), cited by the dissent, we upheld the admission of derogatory remarks, unrelated to the decision-making process, made by a person other than the decision-maker. But those remarks were made by the CEO of the company, a person who unquestionably set the tone for all lesser managers. That CEO consistently repeated his derogatory remarks over a period of years, strongly suggesting the creation of an unspoken corporate policy. <em>Cooley, </em>25 F.3d at 1331-32. Moreover, we did not positively hold that even such strong indicia of bigotry at a high level proved discrimination by the decision-maker, we merely refused to find that admission was an abuse of discretion in the context of an otherwise-strong plaintiE\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 1332-33.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
