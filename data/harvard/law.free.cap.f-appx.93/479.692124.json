The Officers claim that they are owed an additional paycheck for unpaid hours which accrued over an 11-year period. The District Court granted summary judgment to the Borough and denied the Officers\u2019 cross motion for summary judgment, stating, \u201c[t]he plaintiffs have not stated a legal basis on which to base their claim.\u201d Dist. Ct. Mem. &amp; Order, Sept. 26, 2002 at 5. Because we agree that the Officers have no legal support for their claim, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-17\">This Court exercises plenary review of the District Court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. <em>Curley v. Klem, </em>298 F.3d 271, 276-77 (3d Cir.2002). We apply the same test employed by the District Court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) and will affirm only if it appears \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In evaluating the evidence, we, like the District Court, are required \u201cto view the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Curley, </em>298 F.3d at 276-77 (quoting <em>Barbnicki v. Vopper, </em>200 F.3d 109, 114 (3d Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-18\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-19\">Because we write only for the parties, and the background of this case is set forth in detail in the District Court\u2019s Memorandum and Order, we revisit the factual basis of the action only briefly. Counsel for the Officers explained at oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>before the District Court that, \u201c[d]ue to a quirk in the American Calendar, every four years there are three days of work that they have not been compensated for. Every 11 years that winds up being a full pay period.\u201d Counsel further explained that \u201cpay period\u201d refers to two weeks of salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The Officers are salaried employees, pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) entered into by the Borough and North Plainfield PBA Local No. 85 in 1997. Article X and Appendix A of the CBA establish that the Officers are paid based on their work experience, and the agreement does not provide for this calendar quirk. Article XI of the CBA addresses the payment of overtime, and defines it as \u201cany time worked in excess of eleven (11) hours in any twenty-four (24) hour period or forty-four (44) hours in one (1) 4 X 4 block....\u201d The agreement makes no provision for accruing overtime on an annual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Though counsel for the Officers conceded at argument before the District Court that \u201cthere is no case directly on point,\u201d they rely on a past payment by the Borough which compensated them for this so-called calendar quirk in a previous 11-year cycle as support for their claim in this case. As the Borough points out, however, that payment was a one-time payment which was neither provided for in the CBA applicable at that time nor the result of litigation. The Borough further notes that even the latest CBA, which was reached subsequent to that payment, does not account for the calendar quirk at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The Borough argues, we believe correctly, that the parties bargained for their salary arrangement and did not provide for additional, cumulative payouts to compensate for any calendar quirk. We agree with the District Court that because the Officers are unable to point to any legal support for their claim, it must fail. We are unaware of, and the Officers have not cited, any case or statute which would support their theory of accumulated overtime payments due as a result of this calendar anomaly. Because we conclude that the Officers\u2019 claim must fail because of a lack of any legal support for their theory, we do not reach the question of whether the statute of limitations would apply to their claim under the Fair Labor Standards Act. We will therefore affirm the decision of the District Court granting summary judgment to the Borough.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
