For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-17\">Rachid arrived in this country on May 4, 1998 without any travel documents. He claimed to be an Algerian national and he was seeking political asylum. App. at 169a. He was immediately detained by the INS and interviewed. App. at 169a. During the interview, he stated that he fled Algeria because he was afraid he would be killed after his brothers were killed in the middle of the night by government soldiers. App.at 172a, 174a. The INS interviewed Rachid again on May 15. App. at 162a-67a. During the second interview, Rachid again stated that he was afraid to go back to Algeria due to the civil war there and his brothers\u2019 shooting. App. at 169a. He also responded \u201cno\u201d to questions about whether he had ever been threatened, arrested or detained; had encountered problems with the police or military; or was ever mistreated, abused or tortured. App. at 164a-65a. His case was then referred for a hearing to see if he qualified for asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> App. at 167a-68a.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>On May 28, Rachid appeared pro se at his asylum hearing and withdrew his asylum application. App. at 152a-53a. In September, he attempted to reinstate his asylum application by submitting a written asylum application. App. at 150a. The attempt met with no success. However, a year and a half later, his asylum application was reinstated with the help of counsel, and Rachid submitted a second written asylum application. App. at 133a-34a, 138a-39a. In that petition, he stated for the first time that the Algerian police had accused him of belonging to the Islamic Salvation Front (\u201cFIS\u201d); that the police had arrested him three times; and that they had jailed, beat, starved and tortured him for days following his arrest. App. at 133a-34a. He requested asylum, withholding of removal, or withholding of removal and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). App. at 3a.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Rachid had his second hearing before an IJ in July 2001. App. at 36a. At the hearing, Rachid testified that the Algerian military police arrested him three times in February, June and August 1995, and that the police beat and tortured him using electric shocks while he was detained. App. at 46a-57a. He also testified that the police interrogated him regarding his connections with FIS the first and third times he was arrested. App. at 49a, 56a. Rachid claimed that he did not tell his entire story during his first two INS interviews because he was frightened, and that he did not trust the person who helped him complete his first written asylum application enough to tell that person about his arrests and torture. App. at 66a, 77a-78a, 81a-82a. He also submitted the affidavit of a doctor who examined him, David S. Kang, M.D., which stated that his scars were clearly indicative of torture. App. at 107a-10a.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">The IJ denied Rachid any relief. He denied Rachid asylum because he found that Rachid\u2019s testimony regarding his arrests and torture was unbelievable. R. at 18a. He found Raehid\u2019s excuses for his failure to mention these things during his first two interviews and in his first written asylum application were implausible, concluding that \u201cat some point [Rachid] decided to embellish his story, particularly the arrests. What we have is, in my opinion, a recent fabrication of a story.\u201d R. at 17a. The IJ then found that Rachid\u2019s consistent story about his brothers being killed did not make out his asylum claim, either. App. at 17a-18a. He also refused to grant Rachid withholding of removal, stating that withholding required Rachid to meet a higher standard of proof than granting asylum did. R. at 18a-19a.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. It agreed with the IJ that \u201ccontradictions, addressed in detail in his decision, were not resolved by the applicant, either during the proceedings or on appeal.\u201d R. at 2a. Rachid timely filed this petition, requesting review of the BIA\u2019s decision to affirm the order of removal against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">Rachid raises three arguments be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>fore this court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, he argues that the IJ should not have found his later story about being arrested and tortured unbelievable because this Court has recognized that an alien\u2019s fear can explain differences between the story the alien tells upon arrival and the story he/she tells later. Second, he argues that the IJ should have accounted for the medical evidence of his torture when the IJ analyzed his asylum claim. Finally, he argues that the IJ should have granted his petitions for withholding of removal generally or withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). We address these issues seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Rachid states that the IJ erred in making an adverse credibility determination against him due to his failure to mention his arrests and torture in his first two INS interviews and in his first written asylum application. He argues that this was error because <em>Balasubramanrim v. INS, </em>143 F.3d 157 (3d Cir.1998), holds that inconsistencies between the story an alien initially tells and the story he/she tells later is not enough to discount the alien\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">We disagree. Upon his arrival in the U.S., Balasubramanrim was immediately detained and interviewed in English, a language in which he did not have good competency. During the interview, he was asked whether he had been arrested or tortured and responded only that his brother had been arrested. He subsequently described mistreatment at the hands of his home country\u2019s government and a rebel group within the country in a written asylum application, and testified to the same matters in his first hearing in front of an immigration judge. <em>Id. </em>at 158-GO. The IJ denied Balasubramanrim\u2019s application, finding the petitioner\u2019s later statements unbelievable because he had told the officers at the airport that he had never been arrested. <em>Id. </em>at 160. The BIA affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Subsequently, this Court found that the IJ and BIA placed undue reliance on the airport interview. <em>Id. </em>at 162. We stated that an arriving alien who has suffered abuse during interrogation by government officials in his home country may be reluctant to reveal such information during the first meeting with government officials in this country. <em>Id. </em>at 163. We then held that \u201csome inconsistencies between the airport statement and [the petitioner\u2019s] testimony before the immigration judge [were] not sufficient, standing alone, to support the Board\u2019s finding that [the petitioner] was not credible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">It is clear that there were more than just a few inconsistencies between the airport statement and the petitioner\u2019s testimony in the case at hand, though, giving the IJ appropriate grounds to distinguish Rachid\u2019s situation from <em>Balasubramanrim.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The IJ\u2019s decision notes that, unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Balasubramanrim, Rachid repeated that he had not been arrested or tortured in response to direct questions in a lengthier interview 10 days after the initial airport interview and in his first written asylum application submitted several months after the initial interview. He also notes that the cases can be distinguished because Rachid\u2019s airport interview was conducted in a language, French, in which Rachid\u2019s competency is uncontested. These are significant differences between the two cases that allowed the IJ to distinguish them and find that Rachid\u2019s inconsistent testimony was unbelievable. We will affirm the IJ\u2019s rejection of Rachid\u2019s testimony that he was tortured and arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Rachid\u2019s final argument is that the IJ\u2019s decision should have addressed the medical evidence because it establishes that he was tortured, and his torture establishes that he was persecuted such that he is eligible for asylum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The medical evidence at issue is the affidavit of David S. Kang, M.D., that Rachid submitted to the IJ at his second hearing. In this affidavit, Dr. Kang concludes that Rachid had been a victim of torture because Rachid\u2019s explanations of scars and injuries were consistent with his physical findings. The IJ\u2019s decision refers to Dr. Kang\u2019s testimony once, stating that Rachid was \u201cexamined by a Dr. Khan (sic) who he spent an hour and a half with and told him the story as to what happened to him in Algeria concerning the arrests, the beating and the killing of his brothers and his flight into the United States. The doctor\u2019s report was admitted into evidence.\u201d R. at 10a.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">This court has found that an affidavit reporting that an examination of an asylum applicant indicated torture is \u201cpowerful evidence.\u201d <em>Obianuju Ezeagwuna v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 116, 132 (3d Cir.2002). Even such important evidence can not help Rachid here, however. The IJ\u2019s decision not to grant asylum was based on his finding that the petitioner\u2019s later testimony/application was inconsistent with his earlier ones, and the doctor\u2019s opinion does not determine whether Rachid\u2019s later allegations of torture at the hands of government soldiers were true or false. Dr. Kang does not try to pinpoint when in time the torture occurred or at whose hands it happened; his testimony leaves open the possibility that Rachid was tortured this way but not under the circumstances he described. Because the doctor\u2019s affidavit does not compel a different conclusion than the one the IJ reached, we can not overturn the IJ\u2019s findings that the petitioner was ineligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Rachid also argues that the IJ should have found him eligible for withholding of removal. He states that he meets the criteria for withholding of removal generally because he has established that he suffered past persecution and will suffer future persecution due to his political opinion, and for withholding of removal under CAT because he established that he was tortured. He asked this Court to reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the IJ\u2019s decision and enter an order prohibiting his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The IJ explains his decision to deny withholding of removal, albeit briefly. After stating that Rachid was not eligible for asylum, he states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">Since withholding of removal is a higher standard, I must deny that, as well. Since I do not believe his testimony concerning his arrests, the mere fact that he may have been in the cross fire, an innocent family in a civil war, does not lead me to believe that he would be tortured if he returned to Algeria. He has not convinced me that the government of Algeria or its agents would be interested in him since I have not found him credible. I will deny that application as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">R. at 18a-19a. In summary, the IJ denies withholding of removal because he finds that Rachid can not be eligible for such relief if Rachid could not meet the lower standard for asylum eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">We agree with the ALJ that Rachid could not meet the standards for withholding of removal or CAT relief if he did not meet the criteria for asylum. To be granted asylum, a petitioner must prove only that he/she has a well-founded fear of persecution on account <em>of </em>race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158. Such a fear of persecution can be well-founded even when there is less than a 50 percent chance of the occurrence taking place. <em>Lin v. INS, </em>238 F.3d 239, 244 (3d Cir.2001). But he must prove that he faces a \u201cclear probability of harm\u201d upon return to his home country to qualify for withholding of deportation, <em>Chang v. INS, </em>119 F.3d 1055, 1065-66 (3d Cir.1997); this standard requires him to establish at least a 51 percent chance of harm. Similarly, the standard to establish eligibility for CAT relief requires Rachid to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he would be subject to torture upon return to his home country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c) (2004). Because it is more difficult to establish eligibility for withholding of removal generally and CAT relief than to establish eligibility for asylum, no one ineligible for asylum could possibly be eligible for withholding of removal under either test.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">For the above reasons, we will affirm the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-10\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1) (2004) states that IJs should grant applicants asylum as a matter of discretion based on whether the applicant proves he/she meets the definition of \"refu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>gee\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2004). <em>See Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 482 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">Section 1101(a)(42)(A) defines a refugee as: any person who is outside any country of such person's nationality ... who is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ...</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\">. We have the authority to review the BIA's decision to affirm an order of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) (2004). Because the BIA adopted the IT's decision, we review the Li's administrative findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>See Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 549 n. 2 (3d Cir.2001). Such review requires us to treat the IJ\u2019s findings as \"conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 167 (3d Cir.2003) (internal citation omitted). However, even under this deferential standard of review, an IJ must offer \"specific, cogent reasons for his or her disbelief\u201d when rejecting a witness's positive testimony because in his or her judgment it lacks credibility in order for his/her rejection of such testimony to be supported by substantial evidence. <em>Senathirajah v. INS, </em>157 F.3d 210, 216 (3d Cir.1998) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b510-13\">.
