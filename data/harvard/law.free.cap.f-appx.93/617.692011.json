SMITH, Circuit Judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b642-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-22\">The claimant, Raymond Veles, worked as a longshoreman for the employer, Coo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>per T/Smith, Inc. (\u201cCooper\u201d). During the course of his work, on November 26, 1999, a \u201ccheater pipe\u201d broke loose and collided with his knee, causing him to fall. Veles duly informed Cooper of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Somewhat later, after pain lingered in his knee, Veles visited his family physician, who examined the resulting swollen, bruised knee and recommended physical therapy. After therapy and medication failed to provide relief to pain, Veles\u2019 treating orthopedist, Bryan, gave him to an MRI, tentatively concluding he had torn meniscus. An independent Department of Labor physician, Butler, concluded that the knee problems arose from the aggravation of Veles\u2019s pre-existing chondromalacia, a diagnosis confirmed by Bryan during arthroscopic surgery in November 2000. As a result of back problems, Veles also had back surgery in February 2002 under Gertzbein\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Veles filed his benefits claim pursuant to the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to secure payment from respondents Cooper and the American Long-shore Mutual Association. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found Veles credible with respect to the symptoms of his injury and relied on treating physicians\u2019 testimony in finding that the cheater pipe accident had exacerbated an existing medical condition to the extent that Veles became unable to continue his longshore work.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Because the ALJ concluded that the injuries arose from a work-related accident, that Veles\u2019s knee injury resulted in permanent disability, and that his back injury resulted in a temporary disability, the ALJ concluded that Veles was due appropriate benefits. The ALJ also decided that Veles had reached maximum medical improvement for his knee injury on November 12, 2001, and keyed his receipt of benefits accordingly, including temporary total disability payments from November 26, 1999, to November 11, 2001, and permanent total disability compensation thereafter. The Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d) affirmed. Cooper and the earner petition for review, arguing that the ALJ\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">We review decisions of the BRB for errors of law. Like the BRB, we may gainsay the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact only if they are unsupported by substantial evidence. Especially, we must respect the ALJ\u2019s evaluations of witness credibility, whether the witness is lay or expert. <em>Calbeck v. Strachan Shipping Co., </em>306 F.2d 693. We will not interfere with the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations unless they are \u201cinherently increditable or patently unreasonable.\u201d <em>Dir., OWCP v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>620 F.2d 60 (5th Cir.1980). We look to whether the BRB has applied the correct deferential standard of review with respect to the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact, or equivalently that it has not substituted its own view for the ALJ\u2019s. <em>New Orleans (Gulfwide) Stevedores v. Turner, </em>661 F.2d 1031 (Former 5th Cir. Nov. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">Respondents contend that the ALJ\u2019s finding that Veles sustained permanently disabling work-related injuries is not supported by substantial evidence. Respondents dispute that Veles\u2019s knee and back problems arose from a work-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>injury. Cooper contends that the \u201ccheater pipe\u201d accident resulted in a temporary bruise, which acted to exacerbate neither existing chondromalacia in his knee or the problems \"with his spine. Rather, respondents assert that Veles is a malingerer and exaggerated the extent of the injury to his knee. They fault the ALJ for preferring the testimony of treating physicians over respondents\u2019 expert witness and for crediting Veles\u2019s testimony with respect to the difficulties caused by his knee and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">In deciding whether the knee and back in-juries were work-related, the ALJ properly undertook the presumption-shifting framework described by section 20(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The claimant established his <em>prima facie </em>case, the defense rebutted, and the ALJ heard arguments from both sides concerning the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The key testimony before the ALJ included Department of Labor physician Butler\u2019s testimony that the pre-existing condition of chondromalacia was exacerbated by the accident and that Veles\u2019s back problems were intensified by his resulting limp; and Cooper\u2019s examining physician Fultz\u2019s admission that the pre-existing condition of chondromalacia had likely been exacerbated by the accident. <em>See Conoco, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 684, 33 BRBS 187(CRT) (holding that employer is liable for aggravation of pre-existing injury). The ALJ credited the testimony of Gertzbein, who concluded that the back injury also flowed from the accident as a result of Veles\u2019s resulting limp. The ALJ noted that Bryan believed, at least as of July 11, 2001, that there was nothing he could do to improve the function of the knee. Importantly, the ALJ also heard Veles\u2019s description of the accident and the symptoms of his injury, and the ALJ found his testimony to be straightforward and credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence, and the BRB acted properly in refusing to gainsay them. Though respondents point to Fultz\u2019s doubts that the back injury flowed from Veles\u2019s limp, and point to claimant\u2019s alleged \u201chypersensitivity\u201d to pain, it was within the ALJ\u2019s purview to exercise his judgment in evaluating witnesses\u2019 credibility and in assembling the evidence presented to him. Merely because different determinations of credibility could have led to different conclusions, does not mean that the ALJ\u2019s fact finding was unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">In assessing the point at which Veles\u2019s disability became permanent, the ALJ analyzed the time when his knee injury reached \u201cmaximum medical improvement.\u201d The respondents dispute the ALJ\u2019s finding that maximum medical improvement had been reached on November 12, 2001, when treatment, including surgeries, were undertaken thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Maximum medical improvement may have been reached, however, before the end of a series of surgical treatments, when the later surgeries will not improve the claimant\u2019s ability to perform. <em>Sketoe v. Dolphin Titan Int\u2019l, </em>28 BRBS 212 (1994). Moreover, even where a doctor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>prognosis indicates that a condition may improve, but where the condition has a lasting and infinite duration, the ALJ may yet conclude that a claimant has reached maximum medical improvement. <em>Brown v. Bethlehem Steel, </em>19 BRBS 200 (1987). The ALJ relied on the testimony of Veles\u2019s treating doctors over that of Cooper\u2019s expert in determining that Veles reached maximum medical improvement with respect to his knee on November, 12, 2001. There is substantial evidence to support the AL J\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Respondents contend the ALJ erred in awarding total disability benefits, saying that the ALJ did not rely on substantial evidence of Veles\u2019s inability to return to his usual work. The ALJ heard Gertzbein\u2019s testimony that Veles\u2019s knee condition will prevent him from returning to his former, physically demanding job. Given the infirmity of Veles\u2019s knee, the ALJ relied on substantial evidence in deciding that Veles was permanently unfit for longshore work.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Once a claimant establishes inability to return to his usual work, the employer may take up the burden of showing the availability of suitable alternative work. <em>See Turner. </em>Veles demonstrated that he was functionally illiterate and unable to perform any work at the time the record closed, and respondents presented no evidence of suitable alternate employment. The ALJ relied on substantial evidence in concluding that Veles was totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-6\">. A claimant must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case that the accident occurred at the place of employment and could have caused harm or pain or aggravated a pre-existing condition, which the employer may rebut by producing substantial evidence that the injury is not related to employment. <em>See, e.g., Gooden v. Dir., OWCP, </em>135 F.3d 1066, 32 BRBS 59(CRT) (5th Cir.1998); <em>Conoco, Inc. v. Dir., OWCP, </em>194 F.3d 684, 33 BRBS 187(CRT) (5th Cir.1999). If the employer rebuts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the claimant to show causation, based on the record as a whole. <em>See, e.g., Universal Maritime Corp. v. Moore, </em>126 F.3d 256, 31 BRBS (CRT) (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
