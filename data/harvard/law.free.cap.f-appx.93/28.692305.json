Because Vi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>tek\u2019s failure to produce evidence of his inability to pay the debt renders him ineligible for a discharge of that debt, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">After more than twenty years of marriage, Vitek and Spiezio divorced. As part of the property settlement, Vitek agreed to make monthly payments to Spiezio. Vitek eventually claimed to be unable to continue making the monthly payments and commenced Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings, listing his debt to Spiezio as $77,000.00. Spiezio filed an adversary proceeding contesting Vitek\u2019s entitlement to discharge and challenging the discharge-ability of the marital property settlement. The bankruptcy court granted Vitek a general discharge, but denied him a discharge of the property settlement debt to Spiezio.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Vitek sought discharge of the usually non-dischargeable property settlement debt under the inability-to-pay exception of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523. The bankruptcy court recognized that while most divorce property settlements are nondischargeable in bankruptcy, there are two exceptions: (1) if the debtor proves his inability to pay such debt, or (2) if the discharge would benefit the debtor more than it would harm the debtor\u2019s former spouse and children. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15) (2003). A debtor bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a debt meets one of these exceptions and is thus dischargeable. <em>See Grogan v. Garner, </em>498 U.S. 279, 291, 111 S.Ct. 654, 112 L.Ed.2d 755 (1991); <em>Davis v. Cox, </em>356 F.3d 76, 95 (1st Cir.2004); <em>Gamble v. Gamble (In re Gamble), </em>143 F.3d 223, 226 (5th Cir.1998). The bankruptcy court concluded that Vitek did not meet the burden for either exception; the bankruptcy appellate panel (BAP) affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">On appeal, Vitek argues that the court erred in concluding that his debt to Spiezio does not meet the first exception, requiring debtors to prove that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">the debtor does not have the ability to pay such debt from income or property of the debtor not reasonably necessary to be expended for the maintenance or support of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor and, if the debtor is engaged in a business, for the payment of expenditures necessary for the continuation, preservation, and operation of such business ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(15)(A) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Although Vitek\u2019s appeal comes to this court by way of the BAP, our review is of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. <em>Koenig Sporting Goods, Inc. v. Morse Rd. Co. (In re Koenig Sporting Goods, Inc.), </em>203 F.3d 986, 988 (6th Cir.2000). We review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <em>Unsecured Creditors\u2019 Comm. of Highland Superstores, Inc. v. Strobeck Real Estate, Inc. (In re Highland Superstores, Inc.), </em>154 F.3d 573, 576 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">Vitek argues that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that he was able to pay the balance of the property settlement because it relied on the wrong schedules and failed to consider evidence regarding his living and business expenses. Vitek contends that if the court properly viewed this information, it would have found that he was not able to pay Spiezio. The bankruptcy court, however, never concluded that Vitek possessed the ability to pay the property settlement debt. Rather, the court concluded that Vitek failed to carry his burden of presenting evidence that would enable the court <em>to determine </em>his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ability <em>to pay. </em>According to the bankruptcy judge, Vitek did not provide: (1) current information on the fair market value of his real property so as to allow judicial determination about any available equity; (2) sufficient data to permit valuation of Vitek\u2019s business equipment and inventory, (3) information necessary to assess the highest and best use of his real property, or (4) information relevant to assessing whether Vitek\u2019s expenses could be reduced by liquidating his real estate. Since the missing pertinent financial information <em>prevented </em>proper judicial evaluation of Vitek\u2019s ability to pay-and he bore the burden of proof-his argument that the court used the wrong schedules or evidence lacks merit. The court simply decided it could not make the call in the absence of additional financial information. Thus Vitek did not prove to the court by a preponderance of the evidence that he met one of two exceptions to non-disehargeabilty under \u00a7 523(a)(15)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Vitek next contends that although he failed to supply evidence regarding his real property\u2019s value, the court should have viewed the property as valueless in light of the trustee having abandoned it. Vitek cites the \u201cTrustee\u2019s Report of No Distribution\u201d in support. But that report evidences only the trustee\u2019s conclusion that the estate included no exempt property available for distribution, not that the property was valueless or that he was abandoning the property. Moreover, distinctions exist between a trustee\u2019s decision to abandon property and a finding that the property is worthless in the hands of the <em>debtor. </em>A trustee may elect to abandon property burdensome to the <em>estate </em>or of inconsequential value and benefit to the <em>estate. </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a) (1993). The trustee\u2019s treatment of the real estate compelled no conclusion on the part of the bankruptcy court as to its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">Vitek next questions on the grounds of relevance, the bankruptcy court\u2019s reference to the nondischargeability of spousal support, given that the parties stipulated that this was a property settlement and not spousal support. On review, we assess this reference as appropriate. The bankruptcy court referenced the nondischargeability of spousal support only to provide context for the pertinent discussion of the 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15) exceptions. The court acknowledged Vitek\u2019s debt to Spiezio to be a property settlement and did not, as Vitek suggests, \u201cignore the pleadings [ ] and \u2018manufacture\u2019 other pleadings after trial testimony [was] completed.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">Vitek also complains on appeal that the bankruptcy court demonstrated a predisposition to rale in Spiezio\u2019s favor by (1) denying Vitek\u2019s motions for summary judgment and sanctions, (2) hinting to Spiezio that she should proceed under a different provision of the bankruptcy code, (3) extending the time for filing post-trial memoranda, (4) entering the decision the day after Christmas so as to impede the filing of an appeal, and (5) relying on law review articles to extend the case beyond the pleadings. Despite perceiving a predisposition on the part of the trial judge, Vitek never moved to have the judge removed. This court normally forgoes consideration of such waived issues. In light of the serious nature of the claim, however, the bankruptcy appellate panel elected to review it and found the assignment of error without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">Upon reviewing Vitek\u2019s various charges of bias, we too find no merit because \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>reasonable, objective person, knowing all of the circumstances, would not have questioned [the judge\u2019s] impartiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Hough, </em>276 F.3d 884, 899 (6th Cir.2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">We reject each of Vitek\u2019s reasons for concluding the bankruptcy judge was biased. First, the bankruptcy judge\u2019s rulings on Vitek\u2019s motions for summary judgment and sanctions, together with the court\u2019s extension of the deadline for filing post-trial memoranda, were not unreasonable and thus do not support his bias claim. Second, the court\u2019s citing to law review articles merely provided a framework for its decision, not a divergence from the record. Third, we find that when the court asked Spiezio\u2019s counsel, \u201cAm I correct in my understanding, Mr. Mittman that you\u2019re still going under 727 and 523,\u201d it was not hinting that Spiezio should amend her complaint to proceed under a different section of the code. J.A. at 196. The court suggested no alternative avenue, nor otherwise guided Spiezio\u2019s counsel, as Vitek intimates. Finally, Vitek\u2019s objection to the timing of the fifing of the court\u2019s opinion ascribes an ulterior motive of discouraging appeal that this court rejects as groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Last, Vitek claims the bankruptcy court improperly looked to Spiezio\u2019s financial need when determining Vitek\u2019s ability to pay under \u00a7 523(a)(15)(A). Our review, like that of the BAP, confirms that the court\u2019s interest in Spiezio\u2019s financial situation concerned the question of whether the benefit to Vitek from a discharge of the debt would outweigh the detrimental consequences to Spiezio, an appropriate inquiry under \u00a7 523(a)(15)(B). Contrary to Vitek\u2019s briefing, the bankruptcy court did not confuse the \u00a7 523(a)(15)(A) and (B) inquiries. The court properly concluded that Vitek was not entitled to a discharge under either section.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">We thus affirm the bankruptcy appellate panel\u2019s decision upholding the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
