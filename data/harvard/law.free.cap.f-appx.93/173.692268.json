We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-22\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum for substantial evidence and reverse only if the evidence was such that a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d <em>38 </em>(1992); <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-23\">The BIA determined that Avetissova lacked credibility and failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum. This determination is supported by Avetissova\u2019s previous application for asylum, which was materially inconsistent with her later application, and by her own admission that she filed the previous application for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>improper purpose. Because the BIA found Avetissova\u2019s testimony incredible, the BIA reasonably took into account the lack of corroborative evidence that she introduced to support her testimony. <em>See Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000). Avetissova did not show that the record compels a contrary result as to her asylum claim. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">As Avetissova has failed to demonstrate that she is eligible for asylum, she also does not qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b197-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
