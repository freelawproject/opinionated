This action was filed after the death of the Chic Wigs\u2019 employee who claimed such harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">First, Chic Wigs contests the admission of three items of evidence \u2014 EEOC documents. The Chic Wigs employee had filed charges with the EEOC; the documents concern those charges. Based upon the unusual procedural posture of this action, our review of the record, and application of the proper standard of review, the district court did not commit reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Second, Chic Wigs challenges the denial of its motion for a mistrial based on statements in Cool\u2019s closing argument about a witness not being called by Chic Wigs. The district court found there was no prejudice. This ruling was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Third, Chic Wigs has appealed the award of attorney\u2019s fees to Cool. At oral argument for this appeal, however, Chic Wigs conceded that, if the judgment were upheld, so too should the fees order. Accordingly, because of our disposition of the other issues, we need not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5 th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
