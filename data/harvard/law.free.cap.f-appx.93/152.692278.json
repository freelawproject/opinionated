We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2003). We grant the petition, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s determination that Egoavil-Macha did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution based on the bombing of her home, the deaths in her family, and the attempted forced recruitment by the terrorists on account of her father\u2019s imputed political opinion. <em>See Meza-Manay v. INS, </em>139 F.3d 759, 764 (9th Cir.1998) (finding persecution based on the political opinion imputed to the petitioner from her husband\u2019s involvement with the police).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">We therefore grant the petition and remand to the BIA for a determination, accepting Egoavil-Macha established a well-founded fear of future persecution, whether Egoavil-Macha is otherwise eligible for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">PETITION GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b177-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
