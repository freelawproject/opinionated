The district court found that Hartford had no duty to defend or indemnify Brown in a bankruptcy adversary proceeding seeking the return of estate property allegedly illegally transferred to her, because the action was not a covered suit for damages under the terms of Brown\u2019s policy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On appeal, Brown insists she should have been defended for a covered \u201coccurrence.\u201d Her homeowners\u2019 insurance policy provides personal liability coverage \u201c[i]f a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Like the district court, we find that Brown failed to meet her \u201cburden of showing that there has been an \u2018occurrence\u2019 within the terms of the policy\u201d and otherwise \u201cto bring the claim within the basic scope of coverage.\u201d <em>Waller v. Truck Ins. Exch., Inc., </em>11 Cal.4th 1, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619, 625-26 (1995). The bankruptcy trustee\u2019s action alleged an illegal transfer to Brown from the bankruptcy estate; it did not allege either bodily injury or property damage, the types of liabilities covered by the policy. At the time of tender, Brown failed to inform Hartford of any additional facts that might have raised the possibility of coverage, and accordingly Hartford was under no duty to defend Brown in the trustee\u2019s suit. <em>See Upper Deck Co. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>358 F.3d 608, 615-16 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe plaintiffs in the underlying suit do not allege the type of damages covered by the policy. To support a finding of potential liability, the plaintiffs would have to allege <em>new facts of </em>[property damage]. Mere speculation that the plaintiffs could or will allege such facts does not give rise to a duty to defend.\u201d); <em>Hurley Constr. Co. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>10 Cal.App.4th 533, 12 Cal. Rptr.2d 629 (1992) (affirming summary judgment to insurer because third party action alleged no facts indicating a potential for coverage; there was no accidental \u201coccurrence\u201d within the plain meaning of the policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">In addition, the suit sought restitution of property in Brown\u2019s possession to the bankruptcy estate; it did not seek \u201cdamages\u201d as a result of Brown\u2019s conduct. Accordingly, Hartford did not breach its contract to defend or indemnify Brown in covered suits for damages, and summary judgment to Hartford is appropriate. <em>See Republic Western Ins. Co. v. Spierer, Woodward, Willens, Denis &amp; Furstman, </em>68 F.3d 347, 352 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cRestitutionary payments ... are not \u2018damages.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Bank of the West v. Superior Court, </em>2 Cal.4th 1254, 10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545, 553 (1992) (\u201cIt is well established that one may not insure against the risk of being ordered to return money or property that has been wrongfully acquired. Such orders do not award \u2018damages\u2019 as the term is used in insurance policies.\u201d); <em>see also Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London v. Superior Court, </em>24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Cal.4th 945, 103 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 16 P.3d 94, 102 (2001) (\u201c[W]here there is no duty to defend, there <em>cannot be </em>a duty to indemnify.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">.

California\u2019s duty to defend coverage is far broader than my colleagues in the majority appear to recognize. All that is necessary is that the facts <em>could </em>support a claim; a specific covered remedy need not be pled. <em>See Montrose Chemical Co. v. Super. Ct., </em>6 Cal.4th 287, 296, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153 (1993). Moreover, <em>Brown\u2019s </em>receipt of the property from her brother is not asserted to be intentional and, under California law, may constitute an <em>occurrence. See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Super. Ct., </em>161 Cal.App.3d 1199, 1202-03, 208 Cal.Rptr. 5 (1984).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
