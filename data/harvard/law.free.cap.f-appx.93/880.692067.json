(\u201cJeffrey Chain\u201d) summary judgment on Tropodyne\u2019s counterclaim for trademark infringement and unfair competition. Tropodyne contends that the district court erred in its determination that Jeffrey Chain was entitled to use the name \u201cJeffrey Chain\u201d in the sale of plastic chain without regard to evidence that such use was causing confusion in the marketplace. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-16\">This court is well acquainted with the facts of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We accordingly draw on those opinions for the facts relevant to the counterclaim currently before us. The Jeffrey Division of Dresser Industries, Inc. (\u201cDresser\u201d) manufactured engineering grade chain. Dresser had a trademark in the marks \u201cJeffrey\u201d and \u201cJ.\u201d In 1985 Dresser sold the Jeffrey Division to Jeffrey Chain. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement Jeffrey Chain acquired the right to use the name \u201cJeffrey Chain\u201d as its corporate name.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Licensing Agreement granted Jeffrey Chain an unlimited right to use the mark \u201cJeffrey\u201d when coupled with the word \u201cChain\u201d in its corporate or business name, and the exelu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>sive right to use the \u201cJeffrey\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d marks in the sale of non-plastic sewage chains when associated with the word \u201cChain.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">After selling the Jeffrey Division to Jeffrey Chain, Dresser continued to manufacture and sell plastic chain under the \u201cJeffrey Thermoplastic Link Sludge Collector Component\u201d product line. In 1992 Dresser spunoff its plastic sewage chain division to Indresco, Inc. As part of the spinoff, Dresser assigned to Indresco its interest in the \u201cJeffrey\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d trademarks. In 1993 Jeffrey Chain registered the trademark \u201cJeffrey Chain\u201d for engineering class chain, which includes all types of metallic and plastic chain at issue in this case. The same year Jeffrey Chain began selling plastic wastewater chain under the name \u201cJeffrey Chain.\u201d In 1995 Tropodyne acquired Indresco\u2019s plastic sewer chain line and Indresco\u2019s rights to use the \u201cJeffrey\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d trademarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">In 1996 Jeffrey Chain filed suit against Tropodyne alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition in connection with Tropodyne\u2019s use of the \u201cJeffrey\u201d mark in the sale of metallic sewage chain. In response, Tropodyne filed a counterclaim against Jeffrey Chain alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition in connection with Jeffrey Chain\u2019s use of the mark \u201cJeffrey\u201d in the sale of plastic sewage chain. After several proceedings in the district and appellate courts, Jeffrey Chain\u2019s claims against Tropodyne have been disposed of as a matter of law. On December 12, 2001, the district court dismissed the last remaining issue in the case when it entered summary judgment in favor of Jeffrey Chain on Tropodyne\u2019s counterclaim. The district court determined that pursuant to our May 23, 2000, opinion, Jeffrey Chain could not be prohibited from using its corporate name in the sale of plastic chain. Because there was no evidence of any unauthorized use of the marks, the district court determined that Tropodyne\u2019s claims failed as a matter of law and any evidence of confusion was irrelevant. Tropodyne filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment, applying the same Rule 56(c) standards used by the district court. <em>Bell v. Ohio State Univ., </em>351 F.3d 240, 246-47 (6th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate under Rule 56(c) \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show'that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). In conducting this review we view the evidence, all facts, and any inferences that may be drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>from the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Bell, </em>351 F.3d at 247 (citing <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">On appeal Tropodyne contends that the district court erred in failing to consider whether Jeffrey Chain\u2019s use of the \u201cJeffrey\u201d trademark in the plastic wastewater chain industry is likely to cause confusion so as to constitute trademark infringement and unfair competition by Jeffrey Chain against Tropodyne. Tropodyne contends that a \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d analysis was mandated by this Court\u2019s May 23, 2000, opinion, and that the district court accordingly erred when it entered summary judgment without first undertaking the confusion analysis set forth <em>in Frisch\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. Elby\u2019s Big Boy of Steubenville, Inc., </em>670 F.2d 642, 648 (6th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">In our May 23, 2000, opinion, we vacated the district court\u2019s entry of a permanent injunction against Jeffrey Chain\u2019s use of its corporate name in the sale of plastic sewage chain. <em>Jeffrey Chain I, </em>2000 WL 712379 at *1. We reasoned that both the Asset Purchase Agreement and the License Agreement specifically grant Jeffrey Chain the right to use \u201cJeffrey Chain\u201d as its corporate name and that neither of these instruments place any restrictions on the type of business in which Jeffrey Chain may engage. <em>Id. </em>at *4. We then considered whether the breadth of the permanent injunction was warranted by the district court\u2019s conclusion that a likelihood of confusion would result from Jeffrey Chain\u2019s use of its corporate name in marketing plastic chain. We concluded that the district court had improperly assumed confusion without a consideration of the <em>Frisch\u2019s </em>factors. We accordingly vacated the permanent injunction and remanded for proceedings consistent with the opinion. <em>Jeffrey Chain I, </em>2000 WL 712379 at *4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">As the district court aptly noted, our May 23, 2000, opinion was not the model of clarity. This becomes particularly apparent when we attempt to square that opinion with the case in its current posture. The arguments currently being raised are not the same as the arguments presented in <em>Jeffrey Chain If </em>The permanent injunction that was before this court on interlocutory appeal in <em>Jeffrey Chain I.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>prohibited Jeffrey Chain from using the word \u201cJeffrey,\u201d alone or in combination with other words, in connection with its sale of plastic chain. Given the wording of the injunction, it appeared that there was a question of fact as to whether Jeffrey Chain was selling its plastic chain under the name \u201cJeffrey,\u201d unaccompanied by the word \u201cChain.\u201d Subsequent to our May 23, 2000, opinion it has become abundantly clear that Jeffrey Chain is only selling its plastic chain using its corporate name. In response to Jeffrey Chain\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Tropodyne was unable to come forward with any evidence that Jeffrey Chain had used the trademark \u201cJeffrey\u201d in an unauthorized manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">Had Jeffrey Chain been using the word \u201cJeffrey\u201d alone to market its plastic chain, such a use of the trademark \u201cJeffrey\u201d would have been unauthorized and would have called for a likelihood of confusion analysis. It is the elimination of a question of fact as to Jeffrey Chain\u2019s unauthorized use of the trademark \u201cJeffrey\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>extinguishes the need for a \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d analysis. As we noted in <em>U.S. Structures, Inc. v. J.P. Structures, Inc., </em>130 F.3d 1185 (6th Cir.1997), \u201c[t]he Lanham Act [15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051-1127] prohibits the unauthorized use of a registered trademark when selling or advertising a good or service using the trademark is likely to confuse or deceive consumers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1188 (emphasis added). In order to defeat summary judgment on its counterclaim, Tropodyne was required to raise a genuine issue of fact as to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-4\">(1) whether their use of the trademark was without the registered owner\u2019s consent, or (2) whether their unauthorized use was likely to cause confusion in the marketplace as to the origin or sponsorship of the product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1188-1189 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted) (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114(l)(a), 1125(a)). In <em>Bird v. Parsons, </em>289 F.3d 865 (6th Cir.2002), we clarified the need for unauthorized use. We noted that \u201c[generally speaking, the key question in cases where a plaintiff alleges trademark infringement and unfair competition is whether the defendant\u2019s actions create a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of the parties\u2019 goods or services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 877 (citing <em>Daddy\u2019s Junky Music Stores, Inc. v. Big Daddy\u2019s Family Music Ctr., </em>109 F.3d 275, 280 (6th Cir.1997)). However, where the allegations arise out of the defendant\u2019s alleged use of the plaintiff\u2019s trademark rather than out of any other actions that might have misled the public, the plaintiffs claims of trademark infringement and unfair competition \u201cfail unless the defendants actually used [the plaintiffs] trademark in a prohibited manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 877 (citing <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. 800 Reservation, Inc., </em>86 F.3d 619, 626 (6th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Tropodyne\u2019s counterclaim against Jeffrey Chain rests on Jeffrey Chain\u2019s use of the mark \u201cJeffrey\u201d in the sale of plastic chain. As we previously held in our opinion of May 23, 2000, Dresser granted Jeffrey Chain the right to use the mark \u201cJeffrey\u201d together with the word \u201cChain\u201d as its corporate name without restrictions on the nature of the businesses into which it might enter. Although Dresser only granted Jeffrey Chain an exclusive right to use the mark in its non-plastic chain business, it did not prohibit Jeffrey Chain from entering the field of plastic chain. Jeffrey Chain was accordingly authorized to use its corporate name in conjunction with its sale of plastic chain. There simply is no evidence in this case that Jeffrey Chain used Tropodyne\u2019s trademark in a prohibited manner. The district court properly concluded that because Tropodyne presented no evidence that Jeffrey Chain made any unauthorized use of the trademark \u201cJeffrey,\u201d there was no trademark infringement as a matter of law and there was no need to consider the issue of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">For the reasons stated herein, the district court\u2019s December 12, 2001, order granting Jeffrey Chain summary judgment on Tropodyne\u2019s counterclaim is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-11\">.
