The Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York informed the Court that it was \u201cunable to appear as counsel\u201d because the defendant \u201cwas not served with the complaint,\u201d but it offered to \u201csubmit an <em>amicus </em>brief at the Court\u2019s request.\u201d Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The complaint is frivolous, whether reviewed <em>de novo or </em>for abuse of discretion. <em>Fitzgerald v. First E. Seventh St. Tenants Corp., </em>221 F.3d 362, 363-64 &amp; n. 2 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam). \u201cA complaint will be dismissed as \u2018frivolous\u2019 when \u2018it is clear that the defendants are immune from suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montero v. Travis, </em>171 F.3d 757, 760 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989)). In addition, for the reasons substantially stated by the district court, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine precludes subject matter jurisdiction over this claim. <em>See Moccio v. New York State Office of Court Admin., 95 </em>F.3d 195, 198 (2d Cir.1996); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3) (\u201cWhenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
