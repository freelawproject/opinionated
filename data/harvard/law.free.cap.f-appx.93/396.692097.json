Olick. Appellants argued before the NASD and the District Court that the award was precluded on <em>res judicata </em>grounds. Their arguments were rejected below and they appealed. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">This case is one in a series of lawsuits arising out of allegedly fraudulent transactions by dealers at John Hancock Distributors, Inc. (\u201cHancock\u201d). At the time of the transactions, Olick and Nikles were representatives of Hancock. DiMento, through the DiMento General Agency, was the Hancock agent responsible for supervising Olick and Nikles.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">A group of plaintiffs led by John Carroll sued Hancock, Olick, DiMento, the DiMento General Agency, and fifteen others, advancing claims under several state and federal statutes. The District Court in the <em>Carroll </em>lawsuit denied, as untimely and meritless, Oliek\u2019s motion seeking to assert cross-claims against DiMento and Hancock and third-party claims against Nikles. Appellants\u2019 App. at 101. The Court later dismissed the case with prejudice. Appellants\u2019 App. at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-19\">Before the Court ruled in <em>Carroll, </em>Olick filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Nikles had slandered and defamed him, interfered with business relations, and committed RICO violations. The District Court remanded the case to NASD arbitration. Appellants\u2019 App. at 64. In arbitration, the case against Nikles was consolidated with a similar lawsuit brought by Olick against Hancock, DiMento, and Larry Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-20\">Hancock sought a declaration from the District Court that the claims to be arbitrated were barred under <em>res judicata, </em>because they arose from the same facts as those asserted in the cross-claim in <em>Carroll. </em>The District Court dismissed Hancock\u2019s complaint, but on appeal we stated that \u201cthe federal courts must intervene in the arbitration process when faced with res judicata objections stemming from a prior federal judgment.\u201d <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Olick, </em>151 F.3d 132, 139 (3d Cir.1998). On remand, the District Court granted Hancock\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis that Olick\u2019s claims were barred under <em>res judicata. </em>Appellants\u2019 App. at 92. We affirmed. <em>John Hancock Distribs., Inc. v. Olick, </em>202 F.3d 254 (Table) (3d Cir. Sept.10, 1999) (per curiam), Appellants\u2019 App. at 103. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>NASD thus removed Hancock and Carter from the case awaiting arbitration. Appellants\u2019 App. at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">As the only remaining defendants in the case, appellants asserted a <em>res judicata </em>defense. Appellants\u2019 App. at 112. The NASD arbitrator rejected the defense and entered an award in favor of Olick. The appellants filed a motion in the District Court to vacate the arbitration award, but this motion was denied. Appellants\u2019 App. at 3. Appellants appealed and we dismissed because the appeal was not from a final order. Appellants\u2019 App. at 180. Appellants now appeal from a final order of the District Court confirming the award entered by the NASD. Appellants\u2019 App. at 3. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Appellants argue that by rejecting their <em>res judicata </em>claim, the District Court has created a direct conflict with the earlier opinion, affirmed by this court, dismissing Hancock and Carter from the lawsuit on the basis of <em>res judicata. </em>According to appellants, they meet the requirements to apply <em>res judicata: </em>(1) there was a final judgment on the merits in <em>Carroll; </em>(2) involving the same parties or, as here, their privies; and (3) the cause of action and underlying facts were the same. <em>See, e.g., In re Cont\u2019l Airlines, Inc., </em>279 F.3d 226, 232 (3d Cir.2002). Appellants thus ask us to reverse the District Court\u2019s order refusing to vacate the arbitration award and to rule as a matter of law that Oliek\u2019s claims against appellants are barred by <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Addressing appellants\u2019 concern that the arbitration panel acted in manifest disregard of the law by refusing to apply <em>res judicata, </em>the District Court stated \u201cthe arbitration panel did not disregard the Third Circuit\u2019s order ..., but ... apparently [found] that one or more of the required elements of <em>res judicata </em>had not been met. Even assuming arguendo that this decision is in error, it is not in manifest disregard of the law.\u201d Appellants\u2019 App. at 8. Like the District Court, we do not see a conflict between the earlier decision granting summary judgment to Hancock and the result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">In <em>Hancock, </em>we held that the courts, rather than an arbitrator, should make decisions about the applicability of res <em>judicata </em>based on a prior federal judgment. That decision, however, was dependent upon the procedural posture in that case. 151 F.3d at 134 (noting that in addition to asking the arbitration panel to dismiss the claim based on <em>res judicata, </em>\u201cHancock filed a complaint in the District Court,\u201d and thus the arbitration proceeding is still pending). \u201c[F]ederal courts must intervene in the arbitration process <em>when faced with res judicata objections </em>stemming from a prior federal judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">In the present case, appellants did not make a motion to the District Court alleging res <em>judicata, </em>but instead argued that doctrine only as a defense before the arbitrator. This distinction from <em>Hancock </em>is determinative. Appellants\u2019 plea to the District Court after the arbitration award was entered, in the form of a motion to vacate, was too little too late. The District Court had no authority to vacate the arbitration award under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a). Thus, appellants resorted to the judicially created doctrine that allows a District Court to vacate an award made in \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d <em>Dluhos v. Strasberg, </em>321 F.3d 365, 370 (3d Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). Under that extremely deferential standard, the District Court was unable to analyze the <em>res judicata </em>issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>anew, and thus correctly held that it could not vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">For the reasons set forth, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order confirming the arbitration award.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
