(CIU) appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of the motion for summary judgment filed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Appellants also appeal from the district court\u2019s (1) denial of their motion for reconsideration of that court\u2019s dismissal of CIU from the case due to CIU\u2019s failure to timely secure counsel to represent it and (2) denial of Ruiz Rivera\u2019s motion to file an amended complaint. We affirm the district court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-25\">As for the merits, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the IRS for essentially the reasons stated in that court\u2019s Opinion and Order. <em>See Ruiz Rivera v. I.R.S., </em>226 F.Supp.2d 345 (D.P.R.2002). We only add two com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ments. First, constitutional claims against the IRS, a federal agency, plainly are barred. <em>See FDIC v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 484-86, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994) (refusing to imply a Bivens-type cause of action directly against a federal agency). Second, any tort claims against the IRS must be brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671-2680, which \u201cwaives the sovereign immunity of the United States to suits in tort.\u201d <em>See Santiago-Ramirez v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>984 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir.1993). However, such a suit would be barred here under the exceptions to sovereign immunity contained in \u00a7 2680(c) (barring \u201c[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax\u201d) and (h) (barring \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of ... libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">In relation to the failure of CIU to retain counsel, the district court gave CIU over <em>two years </em>to secure legal representation, and CIU missed all of the deadlines the court had set for an attorney to appear on CIU\u2019s behalf. Indeed, an attorney did not file an appearance for CIU until <em>after </em>the court had dismissed CIU from the case. To be entitled to reconsideration of this dismissal, which was not a \u201cfinal\u201d order, appellants would have to show that the interests of justice required CIU\u2019s reinstatement as a plaintiff. <em>See Greene v. Union Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>764 F.2d 19, 22-23 (1st Cir.1985). We review a district court\u2019s denial of an interlocutory motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Douglas v. York County, </em>360 F.3d 286, 290 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We simply do not see how the interests of justice required the reinstatement of CIU, given the circumstances surrounding appellants\u2019 failure to timely secure counsel to represent CIU. First, appellants do not claim that they were unaware of the court orders directing CIU to obtain counsel or that they somehow misunderstood the orders or the deadlines contained in the orders. Rather, appellants, <em>knowing </em>of their obligations, simply did not comply with the district court\u2019s orders until two years had elapsed and until CIU had been dismissed from the case. <em>Compare Douglas, </em>360 F.3d 286, 290 (where the district court injected a <em>new </em>issue into the case without notifying the parties, it was an abuse of discretion to deny a promptly-filed motion for reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ruiz-Rivera\u2019s motion to amend the complaint. In this regard, it is undisputed that both Ruiz-Rivera and CIU were represented by counsel when the district court, in its scheduling order, set August 31, 1999 as the deadline for filing amended pleadings. Similarly, it is undisputed that appellants were represented by these same attorneys when the August 31 deadline passed. Appellants\u2019 counsel did not request an extension of time to file an amended complaint at this point, but rather waited until the conference held on November 22, 1999 to announce that they would be filing an amended complaint on or before January 3, 2000. Significantly, counsel also missed this deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u201cWe review the denial of a motion to amend the pleadings for an abuse of discretion and will affirm if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent from the record.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connell v. Hyatt Hotels of Puerto Rico, </em>357 F.3d 152, 154 (1st Cir.2004). Where a responsive pleading has been filed and the district court has entered a scheduling order, as here, Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(b) supplies the standard for obtaining an extension of time. Thus, Ruiz-Rivera was required to show \u201cgood cause\u201d for missing the deadline. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Here, Ruiz-Rivera did not file a motion to amend the complaint until August 13, 2002, which was almost <em>three years </em>after the expiration of the scheduling order deadline of August 31, 1999. In attempting to excuse this length of time, appellants focus on the fact that the motion to amend was filed only 30 days after attorney Morillo appeared in the case. This period of time, however, is not determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Rather, the focus of the \u201cgood cause\u201d inquiry must be on the reasons for the failure of appellants\u2019 <em>original </em>attorneys to meet the scheduling order deadline, as well as on the reasons for the failure of these attorneys to meet them own deadline of January 3, 2000 for the filing of an amended complaint. Appellants, however, do not present <em>any </em>arguments concerning these attorneys nor do they address these early deadlines. Plainly, then, appellants have failed to show either \u201cgood cause\u201d for missing the earlier deadline or \u201cdiligence\u201d in pursing an extension of time to file an amended complaint. <em>See </em>Rule 16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Moreover, there is no evidence that appellants exercised any diligence during the year and four months that expired between the date their original attorneys were permitted to withdraw \u2014 -March 26, 2001 \u2014 and the date they finally filed the motion to amend \u2014 August 13, 2002. That they were without an attorney during this time cannot pardon the delay where, as discussed <em>supra, </em>they failed to show excusable neglect for the length of time it took them to secure counsel. We therefore cannot see that the district court abused its discretion in denying permission to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
