On appeal, Phan contends that: 1) insufficient evidence supports his conviction; 2) the trial court erred in denying his request for a four-level \u201cminimal role\u201d adjustment in sentencing; and 3) the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him according to the full value of the counterfeit checks that he and his co-defendants attempted to sell. We have jurisdiction over Phan\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">After a trial in the Central District of California, Phan was convicted of possession of counterfeit securities and sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>to 21 months imprisonment and two years of supervised release. We do not repeat additional factual or procedural background of the case except as necessary, as that background is known to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">1. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">This Court reviews claims of insufficient evidence de novo. <em>United States v. Odom, </em>329 F.3d 1032, 1034 (9th Cir.2003). There is sufficient evidence to support a conviction if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we find that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Here, the jury may have found Phan guilty of possession of counterfeit securities based on either direct liability or on the theory that he aided and abetted his co-defendants. To establish direct liability, the government had to prove both that Phan possessed counterfeit securities and that he had the intent to deceive. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a). Possession may be actual or constructive. <em>Rodella v. United States, </em>286 F.2d 306, 311-12 (9th Cir.1960). We have previously held that a driver\u2019s conduct in support of a passenger\u2019s efforts to dispose of contraband could establish that he jointly possessed the contraband. <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>918 F.2d 1455, 1458 (9th Cir.1990). Based on <em>Chambers, </em>Phan\u2019s conduct as the driver of a vehicle participating in a delivery of counterfeit checks could establish his constructive joint possession of the checks. Knowing that \u201csomething illegal was going on\u201d and that his passenger had the counterfeit checks with him, Phan drove to the \u201cmeet\u201d location where the checks were to be delivered to waiting undercover government agents, observed the initial delivery of two counterfeit checks, drove away but remained nearby while those initial securities were inspected, returned to the meet location, personally handed over the remaining eighteen checks, and drove to another location in the parking lot pending completion of the transaction. These actions are sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude that Phan, as the driver, exercised joint \u201cdominion and control\u201d over the checks and thereby had constructive possession of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">A jury could also have found that Phan exhibited an \u201cintent to deceive,\u201d the second requirement for direct liability under the statute. Such an intent can be be inferred from the defendant\u2019s actions. <em>United States v. Lorenzo, </em>570 F.2d 294, 299 (9th Cir.1978). A jury may ordinarily base intent on the assumption that a person intends the \u201cnatural and probable consequences of acts knowingly done or knowingly omitted.\u201d <em>United States v. Lord, </em>711 F.2d 887, 892 (9th Cir.1983). Here, a jury could have concluded that Phan\u2019s actions, coupled with his acknowledgment that he \u201cknew something illegal was going on\u201d when he viewed the counterfeit checks, demonstrated his intent to deceive. Even if his actions are also consistent with those of someone who accompanied his friends on an excursion for purely social reasons, the question before this Panel is \u201cnot whether the evidence excludes every hypothesis except guilt, but whether the trier of fact could reasonably arrive at its conclusion,\u201d drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the government. <em>United States v. Fleishman, </em>684 F.2d 1329, 1340 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Alternatively, the jury could have found that Phan knowingly possessed counterfeit securities under an aiding and abetting theory. Under this theory, the government need not have proven that Phan ever possessed the checks himself, so long as it showed that <em>someone </em>possessed a counterfeit security and that Phan knowingly and intentionally aided that person to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>commit a crime. <em>United States v. Cruz-Ventura, </em>979 F.2d 146, 149 (9th Cir.1992). It is undisputed that Phan\u2019s two companions possessed the counterfeit checks. The jury could have found from Phan\u2019s actions that he intentionally aided his companions in committing the substantive offense. Therefore, under either a direct liability or an aiding and abetting theory, we find the evidence sufficient to support Phan\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">2. Minimal/Minor Role Adjustment</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">We also conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing Phan\u2019s request to grant a four-level sentencing reduction based on the defendant\u2019s \u201cminimal role\u201d in the crime. A district court\u2019s finding that a defendant is not entitled to a minor or minimal role adjustment is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>282 F.3d 758, 772 (9th Cir.2002). The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines provide that the determination of whether a participant\u2019s role entitles him to a two-, three-, or four-level reduction is \u201cheavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(C) (2002). Here, the trial court\u2019s decision to subtract only two levels based on its finding that Phan played a \u201cminor role\u201d in the crime, rather than to grant a four-level reduction, was not clearly erroneous. Phan assisted in transporting the counterfeit checks to the meet location and in delivering them to the undercover government agents. The court could reasonably have concluded that Phan was less culpable than one of his co-defendants but not so significantly less culpable that he was entitled to a four-level reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">3. Sentencing Based on Value of Loss</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Finally, we reject Phan\u2019s claim that the District Court erred in increasing his sentencing level based on the full $400,000 face value of the counterfeit checks in question. A district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts of a particular ease is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>287 F.3d 811, 818 (9th Cir.2002). Here, the jury expressly convicted Phan of possessing twenty counterfeit checks, each in the amount of $20,000. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Phan based on the full value of the counterfeit securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b133-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
