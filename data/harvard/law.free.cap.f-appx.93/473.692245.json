The Notice of Determination sent to each of the taxpayers and advising of them of this classification also indicated that the taxpayer was not entitled to relief under Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result, each of the corporate taxpayers was assessed employment taxes for its respective employee under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (\u201cFICA\u201d), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3101-3128, and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (\u201cFUTA\u201d), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3311.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Taxpayer Joseph M. Grey Public Accountant, P.C. (\u201cJMG\u201d) received a Notice of Determination in February 2000 advising that the IRS had classified Mr. Grey as JMG\u2019s employee. JMG, a sub-chapter S corporation, operated as a public accounting, bookkeeping and tax return preparation business. Mr. Grey was JMG\u2019s president and sole shareholder. During the tax years at issue, Mr. Grey solicited the corporation\u2019s business, transacted its affairs, handled the financial aspects of the operation and \u201cperformed all accounting, bookkeeping and tax preparation services.\u201d JMG did not make any regular payments to Mr. Grey for the services he rendered during the tax years at issue. Instead, Mr. Grey received money from JMG\u2019s bank account as his needs arose. Those payments were reported on Mr. Grey\u2019s federal return as non-passive income.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-18\">Taxpayer Mike J. Graham Trucking, Inc. (\u201cMJG\u201d) also received a Notice of Determination issued in February 2000. The classification pertained to Mr. Graham, MJG\u2019s majority shareholder and president. MJG was also a subchapter S corporation, operating as a trucking company. Mr. Graham solicited business for the company, handled its business transactions, managed its finances and performed the driving services rendered by the company. MJG did not provide Mr. Graham with a salary or wages during the tax years in dispute. Rather, Mr. Graham distributed money to himself from MJG\u2019s bank account as his needs arose, or he paid certain personal expenses which he or his family incurred from the business account. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Mr. Graham reported the payments as non-passive income on the K-l Schedule of his federal return.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Water Pure Systems, Inc. received a Notice of Determination dated June 8, 2001, classifying Martin Ridge as Water Pure\u2019s employee for federal employment tax purposes. Water Pure, a subchapter S corporation, \u201cprovided sales and service of water filtration and purification systems.\u201d Mr. and Mrs. Ridge each owned 50% of Water Pure\u2019s shares and Mr. Ridge was Water Pure\u2019s president and sole officer. Mr. Ridge was the only person performing any services for Water Pure. Water Pure did not distribute any dividends to any shareholder during the tax years at issue. Nor did Mr. Ridge receive regular payments from Water Pure. Instead, he received money from the corporation as his needs arose and those payments were reported as non-passive income on his Schedule K-l of his federal tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Taxpayers JMG, Water Pure and MJG challenged both the worker classifications and the determination that they were not entitled to relief under Section 530. The Tax Court concluded that the classifications were appropriate and that relief was not available under Section 530\u2019s safe harbor provision. These appeals followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Each of the taxpayers contend that the Tax Court erred because the taxpayer neither controlled nor employed the worker who was classified as an employee. Rather, they contend that the remuneration each worker received was attributable to his status as an officer and shareholder of his respective corporation. They urge this Court to disregard the statutory definitions of \u201cemployee\u201d in the Internal Revenue Code and in the Treasury regulations, and to apply the usual common law <em>rules </em>for determining whether an individual is an employee. Alternatively, the taxpayers argue that they had a reasonable basis for not treating each worker as an employee and are entitled to relief from the assessment of the PICA and FUTA taxes under Section 530.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">We have recently addressed and rejected in <em>Nu-Look Design, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>356 F.3d 290 (3d Cir.2004), a similar challenge to the Tax Court\u2019s determination that the IRS\u2019s classification of a corporate officer and shareholder as an employee was appropriate and that the taxpayer was liable under the FICA and the FUTA. After careful review of each record, we are unable to distinguish any of these appeals from <em>Nvr-Look Design. </em>Accordingly, <em>Nu-Look Design </em>controls and we will affirm the decisions of the Tax Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AWD\">. <em>See </em>Revenue Act of 1978, Pub.
