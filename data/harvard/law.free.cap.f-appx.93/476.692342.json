Scott contends that the District Court, in accepting his guilty plea, failed to comply with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1), which requires a court to \u201caddress the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands ... the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, Scott alleges that the failure of the District Court to explicitly list the technical elements of the offenses of which he was accused resulted in a plea which was not \u201ctruly voluntary,\u201d since it cannot be shown that he \u201cpossessed] an understanding of the law in relation to the facts.\u201d <em>See McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969). Accordingly, Scott asks that the judgment be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-23\">Scott acknowledges that, because no objection was made in the District Court, we review for \u201cplain error\u201d only. <em>See United States v. Knobloch, </em>131 F.3d 366, 370 (3d Cir.1997). We act to correct such errors only when they implicate \u201csubstantial rights\u201d and \u201cseriously affect[ ] the fairness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id., quoting Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). \u201cThe burden is on the defendant to show that the error in fact prejudiced him....\u201d <em>Knobloch, </em>131 F.3d at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We do not believe that any of Scott\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights\u201d were compromised here. Scott acknowledged that he had reviewed with his attorney the criminal indictment which described the elements of the offenses charged, and waived the reading of the indictment in open court. App. 52A. The prosecutor nevertheless described in detail the factual bases for the charges against Scott. App. 61A-62A. The District Court then asked Scott, \u201c[I]s that what happened here?\u201d App. 62A. Scott replied, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court made an explicit finding that Scott was acting voluntarily, and that he understood that \u201cthe plea has a basis in fact and contains all of the elements of the crimes charged.\u201d App. 66A.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Scott points to <em>United States v. Quinones, 97 </em>F.3d 473 (11th Cir.1996), in which it was found that the failure to inform a defendant of the nature of the charge against him violated the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 475. However, as the Eleventh Circuit has later emphasized, neither <em>Quinones </em>nor Rule 11(c) specifies that a district court is required to list each element of the offenses charged seriatim. <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>131 F.3d 1440, 1442-43 (11th Cir.1997). As was the case with the defendant in <em>Wiggins, </em>we believe that Scott was adequately informed of and understood the nature of the charges against him, even though the District Court did not explicitly list the offenses\u2019 elements in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In fact, Scott does not contend on appeal that he did not understand the elements of these crimes at the time that he entered his plea. Nor does he claim that he would have pleaded differently if those elements had been explicitly set forth at his plea hearing. Because Scott has failed to show that his substantial rights were prejudiced by the alleged \u201cerror\u201d of the District Court, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
