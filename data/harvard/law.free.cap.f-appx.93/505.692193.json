Because the parties agree, in light of recent events, that this case and appeal are moot, we dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>appeal, vacate the district court order, and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case. <em>See Arizonans for Official English v.
