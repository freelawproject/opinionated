We assume familiarity with the facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-22\">Section 3664(k) provides that if a defendant experiences \u201ca material change in [his] economic circumstances,\u201d the district court may \u201cadjust the payment schedule\u201d of a restitution order \u201cas the interests of justice require.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>United States v. Grant, </em>235 F.3d 95, 99-100 (2d Cir.2000). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s rulings as to what constitutes a material change in a defendant\u2019s economic circumstances, but we review for abuse of discretion its judgment as to whether a change merits modification of a payment schedule. <em>See United States v. Grant, </em>235 F.3d at 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Before the district court, Kalani noted in a footnote to his modification motion that adverse market conditions had reduced the value of his gross assets from $182,100 at sentencing to $67,000. While this represents a change in economic circumstances, Kalani does not argue on appeal that the district court failed to recognize this fact or abused its discretion in declining to modify his restitution schedule on this ground. Accordingly, such arguments are waived. <em>See United States v. Greer, </em>285 F.3d 158, 170 (2d Cir.2002). In any event, Kalani could not show any abuse of discretion in this regard. The reduced value of his gross assets from $182,100 to $67,000 was only partially due to a decline in the financial markets. After sentencing, Kalani had apparently spent all of his more liquid assets: $59,800 held in savings and checking accounts at the time of sentencing. As the district court explained, it had ordered Kalani to make an up-front, lump-sum payment of $60,000 on the total restitution order of $161,785 \u201cspecifically ... to avoid the potential dissipation of assets.\u201d Confronted with evidence that Kalani had engaged in precisely the dissipation feared, the district court acted well within its discretion in refusing to absolve Kalani of his obligation to make the lump-sum payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">To the extent Kalani argues that the district court erred both at his original sentencing and in its consideration of his modification motion in assuming that his ERISA-based assets were available for restitution, the argument does not present a basis for \u00a7 3664(k) relief. That statute permits modification only for a \u201cmaterial change in economic circumstances.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k); <em>see United States v. Grant, </em>235 F.3d at 100. It does not authorize modification based on a challenge to the legality of the restitution order. <em>See United States v. Lussier, </em>104 F.3d 32, 34 (2d Cir.1997) (holding that illegality of restitution order is not a proper ground to modify the terms of supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2)). Such a challenge should have been raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment denying modification is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
