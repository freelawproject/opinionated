On appeal, he alleges the district court erred in denying his Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion for acquittal. He also claims the district court improperly applied the cross-reference provision in the <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines, </em>\u00a7 2B1.1(c)(3) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">Where, as here, a motion for acquittal was based on insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">Bryant argues that when he told Ricky Carraway that if anyone asked about the gun purchases to say that he did not know anything, he was merely instructing Carraway to tell the truth. Bryant further argues that he did not make a false statement to a federal agent because he did not know William Boyd by his proper name or by the name \u201cCheeseburger.\u201d We must assume that the jury resolved these issues in the Government\u2019s favor. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>115 F.3d 1185, 1190 (4th Cir.1997). We find that there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Glasser, </em>315 U.S. at 80, 62 S.Ct. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">Bryant next argues that the application of the USSG \u00a7 2B1.1(c)(3) cross-reference was in error. We review de novo a district court\u2019s legal interpretation of a guideline. <em>United States v. Souther, </em>221 F.3d 626, 628 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">Bryant was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by making a false statement to a federal agent \u201cin connection with the investigation of various firearms offenses, including straw purchases and interstate transportation of firearms.\u201d (J.A., Vol. I at 18). For such a violation, USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 provides the applicable guideline offense level. <em>See </em>USSG App. A; USSG \u00a7 2B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-16\">In pertinent part, USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(3) provides that if \u201cthe defendant was convicted under a statute proscribing false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or rep-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>reservations generally <em>(e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 ...); and [ ] the conduct set forth in the count of conviction establishes an offense specifically covered by another guideline in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct), apply that other guideline.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(3). The introduction of the indictment, Count One, and Count Two all reference Bryant\u2019s involvement with firearm offenses. Therefore, the probation officer applied the guidelines for firearm violations under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1. Since Bryant\u2019s conduct, as set forth in the count of conviction, established a firearm offense specifically covered in USSG \u00a7 2K2.1, the district court correctly adopted the probation officer\u2019s application of the cross-reference. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Finding no error, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
