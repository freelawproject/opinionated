Because we find that the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, the decision will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">Gao is a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Administrative Record (\u201cA.R.\u201d) 316. He arrived in the United States on May 10, 1997 and presented a fraudulent Chinese passport to Immigration and Nationalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> inspectors. A.R. 160. When the inspectors discovered that the passport was a fake, Gao confessed his true identity, but continued to he about his age. Gao was subsequently placed into removal proceedings. A.R. 389-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-18\">On August 5, 1998, Gao submitted an application for asylum and withholding of removal.\u201d A.R. 320-27. As part of the application, Gao also submitted an affidavit stating the facts of his claim. A.R. 316-19. Gao asserted that he was born on April 17, 1979 in Changle County, Fujian Province, People\u2019s Republic of China. He is the eldest of three children. A.R. 316. After the birth of his first brother in 1981, population control officials ordered Gao\u2019s mother to use an Intrauterine Device as a method of birth control. Instead of complying with the government\u2019s order, his parents decided to move away from Changle County to avoid population control officials. A.R. 316-17. Later that year, pop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ulation control officials came to Gao\u2019s grandparents\u2019 house in search of his parents. When his grandparents indicated that they did know where Gao\u2019s parents were, the officials \u201cdemolished [their] house, and confiscated [their] furniture and other valuables.\u201d A.R 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The affidavit further stated that Gao\u2019s second brother was born in 1983. The family moved several times during the next 13 years in order to avoid detection by population control officials so that Gao could attend school. A.R. 317. In 1996, however, his parents decided to move back to Changle County. <em>Id. </em>Shortly thereafter, local population control officials came to the family\u2019s home and took Gao\u2019s mother to Changle County Hospital for sterilization. A.R. 318. After learning of what happened to his mother, Gao went to the local population control office and protested China\u2019s policy on population control. He asked the officials \u201cwhy they did this to [his] mother\u201d and stated that the \u201cbirth control policy was inhuman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reaction to his protest, the officials \u201cbecame very irritated,\u201d and Gao was detained \u201cin a very small room in the village government building.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He was released one week later when his parents agreed to pay of fine of 10,000 Yuan. The fine was imposed for his opposition to China\u2019s population control policy as well as his parents\u2019 violation of said policy. <em>Id. </em>Gao also stated that before he was released, population control officials indicated that he \u201cwould be put in jail again if they found out that [he] was still resistant to the enforcement of the birth control policy.\u201d A.R. 319. As a result of this experience, and with the help of family and friends, Gao fled to the United States. Finally, Gao stated that he feared returning to China because he believed he would be subjected to further persecution based on his opposition to the country\u2019s population control policy. A.R. 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">During his hearing before the Immigration Court, Gao reasserted his application for asylum and withholding of removal and also sought relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). A.R. 69. Although Gao testified that everything he stated in his earlier affidavit was true (A.R.82), he added several additional facts during his testimony. First, he testified that when population control officials came to take his mother to the hospital for sterilization, he \u201crushed to them, and ... was pushed onto the ground.\u201d A.R. 97. Later, he testified that he initiated an altercation with population control official when he went to their office to protest his mother\u2019s serialization. A.R. 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The IJ found that Gao\u2019s claim failed for lack of credibility. A.R. 29. Specifically, he noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">(1) Gao presented a false passport to INS inspectors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6K\">(2) Gao continued to he about his age, even after INS inspectors determined that his passport was fraudulent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">(3) Gao did not mention that he was jailed for his views on China\u2019s population control policy prior to his testimony before the Immigration Court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">(4) Gao did not mention that he initiated an altercation with population control officials prior to his testimony before the Immigration Court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">(5) Gao\u2019s testimony regarding his encounters with population control officials was inconsistent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-12\">(6) there was no evidence that Gao had any interest in China\u2019s population control policy either before or after his mother\u2019s sterilization; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">(7) there was no evidence that population control officials had any adverse interest in Gao during the nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>months he lived in China following his arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">A.R. 30-32. Therefore, the IJ denied Gao\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. A.R. 34. However, Gao was permitted to depart the country voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">On January 28, 2003, the BIA issued a <em>per curium, </em>order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion pursuant 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), thereby making the IJ\u2019s decision the final agency determination. A.R. 2. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The Attorney General has the discretion to grant asylum to an alien who qualifies as a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b). The Immigration and Nationalization Act defines a \u201crefugee\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). In order to meet this standard, an alien must \u201cshow that he has a subjective fear of persecution that is supported by objective evidence that persecution is a reasonable possibility.\u201d <em>Chang v. INS, 119 F.3d 1055, 1166 </em>(3d Cir.1997). However, an alien does not have to show clear probability of persecution. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 431, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987), \u201c[o]ne can certainly have a well-founded fear of an event happening when there is less than a 50% chance of the occurrence taking place.\u201d If an alien establishes that he or she suffered past persecution, a rebuttable presumption arises that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution in the future. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">In order to withstand appellate review, the agency decision must be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Balasubramanr</em>im <em>v. INS, </em>143 F.3d 157, 161 (3d Cir.1998). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion....\u201d <em>N.L.R.B. v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, \u201cthe administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">With these standards in mind, we now consider the IJ\u2019s decision, which became the final agency determination. As an initial matter, we must note that the IJ makes several misstatements of fact in his decision. First, he stated that \u201c[i]t was not until [Gao] testified in the Immigration Court in the year 2000 and 2001, several years after he arrived in the United States, that he alleged that he had been jailed in China because of [his] opposition to the birth control policy.\u201d A.R. 31. This is simply not true. In his 1998 asylum application, Gao indicated that he was has detained and fined because of his \u201cresistance to the birth control policy....\u201d A.R. 318. He also stated that population control officials threatened to arrest him again if they found out that he \u201cwas still resistant to the enforcement of the birth control policy.\u201d A.R. 319. Thus, the record clearly reflects that Gao claimed that he was arrested for his opinion on China\u2019s population control policy prior to his testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>mony before the Immigration Court. Second, the IJ found that Gao\u2019s testimony regarding his altercations with birth control officials were inconsistent. Specifically, the IJ stated: \u201c[a]t one point [Gao] testified that he assaulted the birth control official when [the official] came to the family home to take his mother for sterilization. Later in his testimony, however, [Gao] claimed that he assaulted the birth control official at the office of the birth control cadre.\u201d A.R. 31. Again, this is a misstatement of the record. At one point during the hearing, Gao testified that when the population control officials came to take his mother for sterilization he \u201crushed to them, and ... was pushed onto the ground.\u201d A.R. 97. Later, he claimed that he <em>also </em>initiated a physical alteration with population control officials at their office. A.R. 131 (\u201cI pushed them down. That was [what] happened in the office of the family... .\u201d). Thus, it is clear that Gao was referring to two separate altercations, and that his testimony was not inconsistent in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">However, despite these misstatements of fact, we must still determine whether the additional bases for the IJ\u2019s decision are sufficient to meet the substantial evidence standard. To begin, Gao admitted presenting a false passport to INS inspectors when he arrived in the United States. Even after the inspectors determined that the passport was fraudulent, he continued to lie about his age. Moreover, Gao did not mention either of his alleged altercations with population control officials in his asylum application, instead waiting until he testified before the Immigration Court. When the IJ questioned him about the lack of detail in his asylum application, Gao testified: \u201cIf I had to go through every step-every motion like that, then I should go to make a movie to present to the Court.\u201d A.R. 133. Later, he testified that he simply \u201cforgot\u201d to include these incidents in his asylum application. <em>Id. </em>Finally, Gao presented no evidence that he had any interest in China\u2019s population control policies either before or after his mother\u2019s sterilization. In fact, Gao remained in China for nine months after his arrest and had no further encounters with population control officials. Given these facts, which are essentially undisputed, we find that there is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s finding that Gao was not credible with respect to his claim that he was persecuted for his opposition to China\u2019s birth control policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Based on the foregoing analysis, we will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\">.

Because Gao does not meet the standard for asylum relief, there is no need to consider his applications for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT, both of which require a higher likelihood of persecution. <em>Chang, 119 </em>F.3d at 1059; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16(c)(2) and (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
