Telesca, Judge), after a bench trial, finding him guilty of possession with intent to distribute a substance containing marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-19\">Defendant argues on appeal that there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable fact finder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he violated 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D). Specifically, he argues that the District Court wrongly concluded that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the requisite \u201cintent to distribute\u201d the marijuana in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-20\">Defendant relies primarily on our decision in <em>United States v. Boissoneault, </em>926 F.2d 230 (2d Cir.1991), in which we held that there was insufficient evidence to establish \u201cintent to distribute\u201d where the evidence of \u201cintent to distribute\u201d consisted of a small quantity of narcotics and a significant amount of cash in the defendant\u2019s possession. <em>See id. </em>at 234. However, we have previously held that \u201cth[e <em>Boissoneault </em>] case is not authority for the proposition that evidence will be insufficient whenever the amount of drugs seized is consistent with personal use.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>943 F.2d 215, 219 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-21\">In this case, the District Court\u2019s determination relied on more than just the defendant\u2019s possession of marijuana and a sizeable sum of money. Most significantly, unlike in <em>Boissoneault, </em>the District Court had the benefit of the defendant\u2019s own testimony at trial, and the record reveals that the Court relied heavily on defendant\u2019s testimony to evaluate his credibility and weigh the evidence. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>No. 02-CR-6017T(B), at 19-21 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2003); <em>see also Rodriguez, </em>943 F.2d at 219 (concluding that there was sufficient evidence for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>rational fact finder to conclude the defendant had \u201cintent to distribute\u201d where evidence of possession was corroborated by defendant\u2019s lack of credibility in testifying at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Accordingly, for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court in its January 23, 2003 Order and Verdict, <em>see Thomas, </em>No. 02-CR-6017T(B), at 19-21 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2003), we hold that there was sufficient evidence to support the District Court\u2019s conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed marijuana with \u201cintent to distribute,\u201d in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
