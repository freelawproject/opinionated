Dice, proceeding through counsel, appeals a magistrate judge\u2019s judgment dismissing his diversity declaratory judgment action. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. The parties have waived oral argument and this panel unanimously agrees that oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">On January 4, 2002, Dice filed a complaint against General Electric Capital Assurance Company (GECA) in the Montgomery County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas. Dice alleged that his wife, Brenda J. Dice, died on February 12, 2000. At the time of her death, Brenda\u2019s life was insured pursuant to a life insurance policy issued by GECA and Dice was the beneficiary of the life insurance benefits. Following Brenda\u2019s death, Dice submitted a claim for life insurance benefits, which was denied by GECA. As a result of GECA\u2019s denial of benefits, Dice filed the instant action seeking a judgment declaring his entitlement to the life insurance benefits from the GECA policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">GECA removed the action to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 on the bases of diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy found in \u00a7 1332. Both parties consented to have a magistrate judge exercise jurisdiction over the action in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). Thereafter, both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The magistrate judge granted GECA\u2019s motion, denied Dice\u2019s motion, and-dismissed the case. Dice has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">We review the magistrate judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Lanier v. Bryant, </em>332 F.3d 999, 1003 (6th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence presented shows \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">When federal jurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship, as here, we must apply the law of the forum state. <em>Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <em>Stalbosky v. Belew, </em>205 F.3d 890, 893 (6th Cir.2000). Under Ohio law, \u201c[w]hen the language of an insurance policy has a plain and ordinary meaning, it is unnecessary and impermissible ... to resort to construction of that language.\u201d <em>Karabin v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>10 Ohio St.3d 163, 462 N.E.2d 403, 406 (Ohio 1984); <em>see also Weiss v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>283 F.3d 790, 796 (6th Cir.2002); <em>Park-Ohio Indus., Inc. v. Home Indem. Co., </em>975 F.2d 1215, 1218 (6th Cir.1992). However, \u201cwhere provisions of a contract of insurance are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, they will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, 1383 (1988); <em>see also Munchick v. Fid. &amp; Cas. Co., </em>2 Ohio St.2d 303, 209 N.E.2d 167, 169-70 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Upon review, we conclude that the magistrate judge properly granted summary judgment in favor of GECA. The life insurance policy at issue in this case contains an exclusion, which states that coverage is not provided \u201cfor any loss caused by or resulting from ... (3) alcohol intoxication or being under the influence of any narcotic, drug or sedative, unless administered on the advice of a physician.\u201d In this case, the coroner determined that Brenda\u2019s death was caused by \u201c[ajcute multiple drug intoxication\u201d and that \u201coxycodone, cocaine, alprazolam, and diazepam\u201d were the contributing drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">At the time of her death, Brenda\u2019s treating physician had prescribed Oxycontin for pain. The record indicates that Brenda was prescribed Oxycontin in forty milligram tablets and instructed to consume forty to eighty milligrams every eight hours. Pursuant to her physician\u2019s instructions, the maximum dose of Oxycontin that Brenda should have ingested within a twenty-four-hour period would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201c6, 40 mg. tablets\u201d or 240 milligrams. According the policy language its plain and ordinary meaning, Brenda was required to give herself the prescribed medication pursuant to the recommendation of her physician. However, the post-mortem toxicology laboratory report indicated that Brenda had the equivalent of 300 milligrams of Oxyeontin in her blood, which is more than the prescribed dosage. Thus, Brenda ingested more Oxyeontin than her physician had prescribed or advised that she ingest and such ingestion, either alone or in combination with some of the other drugs found in her blood, caused her death. Under these circumstances, Oxyeontin was not administered on the advice of Brenda\u2019s physician. Because Brenda\u2019s death resulted from her being under the influence of at least one drug that was not administered on the advice of a physician, the policy exclusion is applicable and Dice is not entitled to the life insurance benefits under the GECA policy. Dice\u2019s arguments on appeal do not compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the magistrate judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
