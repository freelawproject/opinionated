Ceballos was also convicted of conspiracy to launder drug proceeds, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h), (a)(l)(A)(i). Martinez-Guzman and Ceballos appealed, and the government cross-appealed, arguing that the district court erred by refusing to increase each defendant\u2019s offense level by two for using a minor in the commission of the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4. We agreed with the government and remanded for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Ceballos, </em>302 F.3d 679, 696-98 (7th Cir.2002). As relevant here, the district court resentenced Martinez-Guzman to 324 months\u2019 imprisonment (originally 268 months) and Ceballos to life imprisonment on the drug conspiracy count (originally 360 months). Martinez-Guzman and Ceballos appeal from the amended judgments, but their appointed counsel move to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), because they believe the appeals are frivolous. Counsels\u2019 jointly filed brief is facially adequate, and so we limit our review to the potential issues identified in the brief and in the response Ceballos filed under Circuit Rule 51(b). <em>See United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">During the conspiracy Martinez-Guzman and Ceballos employed Jorge Hernandez-Martinez, then under 18, as a drug courier and translator to quote prices to undercover DEA agents. Section 3B1.4 applies \u201cif the defendant used\u201d a person under eighteen \u201cto commit the offense <em>or </em>assist in avoiding\u201d apprehension or detection for the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4 (emphasis added). Although the district court originally found that Martinez-Guzman and Ceballos had \u201cused\u201d Hernandez-Martinez, it nonetheless reasoned that the \u00a7 3B1.4 adjustment was improper because Martinez-Guzman and Ceballos had not also relied on Hernandez-Martinez\u2019s status as a minor to shield them from prosecution. We rejected any notion of such an additional requirement, and instructed the district court to apply the \u00a7 3B1.4 adjustment, noting that Martinez-Guzman and Ceballos did not and could not argue that \u201cHernandez-Martinez\u2019s involvement did not constitute \u2018use\u2019 under \u00a7 3B1.4.\u201d <em>Ceballos, </em>302 F.3d at 697-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">At resentencing neither Martinez-Guzman nor Ceballos disputed Hernandez-Martinez\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy. Based on our opinion in the original appeal, the district court found the adjustment warranted as to both defendants: Martinez-Guzman had twice used Hernandez-Martinez as a translator during controlled drug buys and Ceballos had used Hernandez-Martinez as both a translator and courier. Given our opinion in <em>Ceballos, </em>we agree with counsel that it would be frivolous for Martinez-Guzman and Ceballos to argue that they did not \u201cuse\u201d Hernandez-Martinez as contemplated by \u00a7 3B1.4. <em>See Ceballos, </em>302 F.3d at 697-98; <em>see also United States v. Hodges, </em>315 F.3d 794, 802 (7th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>248 F.3d 677, 682 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">In his Rule 51(b) response Ceballos contends that our court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3B1.4 in his earlier appeal conflicts with the decisions of other circuits and thus should be reconsidered en banc. We are not aware of any such conflicts, nor does Ceballos identify any. This argument is therefore frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>Finally, Caballos asserts in a single sentence that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at resentencing, but to the extent that he proposes this as an appellate argument, it is better saved for collateral attack where the claim can be explained and the record fully developed. <em>See generally Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>see also United States v. Kelly, </em>337 F.3d 897, 903 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Accordingly, we GRANT counsels\u2019 motions to withdraw and DISMISS the appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
