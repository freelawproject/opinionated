The court concluded, as did the administrative law judge in the agency proceedings, that appellant\u2019s claims had no merit. <em>See Beams v. Norton, </em>256 F.Supp.2d 1203, 1215-1218 (D.Kan.2003). The court also denied appellant\u2019s motion to include additional claims which were decided by the agency during the pendency of his case in federal court. <em>Id. </em>at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal by virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards as did that court to determine whether genuine issues of material fact exist and, if not, whether the nonmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Simms v. Okla. ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Mental Health &amp; Substance Abuse Seros., </em>165 F.3d 1321, 1326 (10th Cir.1999). In the context of appellant\u2019s substantive claims, that means we consider his arguments in light of the familiar burden-shifting analysis based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Beams, </em>256 F.Supp.2d at 1213, 1214 (setting out the general elements of prima facie cases alleging discriminatory failure to hire and retaliation) (citing <em>Garcia v. Pueblo Country Club, </em>299 F.3d 1233, 1238 (10th Cir.2002) and <em>Pastran v. K-Mart Corp., </em>210 F.3d 1201, 1205 (10th Cir.2000)). In our consideration of appellant\u2019s claims, we construe his pro se pleadings, including his appellate filings, liberally. <em>See Cummings v. Evans, </em>161 F.3d 610, 613 (10th Cir.1998). We will not, however, supply additional factual allegations to support appellant\u2019s complaint or construct legal theories on his behalf. <em>Whitney v. New Mexico, </em>113 F.3d 1170, 1173-74 (10th Cir.1997). Unsupported conclusory allegations do not create an issue of fact. <em>See Matthiesen v. Banc One Mortgage Corp., </em>173 F.3d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">After careful review of the record on appeal and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court correctly decided this case. Further, appellant\u2019s arguments on appeal do not challenge the basis of the district court\u2019s rulings, namely that he had not demonstrated either the existence of a prima facie case or, where such case existed, had not presented evidence that the agency\u2019s articulated legitimate reasons for not hiring him were a pretext for discrimination or retaliation. To the extent that appellant\u2019s appellate arguments attempt to raise new claims based on the Indian Preference statute, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 472, we decline to address them. Appellant\u2019s comments on Indian preference rules to the district court were made in the context of his discrimination claims and did not refer to the statute itself. Even under the liberal construction afforded pro se pleadings, these sparse references did not apprise that court of a separate claim based on the statute. We do not, as a general rule, address matters that were not presented to the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>court. <em>See Walker v. Mather (In re Walker), </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Appellant also challenges as error the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to amend the pretrial order with additional claims of employment discrimination. We review this decision for abuse of discretion only. <em>Davey v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>301 F.3d 1204, 1208 (10th Cir.2002). We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the addition of new claims would prejudice defendant in this case, and appellant does not argue otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-29\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-5\">. After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
