Thomas, proceeding pro se, appeals a district court order dismissing her civil action filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">On October 23, 2002, Thomas filed a complaint against Glaxo Wellcome, Incorporated, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Thomas alleged that Glaxo \u201chas a product (Imitrex Stat-Dose Pen) that is defective, and dangerous, in that it has caused a permanent injury to me.\u201d Thomas alleged that the FDA \u201cviolated [her] right of freedom of information, by not providing information pertaining to the said product in its status after numerous consumer complaints were reported concerning malfunction of the pen.... \u201d Thomas alleged that when she requested information concerning the number of complaints and adverse reactions to \u201cthe pen,\u201d the FDA incorrectly reported only one when \u201cthere were 1627 complaints reported in 1997, 2111 in 1998, 1397 in 1999, 872 in 2000.\u201d Thomas sought monetary relief only.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The district court dismissed Thomas\u2019s complaint pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). Thomas now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">We review de novo a district court order dismissing a suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under \u00a7 1915(e). <em>Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 867 (6th Cir.2000). \u201cDismissal of a complaint for the failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted is appropriate only if it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Thomas\u2019s complaint. Although Thomas did not allege a basis for federal jurisdiction in her complaint, she filed her complaint on a standard form prepared for the use of prisoners filing civil rights actions under \u00a7 1983. In order to assert a \u00a7 1983 civil rights claim, a plaintiff must allege and prove that a person acting under color of state law deprived her of a right secured by the federal Constitution or laws of the United States. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; <em>Christy v. Randlett, </em>932 F.2d 502, 504 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Neither defendant in this case is a state actor. Although private actors acting in concert with state officials may be subject to \u00a7 1983 liability, <em>Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 27-28, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980), Thomas did not allege that either Glaxo or the FDA acted in concert with a state agent. Thus, neither Glaxo nor the FDA is subject to liability under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">To the extent that Thomas may have intended to pursue a <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), action against the FDA, she is not entitled to relief. A federal agency such as the FDA is not subject to liability under <em>Bivens. See F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 486, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">In any event, Thomas\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted against either defendant. First, Thomas\u2019s claim against Glaxo is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. <em>Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, </em>452 U.S. 394, 398, 101 S.Ct. 2424, 69 L.Ed.2d 103 (1981); <em>Kane v. Magna Mixer Co., </em>71 F.3d 555, 560 (6th Cir.1995). Second, Thomas\u2019s claims against the FDA under either the Freedom of Information Act or the Federal Torts Claim Act are unexhausted. <em>See McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993) (FTCA); <em>Fishburn v. Brown, </em>125 F.3d 979, 982 (6th Cir.1997) (FTCA); <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>Steele, </em>799 F.2d 461, 465-66 (9th Cir.1986) (FOIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
