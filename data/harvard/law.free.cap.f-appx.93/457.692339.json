The District Court had jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We exercise appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review \u201cis identical to that of the District Court, namely to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-18\">In determining whether a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner must follow the familiar five step sequential analysis set forth in the regulations promulgated by the Social Security Administration. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920. Olivares contends that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred at the third and fifth step of this analysis. With respect to step three, Olivares argues that the ALJ failed to adequately explain why Olivares\u2019s medical condition did not satisfy any of the impairments listed in Appendix 1 to the Social Security regulations, thereby establishing that he was disabled <em>per se. See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). Olivares also takes issue with the ALJ\u2019s determination at step five that Olivares had the residual functional capacity to perform the full range of sedentary work. This determination, according to Olivares, is not supported by substantial evidence, because the ALJ failed to properly consider the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>his medical expert, Dr. Mylod, an orthopedic surgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Olivares\u2019s argument with respect to step three of the sequential analysis is frivolous. Dr. Mylod, plaintiffs own medical expert, testified before the ALJ that Olivares\u2019s medical condition did not meet or equal the listing for either spinal disorders or several other musculoskeletal maladies. This aspect of Dr. Mylod\u2019s testimony was specifically cited by the ALJ. Accordingly, there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination at step three that Olivares did not have a listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">As to Olivares\u2019s contention that the ALJ failed to accord sufficient weight to the opinion of Dr. Mylod, we find it unpersuasive. Dr. Mylod, as the ALJ noted in his decision, testified at the June 1999 hearing regarding Olivares\u2019s residual functional capacity, explaining that Olivares had initially injured his back in the latter part of 1997. Diagnostic studies revealed a herniated lumbar disc and Olivares was treated on two occasions with an epidural injection containing a steroid. As a consequence of the steroid medication, Olivares developed a rare pulmonary fungal infection called aspergillosis. Although treatment during the first few months of 1998 with the medication Amphotericin B was successful, Olivares developed joint pains. Dr. Mylod acknowledged that Olivares\u2019s physicians \u201cwere puzzled as to why he had persistent joint pains\u201d once the course of Amphotericin was completed. Subsequent diagnostic testing did not reveal any specific medical condition causing the joint pain. Indeed, a bone scan conducted in July 1998 was unremarkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">After reviewing Olivares\u2019s medical status, Dr. Mylod opined that Olivares was limited to standing for \u201cmaybe two out of eight hours\u201d and no more than twenty to thirty minutes at a time. Walking was also limited, because of knee and hip pain, to one to one-and-a-half blocks. Sitting was restricted, in Dr. Mylod\u2019s opinion, to <em>no more </em>than four hours in an eight hour day and no more than thirty minutes at a time. A five pound weight limit was warranted for lifting and carrying.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">The ALJ accorded little weight to Dr. Mylod\u2019s restrictive assessment of Olivares\u2019s residual functional capacity. He noted that Dr. Mylod was frequently used by claimants in disability cases and was being paid to testify in that proceeding, thereby creating an inherent bias. Because Dr. Mylod had neither treated nor examined Olivares, the ALJ explained that the weight to be accorded Dr. Mylod\u2019s opinion was dependent on the amount of supporting evidence in the record. In the ALJ\u2019s view, the record did not support Dr. Mylod\u2019s opinion which was \u201cbased to a significant degree on the ongoing subjective complaints of joint pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">We find no error by the ALJ in discounting Dr. Mylod\u2019s opinion. It was based predominantly on Olivares\u2019s subjective complaints of persistent joint pain. The record fails to demonstrate that Olivares\u2019s pain limited him as severely as Dr. Mylod opined. As the ALJ noted, Dr. Lichtbroun, Olivares\u2019s treating physician, documented in August 1998 that despite joint pains, Olivares had full range of motion and was capable of compressing twenty pounds. Notably, the reports of several consultative physicians who examined Olivares in August, September and December of 1998 documented complaints of only back pain. In the absence of medical evidence to support Olivares\u2019s contention that he continued to suffer from debilitating joint pains in the latter part of 1998, it was not improper for the ALJ to discount Dr. Mylod\u2019s subsequent opinion that Olivares\u2019s physical capabilities were severely restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Olivares asserts that the ALJ rejected Dr. Mylod\u2019s opinion simply because Dr. Mylod was a paid medical expert. Yet that assertion simply ignores the medical evidence of record. Although the ALJ\u2019s observations that Dr. Mylod was frequently used by claimants and that he was being paid to testify in this proceeding may have been an inartful way of explaining one of the bases for discounting Dr. Mylod\u2019s opinion, they did provide an appropriate basis for classifying Dr. Mylod\u2019s opinion as that of a \u201cnon-examining source\u201d under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">In sum, we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision that Olivares was not disabled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-14\">. As support for his contention that the ALJ erred, Olivares submits that he subsequently applied for disability benefits and was found to be disabled. We made explicit in <em>Jones v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 125, 128 (3d Cir.1991), that evidence which was not before the ALJ \"cannot be used to argue the ALJ's decision was not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Accordingly, the fact that Olivares subsequently received disability benefits is of no consequence to our analysis of whether the ALJ erred in the case <em>sub judice. </em>See <em>also Matthews </em>v. <em>Apfel, </em>239 F.3d 589, 594-95 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
