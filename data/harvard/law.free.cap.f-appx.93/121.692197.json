Arlen Beam, Senior Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b145-23\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-24\">Rajwinder Kaur (\u201cKaur\u201d) petitions for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) that affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying her application for asylum and withholding of deportation. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(l). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-25\">The IJ determined that Kaur did not qualify for asylum or withholding of deportation because the IJ found that her testimony was not credible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ based this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>determination on observations of Kaur\u2019s demeanor while testifying and on the numerous incongruities and implausibilities in her testimony. We review adverse credibility determinations for substantial evidence. <em>Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cInconsistencies in the petitioner\u2019s statements must go to the heart of [her] asylum claim to justify an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe give special deference to a credibility determination that is based on demeanor.\u201d <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Here, the IJ gave \u201cspecific, cogent reasons] for its disbelief\u2019 relating to the nonverbal aspects of Kaur\u2019s testimony. <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). In a separate and detailed discussion of Kaur\u2019s demeanor, the IJ pointed out that when INS counsel cross-examined Kaur, especially about elections in India in the early 1990s, Kaur \u201cbecame extremely hesitant\u201d in her answers and \u201cbecame agitated and claimed to not be feeling well.\u201d By contrast, the IJ found Kaur\u2019s testimony on direct examination to be \u201cquick and direct\u201d and \u201cgiven with ease.\u201d While \u201cmost witnesses are uncomfortable and nervous when being cross-examined ... we defer to [the IJ\u2019s] ability to differentiate between the usual level of anxiety and Petitioner\u2019s behavior....\u201d <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d at 1151. Here, the record supports the IJ\u2019s negative assessment of Kaur\u2019s demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Among the many substantive irregularities in Kaur\u2019s testimony, the IJ pointed to conflicting testimony about which days and how often Kaur was beaten by the local police. The IJ also found it highly suspicious that Kaur, who claimed to be a member of the All-India Sikh Student Federation (\u201cAISSF\u201d) and who claimed to' give talks on behalf of the organization, knew so little about Indian politics. These discrepancies go directly to the heart of Kaur\u2019s claim \u2014 that she was arrested and beaten by local police authorities on account of her political affiliation with the AISSF.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Because substantial evidence in the record supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, no reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to reach a contrary conclusion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Accordingly, Kaur\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b145-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-30\">. Here, the BIA adopted the adverse credibility finding made by the IJ. \"When the BIA adopts an IJ\u2019s findings and reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s opinion as if it were the opinion of the BIA.\u201d <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b146-9\">PREGERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AYO\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">I would grant the petition to remand the case to the BIA for several reasons. First, I find that none of the inconsistencies raised by the IJ go to the heart of Kaur\u2019s asylum claim and none of them represent an attempt by Kaur to exaggerate her claim. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001) (finding that inconsistencies that do not \u201cgo to the heart of [an] asylum claim\u201d do not warrant adverse credibility finding); <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1166 (9th Cir.2000) (rejecting adverse credibility finding based on inconsistencies regarding which day beating occurred during period of imprisonment). Second, I believe that it is incorrect to conclude that knowledge of particular facts about the hierarchy and election politics of the AISSF is a prerequisite to asylum based on membership in that group. Speculation about what a petitioner should know can never replace substantial evidence. <em>Maini v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 1167, 1175 (9th Cir.2000). Finally, I believe the memorandum is too deferential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>to the IJ\u2019s finding on demeanor. An IJ\u2019s credibility determinations are not immunized from review simply because they concern a witness\u2019s demeanor. Paredes-<em>Urrestarazu v. U.S. INS, </em>36 F.3d 801, 817 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cSpecial deference [to an IJ\u2019s findings on demeanor] does not imply a complete absence of judicial scrutiny.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
