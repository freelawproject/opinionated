Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>922(g) makes it illegal for felons \u201cto ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm ... or to receive any firearm ... which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Prior to trial, Sinclair moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction because the government\u2019s proofs would be insufficient to satisfy the interstate nexus element of \u00a7 922(g). The court denied the motion. At trial, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Agent Steve Toth testified that Smith <em>&amp; </em>Wesson guns are manufactured in Massachusetts and, thus, that Sinclair\u2019s weapon would have had to cross state lines to get to Michigan where Sinclair was arrested. During cross-examination, Sinclair\u2019s attorney asked Toth if he knew how the gun had arrived in Michigan. The prosecutor objected on relevancy grounds. The court sustained the objection, ruling that the proposed line of questioning was \u201cnot relevant to the proofs to this trial.\u201d The jury returned a guilty verdict and Sinclair timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Sinclair\u2019s appeal lacks merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">On appeal, Sinclair contends that the district court committed reversible error when it precluded Sinclair from cross-examining a government witness concerning the interstate commerce nexus of the firearm at issue. He concedes that, under our cases, to convict a felon for possessing a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), the government need only prove that the firearm in question traveled at some time across state lines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Loney, </em>331 F.3d 516, 524 (6th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Napier, </em>233 F.3d 394, 401 (6th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Chesney, </em>86 F.3d 564, 568-70 (6th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>77 F.3d 887, 889 (6th Cir.1996). Sinclair nonetheless contends that the district court\u2019s refusal to allow questions \u201cabout how the firearm affected interstate commerce\u201d violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront his accuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">Under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, a trial court retains discretion to limit the scope of cross-examination based on concerns such as \u201charassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986); <em>see also Mason v. Mitchell, </em>320 F.3d 604, 633 (6th Cir.2003). We review the district court\u2019s determination of relevancy for abuse of that discretion. <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>969 F.2d 169, 174 (6th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">To establish the requisite nexus to interstate commerce under \u00a7 922(g), the government needed to prove no more than that Sinclair\u2019s gun had traveled across state lines, a point Sinclair concedes. Agent Toth testified that it had. The jurisdictional element of \u00a7 922(g) makes it illegal for a felon \u201cto ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, <em>or </em>possess in <em>or </em>affecting commerce, any firearm ... <em>or </em>to receive any firearm .... \u201d (emphasis added), giving the government other alternatives for establishing the requisite nexus. But here, the indictment charged Sinclair only with possession of a firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>\u201chaving previously traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d Because Sinclair did not challenge the evidence supporting that ground, the proposed line of cross-examination was clearly irrelevant. Moreover, given that the jurisdictional element was essentially conceded, any error would have been harmless. <em>See Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431 (\u201c[W]e hold that the constitutionally improper denial of a defendant\u2019s opportunity to impeach a witness for bias, like other Confrontation Clause errors, is subject to ... harmless-error analysis.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-7\">. Sinclair acknowledges that this court has previously rejected Commerce Clause challenges to this rule based on <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and its progeny. We decline his invitation to revisit these decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
