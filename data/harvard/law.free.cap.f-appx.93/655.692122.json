Assiter pleaded guilty to one count of \u201cInterstate Receipt of Child Pornography,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(A) and \u00a7 2 (2000). Assiter appeals from the district court\u2019s sentencing decision, claiming that the court improperly enhanced his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) (2002). For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Because Assiter pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(A), the district court applied \u00a7 2G2.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines. The government recommended a five-level increase to the base offense level, under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4), for \u201cengaging] in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.\u201d This five-level increase is appropriate when the defendant has, on at least two occasions, engaged in \u201cconduct constituting criminal sexual abuse of a minor, sexual exploitation of a minor, abusive sexual contact of a minor, [or] <em>any similar offense under state law.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 cmt.1 (emphasis added). At the sentencing hearing, the government asserted that Assiter had, at least twice, taken nude photographs of two minor girls while he was wearing only a long shirt. Accordingly, it argued that Assiter had committed the Texas crime of \u201cIndecency With a Child.\u201d <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) (Vernon 2003). Assiter objected and claimed that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that he had violated \u00a7 21.11(a)(2). The district court overruled the objection and sentenced Assiter to fifty-one months of imprisonment, followed by a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">On appeal, Assiter reasserts his contention that the enhancement was erroneously applied because the government did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he had committed the Texas indecency crime. We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings at sentencing for clear error. <em>See United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 643 (5th Cir.2003). Generally, the government must prove factors for the enhancement of a sentence by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 157, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997); <em>United States v. Canada, </em>110 F.3d 260, 263 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">A person commits the Texas crime of Indecency With a Child if,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-17\">with a child younger than 17 years and not the person\u2019s spouse, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>child is of the same or opposite sex, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">(2) with intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">(A) exposes the person\u2019s anus or any part of the person\u2019s genitals, knowing the child is present; <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">(B) causes the child to expose the child\u2019s anus or any part of the child\u2019s genitals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) (emphasis added). Assiter claims that the government proved only that he was wearing nothing but a long shirt while taking photographs of the two minor children, and it did not claim that the girls saw his genitals. But Texas law does not require proof that a child actually saw Assiter\u2019s genitals; proof of exposure is sufficient. <em>See Breckenridge v. State, </em>40 S.W.3d 118, 128 (Tex.App.\u2014San Antonio 2000, pet. ref'd). Moreover, the government did not rely on Assiter\u2019s exposure in arguing that he had committed this crime. Instead, the government alleged that Assiter violated \u00a7 21.11(a)(2)(B) by causing the children\u2019s genitals to be exposed while he took numerous photographs of them for his own sexual gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Assiter also argues that there was insufficient evidence to show that his intent in taking the photographs was to arouse or to gratify his own sexual desires. Specifically, Assiter notes that the government did not attempt to prove that he was actually aroused during the photography session. Once again, Assiter\u2019s contention misses the mark because \u00a7 21.11(a)(2) does not require proof of arousal. <em>See Gregory v. State, </em>56 S.W.3d 164, 171 (Tex.App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. dism\u2019d), <em>cert. denied </em>538 U.S. 978, 123 S.Ct. 1787, 155 L.Ed.2d 667 (2003); <em>cf. Caballero v. State, </em>927 S.W.2d 128, 130 (Tex.App.\u2014El Paso 1996, pet. Ref'd). Under Texas law, \u201c[t]he requisite specific intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of a person can be inferred from conduct, remarks, or all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Gregory, </em>56 S.W.3d at 171. Here, the government maintained that the court could infer the intent to arouse because Assiter not only caused two minor girls to expose their genitals while he himself was naked from the waist down, but he also took numerous nude pictures of the girls, some of which focused on the genital area. In addition, an FBI agent testified that Assiter had stored many pornographic images of adult women on his computer, including images of bestiality. This combination of circumstances is far more compelling than the facts required to prove the intent to gratify under Texas law. <em>See Martins v. State, </em>52 S.W.Sd 459, 475 (Tex.App.\u2014Corpus Christi 2001, no pet.) (reviewing cases). We therefore hold that the government met its burden of proving Assister\u2019s intent by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">In the alternative, Assister claims that even if he violated \u00a7 21.11(a)(2), this crime is not sufficiently similar to the offenses enumerated in the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) to qualify <em>for the </em>five-level sentencing increase. Because Assister did not object to his sentence on this basis in the district court, this \u201cissue is raised for the first time on appeal and is reviewed for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Cabral-Castillo, </em>35 F.3d 182, 188-89 (5th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have stated that an error is not \u201cplain\u201d unless it is \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189. This circuit has never before considered whether a violation of the Tex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>as indecency statute constitutes \u201csexual abuse or exploitation of a minor\u201d under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4). Thus, \u201cany error by the district court in this regard was not plain or obvious, as we have not previously addressed this issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega, </em>332 F.3d 849, 852 n. 3 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b680-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

Although the government did not ask us to adopt this standard until oral argument, its failure \u201cis unfortunate, but not fatal\u201d to our use of the appropriate standard of review. <em>United States v. Vontsteen, 950 </em>F.2d <em>1086, </em>1092 (5th Cir.1992) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
