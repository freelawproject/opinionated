Aucoin. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">I. FACTS &amp; PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">After Haney\u2019s predecessor as district attorney for Louisiana\u2019s 16th Judicial District Court resigned in mid-term, Haney became acting district attorney and announced his candidacy to fill his predecessor\u2019s unexpired term. According to Aucoin, Haney\u2019s predecessor talked with Aucoin, a 20-year assistant district attorney in the same office, urging that he either support Haney\u2019s election bid or resign. Aucoin alleged that he declined this suggestion and- thereafter rejected Haney\u2019s entreaty of political support, whereupon Haney fired Aucoin.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">Aucoin sued Haney in federal district court, alleging various constitutional violations, each of which stemmed from Aucoin\u2019s firing by Haney for failure to support Haney\u2019s candidacy for district attorney (and, apparently, for supporting an opposition candidate). Haney requested that Underwriters provide defense and indemnification under its lawyers professional liability insurance policy (the \u201cpolicy\u201d), but Underwriters declined based on (1) the policy\u2019s express exclusions of claims related to employment practices, and (2) Haney\u2019s predecessor\u2019s rejection of employment practices coverage when that policy was applied for and obtained to cover legal claims arising from professional liability, personal injury, disciplinary proceedings, punitive damages, and criminal defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-18\">The district court denied Haney\u2019s motions for summary judgment seeking dismissal of Aucoin\u2019s suit or, alternatively, a grant of qualified immunity, and Haney appealed to us. We reversed the district court, holding that Haney had not violated Aucoin\u2019s First Amendment rights, and remanded to the district court for further consistent proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-19\">Haney pursued his third party demand against Underwriters to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs and expenses incurred in his successful defense of Aucoin\u2019s claims. Haney and Underwriters filed opposing motions for summary judgment, each relying principally on the language of the policy and the application of the district attorney\u2019s office for professional liability coverage. The district court denied Haney\u2019s summary judgment motion and granted Underwriters\u2019s, dismissing Haney\u2019s claims in their entirety. Haney timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Our employment of the <em>de novo </em>standard of review of a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is too well known to require citation. Here, the applicability of <em>de novo </em>review is all the more obvious, given that neither party asserted the existence of factual disputes, so that the outcome turned on undisputed facts and contractual interpretation of the subject insurance policy and related documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">B. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">It took the district court only seven pages of double-spaced, typewritten, letter-size stock (2-1/2 of which pages were devoted to a long-form reiteration of the summary judgment standard that both we and the district court employ) to explicate pellucidly its grant of Underwriters\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its denial of Haney\u2019s. Our careful review of the district court\u2019s ruling, the summary judgment record, and the arguments advanced by the parties\u2019 respective counsel in their appellate briefs convinces us beyond cavil that the district court was correct in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">That court charitably characterized Haney\u2019s interpretation of the policy as \u201chighly doubtful\u201d and his arguments as \u201cunusual.\u201d We shall be more frank: Haney\u2019s appellate arguments and his characterization of the provisions of the subject insurance policy and application are sophistry incarnate. Not only did the insured affirmatively decline coverage of employment practices claims, the policy itself expressly, unequivocally, and unambiguously excludes employment claims of every nature from its coverage. And, we are satisfied that, as a matter of law, there can be no non-frivolous contention that the claims asserted by Aucoin were anything other than employment claims, pure and simple: Haney fired Aucoin when he refused to support Haney\u2019s election bid, and all of Aucoin\u2019s judicially asserted claims arose from or were connected with that termination of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">For essentially the same reasons advanced by the district court in its succinct yet completely definitive Memorandum Ruling, we affirm summary judgment in favor of Underwriters, dismissing Haney\u2019s claims for costs and expenses incurred in defending Aueoin\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">AFFIRMED, at Haney\u2019s cost.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b663-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
