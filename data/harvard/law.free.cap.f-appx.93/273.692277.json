Trager of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b298-19\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b298-20\">The defendant-appellant Geisha Suarez pleaded guilty (1) to a conspiracy to steal federal funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and (2) to stealing federal funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. As part of her sentence, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Victor Marrero, <em>Judge) </em>ordered Suarez to pay restitution under the authority of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663A, 3664, (\u201cMVRA\u201d) to the Bronx Check Cashing Corporation (\u201cBCCC\u201d) in the amount of $25,302.86.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-21\">Suarez argues that BCCC is not properly a victim to which she could owe restitution under the MVRA. We disagree. The MVRA authorizes the district court to order Suarez to provide restitution to BCCC because BCCC reimbursed the vic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>tim, the United States, for its loss from Suarez\u2019s crimes. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3664(j)(l). The MVRA indicates that the United States qualifies as a victim for restitution purposes. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3664(i). Therefore, the district court properly ordered restitution to BCCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">There is also no merit to Suarez\u2019s argument that she has a right of contribution against BCCC that would diminish the amount of her restitution to BCCC. \u201c[W]hile apportionment may now be required in some jurisdictions in civil tort suits, we decline to apply by analogy the same principle in criminal cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Tzakis, </em>736 F.2d 867, 871 (2d Cir.1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Suarez also maintains that the district court did not give individualized consideration to her ability to pay when setting the payment schedule. \u201c[I]n considering restitution sentences imposed by the MVRA, we will not vacate and remand ... solely by reason of the sentencing judge\u2019s failure to indicate consideration of the mandatory factors [of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2)].\u201d <em>United States v. Walker, </em>353 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir.2003). The sentencing judge must, however, \u201cconsider the mandatory factors in setting payment schedules for restitution orders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We must therefore find in \u201cthe record ... some affirmative act or statement allowing an inference that the district court considered the defendant\u2019s ability to pay\u201d in setting the schedule. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>302 F.3d 72, 75 (2d Cir.2002) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). The circumstances give rise to the reasonable inference that the district court considered the mandatory factors in setting Suarez\u2019s payment schedule. First, the district court announced at sentencing that it reviewed and adopted the PSR factual recitation, which contains information about Suarez\u2019s background, education and training, employment history, earnings, assets and liabilities, family status, and financial support. <em>See United States v. Kinlock, </em>174 F.3d 297, 300-01 (2d Cir.1999). Only after adopting these factual findings did the district court impose the PSR\u2019s recommended payment schedule of 10% of her gross monthly income over the period of supervision. Second, the court demonstrated its awareness of Suarez\u2019s financial situation when it decided to impose no fine on the ground that she did not have the ability to pay it. Finally, four of the letters that Suarez\u2019s lawyer submitted to the court regarding the issue of restitution discussed her financial situation, employment history, IQ, and family obligations. And in one of the government\u2019s letters to the court on the issue of restitution, the government articulated the three factors that the court must consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u201cOnce having considered the mandatory factors specified by \u00a7 3664(f)(2), the sentencing judge is afforded very broad discretion in setting the schedule.\u201d <em>United States v. Corbett, </em>357 F.3d 194, 195 (2d Cir.2004). The district court did not abuse its discretion in setting Suarez\u2019s payment schedule at 10% of her gross monthly income. <em>Cf. Kinlock, </em>174 F.3d at 301 (\u201cWhile we recognize the difficulty the district court may encounter in fashioning a precise dollar amount for the period of incarceration, a payment schedule expressed as a percentage of the defendant\u2019s monthly income while incarcerated, e.g. 10% of monthly income, is satisfactory.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Suarez also attacks the MVRA on a number of constitutional grounds. We do not consider the alleged violations of the New York Constitution because \u201cthe Supremacy Clause invalidates state laws that interfere with, or are contrary to, federal law.\u201d <em>Hillsborough County v. Automated </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>Med. Labs., Inc., </em>471 U.S. 707, 712, 105 S.Ct. 2371, 85 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Suarez argues that she was denied her Fifth Amendment right to procedural due process because the district court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing as to whether the BCCC was a victim under the MVRA. All that the Due Process Clause requires the district court to do is \u201cafford the defendant some opportunity to rebut the Government\u2019s allegations. Decisions as to what types of procedure are needed lie within the discretion of the sentencing court and are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Slevin, </em>106 F.3d 1086, 1091 (2d Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In accordance with this principle, the court properly gave Suarez an adequate opportunity to present her position as to her restitution contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Suarez contends further that the order of restitution violated her Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial because the order extinguished her claim against BCCC for contribution and is the equivalent of compensatory damages. Our established case law indicates that this claim has no merit. We have held that an order of restitution under the MVRA\u2019s predecessor statute, the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, as amended, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663, 3664 (1994), (\u2018VWPA\u201d) \u201cdo[es] not transform a criminal sentence into a civil adjudication requiring fact-finding by a jury.\u201d <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>744 F.2d 905, 908 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1089, 105 S.Ct. 599, 83 L.Ed.2d 708 (1984). Suarez is incorrect in asserting that <em>Brown </em>does not control this case because there is no discretion in imposing restitution under the MVRA, whereas there was discretion under the VWPA. \u201cUnder the MVRA, ... while judges must impose the full amount of loss as restitution, they have considerable discretion to impose nominal, in-kind, and periodic payments. That courts cannot exercise discretion as to the technical amount of restitution that would theoretically be recovered is of no import.\u201d <em>United States v. Dubose, </em>146 F.3d 1141, 1148 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 975, 119 S.Ct. 430, 142 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Suarez maintains that the imposition of restitution violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibitions of excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishment. This argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Porcelli, </em>865 F.2d 1352, 1366 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 810, 110 S.Ct. 53, 107 L.Ed.2d 22 (1989); <em>cf. Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 994, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Suarez also contends that Congress lacked legislative authority to enact the MVRA. The MVRA does not violate the Fifth Amendment guarantee of substantive due process because \u201cCongress had a rational basis for its choice of penalties.\u201d <em>United States v. Meskini, </em>319 F.3d 88, 91 (2d Cir.) (internal quotation marks omitted; quoting <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 465, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991)), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1068, 123 S.Ct. 2240, 155 L.Ed.2d 1125 (2003). The MVRA also does not violate the principle of separation of powers on the ground that it removes discretion from judges to impose restitution. The power to fix sentences ultimately rests with the legislature, <em>see Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 364, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989); thus, any legislative diminishment of judicial discretion in sentencing, at least with regard to restitution, is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">We have considered Suarez\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
