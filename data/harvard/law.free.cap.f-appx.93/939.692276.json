The ALJ found that although Jacoby has physical limitations and cannot perform his past relevant work, he retains the capacity to perform other occupations within the national economy and is therefore not entitled to benefits. The district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">In 1995 Jacoby, then 53 years old, was working as a traction motor repairman for General Electric when he injured his left knee at work. Jacoby sought treatment from Dr. Dale Doerr, an orthopedic surgeon, who performed arthroscopic knee surgery in August 1995. This was Jacoby\u2019s second arthroscopic surgery on his knee; the first was in 1980. After two months of physical therapy, Jacoby returned to work with no restrictions. In April 1998, however, Jacoby reinjured his knee getting out of a car. Dr. Doerr recommended another arthroscopic surgery, which he performed the following month.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">As Jacoby recovered from surgery, Dr. Doerr noted that he continued to have problems with pain and swelling of the knee, and had not yet regained a full range of motion. Dr. Doerr\u2019s treatment notes reflect that in July, Jacoby complained of crunching in his knees, difficulty kneeling, and knee pain if he stood for more than 45 minutes or an hour. Dr. Doerr reported that Jacoby\u2019s knee continued to swell, but he had a range of motion in his left knee from 0 to 125 degrees (the normal degree of full flexion is 0 to 130-135 degrees). Dr. Doerr allowed Jacoby to go back to work with the following restrictions: \u201cNo standing for longer than one hour at a time, minimal ladder climbing and no kneeling.\u201d Dr. Doerr prescribed Naprosyn, an anti-inflammatory drug. Dr. Doerr stated that although Jacoby\u2019s condition probably would not get much better, \u201che may improve to the point where he will be able to do a normal standing type of a job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-14\">Dr. Doerr saw Jacoby for the last time on August 12; 1998, and found his physical condition to be basically unchanged from July. Dr. Doerr discussed with Jacoby the possibility of performing a total knee replacement in the future. Dr. Doerr referred Jacoby for a second opinion to Dr. Dennis Dusek, an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Dusek examined Jacoby and agreed with Dr. Doerr\u2019s assessment of his physical limitations. Dr. Dusek recommended that Jacoby continue with a \u201cconservative course\u201d of treatment until he could no longer walk a few blocks, and then a total knee replacement would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-15\">In February 1999 Jacoby applied for disability insurance benefits as of August 26, 1998, because of the arthritis in his left knee. In March 1999 Dr. Eugene Wenthe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>a state agency doctor, examined Jacoby and noted that he had swelling in his left knee, but could extend his knee and had flexion of 0 to 110 degrees. Dr. Wenthe noted that Jacoby\u2019s gait was unassisted and that he could walk further than 50 feet without assistance, but that he tended to favor his right side. Dr. Wenthe\u2019s notes reflect that the only medication Jacoby was taking was an aspirin once or twice per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">In April 1999 another agency doctor, Dr. D. Widious, examined Jacoby and performed a Residual Functional Capacity (RFC) assessment. Dr. Widious considered Dr. Doerr\u2019s and Dr. Dusek\u2019s records and found that Jacoby\u2019s physical limitations matched those outlined in Dr. Doerr\u2019s treatment notes. Adopting the physical restrictions outlined in the notes of Dr. Doerr and Dr. Dusek, Dr. Widious determined that Jacoby was \u201creasonably capable of light work activity with only occasional climbing, stooping, crouching, kneeling and crawling.\u201d Dr. B. Rock Oh, another agency doctor, reviewed both Jacoby\u2019s medical records and Dr. Widious\u2019s report, and agreed with Dr. Widious\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Jacoby provided the only testimony during his administrative hearing in October 1999. He testified that his knee swelled every day and that he had continual pain, which he registered as seven or eight on a ten-point scale. He testified that Dr. Doerr required him to elevate his leg during the day to help alleviate the pain, and that he needed to do so six or seven hours every day. He stated that he could stand or walk for only 10 or 15 minutes at a time and only for one or two hours total during an eight-hour work-day. Jacoby testified that, if allowed to elevate his leg, he could sit for half an hour at a time. The ALJ questioned Jacoby about his daily activities, and he responded that he did not do much of anything during the day except \u201cwatch a little TV, read a little bit,\u201d and perform a few household chores, such as light dusting.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Before the hearing, the ALJ requested that a vocational expert (VE) examine Jacoby\u2019s medical records and give his opinion as to whether there were jobs that Jacoby could perform with his physical limitations. The VE considered Jacoby\u2019s physical limitations in determining that Jacoby could no longer work as a traction motor repairman. However, the VE found that Jacoby\u2019s skills from past work could be transferred to light work jobs, such as an electric motor fitter for railroad equipment, an electric motor assembler, or an electric motor analyst.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">In October 1999, after the administrative hearing, Jacoby\u2019s attorney sent a three-page questionnaire to Jacoby\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Doerr. The questionnaire asked several questions about Jacoby\u2019s physical limitations and Dr. Doerr responded by ticking off the box next to the answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d after each question. He did not expand on any of his answers. Under the section marked \u201cEx-ertional Limitations,\u201d Dr. Doerr agreed with the statement that Jacoby could only perform \u201cSedentary Work\u201d and suffered from \u201cModerately Severe\u201d pain that would \u201cFrequently (34-66%)\u201d interfere with his ability to \u201cmaintain attention and concentration\u201d and attend work on a regular basis. Dr. Doerr answered yes to the question: \u201cIs it necessary for the patient to elevate the leg at waist level or above for two or more hours out of an eight hour day, as needed, for relief of pain and/or swelling?\u201d Although Dr. Doerr had not examined Jacoby since August 12,1998, he agreed with the statement that Jacoby\u2019s \u201csymptoms and limitations existed at the same or similar degree of severity since 8/26/98.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>In his decision, the ALJ applied the requisite five-step framework for determining benefit eligibility. The ALJ found that Jacoby had not been gainfully employed since his claimed disability began; that he did not suffer from impairments that met or equaled the level of severity of a listed impairment; that his arthritis prevented him from performing his past relevant work; but that Jacoby could perform light work with some non-exertional limitations. The ALJ applied the Medical Vocational Guidelines (the \u201cgrid\u201d) and found that Jacoby, even though 53 years old (qualifying as \u201capproaching advanced age\u201d), was not disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, App. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 202.14, 202.15 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">The appeals council denied Jacoby\u2019s request for another hearing and Jacoby timely petitioned for review in the district court. The district court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, and Jacoby now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">The ALJ\u2019s conclusions are reviewed deferentially and should be upheld if reached under the correct legal standard and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Schmidt v. Apfel, </em>201 F.3d 970, 972 (7th Cir.2000). Substantial evidence requires no more than \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Powers v. Apfel, </em>207 F.3d 431, 434 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Jacoby first challenges the ALJ\u2019s decision to disregard the opinions of his treating physician, Dr. Doerr, as set forth in his response to the questionnaire of October 1999. Jacoby argues that the ALJ should have accorded controlling weight to Dr. Doerr\u2019s opinions regarding his physical limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">While Jacoby is correct that an ALJ should generally give more weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion partially because of its longitudinal view, <em>see generally </em>Social Security Ruling 96-2p, controlling weight is appropriate only if the opinion is well supported by medical findings and is not inconsistent with substantial evidence in the record, <em>Dixon v. Massanari, </em>270 F.3d 1171, 1177 (7th Cir.2001); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). Here the ALJ decided not to accord controlling weight to Dr. Doerr\u2019s opinions from October 1999 because they were \u201cinconsistent\u201d with his treatment notes. For example, on the questionnaire Dr. Doerr agreed with the statement that it \u201cis necessary for [Jacoby] to elevate the leg at waist level or above for two or more hours our of an eight hour day, as needed, for relief of pain or swelling,\u201d yet Dr. Doerr\u2019s treatment notes do not mention that Jacoby would need to elevate his legs. Similarly, Dr. Doerr\u2019s notes do not reflect that Jacoby\u2019s pain would interfere with his ability to focus on a task or attend work on a regular basis-a statement that Dr. Doerr agreed to on the October 1999 questionnaire. What Dr. Doerr\u2019s notes do show is that he believed Jacoby could return to work, provided that he did not have to stand for longer than one hour at a time, kneel, or perform minimal ladder climbing. The ALJ properly rejected Dr. Doerr\u2019s October 1999 opinions because they lacked substantiation in his earlier treatment notes or other medical findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">Jacoby next challenges the ALJ\u2019s determination that his testimony of disabling pain was not credible. Jacoby attacks the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination on two grounds: (1) the ALJ incorrectly found that Jacoby\u2019s daily activities contradicted his testimony that he suffered from continuous, severe pain; and (2) the ALJ failed to consider Jacoby\u2019s use of prescription medication to control his pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>An ALJ is required to evaluate a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain in determining whether he is disabled, see 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529, considering both the objective medical evidence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1529(b), as well as information provided by the claimant, his treating physician, or others, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1529(c). The ALJ must also evaluate the credibility of the claimant\u2019s testimony in light of his (i) daily activities, (ii) the location, frequency, and duration of pain, (iii) precipitating and aggravating factors, (iv) the effects of medication, (v) treatment, (vi) other measure used to reheve the pain, and (vii) other facts concerning functional limitations. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1529(c)(3). Although the ALJ must give specific reasons for findings of credibility, <em>see Steele v. Barnhart, </em>290 F.3d 936, 942 (7th Cir.2002); Social Security Ruling 96-7p (1996), these findings are entitled to deference and will not be disturbed unless \u201cpatently wrong\u201d in light of the record, <em>Powers, </em>207 F.3d at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">The ALJ did not erroneously discount Jacoby\u2019s complaints of pain. The ALJ noted that Jacoby \u201cenjoys watching television and reading, activities which are generally regarded to be inconsistent with pain levels so severe as to preclude extended concentration.... The claimant is able to drive an automobile, and there is no evidence that he is unable to perform personal care tasks.\u201d Although this kind of minimal activity might not be sufficient to contradict subjective complaints of disabling pain, <em>Clifford v. Apfel, </em>227 F.3d 863, 872 (7th Cir.2000), the ALJ also noted that Jacoby used only aspirin to manage his pain. <em>See Donahue v. Barnhart, </em>279 F.3d 441, 444 (7th Cir.2002) (evidence that claimant \u201crelied for pain control on over-the-counter analgesics\u201d supports conclusion that pain is not disabling).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Jacoby\u2019s argument that he used the prescription drugs DepoMedrol, Relafen, and Naprosyn to control his pain is not supported by substantial evidence. Jacoby does not mention that he was prescribed Relafen once in 1997, DepoMedrol once in 1998 before his third surgery, and Naprosyn once in July 1998-all before he allegedly became disabled. Furthermore, both Relafen and Naprosyn are prescribed primarily as anti-inflammatory drugs, not to treat severe pain, <em>see Powers, </em>207 F.3d at 435 (reliance on drugs not intended to treat severe pain suggests claimant may be exaggerating condition), and contain the same amount of pain medication found in aspirin, <em>see </em>57 Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference 1617, 2891. The ALJ considered the appropriate factors and Jacoby has not demonstrated that the ALJ\u2019s credibility finding is patently wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Finally, Jacoby challenges the ALJ\u2019s determination that he could do light work, even with some impairments-performing only occasional climbing, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, or crawling, not using ladders, ropes or scaffolds, and avoiding dangerous machinery and heights. Jacoby argues that the ALJ\u2019s determination of his functional restriction failed to include Jacoby\u2019s need to elevate his leg and his claims of disabling pain. But as discussed earlier, the ALJ did not improperly exclude those restrictions because the ALJ reasonably determined that Jacoby\u2019s testimony was not credible and that Dr. Doerr\u2019s opinions were not supported by medical evidence. Jacoby does not explain how the ALJ\u2019s finding that he could perform light work is incorrect if his claims of leg elevation and disabling pain are not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">Jacoby argues that the ALJ should have sought the testimony of a vocational expert at the hearing \u201cto assess how [the] nonexertional impairments affected the occupational base.\u201d We have said, however, that the use of a vocational expert \u201cis entirely within the discretion of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Binion v. Shalala, </em>13 F.3d 243, 246 (7th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Ehrhart v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>969 F.2d 534, 540 (7th Cir.1992) (\u201cvocational expert is not a required or even essential part of a disability benefits hearing\u201d)). After determining Jacoby\u2019s nonexertional limitations, the ALJ consulted Social Security Ruling 83-15 and properly determined that Jacoby\u2019s limitations would not have a significant impact on his ability to perform light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">The ALJ was presented with conflicting evidence regarding whether Jacoby\u2019s pain was disabling. Because the ALJ weighed all the relevant evidence and supported his conclusions with reasons grounded in the record, his denial of benefits was proper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to uphold the Commissioner\u2019s denial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b968-14\">. We note that the ALJ's opinion contains a reference to a \"Mr. Hamilton,\u201d but there is no Mr. Hamilton involved in this case. There are many scenarios that might account for this error; some more worrisome than others. However, we will not disturb the ALJ's determination because it is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
