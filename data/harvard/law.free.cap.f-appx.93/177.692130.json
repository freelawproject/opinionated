Hoover (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019), a former Oklahoma prisoner appearing <em>pro se </em>and <em>informa pauperis,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 while he was incarcerated. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), and Plaintiff now appeals. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b202-16\">Plaintiff alleged that on August 1, 2000, Sergeant Kelly West, supervised and assisted by other prison officials, assaulted and battered Plaintiff while he was wearing full restraints during his cellmate\u2019s cell abstraction. The next day, Plaintiff submitted a \u201cRequest to Staff\u2019 to Randall Workman, a Deputy Warden, who denied it on August 16, 2000. Plaintiff then filed a grievance to the Warden on that same day. On August 21, 2000, the Warden\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>office returned the grievance to Plaintiff unanswered on the ground that Plaintiff had previously filed a grievance regarding the same issue. Defendants have since conceded that the Warden\u2019s office made a mistake regarding this rationale, as no other previous grievance was filed regarding this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Plaintiff then appealed the issue to the Administrative Review Authority (ARA), which returned his grievance unanswered on August 31, 2000 because he had improperly attached additional pages to the grievance and because he had not received a response from the facility head (the Warden). The Administrative Review Authority gave Plaintiff ten additional days to correct the deficiencies and properly submit the grievance. Instead of attempting to cure during this time period,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Oklahoma pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and denial of due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Defendants moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) on the ground that Plaintiff had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The district court granted the motion and Plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">We exercise jurisdiction over this appeal from the district court\u2019s final order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). <em>Jernigan v. Stuchell, </em>304 F.3d 1030, 1032 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">A. The Exhaustion Requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">The general rule is that plaintiffs need not exhaust administrative remedies before filing a \u00a7 1983 suit. <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 523, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002). However, as part of the 1996 Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), Congress added an exhaustion requirement for prisoners\u2019 suits regarding prison conditions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The provision, entitled \u201cSuits by Prisoners,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-15\">No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The Supreme Court has held that this exhaustion requirement for suits regarding \u201cprison conditions\u201d applies to \u201call inmate suits about prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Porter, </em>534 U.S. at 531, 122 S.Ct. 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-17\">\u201cAlthough section 1997e(a) mandates the exhaustion of administrative remedies, a plaintiff\u2019s failure to fulfill a statutory requirement does not necessarily deprive the federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Chelette v. Harris, </em>229 F.3d 684, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>687 (8th Cir.2000). The Supreme Court has held that the language of the exhaustion requirement must contain \u201c \u2018sweeping and direct\u2019 language indicating that there is no federal jurisdiction prior to exhaustion, or else the exhaustion requirement is treated as an element of the underlying claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 757, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975)). Because \u00a7 1997e(a) does not contain this sort of \u201csweeping and direct\u201d language, every circuit court that has considered the issue has found that the PLRA exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional. <em>Id. </em>(collecting cases); <em>see also Ali v. District of Columbia, </em>278 F.3d 1, 5-6 (D.C.Cir.2002) (same). We recently joined our sister circuits in finding that the PLRA exhaustion requirement, although mandatory, is not a prerequisite to our jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Steele v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>355 F.3d 1204, 1206 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">An inmate must not only begin the administrative grievance process in order to meet the exhaustion requirement, but must also complete it in compliance with administrative rules. <em>Jernigan, </em>304 F.3d at 1032. Even if the administrative process does not provide the particular relief sought by the plaintiff, he or she is still required to exhaust all administrative procedures that are available. <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 741, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). Similarly, the plaintiff is required to exhaust all available procedures offered by the prison even if doing so appears \u201cfutile.\u201d <em>Jernigan, </em>304 F.3d at 1032; <em>see also Giano v. Goord, </em>250 F.3d 146, 150-51 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201c[T]he alleged ineffectiveness of the administrative remedies that are available does not absolve a prisoner of his obligation to exhaust such remedies!)]\u201d); <em>Perez v. Wisconsin Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>182 F.3d 532, 536-37 (7th Cir.1999) (finding that the PLRA exhaustion requirement has no \u201cfutility exception,\u201d and stating that \u201c[n]o one can <em>know </em>whether administrative requests will be futile; the only way to find out is to try\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">B. Defendants\u2019 administrative procedure provided a remedy that triggered the exhaustion requirement of \u00a7 1997e(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Plaintiff first argues that the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d) provides no remedy for his allegations. According to Plaintiff, this is because the grievance process cannot be used to discipline staff and because the Oklahoma Governmental Tort Claims Act does not provide a cause of action for \u201cindividual nonofficial acts.\u201d (Aplt. Br. at 10-11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">However, the Supreme Court has held that as long as the administrative procedures have \u201cauthority to take <em>some </em>action in response to a complaint,\u201d that is enough of a remedy to trigger the exhaustion requirement. <em>Booth, </em>532 U.S. at 736, 121 S.Ct. 1819 (emphasis added). For example, although the procedures may not provide monetary relief, they might provide for transfer to another facility or at least a hearing on grievances. <em>See Larkin v. Galloway, </em>266 F.3d 718, 723 (7th Cir.2001). Plaintiff does not argue that transfers or hearings were not available through this process, and it is not sufficient for him to simply point to the lack of either a tort cause of action or an inmate-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>initiated disciplinary action against staff. The administrative procedures provided some remedy and Plaintiff is obligated to exhaust those procedures even if the available remedy is not one of his choosing. <em>See Booth, </em>532 U.S. at 741, 121 S.Ct. 1819.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">C. Plaintiff did not exhaust all \u201cavailable\u201d administrative procedures, and Defendants\u2019 actions did not render these procedures \u201cunavailable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Plaintiff next argues that he exhausted all administrative procedures that were available to him and that any further procedures were made \u201cunavailable\u201d by Defendants\u2019 actions. He is frustrated by the fact that the Warden initially erred in declining to respond to his grievance based on the misconception that a previous grievance had been filed on the same issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Yet, when Plaintiff attempted to appeal, the Administrative Review Authority (ARA) refused to respond in part because the Warden had not yet responded. It is true that Plaintiff seems to have been caught in a catch-22. However, the ARA gave him ten days to cure this deficiency, and instead of even attempting to obtain a response from the Warden or explain the mistake to the ARA within that time period, he filed the instant suit in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Plaintiff is correct that \u00a7 1997e(a) only requires him to exhaust administrative procedures that are made \u201cavailable\u201d to him. Courts \u201crefuse to interpret the PLRA so narrowly as to permit prison officials to exploit the exhaustion requirement through indefinite delay in responding to grievances.\u201d <em>See Lewis v. Washington, </em>300 F.3d 829, 833 (7th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). Instead, we examine the plain meaning of the term \u201cavailable\u201d in \u00a7 1997e(a) and find that a prisoner is only required to exhaust those procedures that he or she is reasonably <em>capable </em>of exhausting. <em>See Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir.1998). For example, \u201c[T]he failure [of prison officials] to respond to a grievance within the time limits contained in the grievance policy renders an administrative remedy unavailable.\u201d <em>Jernigan, </em>304 F.3d at 1032. Similarly, a prisoner lacks \u201cavailable\u201d remedies where prison officials deny him or her the necessary grievance forms. <em>Mitchell v. Horn, </em>318 F.3d 523, 529 (3d Cir.2003). Where prison officials prevent or thwart a prisoner from utilizing an administrative remedy, they have rendered that remedy \u201cunavailable\u201d and a court will deem that procedure \u201cexhausted.\u201d <em>See Lyon v. Vande Krol, </em>305 F.3d 806, 808 (8th Cir.2002); <em>Miller v. Norris, </em>247 F.3d 736, 740 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">However, in the instant case, Plaintiff was given ten days to cure the deficiency, yet failed to make any such attempt. This is similar to the situation we faced in <em>Jernigan, </em>304 F.3d at 1032-33, where we held that the plaintiff had not exhausted his remedies where he failed to cure a deficiency in his appeal related to obtaining a response from the head prison official, even though it may have been the prison official\u2019s fault for misplacing his grievance. We noted that the plaintiff \u201cwas given ten days to cure the deficiency in question which no doubt would have involved informing prison officials of the lost or misfiled grievance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1032. We stated that the plaintiff could not \u201csuccessfully argue that he had exhausted his administrative remedies by, in essence, failing to employ them[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1033. There, as here, the grievance policy pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>vided a time frame for prison officials\u2019 responses, after which the plaintiff could appeal with evidence of <em>attempts </em>to obtain a response. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff has not shown us any reason why he could not have brought the mistake regarding the previous grievance to the Warden\u2019s attention (or the ARA\u2019s) within the 10-day time period. Because he did not even try to cure this deficiency, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of exhaustion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">D. Defendants are not equitably es-topped from moving to dismiss for failure to exhaust.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Finally, Plaintiff argues that because it was Defendants\u2019 mistake that caused him to fall short of fully exhausting the administrative procedures, they should be equitably estopped from moving to dismiss based on \u00a7 1997e(a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u201cThe Fifth Circuit is the only circuit to hold that equitable estoppel can apply to the PLRA exhaustion requirement.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>300 F.3d at 834 (citing <em>Wendell v. Asher, </em>162 F.3d 887, 890 (5th Cir.1998)). This holding is \u201cpersuasive because non-jurisdietional prerequisites to suit in federal court are typically subject to equitable estoppel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc. 455 </em>U.S. 385, 393, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982)). However, the Seventh and Tenth Circuits have so far declined to decide whether equitable estoppel applies because their cases have fallen short of meeting the elements of equitable estoppel. <em>See id.; Jernigan, </em>304 F.3d at 1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">To establish equitable estoppel, the party claiming estoppel must show: (1) a misrepresentation by the opposing party; (2) reasonable reliance on that misrepresentation; and (3) detriment. <em>Emery Mining Corp. v. Secretary of Labor, </em>744 F.2d 1411, 1417 (10th Cir.1984). It is also well-settled that the \u201cGovernment may not be es-topped on the same terms as any other litigant,\u201d and the burden on the party seeking estoppel against the government is heavier. <em>Heckler v. Cmmty. Health Servs. of Crawford County, </em>467 U.S. 51, 60, 104 S.Ct. 2218, 81 L.Ed.2d 42 (1984). \u201cWhen asserting equitable estoppel against the government, one must also prove affirmative misconduct.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>300 F.3d at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">In the instant ease, Plaintiff merely argues that the prison officials have \u201cmisrepresented\u201d that they have a grievance procedure and that they will answer grievances. (Aplt. Br. at 18.) However, he has pointed to no statement made to him regarding his grievance or the deadlines which could constitute a misrepresentation. Nor does he show that he relied on any of Defendants\u2019 statements to him. In fact, Plaintiff was the one who knew that Defendants\u2019 statements regarding his previous grievance were mistaken. Just like the plaintiff in <em>Jernigan, </em>Plaintiff cannot show detrimental reliance on prison officials. <em>See Jernigan, </em>304 F.3d at 1033 (stating that plaintiff could not show detrimental reliance, \u201chaving been told that his grievance had been lost or misfiled and having been given an opportunity to cure\u201d). Because Plaintiff fails to show either a misrepresentation or detrimental reliance, he has clearly failed to state a claim regarding equitable estoppel. Thus, we need not reach the issue of whether equitable estoppel applies to the PLRA exhaustion requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the order of the district court dismissing Plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim for failure to exhaust under \u00a7 1997e(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-18\">. Plaintiff was released from custody prior to filing his notice of appeal, and thus the filing fee provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act do not apply to this appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), (b), (h); <em>Whitney v. New Mexico, </em>113 F.3d 1170, 1171 n. 1 (10th Cir.1997). Based on our review of Plaintiff's financial declarations, we grant his motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\">. Plaintiff did attempt to refile his grievance to the Administrative Review Authority (ARA) on June 21, 2002. However, the ARA returned it for untimeliness because it was filed almost two years after he had been given ten days to correct the above deficiencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b203-18\">. The government asserts, without citation to the record or reference to dates, that Plaintiff was still incarcerated at the date of filing his complaint. Plaintiff does not seem to contest this. Therefore, it appears that the PLRA exhaustion requirement applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b204-5\">. Therefore, Plaintiff is correct when he argues that \u00a7 1997e(a) is not jurisdictional. However, this argument does not get him far as the district court would still have been required to dismiss his complaint had he failed to exhaust. Section 1997e(a) is mandatory and requires dismissal of any case in which an available administrative remedy has not been exhausted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\">. Defendants now concede that the Warden erred in this initial refusal to respond to Plaintiff's grievance, as there existed no previous grievances on this August 1, 2000 incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
