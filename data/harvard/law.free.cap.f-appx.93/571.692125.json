We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-20\">Beekford first argues that the district court erred in admitting evidence of his 1993 arrest for possession with intent to distribute marijuana under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). We review a district court\u2019s determination of the admissibility of evidence under Rule 404(b) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 995 (4th Cir.1997). A district court will not be found to have abused its discretion unless its decision to admit evidence under Rule 404(b) was arbitrary or irrational. <em>United States v. Haney, </em>914 F.2d 602, 607 (4th Cir.1990). Our review of the record convinces us that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence of Beckford\u2019s prior arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-21\">Beekford also argues that, in determining his sentence under the Guidelines,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the district court erroneously applied a two-level enhancement of his offense level for use of a firearm during the course of the conspiracy. Section 2D1.1(b)(1) pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>vides for a two-level increase in offense level for offenses involving drugs \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The commentary accompanying \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) notes that the enhancement \u201creflects the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons. The adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), comment, (n.3). \u201cIn order to prove that a weapon was present, the Government need show only that the weapon was possessed during the relevant illegal drug activity.\u201d <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s enhancement under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) is reviewed for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The Guidelines define relevant conduct to include, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, all reasonably foreseeable acts of others in furtherance of that activity. USSG \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). The presence of guns to perpetrate illicit drug activity typically is reasonably foreseeable. \u201cAbsent evidence of exceptional circumstances, ... it [is] fairly inferable that a codefendant\u2019s possession of a dangerous weapon is foreseeable to a defendant with reason to believe that their collaborative criminal venture includes an exchange of controlled substances for a large amount of cash.\u201d <em>United States v. Kimberlin, </em>18 F.3d 1156, 1160 (4th Cir.1994) (internal quotation and citation omitted). We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not commit clear error in finding that firearms were possessed by Beckford\u2019s co-conspirators and that such possession was reasonably foreseeable to Beckford. The two-level enhancement was properly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We accordingly affirm Beckford\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-22\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2002)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
