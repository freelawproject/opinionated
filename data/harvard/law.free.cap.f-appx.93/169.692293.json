The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found Torres ex-cludable on charges of alien smuggling based in part on a videotaped interview, conducted by the INS, of the woman Torres allegedly attempted to bring into the United States. Torres argues that the IJ erred in admitting the videotaped testimony because the INS did not show that the witness was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-22\">Unless a petitioner first exhausts all available administrative remedies, this court lacks jurisdiction to hear his claim. <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, 358 </em>F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Rashtabadi v. INS, </em>23 F.3d 1562, 1567 (9th Cir.1994). Torres did not challenge the IJ\u2019s admission of the videotaped testimony \u2014 on due process or any other grounds \u2014 before the BIA. As a result, this court lacks jurisdiction over Torres\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-23\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-24\">In addition, the stay of deportation issued on July,24, 2003 is ordered VACATED on the date of issuance of the mandate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The court is not inclined to grant any further stays.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Aul\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
