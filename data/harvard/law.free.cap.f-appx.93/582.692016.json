Johnson pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and was sentenced to a term of 151 months of imprisonment followed by a term of three years of supervised release. On appeal, Johnson raises the single issue of whether the district court erred in computing his criminal history score. For the reason set forth below, we vacate Johnson\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">The district court assigned Johnson two criminal history points for two prior sentences he had received for separate convictions for fleeing from a law enforcement officer. Both of those sentences were imposed under West Virginia Code Ann. \u00a7 61 \u2014 5\u201417(d), which makes non-vehicular flight from a law enforcement officer for the purpose of avoiding a lawful arrest a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the first fleeing conviction, which involved his flight from law enforcement officers as they attempted to arrest him for firing a weapon, Johnson was fined $50. For the second fleeing conviction, which involved his flight from law enforcement officers as they attempted to arrest him for trespassing, Johnson was sentenced to four days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\u201cThe Guidelines create a general presumption that all prior sentences within the applicable time period will be included in calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history category.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>128 F.3d 850, 853 (4th Cir.1997). However, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) creates a narrow exception for certain prior misdemeanor and petty offense sentences which meet the following three conditions: (1) the prior sentence must be listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) or be similar to a listed offense; (2) the prior sentence must have been for a term of less than one year of probation or 30 days of imprisonment; and (3) the prior sentence must not be similar to the instant offense <em>(ie., </em>the offense for which the defendant is then being sentenced). If a prior sentence meets these three conditions, it is excluded from the criminal history calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Johnson contends that his sentences for the fleeing offenses should have been excluded under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). The offense of fleeing is dissimilar to distribution of crack cocaine (the instant offense), and Johnson\u2019s sentences for fleeing are below the terms specified in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). Although fleeing is not a listed offense under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l), Johnson argues that fleeing is \u201csimilar\u201d to the listed offense of hindering or failing to obey a police officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If Johnson is correct, then the district court erred in counting the fleeing sentences in his criminal history. This is a legal issue, and we therefore review the district court\u2019s determination de novo. <em>See United States v. Caplinger, </em>339 F.3d 226, 233 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">In <em>Harris, </em>we recognized that the Guidelines do not define \u201csimilar\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l), and we adopted a \u201csimilar elements\u201d test to determine whether two offenses are \u201csimilar.\u201d 128 F.3d at 854. We stated that \u201cwhen two offenses are similar, their essential elements are \u2018nearly corresponding\u2019 or \u2018resembling in many respects.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Under that test, we held that a prior sentence for the offense of selling alcohol to a minor was properly counted in computing the defendant\u2019s criminal history because the offense is not listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) and, more pertinent, the offense does not \u201cshare common elements with any of the listed offenses.\u201d 128 F.3d at 855. We noted that the elements of the offense of selling alcohol to minors (under the applicable state law) are (1) selling (2) an alcoholic beverage (3) to a person under the age of 21, and that\u201d[n]one of the listed offenses in \u00a7 4A1.2(c) have elements resembling this combination; none involve selling alcohol; none involve transactions with minors.\u201d 128 F.3d at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">The parties agree that under the circumstances of this case we should look to West Virginia law to define the elements of the offenses of fleeing and hindering. These offenses are codified in separate subsections of West Virginia Code Ann. \u00a7 61-5-17 (\u201cCrimes Against Public Justice\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The elements of the offense of hindering are: (1) a person by threats, menaces, acts, or otherwise (2) forcibly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>illegally hinders or obstructs (3) any law enforcement officer acting in his or her official capacity. The elements of the offense of fleeing are: (1) a person intentionally flees by means other than a vehicle (2) from a law enforcement officer acting in his or her official capacity who is attempting to make a lawful arrest (3) with knowledge (or reason to know) that the law enforcement officer is attempting to arrest him or her.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Johnson contends that a comparison of these elements demonstrates their similarity, and he points to <em>State v. Jarvis, </em>172 W.Va. 706, 310 S.E.2d 467, 468 (1983), where the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia held: \u201cAny person, upon being advised by a police officer that he is being arrested pursuant to a warrant, who flees in an automobile or otherwise and thereby avoids immediate arrest, is guilty of illegally hindering an officer of this state in the lawful exercise of his official duty, in violation of W. Va.Code, 61-5-17.\u201d The United States counters that fleeing and hindering are not \u201csimilar\u201d for two reasons. First, the United States asserts that \u201cthe element requiring intentional flight by a defendant to be guilty of fleeing is quintessential to the offense. However, this element has no similar counterpart in the offense of hindering an officer. Therefore, this requirement distinguishes the two offenses and establishes their uniqueness.\u201d <em>Brief of Appellee, </em>at 9. Second, the United States asserts that \u201cthe separate treatment given to the offense of fleeing and the offense of hindering an officer, evidenced by their placement in two distinct subsections of the applicable statute, suggests that under West Virginia law, these two offenses are not similar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 310 S.E.2d 467.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">While the differences between the essential elements of these offenses are readily apparent, utilizing the <em>Harris </em>analysis we need not determine whether those elements are identical; instead, our inquiry is whether those elements are \u201cnearly corresponding\u201d or \u201cresembling in many respects.\u201d 128 F.3d at 854. We conclude that for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) the essential elements sufficiently resemble each other so as to make Johnson\u2019s fleeing convictions excludable. Both offenses are \u201ccrimes against public justice,\u201d and they share the essential elements of action directed toward, or in response to, a law enforcement officer acting in his or her official capacity that is designed to thwart the officer from performing a law enforcement duty. The similarity of these two offenses is best illustrated by the holding in <em>Jarvis </em>that specifically equates the conduct of fleeing \"with hindering under West Virginia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Because of our conclusion, Johnson should not have received criminal history points for his fleeing sentences. We therefore vacate the judgment and remand for the district court to resentence Johnson in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-9\">. Under different circumstances, the offense of fleeing from a law enforcement officer is a felony. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 61 \u2014 5\u201417(g)\u2014(i). For purposes of this opinion, we refer only to misdemeanor fleeing under \u00a7 61 \u2014 5\u201417(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-5\">. Johnson does not argue, as he did below, that fleeing is also similar to the listed offense of resisting arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b608-6\">. Section 61-5-17(a) defines hindering: \u201cAny person who by threats, menaces, acts or otherwise, forcibly or illegally hinders or obstructs ... any law-enforcement officer ... acting in his or her official capacity is guilty of a misdemeanor....\u201d Section 61-5-17(d) defines fleeing: \u201cAny person who intentionally flees ... by any means other than the use of a vehicle from any law-enforcement officer ... acting in his or her official capacity who is attempting to make a lawful arrest of the person, and who knows or reasonably believes that the officer is attempting to arrest him or her, is guilty of a misdemeanor....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b609-6\">. At the time <em>Jarvis </em>was decided, \u00a7 61-5-17 did not specifically criminalize fleeing. Since <em>Jarvis, </em>the statute has been amended several times, and the fleeing subsection was added during one of these amendments. We see no indication that the fleeing amendment was designed to abrogate the holding in <em>Jarvis.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
