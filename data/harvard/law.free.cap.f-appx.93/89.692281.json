The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found that appellant was responsible for more than 30,000 kilograms of marijuana equivalent and set the base offense level at 38 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3) (2002). His offense level was reduced three levels for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, but then enhanced two levels for playing a supervisory role in the drug conspiracy, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). This led to a final offense level of 37, with a sentencing range of 235 to 293 months imprisonment. The district court sentenced Perez Sanchez to 293 months imprisonment. On appeal Perez Sanchez contests the two point supervisory role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-26\">A sentencing court may enhance a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if he was \u201can organizer, leader, manager or supervisor\u201d in a criminal act. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(e). The government has the bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>den of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the enhancement is warranted. <em>United States v. Pitts, </em>173 F.3d 677, 681 (8th Cir.1999). We review a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v.Frank, </em>354 F.3d 910, 925 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The government presented ample evidence to establish that Perez Sanchez played a supervisory role in the conspiracy. A coconspirator, Seth Barker, testified that Perez Sanchez had him wire funds, pick up money, and weigh and package methamphetamine. Perez Sanchez also directed Barker not to sell drugs to specific people, and he kept track of who Barker\u2019s customers were. Barker testified that he was \u201cjust one of the workers basically out of all the people [defendant] had selling drugs.\u201d The district court found Barker\u2019s testimony credible. Another witness, Aaron Bensen, testified that Perez Sanchez had sent him drugs via courier.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Perez Sanchez argues that he did not exercise any control over Barker because Barker described their relationship as a friendship and partnership. Even if Perez Sanchez did not control Barker, \u201cwe do not require proof of control, so long as the criminal activity involves more than one participant and the defendant played a coordinating or organizing role.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>315 F.3d 929, 932 (8th Cir.2003). The district court had the opportunity to hear the testimony, and the evidence supported its finding of fact that Perez Sanchez played a coordinating or organizing role in the drug conspiracy. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-18\">. The Honorable Mark W.
