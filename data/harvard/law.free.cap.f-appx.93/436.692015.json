We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">On July 29, 2002, appellant Bruce Abraham, a Camden, New Jersey police officer, was charged in an eight count amended criminal complaint with supplying false and fraudulent documents to the IRS in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7207 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. More specifically, on his 1995 federal income tax return, Abraham listed six dependents living in his home, and took $21,424 in itemized deductions, including $4,687 in charitable gifts and $4,469 in unreimbursed business expenses. Due to the large number of dependents claimed, and the amount of itemized deductions, the IRS determined to audit the 1995 tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">On July 15, 1997, Abraham met with the IRS auditor, Rick Costow, and gave him, among other documents, the custody order alleged in Count 1 to be fraudulent. Cos-tow gave Abraham a form which requested that he provide, by July 30, 1997, additional documentation to support his claimed dependents and deductions. Costow received no response by the deadline, and on August 11, 1997 sent Abraham a letter disallowing the unsupported claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">Sometime after sending this letter, but before September 17, 1997, Costow received the allegedly fraudulent documents upon which Counts 2-8 are based.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cos-tow did not recall specifically how he got these documents \u2014 whether by mail or personal delivery \u2014 but testified that he was \u201cpositive they were submitted by Mr. Abraham.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>U.S. Magistrate Judge Joel B. Rosen conducted a two day jury trial. On July 31, 2002, Abraham was convicted on all eight counts. He was sentenced on December 10, 2002 to two years probation on each count, to run concurrently, with six months home confinement and a $2,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Abraham appealed his convictions to the District Court, arguing that the evidence was insufficient as to Counts 2-8.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court affirmed by order dated July 2, 2003, finding that \u201cthe evidence really comes close to being overwhelming here.\u201d Abraham appeals that order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Our standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence is plenary, <em>United States v. Taftsiou, </em>144 F.3d 287, 290 (3d Cir.1998), and the parameters of that review are well established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">We review the \u201csufficiency of the evidence ... in a light most favorable to the Government following a jury verdict in its favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Antico, </em>275 F.3d 245, 260 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942)). \u2018We must sustain the verdict if there is substantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, to uphold the jury\u2019s decision.... We do not weigh evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses in making this determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Beckett, </em>208 F.3d 140, 151 (3d Cir.2000) (citations omitted). In making our review we examine the totality of the evidence, both direct and circumstantial. <em>See Antico, </em>275 F.3d at 260. We must credit all available inferences in favor of tic government. <em>See United States v. Riddick, </em>156 F.3d 505, 509 (3d Cir.1998).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9fb\"><em>United States v. Gambone, </em>314 F.3d 163, 169-170 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 67, 157 L.Ed.2d 31 (2003); <em>see also United States v. Hart, </em>273 F.3d 363, 371 (3d Cir.2001). This standard \u201c \u2018places a very heavy burden on [the] appellant,\u201d\u2019 <em>United States v. Dent, </em>149 F.3d 180, 187 (3d Cir.1998) (citing <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>918 F.2d 1129, 1132 (3d Cir.1990)), one that Abraham has surely failed to satisfy.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7207 makes it unlawful for any person to \u201cwillfully deliver[ ] or diselose[ ] to the Secretary [of the Treasury] any list, return, account, statement, or other document, known by him to be fraudulent or to be false as to any material matter.\u201d Abraham argues that because Costow does not remember exactly how he received the fraudulent documents underlying Counts 2-8, the evidence of the first element of the offense \u2014 that he delivered or disclosed these documents to the IRS\u2014 is entirely circumstantial, and therefore insufficient to support an inference of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">Wholly aside from the fact that the circumstantial evidence which Abraham concedes establishes this element of the offense is accorded the same weight as direct evidence, Abraham overstates the government\u2019s burden and understates the strength of the case against him. When evaluating an insufficiency of the evidence claim, we \u201cmust sustain a jury\u2019s verdict if \u2018a reasonable jury believing the government\u2019s evidence could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the government proved all the elements of the offenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rosario, </em>118 F.3d 160, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>163 (3d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Salmon, </em>944 F.2d 1106, 1113 (3d Cir.1991)). There can be no doubt that the government\u2019s evidence meets this burden. Costow testified that he was \u201cpositive\u201d the documents came from Abraham. This testimony alone, if credible (which, for purposes of our review, we must assume), satisfies the delivery/disclosure element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Moreover, there is no explanation even suggested as to why anyone other than Abraham \u2014 who was subject to an IRS audit at the time, and who was asked by Costow to provide these very documents\u2014 would have had a motive to send to Costow fraudulent documents to support false claims on Abraham\u2019s tax return. A reasonable jury, even if it questioned whether Costow was, indeed, \u201cpositive\u201d about the documents\u2019 source, was surely entitled to draw a reasonable inference that Abraham sent the documents to Costow.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s July 2, 2003 order affirming Abraham\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-11\">. The documents are: a letter from the Camden County Board of Social Services stating that four of Abraham's claimed dependents were not receiving financial assistance from the agency; two documents from the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\u201d) stating that two of Abraham's claimed dependents were not receiving SSA benefits; pediatric vaccine records for two of Abraham\u2019s claimed dependents; a letter from the City of Camden Police Department indicating various required uniform and police gear; and a letter from a church to which Abraham purportedly made charitable contributions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-9\">. Abraham does not appeal his conviction on Count 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\">. The Magistrate Judge had subject matter jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636. The District Court had jurisdiction to review the Magistrate Judge' decision under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402. We have jurisdiction to review the District Court's order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
