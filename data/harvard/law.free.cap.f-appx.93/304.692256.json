This took his ease out of the heartland, he argued, because most illegal reentry cases involve immigrants looking to resume living in the United States indefinitely. The district court rejected that as an impermissible ground for departure, a decision we review <em>de novo. See United States v. Abreu-Cabrera, </em>64 F.3d 67, 74 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">We agree with the district court. Regardless of whether a departure based on the motive of the returning alien is ever permissible as a matter of law, <em>see United States v. Leiva-Deras, </em>359 F.3d 183, 191 (2d Cir.2004), we have previously held that no departure was warranted where the defendant \u201ccontended that he had reentered this country <em>with the intention of returning to his native country ... </em>after visiting his ailing father,\u201d <em>United States v. Carrasco, </em>313 F.3d 750, 753 (2d Cir.2002) (emphasis added). Although we recognize that Carrasco involved a motion for departure based on the \u201clesser harm\u201d provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.11 and \u201cexceptional family circumstances\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, we think the same rationale applies here. \u201c[W]e have no doubt that [\u00a7] 1326 is designed to deter deported aliens from illegally reentering for <em>any </em>reason.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755 (emphasis added). \u201c[A] deported alien reentering the country illegally,\u201d even without the intent to remain, \u201chas done the essence of what the statute is intended to prohibit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756. The facts of Parchment\u2019s case, which are on all fours with <em>Carrasco, </em>do not put him outside the heartland of the Sentencing Guidelines. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
