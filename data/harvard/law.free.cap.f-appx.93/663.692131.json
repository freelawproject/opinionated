Rodriguez was sentenced to 77 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to convict him because <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), rendered 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (b)(2) unconstitutional. Rodriguez concedes that this argument is foreclosed and raises it only to preserve possible Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, Rodriguez\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">Rodriguez also contends that the district court erred by increasing his offense level by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) (2002). Rodriguez argues that his two prior New Jersey state convictions for third-degree burglary do not qualify as crimes of violence. Because Rodriguez did not raise this issue before the district court, it is reviewable only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-15\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) provides for a 16-level increase when a defendant was previously deported after a conviction for a crime of violence. Burglary of a dwelling is one of the offenses specifically enumerated as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under this section. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(ii)(II)). In determining whether an offense meets the definition of a crime of violence, we do not look to the facts underlying the offense. Rather, we examine only the elements of the offense. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>323 F.3d 317, 318-19 (5th Cir.2003). One approach, if a statute contains disjunctive elements, is to look to the charging instrument. <em>See United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>339 F.3d 320, 327-29 (5th Cir.2003), <em>modified, </em>357 F.3d 320, 327-29 (5th Cir.2004), <em>vacated for rehearing en banc, </em>362 F.3d 293 (5th Cir.2004). That methodolo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>gy, however, would not change the result here, as we will explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Even if, <em>arguendo, </em>we were to look to the charging instruments or judgments of conviction, it is not clear, from those documents, that Rodriguez\u2019s prior convictions were for burglary of a dwelling, so the district court clearly erred in applying the 16-level enhancement for prior conviction of a crime of violence. Structure is defined as \u201cany building, room, ship, vessel, car, vehicle or airplane, and also means any place adapted for overnight accommodation of persons, or for carrying on business therein, whether or not a person is actually present.\u201d N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:18-1 (1997). Thus, the language of the statute encompasses a broader range of conduct than that which is enumerated as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, and we must examine the charging instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Rodriguez was indicted for \u201cunlawfully enter[ing] the structure of Ricardo Cruz at 78 Deerfield Road, with the purpose to commit an offense therein.\u201d Given the broad definition of \u201cstructure\u201d under New Jersey law, the indictment does not clearly refer to a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">With respect to the second burglary offense, Rodriguez waived indictment and agreed to be charged on the accusation that he committed burglary. The charging instrument did not contain any specific facts indicating that the burglary involved a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Because it is not clear from the charging instruments or judgments of conviction that Rodriguez\u2019s prior convictions were for burglary of a dwelling, the district court clearly erred in applying the 16-level enhancement for prior conviction of a crime of violence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Rodriguez\u2019s substantial rights were affected because this increased the applicable guidelines sentencing range, and he has established plain error. <em>See United States v. Alarcon, </em>261 F.3d 416, 423 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, we <em>vacate </em>his sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b688-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
