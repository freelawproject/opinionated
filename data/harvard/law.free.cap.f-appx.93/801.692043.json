Clumm, an Ohio prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals a district court judgment dismissing his civil rights complaint filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-17\">On April 2, 2003, Clumm filed a complaint against Ross County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas Judge William J. Corzine; Ross County, Ohio, Court of Common Pleas Clerk Susan R. Allyn; and the following officials employed by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (ODRC): Director Reginald A. Wilkinson, Sergeant J. Boysel, Administrative Assistant Tim Oyer, Lieutenant H.D. Miller, and the \u201cPublication Review Screening Committee.\u201d Clumm alleged that Boysel seized \u201cas contraband\u201d material that he possessed in excess of the permitted property limit. Clumm alleged that Boysel seized his property in retaliation for his \u201clegal activities in order to cause him to relinguish [sic ] his right of access to the courts for redress of his grievances and the civil and criminal wrongs done him.\u201d Clumm also alleged that ODRC officials withheld a magazine that was sent to him in the mail \u201cbecause page 66 had monster tokens for a game.\u201d According to Clumm, he was subsequently informed that he could not have the magazine in question, but he was not provided with a written decision to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-20\">Clumm alleged that on August 23, 2002, he \u201cattempted to file criminal affidavits\u201d in a state court proceeding, but the affidavits were returned to him because they did not bear a case number. Clumm returned the affidavits \u201cwith a second praecipe which stated that they should be filed pursuant to both Criminal Rule 2 and O.R.C. 2935.09 along with a civil rule 2 complaint.\u201d Allyn filed Clumm\u2019s affidavits as a civil action and, as a result, funds were subsequently deducted from his prison account to pay the filing fee for that action. Clumm alleged that he contacted Corzine and requested return of his funds, but no action was taken. Clumm sought monetary relief from the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>A magistrate judge filed a report recommending dismissal of the complaint. Over Clumm\u2019s objections, the district court dismissed Clumm\u2019s complaint against Wilkinson, Corzine, and Allyn for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A and 1915(e), and dismissed, without prejudice, Clumm\u2019s complaint against Boysel, Oyer, and Miller for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Clumm\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied. Clumm has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s judgment dismissing a suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under \u00a7\u00a7 1915A and 1915(e). <em>Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 867 (6th Cir.2000). We also review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a suit for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies under \u00a7 1997e(a). <em>Curry v. Scott, </em>249 F.3d 493, 503 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Clumm\u2019s complaint. With respect to Wilkinson, the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because it was based upon a respondeat superior theory of liability. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>Street v. Corr. Corp. of Am., </em>102 F.3d 810, 817-18 (6th Cir.1996). With respect to Corzine, the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because Clumm\u2019s claim against Corzine for monetary damages is barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity. <em>See Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 355-56, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). With respect to Allyn, the complaint faded to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because non-judicial officers are immune from damages for the performance of quasi-judicial duties. <em>See Bush v. Rauch, </em>38 F.3d 842, 847-48 (6th Cir.1994); <em>Foster v. Walsh, </em>864 F.2d 416, 417-18 (6th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Clumm\u2019s complaint against Boysel, Oyer, and Miller was subject to dismissal without prejudice because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his claims against them. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Brown v. Toombs, </em>139 F.3d 1102, 1104 (6th Cir.1998). Clumm\u2019s complaint did not discuss exhaustion, state that exhaustion occurred, or provide any documentary evidence in support of an attempt to administratively exhaust his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
