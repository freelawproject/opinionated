He also moves to amend his petition to include his spouse, Emma, and two older children, Luis and Laura. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the motion, and deny the petition for review in part, and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-19\">Because Moreno-Estrada\u2019s intent to include his spouse and two of his children in his petition was sufficiently clear from the inclusion of their alien numbers in the caption, we grant the motion to amend the petition to include Emma Moreno Martinez, Luis Alfaro Moreno Martinez, and Laura Moreno Martinez. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(2), (4). The Clerk shall amend the docket to reflect the addition of these individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-20\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance without an opinion was inconsistent with due process is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 848-49 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-21\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act favors certain aliens over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>others and therefore violates equal protection similarly fails because the Act \u201ceasily satisfies the rational basis test.\u201d <em>See Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 603 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Severo Moreno-Estrada and Emma Moreno Martinez also contend that the IJ erred in concluding that they failed to demonstrate \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). We cannot consider this contention because we lack jurisdiction over this discretionary determination. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 888 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Because Luis Alfaro Moreno Martinez and Laura Moreno Martinez failed to raise an issue, make a contention or argument, or seek relief, we deny their petitions. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a); <em>see also Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The Clerk is directed to stay the mandate pending the resolution of <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 03-70477, and further order of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part, DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b188-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
