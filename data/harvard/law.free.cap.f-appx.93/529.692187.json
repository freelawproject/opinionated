This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 136 (4th Cir.2001). Where, as here, the motion is based on an allegation of insufficient evidence, the verdict must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the government, to support it. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>256 F.3d 231, 250 (4th Cir.2001). \u201c[S]ubstantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>establish that the firearm traveled in interstate commerce, violating \u00a7 924(c), and that Clark possessed a stolen firearm, violating \u00a7 9220\"). <em>See Glasser, </em>315 U.S. at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Clark also contends that in sentencing him as an armed career criminal, the court erroneously included a 1981 conviction for burglary. However, this court has held that there is no temporal restriction on prior felonies for the purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>United States v. Presley, </em>52 F.3d 64, 69-70 (4th Cir.1995). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court properly considered Clark\u2019s 1981 burglary conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Clark\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented .in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
