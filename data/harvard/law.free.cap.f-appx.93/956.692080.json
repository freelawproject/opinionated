Smith appeals his sentence, arguing that it is plainly unreasonable in light of the eight- to fourteen-month guideline range recommended by the relevant non-binding policy statement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. Because the district court properly considered the relevant sentencing factors, the sentence is not plainly unreasonable, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">In May 1997 Smith pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and was sentenced to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release. In May 1999 the district court granted the government\u2019s motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 (permitting government to seek sentence reduction due to defendant\u2019s substantial assistance following sentencing), and reduced Smith\u2019s imprisonment to 95 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-16\">Smith began serving his term of supervised release on February 7, 2003, and began accruing violations almost immediately. On February 10 Smith tested positive for marijuana, in violation of the standard condition of supervised release prohibiting him from possessing a controlled substance. On February 15 he was arrested for driving without a license, operating an uninsured motor vehicle, and speeding. When Smith pleaded guilty to the charges, he admitted to violating the standard condition prohibiting him from committing another federal, state, or local crime. On March 12 and 13, he again tested positive for marijuana. On April 20, Smith was arrested again, this time for operating an uninsured motor vehicle, speeding, fleeing the scene of an accident, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>and failing to reduce speed; the charges were still pending at the time of the revocation hearing. On May 12, Smith was unsuccessfully terminated from a drug treatment facility, in violation of the special condition requiring him to participate in the program. Finally, Smith violated several standard conditions when he failed to report his arrests or to answer truthfully on monthly reports submitted to his probation officer. The government moved to revoke Smith\u2019s supervised release on May 13, and at the revocation hearing Smith admitted to all of the above violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">At the revocation hearing the district court noted that, because Smith\u2019s use of marijuana constituted a Grade B violation and he had a criminal history category of III, the recommended guideline range was eight to fourteen months. The judge also confirmed that the maximum statutory sentence was sixty months. The government recommended a twelve-month sentence, while Smith requested eight months. Instead the judge imposed forty months\u2019 imprisonment and twenty months\u2019 supervised release, reasoning that he had previously reduced Smith\u2019s sentence from 135 to 95 months and now he was \u201cbasically taking back the sentence reduction\u201d because Smith had violated the terms of his supervised release \u201con numerous occasions.\u201d The judge noted that it was his policy to \u201ctake back\u201d Rule 35 reductions when a defendant has violated his conditions of supervised release:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-5\">Well, you screwed up because I\u2019m taking that Rule 35 back. And you can spread the word that\u2019s my policy. If I give someone a sentence reduction break and if they get out and they start messing up, and you\u2019ve messed up not once, not twice, not three times, not four times, not five. I mean big time you messed up. In your own mind they are all little things, but when you put everything together, you have no intentions of living a lawful life in this society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">The judge explained that the sentence was necessary to make Smith understand that under supervised release he could not continue to \u201cgo willy-nilly living where you want to live, doing what you want to do.\u201d Instead, the judge noted, Smith needed to learn to \u201cgrow up[,] ... follow the rules of society,\u201d and start \u201ctaking things seriously.\u201d After announcing the sentence, the judge asked both attorneys whether they had \u201canything else\u201d to add; Smith\u2019s attorney asked the court to recommend a particular facility to the Bureau of Prisons but did not object to the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">Smith argues on appeal that the sentence he received was \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d because it was based on the judge\u2019s \u2018policy\u2019 rather than on the facts of his case. Smith admits that the sentencing ranges in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4 are advisory rather than mandatory and are \u201csubject only to the statutory maximum terms of imprisonment provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3),\u201d and he does not dispute that the sentence was within the statutory maximum. He acknowledges, too, that the application notes expressly state that an \u201cupward departure may be warranted\" where the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cthe result of a downward departure (e.g., as a reward for substantial assistance).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, comment. (n.4). Smith contends, however, that even though the district court had the authority to impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum, the court erred by imposing that sentence without first conducting \u201can individualized assessment of the facts of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">We will reverse the sentence imposed for a supervised release revocation only if it is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See </em>United States v. Harvey, 232 F.3d 585, 587 (7th Cir.2000). To determine whether a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>tence within the statutory maximum is \u201cplainly unreasonable,\u201d we examine whether the sentencing court considered the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. McClanahan, </em>136 F.3d 1146, 1151 (7th Cir.1998). But while we have \u201cmade it clear\u201d that a sentencing court \u201cis required to consider\u201d the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we have also stated that we will not vacate a sentence simply because the sentencing judge did not \u201cmake findings addressed to each of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, \u201cit is sufficient \u2018if the sentencing court made comments reflecting that the appropriate factors were considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hale, </em>107 F.3d 526, 530 (7th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">As the government correctly argues. Smith\u2019s sentence was not \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d because the judge properly analyzed the required sentencing factors. First, the judge considered the applicable policy statement when he determined that Smith\u2019s previous sentence reduction was a reason to depart upward from the sentencing range suggested by the guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5)(A). The judge also determined that the higher sentence was necessary to deter Smith from committing any future criminal conduct, explaining that Smith needed to learn how to Uve a \u201clawful life in this society.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). Further, the court informed Smith that it could sentence him to sixty months\u2019 imprisonment, a clear indication that the court considered the kinds of sentences available. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(3). Finally, the judge\u2019s statements that Smith needed to \u201cgrow up\u201d and learn to \u201cfollow the rules of society\u201d indicate that he considered the nature of the offense, the history of the defendant, and the need to \u201cpromote respect for the law.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision to sentence Smith to forty months\u2019 imprisonment and twenty months\u2019 supervised release was not \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Doss, </em>79 F.3d 76, 79 (7th Cir.1996) (finding sentence \u201cnot even close to being plainly unreasonable\u201d where judge imposed maximum sentence after articulating only \u201chis concerns\u201d about the defendant and \u201cthe need to imprison him for a longer period than set out in the policy statement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">Smith argues that, even if the district court properly considered the relevant sentencing factors, its decision was still plainly unreasonable because the court was driven not by its consideration of these factors but by its \u201cpolicy\u201d of \u201ctaking back\u201d Rule 35 reductions when determining a sentence for supervised release revocation. Simply put, Smith misunderstands the relevant law. The statute directs a judge to consider the pertinent policy statements, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5), and the application notes explaining the relevant policy statement provides that a judge can consider a previous sentence reduction when sentencing a defendant for a supervised release revocation, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a), comment, (n.4). Thus, the district judge likely could have met the requirements of \u00a7 3553(a) simply by sentencing Smith to the forty months\u2019 imprisonment previously deducted from his sentence without further explanation. Since the judge also considered the need to deter Smith from committing future criminal conduct and to teach him to respect the law, there is little question that the sentence he imposed was not \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
