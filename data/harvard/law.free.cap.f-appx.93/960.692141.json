The Immigration and Naturalization Service charged Boyarintsev with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) as an alien without proper documents. Boyarintsev conceded removability and applied for asylum, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a), and withholding of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1241(b)(3), claiming that he was persecuted by former communists in Ukraine because of his pro-democracy political beliefs and status as a successful restaurant entrepreneur. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>immigration judge denied both of Boyarintsev\u2019s applications and he appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Boyarintsev now petitions pro se for review of the BIA\u2019s order. We deny his petition and affirm the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">At his asylum hearing, Boyarintsev testified that he and his wife operated a caf\u00e9 in Donetsk, Ukraine, called \u201cIndiana.\u201d Indiana was a \u201ccountry and western\u201d caf\u00e9 decorated with symbols of Americana. Boyarintsev says that soon after he opened Indiana, he was targeted for \u201cpersecution\u201d by Donetsk\u2019s deputy mayor, Rosochanko Alexandr. Alexandr and his men went to Boyarintsev\u2019s caf\u00e9 numerous times and demanded money. On two of these occasions they beat up Boyarintsev, and on another visit beat up some his patrons. Often Alexandr and his men would stop by, order food and drink, and refuse to pay. Boyarintsev eventually had to close Indiana after one of Alexandria men hit Boyarintsev\u2019s wife with a car and injured her so severely that she had to spend several weeks in the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Boyarintsev said he was also persecuted \u2014 at Alexandria direction \u2014 by \u201cSibirtsev,\u201d whom Boyarintsev characterized as a \u201cdeputy prosecutor\u201d in Donetsk\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Transportation.\u201d According to Boyarintsev, Sibirtsev twice brought him to his office, threatened him, and beat him up. On the first occasion, Sibirtsev demanded that Boyarintsev buy him a color television, and the second time \u2014 after Boyarintsev closed Indiana \u2014 Sibirtsev demanded that Boyarintsev give him the keys to the caf\u00e9 so he could \u201crob the place.\u201d Sibirtsev warned Boyarintsev that if he didn\u2019t comply he would accuse Boyarintsev of stealing some \u201cmetal\u201d and have him arrested. Boyarintsev says that he didn\u2019t give into Sirbirtsev\u2019s demands, and instead fled Ukraine after this last incident. Boyarintsev now fears that, if he returns, Sirbirtsev will find him and kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">Boyarintsev said that Alexandr\u2019s \u201cpersecution\u201d of him started when Alexandr was a communist party leader at the plant where Boyarintsev worked when Ukraine was a communist state in the former Soviet Union. Boyarintsev said that he was the only person at the plant who did not belong to the communist party, and once, after he \u201cexpressed [his] opposition\u201d to Alexandr at a plant meeting, Alexandr had Boyarintsev attacked and beaten by \u201ca militia.\u201d The experience left Boyarintsev with the lasting impression that Alexandr \u201chated [his] guts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">After recounting his experiences, Boyarintsev tried to explain how this earlier \u201copposition\u201d of Alexandr and the communist party led to Alexandr and Sibirtsev\u2019s \u201cpersecution\u201d of him several years later, after he opened Indiana. Boyarintsev said that Alexandr from the outset opposed his opening Indiana, and later singled him out for \u201cpersecution,\u201d both because of his anticommunist stance during the communist era and because his caf\u00e9 symbolized pro-democratic ideals. But Boyarintsev acknowledged that Alexandr extorted money from all business owners in Donetsk, and that Alexandr may have targeted Indiana especially because he thought Boyarintsev had rich American relatives who helped finance and decorate the caf\u00e9 with its Americana motif.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">The IJ denied Boyarintsev\u2019s application for asylum because he failed to establish that he suffered from past persecution or that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his political opinion. The IJ found Boyarintsev credible for the most part, and that his fear of persecution was subjective and genuine and perhaps even objectively reasonable. But the IJ found that Boyarintsev\u2019s persecutors were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>not motivated by his political opinion. Instead, the IJ found Boyarintsev\u2019s persecution was the result of \u201ccriminal extortion efforts,\u201d and Boyarintsev failed to tie \u201cany of these beatings or threats to any political opinion that he possesses or may possess.\u201d The IJ then denied Boyarintsev\u2019s application for withholding of removal because of the higher burden of proof required under that claim, and ordered him removed to Ukraine.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Boyarintsev then appealed to the BIA and argued, in part, that the IJ erred because he failed to consider that Boyarintsev was persecuted on account of an imputed political opinion. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7), and so we review directly the decision of the IJ, <em>see Georgis v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 962, 967 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">In his petition for review, Boyarintev repeats the argument that he made to the BIA \u2014 that the IJ erred because he failed to consider that Boyarintsev was persecuted on account of a political opinion imputed to him by his persecutors. Boyarintsev contends that Alexandr and Sibirtsev persecuted him not for their own economic gain \u2014 as the IJ found-but instead because they viewed him as an American-styled capitalist whose open endorsement of the American way of life threatened their tightly held communist beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">We assume, as did the IJ, that Boyarintsev suffered persecution in Ukraine. But to warrant asylum, Boyarintsev still must establish that he was persecuted or faces future persecution because of his own political opinion, <em>see Dandan v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 567, 572-73 (7th Cir.2003), or (as he wants his claim evaluated) because of a political opinion attributed or imputed to him by his persecutor, <em>Lwin v. INS, </em>144 F.3d 505, 509 (7th Cir.1998). In either case, he must introduce some evidence that his persecutor was motivated to persecute him <em>because of </em>a political belief the persecutor thought that he held. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (\u201c[T]he statute makes motive critical....\u201d); <em>Cuevas v. INS, </em>43 F.3d 1167, 1171 (7th Cir.1995); <em>Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 865 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Canas-Segovia v. INS, </em>970 F.2d 599, 601-02 (9th Cir.1992); <em>In re T-M-B, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 775 (BIA 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">Thus Boyarintsev\u2019s tenuous asylum claim rests entirely on his ability to show that Alexandr extorted money from him because of his political beliefs. But Boyarintsev cannot point to any evidence to suggest that political beliefs, rather than the prospect of personal economic gain, motivated Alexandr to extort money from him. Indeed, Boyarintsev stated that Alexandr regularly extorted money from all of Donetsk\u2019s business, and that if he targeted Boyarintsev especially it was likely because Indiana was successful, and because he thought Boyarintsev had wealthy American relatives. Ultimately all that Boyarintsev can show is that Alexandria attacks may have stemmed from personal disputes dating back to Boyarintsev\u2019s former employment at the factory. And \u201ca personal dispute, no matter how nasty, cannot support an alien\u2019s claim of asylum.\u201d <em>Marquez v. INS, </em>105 F.3d 374, 380 (7th Cir.1997). Thus Boyarintsev gave the IJ no reason to infer that Alexandr \u201cpersecuted\u201d him on account of his political beliefs, imputed or otherwise. <em>Estrada-Posadas v. INS, </em>924 F.2d 916, 919 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">Boyarintsev\u2019s claim that he was persecuted on account of an imputed political opinion is further undermined by the State Department\u2019s Country Reports for Ukraine, which cast doubt on the likelihood that former communist party members in current government positions will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>persecute individuals who opposed Ukraine\u2019s former communist regime. U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, Ukraine - Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (2000); <em>see also Bereza v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 468, 474 (7th Cir.1997) (citing State Department advisory opinion concluding that supporters of Ukranian independence movement not likely to face persecution from former communist officials still in power); <em>Koliada v. INS, </em>259 F.3d 482, 488 (6th Cir.2001) (same). Without specific evidence from Boyarintsev that the situation in Donetsk is any different than in Ukraine generally, we accept the State Department reports as conclusive. <em>Toptchev v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 714, 722 (7th Cir.2002); <em>Roman v. INS, </em>233 F.3d 1027, 1036 (7th Cir.2000). Thus substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Boyarintsev\u2019s application for asylum as well as withholding of removal, a claim which requires a higher burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Boyarintsev makes a number of other arguments that he did not present to the BIA. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider these arguments, including Boyarintsev\u2019s contention that his interpreter did not accurately translate his answers at the hearing. <em>Capric v. Ashcroft, </em>355 F.3d 1075, 1087-88 (7th Cir.2004); <em>Awad v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 336, 340 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">The petition for review is DENIED and the decision of the BIA is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
