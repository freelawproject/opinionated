On appeal, he challenges the constitutionality of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e), as it is applied to him. Specifically, Shull asserts that, in connection with a prior conviction in South Carolina for burglary, he was ordered to participate in a substance abuse treatment program. However, no programs were available that could accommodate Shull\u2019s handicap and his medical conditions. Therefore, the court removed this condition from his sentence. Shull argues that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>because he did not receive the treatment and rehabilitation, sentencing him as an armed career criminal violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Finding no error in the application of this provision to Shull, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The Armed Career Criminal Act mandates a fifteen-year minimum sentence for a defendant who violates 922(g) and has three prior convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense committed on different occasions. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e). Congress intended this Act to impose harsher penalties, and thereby \u201c \u2018incapacitate particular repeat offenders, who it found were responsible for a large proportion of crimes involving theft and violence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Presley, </em>52 F.3d 64, 68 (4th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>811 F.2d 210, 216 (3d Cir.1987) (citing to legislative history of predecessor to the Armed Career Criminal Act)).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Shull had five convictions in North Carolina for breaking and entering, which were committed on different occasions. These offenses alone qualify Shull for sentencing as an armed career criminal. Shull subsequently was convicted of the burglary offenses for which he was initially directed to participate in drug treatment, but, due to the inability of the facilities to accommodate his disabilities, this condition was eliminated from his sentence. Disregarding these burglary offenses, Shull would still meet the definition of an armed career criminal due to his North Carolina breaking and entering convictions. Thus, we find that his argument that the justice system failed him by not providing treatment after his sixth and seventh convictions does not take him outside the definition of an armed career criminal as a repeat offender. Rather, he is precisely the type of offender for whom Congress intended the mandatory minimum sentence expressed in \u00a7 924(e). Notably, there is no requirement that a defendant participate in a treatment program prior to being sentenced as an armed career criminal. <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Shull\u2019s sentence. <em>See generally Presley, </em>52 F.3d at 68 (rejecting argument that \u00a7 924(e) violates the Equal Protection Clause). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
