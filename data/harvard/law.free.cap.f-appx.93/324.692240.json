Ross, <em>District Judge) </em>dismissing his amended complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). On appeal, Luo does not challenge the district court order dismissing his amended complaint; rather, he contends that the district court erred by denying his earlier motion for entry of a default judgment against defendant-appellee City of New York (\u201cCity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Because the \u201cextreme sanction of a default judgment must remain a weapon of last, rather than first, resort,\u201d <em>Meehan v. Snow, </em>652 F.2d 274, 277 (2d Cir.1981), we agree with the City that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to grant a default judgment in favor of Luo.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Moreover, because Luo does not raise any arguments targeted at the district court\u2019s dismissal of his amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, we treat the appeal of the dismissal order as abandoned. <em>See Cruz v. Gomez, </em>202 F.3d 593, 596 n. 3 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201cWhen a litigant \u2014 including a <em>pro se </em>litigant \u2014 raises an issue before the district court but does not raise it on appeal, the issue is abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">We have carefully considered all of Luo\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
