He was sentenced to ninety-six months imprisonment and assessed a $4550 fine. He appeals the imposition of the fine, contending that the district court failed to make proper factual findings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Section 3572(a) establishes factors to be considered by the district court when deciding whether to impose a fine. In determining the imposition and amount of a fine under \u00a7 3572(a), the district court \u201cshall\u201d consider, among other things, the income, financial resources, and earning capacity of the defendant. Although \u00a7 3572(a) does not require a sentencing court to make specific findings with regard to the listed factors, we have required lower courts to do so. <em>United States v. Bruchey, </em>810 F.2d 456, 459 (4th Cir.1987) (regarding restitution).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> However, a district court may satisfy these requirements if it adopts a defendant\u2019s presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) that contains adequate factual findings to allow effective appellate review of the fine or restitution. <em>See United States v. Gresham, </em>964 F.2d 1426, 1430-31 (4th Cir.1992) (affirming $80,200 fine when PSR indicated that defendant would be employable after release from prison).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Here, the district court did not make any specific factual findings and, instead, adopted the findings and calculations of the PSR. However, the PSR contained detailed information about Lashua\u2019s employment history, educational background, financial status, family relationships, and mental illness. In addition, it was Lashua\u2019s burden to prove that he was unable to pay a fine. <em>See United States v. Hyppolite, </em>65 F.3d 1151, 1159 (4th Cir.1995); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(a) (2002) (fine is mandatory unless defendant establishes inability to pay). While Lashua argued that his mental illness prevented him from holding a steady job, he provided no supporting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">We find that the PSR\u2019s factual determinations and calculations adequately show that Lashua would be able to pay the fine if he obtains a minimum wage job. Since employment is a requirement of his supervised release, and since Lashua failed to produce any evidence supporting his contentions that he was unable to work, we find no error in the conclusion that Lashua could pay the fine imposed. Accordingly, we affirm the imposition of the fine. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b606-6\"> The analysis in fine and restitution cases is the same. See <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>885 F.2d 181, 182-83 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
