Iacono\u2019s counsel has filed a motion to withdraw and a brief in support of that motion pursuant to the decision in <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). For the following reasons, we will affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">On March 11, 2002, Leonard Iacono pled guilty to (1) being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); and (2) possessing a firearm as an unlawful user of controlled substances, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3). Iacono\u2019s presentence report calculated a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of V, which corresponded to a sentencing range of 70-87 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-18\">In accordance with a plea agreement between Iacono and the government, the government recommended to the District Court that it impose a sentence at the bottom end of the guideline range. The government also filed a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, based on Iacono\u2019s substantial assistance, asking the District Court to depart downward thirty percent from the low end of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-19\">The District Court granted the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure, but the Court did not \u201cnecessarily aecept[ ] the figures\u201d the government recommended. The Court decided that a downward departure of 24 months was appropriate and that the 24 months should be deducted from the sentence that it would have imposed absent the departure, which the Court decided was 84 months (\u201cthe middle to the higher end of the guideline range\u201d). Tr. 8, 10. The Court therefore sentenced Iacono to 60 months imprisonment. Iacono\u2019s judgment of sentence was entered in the docket on December 17, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-20\">On January 21, 2003, Iacono filed a <em>pro se </em>motion, which he denominated a \u201cMotion and Brief to File Notice of Appeal Nunc Pro Tunc.\u201d The motion requested \u201can order investing Defendant with his appellate rights,\u201d presumably because the ten day time for appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1) had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>expired. Supplem. App. 45. The District Court granted Iacono\u2019s motion on January 27, 2003, and Iacono filed a notice of appeal that same day. Supplem. App. 48-50. We will treat the District Court\u2019s order as an order extending the time to file a notice of appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(4). Iacono\u2019s appeal is therefore timely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Our role here is twofold-we must (1) determine whether counsel complied with Local Appellate Rule 109.2(a) and submitted an adequate brief; and (2) independently review the record for any nonfrivolous issues. <em>See United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001). Upon considering counsel\u2019s submission, we are satisfied that he has thoroughly scoured the record in search of appealable issues and explained why the issues are frivolous. <em>See United States v. </em>Marvin, 211 F.3d 778, 780 (3d Cir.2000). Consequently, counsel\u2019s brief guides our independent review of the record. <em>See Youla, </em>241 F.3d at 301. Since appellant has also submitted a brief <em>pro se, </em>appellant\u2019s brief will also guide our review. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 301 (where counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief is inadequate the Court is informed by issues raised in defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Counsel\u2019s brief notes that Iacono can only feasibly appeal from the District Court\u2019s discretionary decisions to (1) calculate his downward departure from the top end of the applicable guideline range, instead of the bottom end recommended by the government; and (2) only downwardly depart 24 months. Counsel is correct that both of these arguments are frivolous. We lack jurisdiction to review either determination. <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>251 F.3d 138, 145 (3d Cir.2001) (no jurisdiction to review the extent of a District Court\u2019s discretionary downward departure for substantial assistance); <em>United States v. Richmond, </em>120 F.3d 434, 436 (3d Cir.1997) (no jurisdiction to review for abuse of discretion in imposing a sentence within the guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">In his <em>pro se </em>brief, Iacono contends that his trial counsel never went over his presentence report with him and he was therefore unable to correct mistakes contained in the report. He also contends that his trial counsel misled him into pleading guilty to a crime that he was not guilty of. The record is insufficient for us to determine these claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, however, and they are therefore inappropriate for review on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Haywood, </em>155 F.3d 674, 678 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">For the reasons stated above, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\">. Despite his pending appeal, Iacono filed a motion with the District Court on March 24, 2003 seeking what he styled (1) a \"correction or reduction of sentence pursuant to\u201d Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b); and (2) a \"reduction of sentence\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. Supplem. App. 51. On May 6, 2003, the District Court denied Iacono's motion. Even if the District Court had jurisdiction to consider Iacono\u2019s motion despite his pending appeal, Iacono never filed an appeal from the District Court's May 6, 2003 order. Thus only Iacono's appeal from the judgment of sentence is properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
