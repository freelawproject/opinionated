Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 4112.02(A) and <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contractors, Inc., </em>49 Ohio St.3d <em>228, 551 </em>N.E.2d 981, 981-82 syllabus para. 2 (Ohio 1990). Because there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Yellow Freight regarded Collins as disabled, we AFFIRM the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">On September 22, 1997, Plaintiff John Collins filed a complaint against Defendant Yellow Freight System, Inc. (\u201cYellow\u201d) in the Ohio Court of Common Pleas. In his complaint, Collins alleged that Yellow refused to return him to work because of his handicap or perceived handicap.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in violation of Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 4112.02 and Ohio public policy. Yellow removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-19\">On October 15, 2001, after the completion of discovery, Yellow filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment on July 22, 2002. The court found that there was no genuine issue of material fact that Collins had sought or been considered for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>other position other than the dockworker position which he had formerly held. The court further found that there was no genuine issue of material fact that Yellow had regarded Collins as disabled in refusing to re-employ him as a dockworker, noting that there was no evidence that any employee with decisionmaking authority had regarded him as substantially limited in his ability to perform a major life activity, namely, working. The court also ruled that there was no genuine issue of material fact that Collins was qualified to be a dockworker. Specifically, the court found that it was undisputed that Collins could not meet the lifting requirements for the job. Since he was not objectively qualified to perform the job (and he had not sought a reasonable accommodation), summary judgment was proper on this independent ground. The court dismissed Collins\u2019 public policy claim as derivative of his statutory disabEty discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">\n<em>Substantive Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">CoEns was hired as a dockworker at Yellow in 1983 while he was on a lay-off from his employment at General Electric (\u201cGE\u201d). After completing his time as a \u201ccasual\u201d employee, CoEns was hired as a full-time dockworker, working primarily on the mght shift. In 1985, Collins was recalled to his m\u00e9chame position at GE. From 1985 to 1990, Collins worked full-time at both Yellow and GE, for a total of 80 hours per week. Collms worked various positions at GE, including electro-mechanic, heavy helper and electrical tester; all of these positions require strenuous liftmg or other physical activity, mcludmg Collins\u2019 current position as a winder.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">In December of 1989, Collins injured himself at Yellow while attempting to lift a 200-pound wooden box. Collins felt a pull in his lower back and immeEately reported his injury to his supervisor. He missed several days of work and then continued working until March of 1990, when his physician, Dr. Bhupindar Sawhny, indicated that Collms could not work. Yellow accepted Collins\u2019 injury as a workers\u2019 compensation claim and began paying him temporary total disability benefits. Yellow paid Collms these benefits from March of 1990 through December of 1990, all the while Collms was working at GE. In April of 1991, the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation awarded CoEns wage loss benefits on the ground that he could no longer work two full-time positions; the wage loss benefits were retroactive to March of 1990, but offset by the temporary total benefits he had received to date. The Bureau\u2019s determination was based on the October 10,1990, meEcal report of Dr. Sawhny, which indicated that CoEns had \u201ca congenitally narrow lumbar canal,\u201d specifically, \u201cspinal stenosis at the L-4/5 level.\u201d The report also indicated that Collins was not currently prescribed any medications or therapy and that he had \u201creached maximum medical improvement,\u201d but that he \u201cshould not return to work which involved liftmg more than 100 pounds repeatedly.\u201d (J.A. 89-99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">In April of 1992, the Bureau terminated Collins\u2019 wage loss benefits on the ground that Collins had not sought employment within his physical capabilities following his release for return to work on October 10, 1990. Thereafter, CoEns did not seek re-employment with Yellow.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">In June of 1992, Dr. Sawhny indicated in response to a letter from Collins\u2019 attorneys that Collins\u2019 back condition would not preclude performance of more than one job on a regular basis. CoEns subsequently was evaluated by Yellow\u2019s physician, Dr. Bruce Feldman, in 1994. Dr. Feldman concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-10\">The claimant\u2019s [Collins\u2019] back condition as it relates to the allowed claim\u2019s condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>tion does not render him unable to seek employment for a second full-time job in order to mitigate the loss of income suffered as a result of being unable to return to work as a dock worker at Yellow Freight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-5\">Moreover, the claimant\u2019s back condition as it relates to the allowed claim\u2019s condition would not have prevented the claimant from returning to a second full-time job following his employment termination with Yellow Freight in March 1990.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-7\">As far as restrictions for the work activities of the claimant, again relating to the allowed claim\u2019s condition, since the claim-related condition is resolved, there would be no restrictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-8\">Based solely on the claim\u2019s allowed condition and AMA guidelines the claimant has a 0% permanent partial impairment of the body as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Despite Dr. Feldman\u2019s opinion, Collins never sought employment or attempted to return to work at Yellow at that time. Instead, Collins filed another workers\u2019 compensation claim for \u201caggravation of pre-existing spinal stenosis,\u201d relying on Dr. Sawhny\u2019s 1990 report. That claim was denied on August 11, 1995, and Collins\u2019 administrative appeal of that denial was rejected a few weeks later. Collins then filed an appeal in Ohio state court, but following a jury trial, Yellow again proved victorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">After Collins exhausted his workers\u2019 compensation remedies, Collins\u2019 attorney sent a letter to Yellow\u2019s attorney on July 11,1996, requesting that Collins be permitted to return to work based on Dr. Feldman\u2019s 1994 report. Yellow\u2019s attorney responded that Collins\u2019 return to work was predicated upon his meeting the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement, the National Master Freight Agreement. The letter from Yellow\u2019s attorney failed to indicate the terms and conditions with which Collins needed to comply, but did direct Collins to his union representative for any questions. Collins\u2019 attorney sought clarification from Yellow\u2019s attorney on September 25, 1996, but there is no evidence in the record regarding how or even whether Yellow responded. Evidently, it was Yellow\u2019s position that the National Master Freight Agreement required Collins to be cleared by Yellow\u2019s doctor before he could return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">On July 2, 1997, Collins showed up at the Yellow Freight Terminal with a \u201cDisability \u2014 Release for Work/Sehool\u201d slip signed by his physician, Dr. Paul Steurer. The form did not list any work restrictions, but also did not identify a specific position that Collins was released to perform; it just indicated that Collins had Dr. Steurer\u2019s \u201cpermission to return to work/school.\u201d According to Collins\u2019 affidavit, he and Yellow perceived Dr. Steurer\u2019s release as a release to return to full duty work \u201cas a dock worker.\u201d Yellow did not permit Collins to work that day and sent him home. The next day, Yellow\u2019s Injury Counselor, Vie Pallotta, sent a letter to Collins noting that he had not worked for Yellow for several years and stating that before Collins could return to work he must first submit all of his medical records to Dr. Dean Erickson for his review and then complete a medical examination. The record indicates that Dr. Erickson already had these medical records in his possession because he had conducted a medical evaluation of Collins on May 20,1997 related to a back injury he had sustained with GE. Consequently, Collins did not forward anything to Dr. Erickson.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Collins then filed a grievance contending that Yellow incorrectly had refused to allow him to return to work when presented with the full work release from Dr. Steur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>er. Employer and union representatives deadlocked over the grievance, so, pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, a hearing was held before a Joint Area Committee on September 8, 1997. A September 17, 1997, letter sent to Collins from a union representative stated that the Committee had concluded, \u201cUpon successfully completing a physical examination by a Yellow Freight chosen Doctor, Mr. Collins shall be returned to work.\u201d (J.A. 121.) After some confusion about whether Collins received notice of the Committee\u2019s decision, Collins eventually was examined by Dr. Erickson and participated in a Functional Capacity Examination with Nova-Care on November 24,1997. Based on his examination and the results of the Functional Capacity Examination, Dr. Erickson concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-4\">The functional capacity evaluation indicated that Mr. Collins was capable of a Department of Labor medium category of work. This is equivalent to occasional lifting and carrying to 50 pounds, frequent lifting and carrying to 20 pounds and 10 pounds constantly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-6\">1) Mr. Collins is not capable of returning to work as a Yellow Freight Systems dock worker on an unrestricted basis....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-7\">2) Consistent with his history and examination and objective functional testing, Mr. Collins is capable of a medium level of work with the aforementioned 50 pound lifting, frequent 20 pound lifting and carrying.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">(J.A. 126.) Collins\u2019 physician, Dr. Steurer, reviewed Dr. Erickson\u2019s findings and concurred on January 30,1998, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-10\">I have approved the comprehensive evaluation and physical capacity assessment that were done on John Collins. I have no reason to disagree with this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-11\">The report certainly is thorough and complete and I would concur that he is able to go back to work within those restrictions as outlined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">(J.A. 131.) Based on the undisputed medical findings that Collins could not return to work as a dockworker without restrictions, Collins\u2019 union withdrew his grievance because the collective bargaining agreement afforded Collins the right to return to work only if he did not have any work, restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">The Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and affirms such a judgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Cotter v. Ajilon Serv., Inc., </em>287 F.3d 593, 597 (6th Cir.2002). \u201cThe Court should believe the evidence presented by the nonmovant, and draw all justifiable inferences in his favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Plant v. Morton Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>212 F.3d 929, 933-34 (6th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">B. Statutory Disability Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b882-17\">Ohio law makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a person with respect to hiring or other terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of disability. Ohio. Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 4112.02(A). A \u201cdisability\u201d means (1) \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, including the functions of caring for one\u2019s self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working\u201d; (2) \u201ca record of a physical or mental impairment\u201d; or (3) \u201cbeing regarded as having a physical or mental impairment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4112.01(A)(13). Ohio courts look to judicial interpretations of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) when interpreting Ohio\u2019s statutory prohibitions against disability discrimination. <em>See City of Columbus Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n v. McGlone, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 569, 697 N.E.2d 204, 206 (Ohio 1998) (noting similarity of Ohio law to the ADA).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Collins does not contest Yellow\u2019s interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that, assuming Collins could not perform the dockworker job without restrictions, he was not entitled to return to work as a dockworker. He does not allege that he requested and/or was denied a reasonable accommodation. Instead, Collins argues (1) that he could perform the dockworker job without restrictions and (2) that the true reason Yellow refused to permit him to return to work was because Yellow perceived that he was disabled. There is no factual basis to support either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">1. There is no genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Collins could perform the duties of a dockworker without restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">According to Yellow\u2019s job description for the dockworker position, dated January 28, 1992, an essential function of the position includes being able to lift and carry boxes that weigh between 60 and 75 pounds and some boxes that weigh more than 80 pounds. The job description states that the dockworker must be able to manually lift and carry boxes that weigh as much as 75 pounds for 8 to 20 minutes, two times or more per hour. The undisputed medical evidence shows that Collins was capable of lifting and carrying up to 20 pounds frequently and up to ten pounds constantly, far less than the 60 to 75 pound range specified by the job description. Thus, Collins could not perform an essential function of the dockworker position.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">Collins argues that the lifting and carrying requirement from the job description is not an essential function of the dockworker position. As support, he points to the facts that (1) he was not aware of the written job description until this litigation; (2) two Yellow employees testified that they either were not aware of a written job description or could not testify as to the essential functions of the dockworker position; and (3) neither the collective bargaining agreement nor Yellow\u2019s interrogatory responses mention any weight restrictions. These facts do not create a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Yellow fabricated the essential functions of the dockworker position.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Whether or not Collins and/or other employees were aware of a written document setting out the job\u2019s essential functions in no way contradicts the existence of the essential functions. Other than his eonclusory denial of the weight-lifting restriction, Collins has cited to no affirmative evidence (such as specific testimony from dockworkers or language in the collective bargaining agreement concerning weight-lifting requirements) that actually <em>contradicts </em>the specific weight-lifting requirements set forth in the written job description. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(n)(l) (noting that courts should consider the following factors, among others, to determine whether a job function is essential: the employer\u2019s judgment about what functions are essential; written job descriptions; the amount of time spent on the job performing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>function; the consequences of not requiring the performance of the function; the terms of a collective bargaining agreement; and the experience of people who have performed the job or similar jobs).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Moreover, Collins\u2019 interrogatories never asked Yellow to describe the \u201cessential functions\u201d of the dockworker position, but rather, the \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d of the position. (J.A. 272.) Yellow\u2019s response states that a dockworker is required to move freight and to manually lift and carry boxes and odd-shaped freight. The fact that this brief description of general duties does not specify the amount of weight to be lifted and carried does not raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Yellow concocted the specific, minimum weight-lifting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Finally, although Collins argues that Dr. Erickson was not aware of the dockworker job\u2019s essential functions when he concluded that Collins could not perform the dockworker position, he has not presented any testimony from Dr. Erickson or anyone else that proves this argument. To the contrary, it is undisputed that Dr. Erickson was provided with the written description of the job prior to his evaluation. In addition, Dr. Erickson sent staff to Yellow\u2019s facility to personally observe the job functions first-hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">2. There is no genuine issue of material fact that Yellow regarded Collins as disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Collins does not argue that he has a disability as defined by the Ohio Revised Code. Rather, he argues that Yellow refused to permit him to return to work because Yellow purportedly regarded him as disabled. When an individual proceeds under a \u201cregarded as\u201d theory, the Court \u201cmust look to the state of mind of the employer against whom he makes a claim.\u201d <em>Ross v. Campbell Soup Co., </em>237 F.3d 701, 706 (6th Cir.2001). According to the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-9\">There are two apparent ways in which individuals may fall within this statutory definition: (1) a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. In both cases, it is necessary that a covered entity entertain misperceptions about the individual \u2014 it must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one . does not have or that one has a substantially limiting impairment when, in fact, the impairment is not so limiting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-10\"><em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, </em>527 U.S. 471, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999). When, as here, the plaintiff claims that working is the relevant major life activity, he must create a genuine issue of material fact that the employer mistakenly thought that his impairment \u201cprevent[ed] him from performing a broad class of jobs.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>237 F.3d at 709. <em>See also McGlone, </em>697 N.E.2d at 207 (holding that vision impairment was not tantamount to a \u201chandicap\u201d under predecessor to Oh. Rev.Code. \u00a7 4112.01(A)(13) because the plaintiffs inability to work as a firefighter did not disqualify him from a broad class of jobs or a wide range of jobs; further holding that the plaintiff was not perceived to be disabled because the defendant did not perceive the plaintiffs impairment as \u201cforeclosing him from a class of jobs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">There is no evidence in the record that Collins is substantially limited in his ability to work in a broad range of manual labor jobs for which he is qualified. <em>Cf. Burns v. Coca-Cola Enters. Inc., </em>222 F.3d 247, 253-54 (6th Cir.2000) (holding that an individual may be disabled by a lifting resfrie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>tion of 23 pounds, by being substantially limited in the major life activity of working, if that restriction prevented him from performing \u201cmedium to heavy lifting and other forms of manual labor,\u201d and those jobs constituted the majority of the jobs for which that plaintiff is suited based on his age, education and experience). To the contrary, the evidence suggests that, notwithstanding his back impairment, Collins can perform a broad range of jobs that require manual labor, including his jobs at GE as electro-mechanic, heavy helper and electrical tester; all of these positions require strenuous lifting or other physical activity, including Collins\u2019 current position as a winder.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">To be sure, since Collins has brought a \u201cregarded as\u201d claim, the issue is not what Collins actually can do, but what Yellow <em>perceives </em>he can do. But there is no evidence that Yellow mistakenly perceived Collins as unable to work in broad range of jobs. At the time Yellow refused to let Collins return to work, Yellow knew that Collins was working at GE in a job that required strenuous manual labor. Thus, there is no basis in the record to infer that Yellow inaccurately perceived Collins as unable to work in any job that required manual labor. <em>See Murphy v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>527 U.S. 516, 525, 119 S.Ct. 2133, 144 L.Ed.2d 484 (1999) (affirming summary judgment for employer on \u201cregarded as\u201d claim; \u201cin light of petitioner\u2019s skills and the array of jobs available to petitioner utilizing those skills, petitioner has failed to show that he is regarded as unable to perform a class of jobs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The mere fact that Yellow may have mistakenly regarded Collins as unable to work two jobs is not tantamount to a perception that Collins was substantially limited in the major life activity of working. <em>Cf. Cotter, </em>287 F.3d at 599 (\u201cWe have held that an inability to work overtime is not a substantial limitation on the ability to work.\u201d) (citations omitted). At most, Yellow perceived Collins as incapable of manually lifting and carrying boxes that weigh as much as 75 pounds for 8 to 20 minutes, two times or more per hour. <em>See Henderson v. Ardco, Inc., </em>247 F.3d 645, 651 (6th Cir.2001) (distinguishing situation in which employee with back injury is perceived as unable to perform any \u201cjob in the plant\u201d from a situation in which the employee is perceived as incapable of performing the narrow task of lifting between 30 and 70 pounds; noting that the latter situation does not involve a perceived disability). Such facts are insufficient to support a \u201cregarded as\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">The only other \u201cevidence\u201d of alleged disability bias to which Collins points concerns Yellow\u2019s purported refusal to allow Collins to participate in its modified work program. Article 14, \u00a7 2 of the applicable collective bargaining agreement provided that Yellow could establish a modified work program for employees who were unable to perform their normal work assignments due to a disabling on-the-job injury. Yellow was obligated to offer a temporary modified assignment only to employees who were \u201ctemporarily\u201d disabled due to a compensable worker\u2019s compensation injury. Employees who, according to professional medical opinion, may never be expected to receive an unrestricted medical release, were not eligible to participate in a modified work program. When asked at deposition about the modified work program, two Yellow employees. Vic Pallotta and Joel Campbell, speculated that Collins would not have been eligible for the program because the long-term nature of his medical condition tended to demonstrate that it was permanent and because there was no evidence that his long-term medical condition (spinal steno-sis) was work-related. Consistently, Collins testified that he would not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>eligible for the program because his injury was not work-related. As a result, he never asked to participate in the program. Thus, Yellow\u2019s modified work program is irrelevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Collins nevertheless argues that Pallotta\u2019s deposition testimony about the modified work program provides direct evidence that Yellow perceived him to be disabled. \u201cIn discrimination cases, direct evidence is that evidence which, if believed, requires the conclusion that unlawful discrimination was at least a motivating factor in the employer\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Jacklyn v. Schering-Plough Healthcare Prods. Sales Corp., </em>176 F.3d 921, 926 (6th Cir.1999). At deposition, Collins\u2019 attorney asked Pallotta a series of questions about why Collins had not been permitted to return to work. Pallotta testified that he had had no input into the decision not to permit Collins to return to work on an unrestricted basis. He further testified that whether Collins was eligible to return to work on a restricted basis under the modified work program would have been determined by Yellow employees in Kansas City, not in Cleveland where Collins sought to work. Collins\u2019 attorney then asked Pallotta about his \u201cunderstanding\u201d about why Collins was deemed ineligible for modified work. In response, Pallotta stated that it was his \u201cunderstanding\u201d that someone with a \u201cpermanent disability\u201d is not eligible for the modified work program and that \u201cit was [perjceived by Yellow Freight that Mr. Collins\u2019 disability was permanent and thus he was not eligible for the transitional work program.\u201d (J.A. 92-94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Pallotta\u2019s testimony is not competent direct or circumstantial evidence that Yellow perceived Collins to be disabled. Taken in context, the testimony represents Pallotta\u2019s opinion that Collins had been denied modified work because his physical condition that precluded him from working without restriction was permanent in nature. Pallotta was not opining as to whether Collins suffered from a disability, but as to the duration of Collins\u2019 physical condition for purposes of qualifying for the modified work program. Regardless, because Pallotta was not involved in the decision to deny Collins modified work, and he did not even identify a specific employee who had been involved, Pallotta\u2019s opinion as to Yellow\u2019s intent lacked foundation and therefore was inadmissible speculation. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (\u201c... opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge ...\u201d); Fed.R.Evid. 701 (providing that lay testimony is limited to those opinions or inferences which are \u201crationally based on the perception of the witness\u201d). Moreover, Yellow\u2019s alleged perception that Collins had a permanent back impairment that made him ineligible for modified work is not equivalent to a perception that Collins had a permanent back impairment that substantially limited his ability to perform a major life activity. As noted above, there is no direct or circumstantial evidence that Yellow perceived Collins as unable to perform the major life activity of working. Accordingly, Pallotta\u2019s testimony is not evidence that Yellow perceived Collins to be disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">At most, the evidence shows that Yellow perceived that Collins had a back impairment that rendered him \u201cincapable of satisfying the singular demands\u201d of the dockworker position, the only position that Collins ever sought with Yellow. <em>Kocsis v. Multi-Care Management, Inc., </em>97 F.3d 876, 885 (6th Cir.1996) (quotation marks and citation omitted). This evidence is insufficient to withstand a summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">C. Common Law Disability Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">It is not clear whether Collins was ever discharged, since the posture of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>case is more like a refusal to hire. Thus, it is unclear whether Collins can bring a claim pursuant to <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contractors, Inc., </em>49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981, 981-82 syllabus para. 2 (Ohio 1990), which permits claims for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Because the parties have not raised the issue, the Court assumes, <em>arguendo, </em>that <em>Greeley </em>applies outside of the wrongful discharge context. In any event, since there is no genuine issue of material fact that Collins was disabled or regarded as disabled, his public policy wrongful discharge claim must fail. <em>See Plant, </em>212 F.3d at 939-40 (affirming summary judgment on <em>Greeley </em>claim premised on public policy against disability discrimination because there was no genuine issue of material fact that the plaintiff was disabled under the ADA). In addition, Collins cannot maintain a <em>Greeley </em>claim because the terms of his employment were governed by a collective bargaining agreement. <em>Haynes v. Zoological Soc. of Cincinnati, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 254, 652 N.E.2d 948, 951 (Ohio 1995) (holding that <em>Greeley </em>does not apply to individuals who are not at-will employees, such as persons covered by a collective bargaining agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">To conclude, there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Yellow regarded Collins as disabled when it refused to re-employ him as a dockworker. At most, the evidence shows that Yellow regarded Collins as having an impairment that rendered him unqualified for the specific job of dockworker. The district court also correctly dismissed Collins\u2019 public policy claim as duplicative of his statutory disability discrimination claim. In addition, the claim was properly dismissed because Collins was not an at-will employee. For these reasons, the Court AFFIRMS the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Yellow Freight Systems.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-11\">. Ohio law recently changed the terminology from handicap to disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b882-9\">. According to Yellow\u2019s job description for the dockworker position, dated January 28, 1992, an essential function of the position is being able to lift and carry boxes that weigh between 60 and 75 pounds and some boxes that weigh more than 80 pounds. The job description states that the dockworker must be able to manually lift and carry boxes that weigh as much as 75 pounds for 8 to 20 minutes, two times or more per hour.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
