On December 28, 1999, the district court granted Johnson\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on two of the counts, which alleged firearms offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) and (c). The government thereafter appealed the district court\u2019s judgment of acquittal on the count arising under Section 924(c), which charged Johnson with using, possessing, and carrying a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. On April 29, 2002, we reinstated Johnson\u2019s conviction under that count. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>39 Fed.Appx. 114, 2002 WL 818229 (6th Cir.2002). Johnson now asks this court to reconsider its prior holding and reinstate the district court\u2019s judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Johnson urges us to reconsider our earlier ruling in order \u201cto prevent a manifest injustice.\u201d to wit, sentencing him to an additional 30 years over his sentences for the substantive drug count, possession with intent to distribute marijuana, and the additional count of possession of a firearm that had been converted to a machine gun. Under the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine, a court should not reopen issues decided at an earlier point in the same litigation. <em>Agostini v. Felton, </em>521 U.S. 203, 236, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391 (1997). \u201cIssues decided at an earlier stage of the litigation, either explicitly or by necessary inference from the disposition, constitute the law of the case.\u201d <em>Hanover Ins. Co. v. American Eng\u2019g Co., </em>105 F.3d 306, 312 (6th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). There are, however, three extraordinary circumstances under which courts will reconsider a prior ruling in the same case: \u201c(1) where substantially different evidence is raised on subsequent trial; (2) where a subsequent contrary view of the law is decided by the controlling authority; or (3) where a decision is clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>None of these conditions is present in this ease. There has been no new evidence presented; there is no subsequent contrary view of law decided by binding authority; and our prior decision is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">Johnson\u2019s contention that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction under 924(c) was specifically rejected in our prior opinion. As we stated then: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>39 Fed.Appx. at 121. Sufficient evidence was presented to sustain Johnson\u2019s conviction under Section 924(c). Because Johnson has failed to prove that this case falls into one of the narrow exceptions to the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine, we will not revisit his claim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>\u201cAll three of the firearms were loaded; one of these weapons had been successfully converted into a fully automatic pistol; [ ] Johnson was engaging in the possession and distribution of marijuana, as evidenced by his notebook logs and other drug paraphernalia; and finally, the firearms were located within arms\u2019 reach of the marijuana. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to sustain Johnson\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>Accordingly, we AFFIRM our prior judgment and the district court\u2019s re-sentencing in accordance with that judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
