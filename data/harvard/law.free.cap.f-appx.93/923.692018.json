Savinski believes that he is fit for release because he is no longer \u201csexually violent.\u201d See Wis. Stat. \u00a7 980.06. The state believes that he remains a danger, in part because (in Wisconsin\u2019s view) he obstinately refuses to confront and address other episodes of sexual misconduct, including a rape that the state believes Savinski perpetrated in 1978. Savinski\u2019s therapist has concluded that he is \u201cin denial\u201d about his past and his proclivities. According to Savinski, however, the reason he cannot take responsibility for these acts is that he did not commit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-24\">The most natural way to break this impasse would be for Savinski to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and demand that the state demonstrate an adequate basis for his civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>commitment. He has been unwilling to do so, however. Instead, Savinski commenced this proceeding under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, asking the district court for an injunction that would compel the state to remove from its files all references to the rape that he denies committing. The district court denied this request-properly so, as \u00a7 1983 is not the right remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Savinski\u2019s goal is release, which requires use of \u00a7 2254. See <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Although he contends that he does not want the court in this \u00a7 1983 action to order his release, the remedy he does seek is incompatible with the state\u2019s rationale for his continued confinement. That brings the \u00a7 1983 action within the scope of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Compare <em>Muhammad v. Close, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 1303, 158 L.Ed.2d 32 (2004), with <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). And if it should turn out that the remedy that Savinski seeks really would have no effect on his confinement-if the only thing at stake is the accuracy of statements in public records-then this claim is blocked by the principle of <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976), that the Constitution does not prevent the state from making defamatory allegations. In order to avoid <em>Paul, </em>Savinski must demonstrate a loss of liberty. See <em>Codd v. Velger, </em>429 U.S. 624, 97 S.Ct. 882, 51 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977). The only liberty potentially at issue is his custody (the statements do not affect his employment opportunities, because he has none while in custody); and a challenge to custody must be brought under \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
