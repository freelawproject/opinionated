Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Gottlieb began working for Bowl America in 1976, and she was promoted to manager of the company\u2019s Dranesville, Virginia bowling center in July 1996. In November 1996, Gottlieb injured her back at work; she reaggravated that injury in December 1997. Between December 1997 and August 1998, Gottlieb took extensive leave for her medical condition, working a reduced schedule or not at all. In August 1998, following an extended absence for surgery, Gottlieb returned to work as manager of Bowl America\u2019s Chantilly, Virginia bowling center.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">In October 1998, Gottlieb reinjured her back and informed Bowl America that she needed to take some time off. Bowl America granted this request but informed Gottlieb\u2019s attorney that the company would have to fill Gottlieb\u2019s position at the Chantilly center. However, Bowl America further informed Gottlieb\u2019s attorney that \u201c[a]s soon as Ms. [Gottlieb] is able to return to work, we will be prepared to meet with you to discuss an appropriate position and necessary accommodations for your client.\u201d J.A. 584-85. Gottlieb subsequently notified Bowl America that her doctor had authorized her to return to work on October 26, but she requested permission to take vacation time through November 8. Although Bowl America granted Gottlieb\u2019s request and paid her for her vacation time, Gottlieb never attempted to return to work at Bowl America. Gottlieb accepted a position with another company soon after completing her vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-16\">Gottlieb subsequently filed this action alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Bowl America (1) violated her rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), <em>see </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2601-54 (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2003); (2) discriminated against her in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA), <em>see </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12112 (West 1995); and (3) retaliated against her for reporting alleged sexual harassment by her supervisor, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e 3(a) (West 2003). Gotilieb later amended her complaint to allege violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), <em>see </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461 (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2003), in connection with unpaid benefits allegedly owed to her under Bowl America\u2019s employee benefit plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-17\">The district court granted summary judgment to Bowl America on Gottlieb\u2019s FMLA, ADA, and Title VII claims. The court held that Bowl America had met its obligations under the FMLA by allowing Gottlieb to take the leave she requested and by restoring her to an equivalent position upon her return to work in August 1998. Further, the court determined that Gottlieb was not terminated following her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>injury in October 1998 but instead abandoned her employment with Bowl America. The court also rejected Gottlieb\u2019s ADA claim because Bowl America provided her with every accommodation she requested and did not terminate her or otherwise discriminate against her. Lastly, the district court rejected Gottlieb\u2019s Title VII claim, finding that there was no evidence that Bowl America retaliated against her for complaining about sexual harassment by her supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Following a bench trial on Gottlieb\u2019s ERISA claims, the district court entered judgment in favor of Appellees on Gottlieb\u2019s claims relating to lack of notice and breach of fiduciary duty, finding that Appellees provided all required disclosures to Gottlieb and did not breach any duty in responding to her claim for benefits. After staying Gottlieb\u2019s claim for unpaid benefits pending her exhaustion of administrative remedies, the district court granted summary judgment to Appellees on that claim, concluding that Gottlieb was not entitled to benefits for the relevant years because she had not worked the minimum number of hours required for eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the applicable law, and having had the benefit of oral argument, we conclude that the district court correctly decided the issues before it. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. See <em>Akers v. Bowl America, Inc., </em>No. 00-1342-A (E.D.Va. June 12, 2001); <em>Akers v. Bowl America, Inc., </em>No. 00-1342-A (E.D.Va. July 3, 2001); <em>Akers v. Bowl America, Inc., </em>No. 00-1342-A (E.D.Va. Jan. 21, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-14\"> We refer to Bowl America and the employee benefit plans collectively as \"Appellees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
