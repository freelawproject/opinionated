After his initiation of this appeal, the district court certified to the Secretary of State that Wang is extraditable for the crimes charged in Hong Kong\u2019s request for extradition. The certificate of extraditability included an order that Wang remain, without bail, in the custody of the United States Marshal. The district court\u2019s post-certification denial of bail superseded the pre-hearing detention order, and stripped this case of any \u201clive\u201d issues and this court of any ability to grant effective relief. We lack jurisdiction and dismiss the appeal as moot. <em>Pub. Utils. Comm\u2019n v. Fed.
