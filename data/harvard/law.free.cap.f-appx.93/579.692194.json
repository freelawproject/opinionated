McKayhan pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2000), and possession of a firearm during and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>relation to a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000). He received a 78-month sentence and a consecutive 60-month sentence, respectively. The court also imposed a five-year term of supervised release. McKayhan was released on January 2, 2002. In April 2003, his probation officer filed a motion for revocation of McKayhan\u2019s supervised release. After holding a hearing, of the seven alleged violations, the district court found that McKayhan had violated six conditions of his supervised release. Stating that it had considered the Chapter Seven policy statements and the recommended guideline range of five to eleven months, the court revoked McKayhan\u2019s supervised release and imposed a 24-month sentence. We affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">On appeal, McKayhan argues that the sentence imposed was unreasonable under the facts of his case and in light of the policy statements set forth in <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4 (2002). He further maintains that the court failed to consider the relevant statutory factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) and to set forth its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We review an order imposing a sentence after revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). Chapter Seven of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual sets forth policy statements offering recommended sentencing ranges for revocation of probation and supervised release. Chapter Seven is advisory and non-binding. <em>Id. </em>at 642. However, the court should consider the policy statements before imposing sentence. <em>Id. </em>If the court has considered the relevant factors and the applicable policy statements, the court has the discretion to impose a sentence outside the ranges set forth in the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>Because the district court was presented with and explicitly considered the suggested sentencing range of USSG \u00a7 7B1.4, and McKayhan\u2019s sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (2000), we find no abuse of discretion in McKayhan\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">To the extent that McKayhan alleges that the court failed to consider the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and to explain its reasoning, this claim is reviewed for plain error as he did not raise it below. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Based on our review <em>of </em>the hearing transcript, we find that consideration of the sentencing factors was implicit in the court\u2019s imposition of the sentence. Nothing in the statute or in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the court to state on the record that it considered each of the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Moreover, although the Sixth Circuit has held that a district court should at least provide some explanation for imposing a sentence which exceeds the range recommended by USSG \u00a7 7B1.4,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> this court has never imposed such a requirement. <em>Davis, </em>53 F.3d at 642 (stating \u201c[a] court need not engage in ritualistic incantation in order to establish its consideration of a legal issue\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Velasquez, </em>136 F.3d 921, 924 (2d Cir.1998) (observing that district courts are not obligated \u201cto make specific findings with respect to any or all of the factors listed in ... \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\"> <em>United States v. McClellan, </em>164 F.3d 308, 310 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
