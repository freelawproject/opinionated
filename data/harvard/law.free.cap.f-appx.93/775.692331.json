The parties have expressly waived oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In February 2001, Jernigan pleaded guilty to distributing cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). During a sentencing hearing, the district court declined to apply a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm, and it sentenced Jernigan to concurrent terms of 151 months of imprisonment. On appeal, a panel of this court affirmed Jernigan\u2019s conviction, reversed the district court\u2019s decision not to apply the two-level enhancement, and remanded the case for re-sentencing. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>59 Fed.Appx. 647 (6th Cir.2003). During re-sentencing, the district court rejected Jernigan\u2019s argument that the court lacked jurisdiction to sentence him for distributing crack cocaine because it is not on the list of controlled substances. Jernigan expressly stated that he was challenging the district court\u2019s jurisdiction and not the validity of his indictment. The court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 151 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">On appeal, Jernigan reasserts his claim that the court lacked jurisdiction to sentence him for crack cocaine because it was not on the list of controlled substances. He essentially argues that crack cocaine is a \u201cnew\u201d drug, despite the presence of cocaine in crack cocaine, and that crack cocaine has never been added to the list of controlled substances. Hence, he maintains that the district court lacked jurisdiction to sentence him for distribution of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court had jurisdiction to sentence Jernigan for distribution of crack cocaine. Challenges to the jurisdiction of a federal court can be raised at any stage of the proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 535, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974). However, contrary to Jernigan\u2019s argument, crack cocaine is covered by Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(6), a controlled substance is defined as \u201ca drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V of part B of this subchapter.\u201d Schedule II lists \u201c[cjoca leaves ...; cocaine ...; or any compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any quantity of any of the substances referred to in this paragraph.\u201d <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812, Schedule 11(a)(4); <em>see also </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.12(b)(4) (listing in schedule II \u201c[c]oca leaves [ ] and any salt, compound, derivative or preparation of coca leaves (including cocaine ... and [its] salts, isomers, derivatives and salts of isomers and derivatives), and any salt, compound, derivative, or preparation thereof which is chemically equivalent or identical with any of these substances\u201d). Because cocaine base and crack cocaine are mixtures that contain cocaine and are derived from coca leaves, <em>see United States v. Canales, </em>91 F.3d 363, 366-69 (2d Cir.1996) (describing chemical composition of cocaine base and crack cocaine), these substances are encompassed by schedule II\u2019s definition. Several courts have held that crack cocaine is included within \u00a7 812(a)(4). <em>United States v. Manzueta, </em>167 F.3d 92, 93-94 (1st Cir.1999); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number><em>States v. Sloan, </em>97 F.3d 1378, 1381-82 (11th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Deisch, </em>20 F.3d 139, 149-52 (5th Cir.1994). Hence, the district court properly concluded that it had jurisdiction to sentence Jernigan for distributing crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
