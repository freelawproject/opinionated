However, \u00a7 1229b(d)(l) sets forth a stop-time provision, which provides that any period of continuous residence shall be \u201cdeemed to end\u201d when the alien commits an offense that renders him inadmissible or removable. <em>See also Barahona-Gomez v. Reno, </em>167 F.3d 1228, 1232 (9th Cir.1999), (recognizing that the continuous physical presence requirement ends upon the commission of a qualifying offense), <em>supplemented on other grounds by </em>236 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-17\">Martinez-Perez was convicted of grand theft in 1989. This conviction ended his period of continuous presence because it was a crime of moral turpitude that rendered Martinez-Perez inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l); <em>see also Rashtabadi v. I.N.S., </em>23 F.3d 1562, 1568 (9th Cir.1994) (recognizing grand theft as a crime of moral turpitude and an offense rendering the alien excludable); <em>see also Matter of Perez, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 689 (BIA1999) (holding that \u00a7 1229b(d)(l) did not have a retroactive effect when applied to petitioner\u2019s drug offense that occurred prior to the enactment of the IIRIRA). Martinez-Perez entered the United States in 1986 and committed grand theft in 1989. Therefore, he did not accrue the required seven years of continuous residence necessary for him to qualify for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-18\">Contrary to Martinez-Perez\u2019s contention, he did not begin to accrue time anew following his conviction. <em>Cf. Ram, v. I.N.S., </em>243 F.3d 510, 518 (9th Cir.2001) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>(holding in an analogous context that no \u201csecond period of continuous presence\u201d may begin following the service of an order to show cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b178-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
