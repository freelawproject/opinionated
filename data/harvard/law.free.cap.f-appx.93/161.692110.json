In the first, Chaman-Hurtado appeals the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) summary affirmance of an immigration judge\u2019s denial of his application for cancellation of removal. We lack jurisdiction to review Chaman-Hurtado\u2019s contention that the BIA incorrectly applied its streamlining regulations to his case. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 854 (9th Cir.2003). To the extent Chaman-Hurtado raises a constitutional challenge to the BIA\u2019s streamlining regulations, which we have jurisdiction to review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche, </em>350 F.3d at 851. Accordingly, we dismiss in part, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>deny in part this portion of the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Chaman-Hurtado also petitions pro se for review of a decision by the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d), Legalization Appeals Unit (\u201cLAU\u201d), dismissing his appeal from the INS\u2019s denial of his application for temporary residence status under the Special Agricultural Workers (\u201cSAW\u201d) program. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(e)(3)(A), we have jurisdiction to review Chaman-Hurtado\u2019s application for temporary residence in conjunction with our review of his final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We review Chaman-Hurtado\u2019s appeal from the LAU\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion and our review is \u201cbased solely upon the administrative record established at the time of the review by the appellate authority.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(e)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The INS did not fulfill its burden to disprove Chaman-Hurtado\u2019s evidence, which was sufficient to show ninety-nine man-days of employment for Manzano at Superior Farming Company (\u201cSFC\u201d) \u201cas a matter of just and reasonable inference,\u201d <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. 1160(b)(3)(B), when it failed to contact Manzano to clarify the discrepancy related to the remaining sixteen man-days Manzano claimed Chaman-Hurtado worked for him at SFC. For the foregoing reason, and because the INS and LAU incorrectly characterized SFC as Chaman-Hurtado\u2019s employer, disregarding Chaman-Hurtado\u2019s repeated assertions that Manzano was his employer, we hold that the LAU abused its discretion in denying Chaman-Hurtado\u2019s claim for SAW relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">We do not address Chaman-Hurtado\u2019s due process argument because we have already concluded that the LAU abused its discretion under the SAW statute. Accordingly, we reverse the LAU\u2019s decision and grant Chaman-Hurtado\u2019s application for temporary residence status under the SAW program.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW of the BIA decision DISMISSED in part, and DENIED in part. PETITION FOR REVIEW of the LAU decision GRANTED; SAW APPLICATION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b186-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
