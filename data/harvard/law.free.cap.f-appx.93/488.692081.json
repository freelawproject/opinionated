We find Jacobs\u2019s claims to be without merit and affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">First, even though the jury acquitted Jacobs of the conspiracy count, the District Court properly increased his sentence based on his significant involvement in the distribution of approximately 11 kilos of crack cocaine. <em>See United States v. Miele, </em>989 F.2d 659, 663 (3d Cir.1993). While we agree with the District Court that the proper standard for the District Court to use was \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d and not \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d <em>compare Miele, </em>989 F.2d 659, 663 fn. 3 with <em>United States v. Kikumura, </em>918 F.2d 1084, 1110-1111 (3d Cir.1990), we find that, under either standard, the District Court properly increased Jacobs\u2019s sentence. The Government provided ample evidence, including surveillance, cooperating witnesses, and physical evidence, that convincingly showed the Jacobs acted in cahoots with his brothers, Mark and Rasheed, to distribute over 11 kilos of crack cocaine. Not only did Jacobs help to sell crack to a government witness, but other witnesses testified that Jacobs was often seen dealing drugs on the corner with his brothers. Furthermore, other members of the conspiracy testified that the brothers worked as team. With such evidence in the record, we cannot find that the District Court was clearly erroneous in its sentencing. <em>See Mazzocchi Bus Co., Inc. v. C.I.R., </em>14 F.3d 923, 934 fn. 19 (3d Cir.1994). Thus, any error by the District Court in applying the proper standard was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Second, the District Court did not err in refusing to overturn Jacobs\u2019s firearms convictions. Viewed in \u201cthe light most favorable to the government,\u201d there was sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Frorup, </em>963 F.2d 41, 42 (3d Cir.1992). The jury could have believed that the firearm was in plain sight near the door of the house. The house was used to \u201ccook\u201d and store substantial quantities of crack. The jury could have believed that the firearm was kept near the door so that any of the drug dealers residing there could readily obtain and use it against rivals in the drug trade, law enforcement, or others. Thus, despite Jacobs\u2019s claim that the firearm was in the sole possession of his brother, Mark, a rational trier of fact could have found that Quadre Jacobs, as well as his brother, had constructive possession of the firearm. <em>See United States v. Demes, </em>941 F.2d 220, 223 (3d Cir.l991)(proximity of guns and drugs gives strong inference that the gun was used to further the drug crime); <em>United States v. Garth, </em>188 F.3d 99, 111-112 (3d Cir.l999)(defining constructive possession.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">For the above reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
