Windfelder appeals a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Kaufmann\u2019s Department Store. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Kaufmann\u2019s is a department store division of The May Department Stores Company, operating approximately 50 stores in the Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and West Virginia regions. Each year, store managers at Kaufmann\u2019s receive an overall performance rating on the following scale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-13\">1. \u201cOutstanding\u201d (\u201cO\u201d) \u2014 clearly superi- or performance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-14\">2. \u2018Very Good\u201d (\u2018V\u201d) \u2014 well above the expected performance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-15\">3. \u201cEffective\u201d (\u201cE\u201d) \u2014 expected level of performance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-16\">4. \u201cMarginal\u201d (\u201cM\u201d) \u2014 below expected level of performance; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-17\">5. \u201cUnacceptable\u201d (\u201cU\u201d) \u2014 well below expected results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-18\">These performance appraisals are based on individual ratings in sales, customer service, shortage, profits, and \u201cpeople development.\u201d Annual performance reviews also reflect specific accomplishments and missed opportunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-19\">Windfelder began working for Kaufmann\u2019s as an executive trainee in 1972. He worked as a store manager from 1980 to 1986 and as a Regional Vice President (RVP) from 1986 to 1993, when his position changed from RVP to store manager of the downtown Pittsburgh Kaufmann\u2019s store. As store manager from 1980 to 1986, Windfelder received three \u201cV,\u201d two \u201cE,\u201d and one \u201cM\u201d rating. While working as RVP from 1986 to 1993, he received one \u2018V,\u201d five \u201cE,\u201d and one \u201cM\u201d rating. He received two \u2018V\u201d and one \u201cE\u201d rating as the downtown Pittsburgh store manager from 1993 to 1995, and an \u201cO\u201d rating in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-20\">Windfelder claims Kaufmann\u2019s began to discriminate against him on the basis of his age in May 1997, after Rick Bennet became President of Kaufmann\u2019s. During an unannounced walk-through of the Pittsburgh store on May 23, 1997, Bennet remarked to Windfelder, \u201cit\u2019s good to see someone around here with less hair than me.\u201d Bennet then saw a sock display that was in disarray, learned that Windfelder had 25 years of service, and allegedly remarked, \u201c25 years and you let a table of socks look like that.\u201d RVP James McGowan conducted Windfelder\u2019s 1997 overall performance review and gave him a \u201cmar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>gmal\u201d rating.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In 1998, Kaufmann\u2019s rearranged its management structure so that Windfelder reported directly to McGowan. Windfelder claims his working relationship with McGowan began to deteriorate in Spring of 1998, when a May\u2019s official visited the downtown store and discovered some price signs on the displays that did not match the ticketed price on the merchandise. Upon hearing of this incident, McGowan allegedly became upset with Windfelder. In October 1998, McGowan performed a walk-through of the downtown store. As Windfelder accompanied him and limped due to a leg injury, McGowan allegedly said to him, \u201cHey, you\u2019re getting too old for this.\u201d Windfelder received \u201cmarginal\u201d ratings in his mid-year 1998 and 1998 reviews. McGowan noted on the reviews that Windfelder\u2019s communication with his staff was ineffective, he lacked leadership skills, and he did not develop his staff. In addition, Windfelder\u2019s management team stated that they thought Windfelder lacked communication skills, leadership skills, and the ability to develop the team.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In January 1999, Kaufmann\u2019s demoted Windfelder to manager of the Southern Park retail branch in Youngstown, Ohio. He received a \u201cmarginal\u201d mid-1999 review. Windfelder claims Kaufmann\u2019s set him up to fail, since he did not receive necessary assistance during busy shopping periods. Kaufmann\u2019s counters that Windfelder had difficulty keeping the store up to the required standards and that he failed to effectively lead his management team.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">On March 2, 2000, Windfelder\u2019s supervisor, RVP Mike Hubbell, gave him a \u201c90 Day Final Performance Warning\u201d which listed areas necessary for improvement. Windfelder requested additional information on the warning, but Hubbell did not respond. On April 5, 2000, Windfelder sent Hubbell a letter expressing concern that, due to \u201cevents in the last several years ... I wonder whether there may be some early exit strategy in the works for me, and I fear that my age may be a factor.\u201d Hubbell sent two final warnings dated April 12, 2000 and May 23, 2000, both detailing failings in Windfelder\u2019s performance. On June 14, 2000, Windfelder was terminated due to the recent \u201cmarginal\u201d appraisals because his \u201cleadership, communication, and [ability to] positively influenc[e] results\u201d remained deficient. Windfelder was 53 years old when he was terminated. He was replaced by a younger female, Ella Scales.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">On August 28, 2000, Windfelder filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC and on August 7, 2001 brought suit in federal court. In his suit, Windfelder contended that he was terminated by Kaufmann\u2019s in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, <em>et seq., </em>and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 951 <em>et seq. </em>Windfelder also brought an unlawful retaliation claim under the ADEA. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Kaufmann\u2019s, and Windfelder timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is ple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>nary. <em>Simpson v. Kay Jewelers, </em>142 F.3d 639, 643 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The ADEA prohibits employers from discriminating against individuals in hiring, termination, compensation, or conditions of employment on the basis of their age. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1). To survive a motion for summary judgment in an ADEA case, a plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 801, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Upon such a showing, the burden shifts to the employer to produce evidence of a legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for the adverse action. <em>Id. </em>at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817; <em>Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr &amp; Solis-Cohen, </em>983 F.2d 509, 522 (3d Cir.1992). The plaintiff then has the burden to provide sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to (1) reject the employer\u2019s nondiseriminatory explanation for its decision, or (2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating cause of the employee\u2019s discharge. <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Kaufmanris concedes for the purposes of this motion that Windfelder can show a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination. But it claims Windfelder\u2019s poor job performance led to his termination. The record provides ample testimonial and documentary evidence of Windfelder\u2019s marginal or dissatisfactory job performance. Because Kaufmanris has carried its burden of providing evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason for Windfelder\u2019s discharge, Windfelder must submit evidence from which a factfinder could reasonably believe Kaufmanris reasons for termination are a pretext for age discrimination, or Kaufmanris was motivated by a discriminatory animus. <em>Fuentes, </em>32 F.3d at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">Windfelder may show pretext by producing evidence of \u201cinconsistencies and implausibilities in [Kaufmanris] proffered reasons.\u201d <em>Josey v. John R. Hollingsworth Corp., </em>996 F.2d 632, 638 (3d Cir.1993). Kaufmanris reasons for Windfelder\u2019s demotion and termination were consistent, as it clearly documented and communicated to Windfelder the reasons for his \u201cmarginal\u201d reviews. Several members of Windfelder\u2019s management team further corroborated the poor evaluations with testimony that Windfelder was a poor communicator and ineffective leader. We hesitate to second-guess the process by which an employer evaluates an employee\u2019s performance, even when the appraisal involves subjective elements. <em>Healy v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>860 F.2d 1209, 1216 (3d Cir.1988). Windfelder cannot establish pretext by a mere drop in his performance evaluations from 1996 to 1997-99. <em>Ezold, </em>983 F.2d at 528. In summary, the evidence here does not support a finding of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">Furthermore, Windfelder has not shown that discrimination was more likely than not a cause for his demotion and termination. The only evidence of possible discrimination was McGowan\u2019s September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>1998 comment, \u2018You\u2019re getting too old for this.\u201d This comment carries little weight, since McGowan made the remark two years before Windfelder\u2019s termination and was not involved in the decisions to demote or terminate Windfelder. <em>See Ezold, </em>983 F.2d at 545 (\u201cStray remarks by non-decisionmakers or by decisionmakers unrelated to the decision process are rarely given great weight, particularly if they were made temporally remote from the date of decision.\u201d); <em>Keller v. Orix Credit Alliance, Inc., </em>130 F.3d 1101, 1112 (3d Cir.1997) (comment by company president \u201cyou\u2019re too old for this job\u201d did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that age was a determinative factor in employee\u2019s termination). Windfelder\u2019s claim cannot survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The ADEA forbids employers from discriminating against their employees for having made a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in an investigation, proceeding or litigation against the employer. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(d). To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show: (1) he was engaged in protected conduct; (2) he was discharged subsequent to such activity; and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the discharge. <em>Woodson v. Scott Paper Co., </em>109 F.3d 913, 920 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Windfelder claims the District Court erred in finding the alleged retaliation by Kaufmann\u2019s was not sufficient to survive summary judgment. Windfelder contends Kaufmann\u2019s terminated him in response to his April 5, 2000 letter to Hubbell, which stated, \u201cI fear that my age may be a factor.\u201d The District Court found that Windfelder\u2019s letter was merely a \u201cgeneral complaint of unfair treatment\u201d and was not protected conduct. <em>See Barber v. CSX Distribution Servs., Inc., </em>68 F.3d 694, 701-02 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Even assuming Windfelder\u2019s letter was protected activity under the ADEA, he has failed to establish a causal link between the letter and the termination. Windfelder had already received negative performance reviews for several years, and Kaufmann\u2019s had placed Windfelder on a 90 Day Final Warning one month before he sent the letter. After receiving the letter, Kaufmann\u2019s continued with the termination process by holding 30 and 60 day \u201ctouch base\u201d sessions in which they provided Windfelder interim performance benchmarks, with the clear understanding that he would be terminated if he did not satisfy those benchmarks. Kaufmann\u2019s fired him only after finding his job performance had not improved. There is no indication that the letter, as opposed to Windfelder\u2019s job performance, caused his termination two months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Employers are not obliged to suspend all previously planned or contemplated actions upon receiving a Title VII complaint or learning that a suit has been filed. <em>Clark County School Dist. v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 272, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001). Kaufmann\u2019s had already begun termination proceedings against Windfelder, and without other evidence of retaliation, it need not halt those proceedings simply because Windfelder wrote a letter alleging retaliation. A contrary holding might impede employers from permissible terminations and encourage employees aware of an impending termination to attempt to create their own \u201cseverance package.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Windfelder did not establish a <em>p\u00f1ma facie </em>case for retaliation, and the District Court properly granted Kaufmann\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\">. This review was based on the following performance issues, many of which Windfelder does not dispute: sock and towel displays table not up to visual and presentation standards; failure to mark shoes down to sale prices in a timely manner; messy \"wrap and pack\" area near the crystal area; failure to hold his staff accountable for maintaining the store; Ruby Selling Star Board in disrepair; and lack of effective communication with employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b378-8\">. The elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">(1) The plaintiff is a member of the protected class, i.e., at least 40 years of age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">(2) The plaintiff is qualified for the position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">(3) The plaintiff suffered an adverse employment decision; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-15\">(4) Non-members of the protected class were treated more favorably.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-17\"><em>Sempier v.
