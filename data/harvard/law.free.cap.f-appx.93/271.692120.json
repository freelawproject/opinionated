(\u201cBBVA\u201d) for lack of personal jurisdiction. In his complaint, Sanchez alleged that the defendants committed fraud in a 1992 action in the Southern District of New York by submitting a false declaration executed by Corona, and that the declaration secured the wrongful dismissal of that action on the ground <em>o\u00ed forum non conveniens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">On appeal, Sanchez claims that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, arguing that the facts he alleged in support of personal jurisdiction, including BBVA\u2019s extensive business contacts in Connecticut and his own heart attack in Connecticut upon the receipt of Corona\u2019s false declaration, sufficed to establish jurisdiction over the defendants. This Court reviews the district court\u2019s factual holdings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. See Mario Valente Collezioni, Ltd. v. Confezioni Semeraro Paolo, S.R.L., </em>264 F.3d 32, 36 (2d Cir.2001). For substantially the same reasons stated by the district court, we find that Sanchez\u2019s third amended complaint was properly dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction over BBVA and Corona.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">Sanchez also asserts that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing in order to allow him to present evidence supporting personal jurisdiction. No evidentiary hearing was required, however, because Sanchez failed, after extensive discovery, to satisfy even the more relaxed burden of alleging specific facts that, if credited by the trier of fact, would suffice to establish a <em>prima facie </em>showing of personal jurisdiction over the defendants. There is therefore no indication that, after an evidentiary hearing, he would be able to satisfy the elevated burden of proving jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Alitalia Airlines, S.p.A., </em>347 F.3d 448, 469-70 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">Sanchez\u2019s contention that his complaint also alleged claims for breach of contract, and that BBVA consequently is subject to personal jurisdiction in Connecticut on the basis of its various business and contractual contacts within the state, is also without merit. Sanchez\u2019s amended complaint does not allege that BBVA breached any contract. Moreover, even if the complaint could be construed as alleging such a claim, personal jurisdiction would still be lacking because Sanchez has failed to allege that the contract supposedly breached was made in Connecticut or was to be performed in Connecticut, as required under the applicable long-arm statute. <em>See </em>Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 33-929(0(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Finally, Sanchez challenges a number of the district court\u2019s discovery rulings. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s discovery rulings, including the denial of a motion to strike, for abuse of discretion. <em>See In Re Subpoena Issued to Dennis Friedman, </em>350 F.3d 65, 68 (2d Cir.2003). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying as moot Sanchez\u2019s motion to strike certain affidavits, as consideration of these affidavits was unnecessary in light of Sanchez\u2019s failure to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of jurisdiction. Nor did the district court err in denying Sanchez\u2019s objection to a telephonic deposition of Corona. The defendants made many attempts to accommodate Sanchez and address his concerns, yet he chose not to pursue the deposition. Sanchez\u2019s remaining arguments with respect to the court\u2019s discovery rulings are also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
