Gonzalez argues that the two felony convictions upon which the court relied to classify him as a career offender did not qualify as convictions under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), because the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services had issued certificates for both convictions that showed he had been \u201cdischarged\u201d and \u201crestored all [his] civil rights as provided by law.\u201d In support of this argument, Gonzalez analogizes his case to <em>United States v. Gallaher, </em>275 F.3d 784 (9th Cir.2001), where a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that (1) if a state had restored the defendant\u2019s civil rights with respect to a prior conviction by issuance of a certificate, and (2) the certificate did not expressly contain a restriction pertaining to firearms, the prior conviction may not be used as a predicate offense under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 924.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, even if this court were to agree with Gonzalez that <em>Gallagher </em>applies, Gonzalez\u2019s argument fails because both certificates on Gonzalez included the following disclaimer: \u201cThe issuance of this Certificate of Discharge does not restore to the above captioned individual his/her right to bear arms.\u201d We conclude that a state certificate which merely reinstates a former prisoner\u2019s civil rights does not prevent the conviction from being counted under section 4B1.1(a). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.2 n. 3, 4A1.2 n. 10. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-21\">. The Honorable Richard G. Kopf, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-15\">. Gonzalez's reliance on <em>United States v. Gallaher, </em>275 F.3d 784 (9th Cir.2001), is misplaced. In <em>Gallaher, </em>the defendant was convicted of being a felon in possession of ammunition. Moreover, the holding was based on the plain language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
