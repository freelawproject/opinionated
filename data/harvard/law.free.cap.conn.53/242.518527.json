It clearly does not create a trust, but is an authority to the widow to take $5,000 from the estate and use it for such benevolent purposes as she pleases. As the use of it can not be enforced by a court of equity, she takes it with only a moral obligation to use it as the testator requested. The matter is committed to her conscience and there it is left by the courts. <em>Robinson </em>v. Dusgate, 2 Vernon, 181; <em>Morice </em>v. <em>Bishop of </em>Durham, 9 Ves., 399; <em>Bardswell </em>v. <em>Bardswell, </em>9 Sim., 320; <em>Bull </em>v. Bull, 8 Conn., 48 ; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>19 id., 345; <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>21 id., 257. Even if the title does not thus vest in the widow as a legatee, yet the bequest will be sustained as a power of appointment and disposition over the fund. In <em>Wait </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>40 Conn., 9, the court say that \u201c it is familiar law that a testator may confer on executors and on others absolute power of appointment and disposition over his property.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-10\">2. The twelfth item of the will creates a valid trust. As to the provision directing the trustees to pay over one half the income to the New Haven Orphan Asylum, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>eighth to the Home for the Friendless, and one eighth to the Connecticut Humane Society, no criticism is anticipated. The testator \u201c directs \u201d his wife \u201c to permanently dispose of \u201d the other fourth \u201c for such charitable purposes as she may deem proper.\u201d It is not left to her discretion to dispose of this one quarter or not to dispose of it; she is \u201c directed \u201d to do it. Nor is she allowed to scatter it in private charity from year to year as the impulse of the moment directs; but her choice is to be made but once and for all time. She is to dispose of it \u201cpermanently,\u201d\u2014that is, to some institution or institutions of a \u201c permanent \u201d character; thus clearly and necessarily limiting the executrix-to a choice among public or corporate as distinguished from private and individual <em>cestuis que trust. </em>The character of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>is still further limited by the testator to those existing for \u201c charitable purposes.\u201d To such purposes only is the executrix allowed to dedicate the remaining one quarter of the fund. The proposition for which the complainant contends then appears to be this : That a testator may devote the income of a trust fund to public charitable purposes, and may direct his executor to nominate from that class of beneficiaries one or more permanent <em>cestuis que trust. </em>But the case of <em>Coit </em>v. Comstock, 51 Conn., 353, recently decided by this court, holds with careful precision and clearness that when the intention of the testator to create a public charity is clearly expressed, and a mode of selection from a definite class of beneficiaries is provided, the trust will be sustained. In this case it will be observed that the <em>administration </em>of the charity is not given to the testator\u2019s wife. She is but his authorized agent to elect a \u201c permanent \u201d institution existing for \u201c charitable purposes,\u201d to whom the income of the fund shall ever thereafter be paid by the trustees. The actual administration of the charity to the ultimate beneficiaries is conducted by such institution; and the wife\u2019s duty is once for all performed by a simple nomination. All the machinery of the trust is complete. The trustees are appointed and their duties defined; the fund is set apart, and the intention to dispose of it in support of some public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>charity clearly expressed. One thing only remains, to-wit: to nominate the specific public charity to which the fund should be applied. This the testator authorizes and directs his wife to do. And unless a court of equity will forbid her to exercise this power of nomination, the trust is valid, and has already been made effective by the nomination of the Hartford Hospital and the New Haven Hospital, to receive in equal shares the one fourth part of the income of the trust fund created by the twelfth item of the will.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-5\"><em>J. Halsey </em>and <em>A. Brandegee, </em>for George D. Bristol, the heir at law.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-6\">1. It is a settled principle of Connecticut law that a gift to charity will not be upheld unless\u20141st, the general objects of the charity are defined with reasonable certainty ; and, 2d, a mode is provided by which the particular beneficiaries of the trust may he ascertained. <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>6 Conn., 299; <em>Bull </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>8 id., 48; <em>Langdon </em>v. <em>Plymouth Congregational Society, </em>12 id., 114; <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>McCall's Devisees, </em>15 id., 277; <em>Am.

The Connecticut doctrine has- been recognized and adopted in the state of New York. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>33 N. York, 100; <em>Bascom </em>v. <em>Albertson, </em>34 id., 593; <em>Prichard </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>95 id., 79. The last case closely resembles the one now before the court. All the authorities agree that if the trust attempted to be created is so vague and indefinite as to be incapable of judicial administration, it is void. Perry on Trusts, \u00a7 729 ; <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>21 Conn., 270; <em>Adye </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>44 id., 67 ; <em>Crum </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>47 id., 603; and the cases above cited from the 33d, 34th and 95th N. Y. Reps.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-7\">2. The execution of the power of disposition by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>wife does not cure the radical defect in the will. This is precisely the course adopted in <em>Adye </em>v. Smith, 44 Conn., 61. The finding in that case shows \u201c that the executor was ready and desirous to dispose of the fund for certain benevolent purposes selected by him.\u201d But the court held that such a defect could \u201cnot be cured by <em>any action </em>on the part of the trustee, for the testator must for himself define the objects of his bounty, <em>and cannot delegate this power to </em>another.\u201d And at the close of the opinion: \u201c If such purpose had been specified in the will it would have been valid. But no action or statement on the part of the trustee can avail <em>in the least </em>to cure a radical defect in the will. It is the will of the testatrix, <em>not that of the trustee, </em>which is to stand or fall, and to use the language of Sir William Grant, in <em>Morice </em>v. <em>Bishop of Durham, </em>the question is not whether the trustee <em>may </em>apply the estate upon purposes strictly charitable, but whether he is <em>bound </em>so to apply it.\u201d So also in <em>Crum </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>47 Conn., 603, the court say\u2014 \u201c The will must be carried out as made if it is to be carried out at all.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-6\">3. The bequest in the eleventh item of \u201c such sum, not to exceed $5,000, to disburse to such worthy objects as she may deem proper,\u201d is, if possible, still more objectionable, on all the grounds above stated. It is not given to charity, nor even to benevolence. It is uncertain both as to amount and as to objects. It would not be sustained either in England or Massachusetts. All the authorities condemn it. The doctrine of <em>cy pres </em>has never been stretched to cover such an indefinite disposition as this. <em>Adye </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>44 Conn., 69; <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>111 Mass., 267, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-7\">4. The bequest in the twelfth item of the will being of portions of the income, and not of the <em>corpus </em>of the fund, if inoperative as to any portion, the whole bequest is void. The trust is entire, and cannot be enforced in part. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>33 N. York, 97 ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>23 Gratt., 21. The object of the trust is stated in the will to be \u201c to provide a permanent fund, with a perpetual income, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>which, income shall be paid the annual annuities hereinafter given and set forth.\u201d The estate is thus given to the trustees and their successors in perpetuity, to divide the income therefrom annually, and pay it over in the proportions named, an I to the institutions named, and for the purposes to be designated. If the disposition is void as to any of the portions, it cannot be divided among the other beneficiaries, for, by the terms of the bequest, they are only to receive aliquot portions of the whole income. If the bequest had been of aliquot portions of the fund, instead of the income, this difficulty would not arise. But as it is, the difficulty affects the entire trust for the reason stated, and for the reason that the fund is to be held in perpetuity, and the uses to which a portion of the income is to be applied are not within the provisions of the statute permitting a perpetuity. <em>Coit </em>v. Comstock, 51 Conn., 386. The bequest of the remaining quarter of the income, if void, does not fall into the residue. \u201c Residue means all of which no effectual disposition is made by the will, other than the residuary clause; but where the disposition itself fails, to the extent to which it fails, the will is inoperative.\u201d <em>Skrymsher </em>v. Northcote, 1 Swanst., 566 ; <em>Cheslyn </em>v. <em>Cress</em>well, 3 Bro. P. C., 246; <em>Bagwell </em>v. <em>Dry, </em>1 P. Wms., 700 ; <em>Page </em>v. Page, 2 id., 489; <em>Leake </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 Mer., 363, 392; <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>L. R., 3 Ch. App., <em>301; Sohier </em>v. <em>Inches, </em>12 Gray, 385. The bequest in the eleventh item being void, the legacy therein named falls into the residue. If the bequest of the residue in the twelfth item or any portion is void, such estate is intestate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-5\"><em>C. R. Ingersoll, </em>for the charitable societies named in the twelfth clause of the will.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-6\"><em>First. </em>A valid trust is created by the provisions of item twelfth of the will. By it the testator bequeaths the residue of his estate to trustees, in perpetuity, for certain charitable purposes therein indicated. Subject to the life annuity of $100 to Emeline Cook, the income of the trust fund is directed by the testatoi to be annually divided between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>certain charitable institutions, namely, the New Haven Orphan Asylum, in the proportion of one half, the Home of the Friendless and the Connecticut Humane Society, each in the proportion of one eighth, and the remaining one fourth part the testator \u201c directs \u201d his \u201c beloved wife, Martha A. Bristol, to permanently dispose of for such charitable purposes as she may deem proper.\u201d It is objected that the trust estate is not within the statute relating to charitable uses and therefore is not secured to the uses to which it has been granted \u201caccording to the true intent and meaning\u201d of the testator, because his \u201c true intent and meaning \u201d as to the disposition of the remaining one fourth of the income, (after the appropriation of the other three fourth parts to the charitable institutions named,) is so vaguely and uncertainly expressed that the law cannot effectuate it; and that consequently the entire trust must fail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-5\">1. We submit, in the first place, that there is no such difficulty in ascertaining the intention of the testator; and that, on the contrary, his intention is clear to devote the entire income of the trust fund (saving only the life annuity) to certain \u201c charitable \u201d purposes within the purview of the statute. What he meant by charitable purposes is clear. Whatever popular significance the word \u201c charitable \u201d may have, the testator seeking to raise a trust, in perpetuity, for charitable purposes, must be presumed to use it in the sense of the statute. For otherwise his bequest would fail, and his intention could not be carried out. \u201c If there are two meanings of a word, one of which will effectuate and the other will defeat the testator\u2019s object, the court is bound to select that meaning of the word which will carry out the intention and objects of the testator.\u201d <em>Whicker </em>v. Hume, 7 H. L. Cas., 154; <em>Saltonstall </em>v. Sanders, 11 Allen, 455. The word \u201c charitable,\u201d in our court of ehancery, as in that of England, has a \u201c well known and acknowledged meaning.\u201d <em>Hamden </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>24 Conn., 350. \u201c A technical meaning.\u201d <em>Adye </em>v. Smith, 44 Conn., 71. And this is the meaning of the word in our statute. That meaning has been concisely expressed as \u201c a gift to a general public use which extends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>to the poor as well as the rich,\u201d or \u201c whatever is given for the love of God, or for the love of your neighbor in the catholic and universal sense,\u201d as distinguished from that which, in its motive, is \u201c personal, private or selfish.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. Phillips, 14 Allen, 555. And it is this sense that courts of chancery give to the word when seeking for the intention of a testator in the construction of wills. Solely for the want of this word the court were not able to discern the testator\u2019s intention in <em>Adye </em>v. <em>Smith. </em>But the presence of the word enabled the court to sustain the trust in <em>Schouler, Petitioner, </em>134 Mass., 426. And this statutory meaning has such force that it will give its own sense to other words of a different legal sense with which it may be united. A gift to \u201c charitable or benevolent \u201d purposes is a good charitable gift in Massachusetts, \u201c whose system of jurisprudence relative to trusts for charity is similar to our own,\u201d as this court say in <em>Adye </em>v. <em>Smith. Saltonstall </em>v. Sanders, 11 Allen, 446; <em>Rotch </em>v. Emerson, 105 Mass., 431; <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>111 id., 267; <em>Suter </em>v. <em>Hilliard, </em>132 id., 412. The sense in which the testator used the word is also indicated by the character of the other institutions which are, in the context, made his beneficiaries, in perpetuity. They are \u201c charitable \u201d institutions in the statutory sense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-5\">2. The purpose of the trust being certain and lawful, the beneficiaries are also made certain; and the trust can therefore be executed and administered by a court of chancery. In <em>Coit </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>51 Conn., 379, this court say that where a definite class of beneficiaries is described, and a mode is provided for the selection of the particular objects of the bounty, the uncertainty is reduced to certainty. The mode provided by the present testator for their selection is not only a very certain one, but is otherwise commendable. He leaves that duty to his wife\u2014the one most likely to be possessed of his wishes, and he, at the same time, gratifies himself by testifying in this becoming manner his confidence in her. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Kelsey, </em>2 Cush., 243, the devise was \u201cfor the promotion of such religious and charitable enterprises as shall be designated by a majority of the pastors composing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the Middlesex Union Association,\u201d and it was held sufficiently certain, and the appointees of the association took the bequest. In <em>Wells </em>v. Doane, 3 Gray, 201, the devise to such charities as should be deemed most useful by the executor of the life tenant was held good. In <em>Waldo </em>v. <em>Caley, </em>16 Ves., 206, the charitable objects were such as \u201c my said wife shall judge most worthy and deserving.\u201d And see cases cited in <em>Saltonstall </em>v. <em>Sanders, (supra).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">3. But if the provision respecting the one fourth remaining part of the income should fail, the other trusts of item twelfth would be unaffected by it. \u201c Where a will contains different trusts, some of which are valid and others void or unauthorized by law, or where there are distinct and independent provisions as to different portions of the testator\u2019s property, or different estates or interests in the same portions of the property are created, some of which provisions, estates or interests are valid and others invalid, the valid trusts, provisions, estates or interests created by the will of the testator will be preserved; unless those which are valid, and those which are invalid, are so dependent upon each other that they cannot be separated without defeating the general intent of the testator;\u201d <em>Van Vechten </em>v. <em>Van Veghten, </em>8 Paige, 104, 120 ; <em>Irving </em>v. <em>De Kay, </em>9 id., 521. In the present case the trusts are distinct, and, without any difficulty, separable. Nor is the general intent of the testator defeated by such separation. The claimed uncertainty attaches only to the remaining \u201c one fourth part \u201d of the income, and the only trust that can result to the heir at law by reason of such uncertainty is in respect to that one fourth part simply. There is no more difficulty in making the separation than there would be if the testator, had expressly provided that the principal should be held for the beneficiaries, in separate portions, according to the proportions indicated. Indeed, the bequest of the interest or produce of a fund, without limitation as to time, is regarded as a bequest of the fund itself. 2 Roper on Legacies, 371; <em>Sproul's Appeal, </em>105 Penn. St., 438.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\"><em>Second. </em>If item eleventh of the will is inoperative, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>attempted bequest falls into the residuum. <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Stoug</em>hton, 5 Pick., 537; <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Wellington, </em>9 Allen, 295; <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>6 Conn., 292, 305 ; <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>40 id., 250 ; <em>James </em>v. <em>James, </em>4 Paige, 115.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b262-5\">Loomis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae8\">This case involves the construction of two clauses in the will of Julius D. Bristol and the question of their legality.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The eleventh clause of the will is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201c I hereby authorize and empower my executrix to disburse and give (in furtherance of my wishes expressed to her at sundry times) from my estate to such worthy persons and objects as she may deem proper, such sums as it is her pleasure thus to appropriate, not to exceed in all the total sum of five thousand dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Is this a valid gift ? It clearly is not a trust. There is no person or object named, or even hinted, as the <em>cestui que trust. </em>There is no person who could claim in a court of equity an enforcement of the trust. It is a case where, if the five thousand dollars had been given to the executrix to be disposed of at her pleasure, the law would regard the property given as vested in her, while the direction for its use was merely precatory and of no legal force. In such a case the law regards the legatee as taking the gift absolutely and with no enforceable duty as to its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">But there is no gift to the executrix. She has merely a power of distribution. Nothing vests in her. It is precisely as if no disposition whatever of the fund had been suggested, but the executrix had been empowered to direct how five thousand dollars of the estate should go. It is, in other words, an authority given to a third person to direct how a part of the testator\u2019s property should be disposed of. If good for a part of the estate it would be good for the whole. Would then a will in the following words be a valid one : \u201c I direct that <em>A. B </em>shall declare how all my property shall be disposed of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">The supporters of this will say that such a will would be valid, and quote in support of their claim a dictum of Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Seymour in <em>Wait </em>v. Huntington, 40 Conn., 11, as follows: \u201c It is familiar law that a testator may confer on executors and on others an absolute power of appointment and disposition over his property.\u201d But the case itself did not call for this remark nor involve the question of its correctness, and it seems hardly probable that the learned judge intended that it should have the wide application given it.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">There is a singular absence of all reference to this question in the text books, and we have found no decisions that bear with any directness upon it. In the absence of such authority we should regard such a will as of no legal effect. We think the law never intended to accept as a valid will so vague and indefinite a direction, such a mere authority'. It is in no proper sense a will. It indicates no intent whatever on the part of the testator as to the disposition of his property. It is really a public declaration that he has no such intent. It is a travesty of terms to call such an instrument a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The bequest being inoperative, the five thousand dollars appropriated by it falls into the residue. This is the well-settled rule in the case of void bequests of personal property. <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>6 Conn., 292; <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Wellington, </em>9 Allen, 295; <em>James </em>v. <em>James, </em>4 Paige, 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The remaining question arises under the twelfth clause of the will, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">\u201c I give and bequeath all the rest and residue of my estate of every name and nature, whatever and wherever the same may be situated, unto William T. Bartlett and Edward A. Chatfield, both of the city and county of New Haven, and Edward W. Twitchell of Southington, Connecticut, and their successors to be designated and appointed as hereinafter set forth, as a board of trustees, to hold, invest, reinvest, manage and preserve as a permanent fund, in trust for the uses and purposes and subject to the directions by me herein set forth and for the objects herein indicated, which fund shall be called The J. D. Bristol Benevolent Fund of Southington, Connecticut, and the object of the trust is to provide a permanent fund with a perpetual in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>come, from which income shall be paid the annuities hereinafter given and set forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The testator then gives one hundred dollars a year from the income of the fund to Emeline Cook, during her natural life, and directs that, from the remainder of the income, there shall be paid one half to the New Haven Orphan Asylum, one eighth to the Home of the Friendless in New Haven, one eighth to the Connecticut Humane Society, and the remaining quarter he disposes of by the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">\u201c And I do hereby authorize, empower and direct my beloved wife, Martha Amelia Bristol, to permanently dispose of, for such charitable purposes as she may deem proper, the other one fourth of said remaining interest, income and profit accruing from said permanent trust fund.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">It is very clear that this is not a gift to the wife herself, which she can take discharged of the trust, as it merely gives her a power to appoint the charitable use. Is it then valid 'as a gift to charitable uses under our statute on that subject?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Whatever might be held o.n this question by the courts of England, or of those states which have adopted the English doctrine on the subject, it is very clear that under our own decisions, which have established a definite rule on the subject in this state, this bequest can not be held valid. It is well established with us that a gift to a charitable use must designate the particular charitable use by making the gift to some charitable corporation, whose charter provides for a charitable use of its funds, or to some particular object or purpose that the law recognizes as charitable. It is enough if the object be mentioned, and the law can see that it is a charitable one; but it is not enough that the gift be merely \u201cto charitable uses\u201d or \u201cto be used in charity,\u201d so long as no selection is made from the long list of recognized charitable objects. And it is not enough that some person is named to whom is given the power of naming the charity. That is the testator\u2019s own matter. It is his intent that is to determine that. If he chooses to leave the matter wholly to the discretion of some person named, he can do so by making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the gift to him, leaving him to use his discretion as to the disposition of it. In this case the donee takes absolutely, and the law does not trouble itself as to whether he acts conscientiously in the matter. The testator has chosen to leave the matter to uncertainty and there the law leaves it.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The charitable object, thus required to be named, may be a benefit to a class of persons and therefore uncertain as to the particular persons of the class that are to receive the benefit. This uncertaintjr may make the bequest void, unless there is a power given to some person or corporation to make a selection of the individuals. <em>White </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>22 Conn., 50; <em>Adye </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>44 id., 70; <em>Fairfield </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>50 id., 513; <em>Coit </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>51 id., 379 ; <em>Tappan\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>52 id., 412. Here the power given the widow is not to select the particular beneficiaries of a class named, but to select the charity itself. We think that, to uphold this bequest, we should have to go beyond the utmost limit to which we have gone in upholding charitable gifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The bequest being of such a character, it clearly can not be saved by the act of the widow in making a written designation of the charitable purposes which by it she is authorized to select.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">If this gift can not be sustained, then it is claimed that the entire trust fund falls with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">But the principle to be applied is well settled, that where a trust is for several purposes, some valid and some invalid, it will be supported so far as it is good, provided such part is separable from the rest and no violence will thereby be done to the testator\u2019s general intent. 3 Jarman on Wills, (Am. ed.,) 709; 1 Redfield on Wills, 428; <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>102 Mass., 9; <em>Benedict </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>98 N. York, 460. But the case of <em>Coit </em>v. <em>Comstock </em>51 Conn., 352, was cited in argument to show that the trust was inseparable. In that case however the annual income of the trust fund was to be expended, so much as might be necessary, in putting and keeping in good order certain burial lots and monuments, and. the remainder for the support of religious services in connection with the ecclesiastical society that was named as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>trustee. The bequest for the care of the burial lots was invalid, but it was not separable for the reason that it was impossible to tell how much of the income would be required for the burial lots or that it might not take the whole and leave nothing to be applied to the valid charity.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In the case at bar it is admitted that if the residue were given, in different portions, to different objects, each would be independent of the others, and a failure of any one of them would not affect the others. But it is said that here the gift is of different portions of the <em>income </em>only, so that the shares, being shares only of a common income, can not be severed in advance, or in any other way except by a division of the income. The question raised here is not without practical difficulty. It is of course out of the question that the quarter of the income should <em>in perpetuo </em>be distributed to the heirs at law. If the quarter is set apart for them at all, it clearly must be in the principal. The testator, whose intent is to govern so far as practicable, clearly intended that the benefit of three quarters of the fund should go to the charitable institutions named. This plain intent clearly should not be allowed to fail if there is any way by which the quarter share of the heirs at law in the income can be severed from the rest. This can only be done by a division of the principal of the fund, setting aside for distribution as intestate estate one quarter of it, and preserving the other three quarters for the trust fund. This can do no possible injustice to any party interested, unless the part set to the heirs should increase in value, making the income from it larger in proportion than that from the trust fund, in which case the charitable institutions would be losers; or unless the trust fund should increase disproportionately in value, making a corresponding loss to the heirs at law. But the loss or gain on either side would probably be very small, while the chances .are equal, and the advantage to both the trust fund and the heirs in thus severing their interests would be very great.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The matter stands at this point precisely as it would if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>testator should direct that his property go into the hands of trustees and the income be divided into ten equal parts and paid over annually to \u201c the following charitable corporations, one part to each;\u201d and should then by mistake name only nine charitable corporations, leaving the tenth part undisposed of and therefore intestate. Now must all these nine charitable bequests, all legal in themselves, fail, simply for this oversight ? The testator\u2019s one great intent was to give his property in charity, and not to give a dollar to his heirs, who were perhaps remote collaterals. Shall this great intent wholly fail, and the other non-intent completely succeed ? This would be doing great injustice to the testator and great despite to his intent. What is the technical difficulty ? Simply this\u2014that if the fund is at once divided into ten parts and one part given to the heirs at law, these heirs may not get an exact tenth, or the other nine tenths may some time or other yield more than nine tenths of the income. If they yield less that is of course the loss of the charitable societies; but that is of no consequence, as they do not complain. The only complaint is from the heirs at law\u2014that they may not get the full tenth. But the heirs have this advantage\u2014they get their tenth of the fund down, at once, and at market value ; so that they can at once turn it into money if they choose ; while the other nine tenths are to be kept a long time and may in part be lost or reduced in value. In the whole matter the heirs have the advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Now can it be that this small risk\u2014not only very small, but very remote and merely speculative, is to be allowed to defeat the great prevailing, manifest, legal intent of the testator, and that too in favor of heirs at law to whom it was his clear intention to give nothing? Such a result would seem to be a reproach to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">It is true that this is a division of the principal, while the testator, in the case we are supposing, intended only a division of the income. But it is well settled that an absolute gift of all the income of property is a gift of the property itself. The donor in such.a case retains nothing, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>gives no interest to any other person than the donee. In the ease before us the departure from the exact intent of the testator is only as to the mode of carrying out his cherished object, not a substitution of one object for another. There is nothing of the <em>ey pres </em>doctrine in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We think therefore that one quarter of the residue now devoted to the trust fund, should, upon a fair estimate of values, be separated from the trust fund and distributed as intestate estate to the heirs at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">A question of some practical difficulty arises with regard to the annuity of one hundred dollars in favor of Emeline Cook, which is charged for her life upon the entire trust fund. It is clear that the reduced trust fund should pay but three quarters of this and that the other quarter should be paid from the quarter of the residue that goes to the heirs. This annuity is charged upon the whole residue and therefore as much upon the quarter that goes to the heirs as upon the three quarters that goes to the trust fund. Unless the parties agree upon some arrangement that shall dispose of this small charge, the trustees should retain, either the whole of the residue until Mrs. Cook\u2019s death, or an ample amount from the quarter distributed to the heirs to yield with certainty the sum of twenty-five dollars per year, the same to be distributed to the heirs at law upon the death of Mrs. Cook.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The claim is made in behalf of the .charitable institutions taking under the residuary clause, that this quarter of the income, or of the principal if we so treat it, upon the legacy in question failing, goes into the residue, thus preserving the trust fund unimpaired and increasing their beneficial interest under it. But this clearly can not be so. The residue spoken of in the will is the residue after the payment of the preceding bequests, and clearly can not, either in law or reason, take back into itself a part of the residue itself that has dropped out by not having been legally disposed-of. It necessarily becomes intestate estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Carpenter and Stoddard, Js., dissented from so much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>of the opinion as held the bequest of the fourth of the income of the trust fund to charitable purposes to be designated by the widow invalid, but concurred in holding that the bequest of the other three fourths of the income to the charitable societies named was valid. Park, C. J., and Granger, J., dissented as to the validity of the bequest of the remaining three fourths of the income of the trust fund. All the judges concurred in the opinion except as to the points of dissent noted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
