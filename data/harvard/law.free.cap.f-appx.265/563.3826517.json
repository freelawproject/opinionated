R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Reynaldo Garcia-Cunanan appeals from the 114-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d), and use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">Appellant contends that the district court erred by incorrectly calculating the applicable Guidelines range. We disagree. The plain language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(b) indicates that it pertains only to the Guidelines range for the mandatory consecutive term required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">Appellant next contends that the district court erred by treating the Guidelines range as the presumptive sentence. We reject this contention because the record indicates that the district court was aware of its discretion to impose a sentence outside of the applicable Guidelines range based on the sentencing factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 245-46, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-16\">Finally, appellant contends that the district court erred by failing to adequately consider all the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We conclude that the district court\u2019s explanation of its reasoning was sufficient under the circumstances. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Perez-Perez, </em>512 F.3d 514, 514-17 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b588-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
