We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings, <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Resendiz-Arcos\u2019s motion to reopen because he failed to support the motion with an affidavit or to demonstrate the evidence he submitted was previously unavailable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(a) and (c); <em>Bhasin v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 977, 984 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-24\">We reject Resendiz-Arcos\u2019s contention that the BIA deprived him of due process by not addressing his counsel\u2019s argument in the motion to reopen that the evidence was previously unavailable. <em>See Carrillo-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>353 F.3d 1077, 1079 (9th Cir.2003) (argument of counsel does not constitute evidence); <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (to prevail on a due process challenge the petitioner must show his proceeding was \u201cso fundamentally unfaii\u2019 that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case\u201d and must demonstrate prejudice) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b543-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
