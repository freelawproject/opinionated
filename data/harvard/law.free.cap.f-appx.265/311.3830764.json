Briones-Zapata contends that the district court erred by imposing a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because his prior Texas conviction for aggravated assault is not a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. He contends that the Texas crime of aggravated assault has a broader definition than most other definitions of aggravated assault because it may be committed by threatening the victim with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-19\">This court has previously held that aggravated assault under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.02 (Vernon 2000), which is identical to the 2006 version of the statute at issue in the instant ease, is substantially similar to the generic, common sense definition of \u201caggravated assault\u201d and therefore qualifies as the enumerated offense of \u201caggravated assault\u201d under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 418, 169 L.Ed.2d 293 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Rojas-Gutierrez, </em>510 F.3d 545 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Galves, </em>262 Fed.Appx. 587 (5th Cir.2007) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Quintanilla-Garay, </em>254 Fed.Appx. 425 (5th Cir.2007) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Delgado-Salazar, </em>252 Fed.Appx. 596 (5th Cir.2007) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-22\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Briones-Zapata challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625-26 (5th Cir.2007), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-25\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, die court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
