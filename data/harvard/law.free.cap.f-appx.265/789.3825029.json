He claims (1) the district court erred in failing to give him credit for time served in state custody, and (2) his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Davis, </em>313 F.3d 1300, 1305 (11th Cir.2002). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b), the district court shall adjust a defendant\u2019s sentence for time already served if the term of imprisonment resulted from another offense (1) that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction and (2) was the basis for an increase in offense level for the instant offense. The intended purpose of \u00a7 5G1.3(b) is to credit defendants who have already served time, generally in another jurisdiction, for the same conduct or course of conduct. <em>United States v. Flowers, </em>13 F.3d 395, 397 (11th Cir.1994) (applying an earlier, but nearly identical version of \u00a7 5G1.3(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">The district court was not required under \u00a7 5G1.3(b) to credit Fuentes-Tavora for the time he served in state custody prior to his federal trial. Fuentes-Tavora was in state custody stemming from his charges of battery on a law enforcement officer and obstruction with and without violence. These offenses are not relevant conduct, as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a), to the instant offense of illegally re-entering the United States after being deported. Thus, \u00a7 5G1.3(b) is inapplicable, and the district court was not required to adjust Fuentes-Tavora\u2019s sentence to reflect his time already served in state custody.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-15\">Generally, we review a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>sentence for reasonableness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Reasonableness review requires us to review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,\u201d and then we \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing the sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We may presume a sentence within the properly calculated Guidelines range is reasonable. <em>Rita v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">After carefully reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude the district court committed neither procedural nor substantive error in arriving at FuentesTavora's sentence. The court correctly calculated the applicable Guidelines range and noted it had discretion to vary from the range. Also, the court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explained its reasons for sentencing Fuentes-Tavora at the low end of the Guidelines range. The court specifically considered whether a sentence within the Guidelines range was greater than necessary to meet the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). After noting valid reasons existed for sentencing Fuentes-Tavora at the higher end of the range, the court determined a 77-month sentence was sufficient to serve the statutory goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">To the extent Fuentes-Tavora argues the court\u2019s decision not to give him credit for time served was unreasonable, we made clear in <em>United States v. Winingear </em>that individual sentencing decisions are not subject to reasonableness review. 422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Instead, we review the final sentence for reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>Given the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines range as advisory, consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, explanation for reaching its decision, and imposition of a sentence within the properly calculated Guidelines range, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Fuentes-Tavora to 77-months\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-10\">. Fuentes-Tavora does not argue on appeal the court should have granted him a departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c). Even if he did, a court is not required to grant a departure under \u00a7 5G 1.3(c), as it is under \u00a7 5G1.3(b) if certain circumstances are present. Likewise, <em>United States v. Sanchez-Rodriguez, </em>161 F.3d 556 (9th Cir.1998), which Fuentes-Tavora does cite in his brief, does not require the court to grant a departure, but rather acknowledges it is within the court's discretion to do so based on time already served in slate custody or the lost opportunity to serve a greater portion of a state sentence concurrently with the federal one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-11\">. Though the Government claims plain error review is appropriate where, as here, a defendant raises a reasonableness argument for the first time on appeal, we need not decide whether plain error review is proper, as the outcome is the same under either standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
