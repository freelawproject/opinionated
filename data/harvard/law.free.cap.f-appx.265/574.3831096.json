We have juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>diction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Lira contends that the district court erred by failing to adequately state its reasons for imposing a sentence at the top of the guideline range as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(c)(1). We disagree. \u201cSection 3553(c)(1) only requires the court to state its reasons for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the applicable range if that range <em>exceeds </em>24 months.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Gonzalez, </em>962 F.2d 874, 879 (9th Cir.1992) (emphasis added). Because the recommended range in this case spanned only 19 months, the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Lira contends that the district court failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c), which requires the court to state its reasons for imposing a particular sentence. Because Lira did not object to the court\u2019s statement of reasons, this contention is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1176 (9th Cir.2006). Lira has not carried his burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice, and therefore his contention fails. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b598-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
