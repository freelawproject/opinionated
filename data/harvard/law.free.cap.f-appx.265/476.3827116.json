We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-21\">We address Meneely\u2019s jurisdictional argument first. <em>See Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade Servs., Inc., </em>341 F.3d 987, 995 n. 12 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc). The district court had jurisdiction over Meneely\u2019s revocation proceedings. Meneely was arrested during her supervised release term, which was tolled when she entered fugitive status. <em>See United States v. Murguia-Oliveros, </em>421 F.3d 951, 953-55 (9th Cir.2005); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3606, 3583(e)(3). Meneely\u2019s argument that she was not a fugitive is foreclosed by <em>Murguia-Oliveros, </em>which held that a failure to comply with the terms of supervised release triggers fugitive status. <em>Id.) see also United States v. Delamora, </em>451 F.3d 977, 980 (9th Cir.2006). Meneely violated the terms of her supervised release by failing to report to probation within seventy-two hours of her release from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-23\">Meneely had actual notice of her seventy-two hour reporting duty. She received an oral advisement to report to probation from the sentencing court and written notice of the seventy-two hour reporting requirement from a Federal Bureau of Prisons \u201cNotice of Release and Arrival\u201d form, which she signed. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>Orlega-Brito, </em>311 F.3d 1136, 1139 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Meneely\u2019s contention that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) violates the Sixth Amendment is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Huerta-Pimental, </em>445 F.3d 1220 (9th Cir.2006), which remains good law after <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856,166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b501-24\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
