MirelesFlores argues that the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), based on the determination that his 2006 Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation constitutes a crime of violence. We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>356 F.3d 598, 602 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-22\">Mireles-Flores recognizes that this court has previously held that an offense committed under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1), the statute of his conviction, is a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, but he argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1599-1600, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), overrules this circuit\u2019s precedent. In <em>United States v. Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d 301, 303 n. 1 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 156, 169 L.Ed.2d 106 (2007), this court noted that the analysis in <em>James </em>expressly does not concern enumerated offenses and pertains only to a residual provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae, which \u00a7 2L1.2 does not contain. Consequently, <em>James </em>is not dispositive of this case. Moreover, because this court has held that an offense under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, the district court did not err in applying the enhancement under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(\u00fc). <em>See Uriited States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1199, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. Neiv Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Mireles-Flores challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
