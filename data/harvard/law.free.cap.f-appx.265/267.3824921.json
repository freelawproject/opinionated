McKay (\u201cMcKay\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her claims of disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791. Because we agree that McKay cannot show that she suffered an \u201cadverse employment action,\u201d we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">McKay, who suffers from a speech impediment, a hearing impediment, and a learning disability, has been employed at the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d) Rural Development Office in Jackson, Mississippi since August 5, 1984. On or about June 19, 2003, McKay was moved from her work station in the \u201cContraction/Proeurement\u201d area of the USDA Jackson office to another workstation, located in the \u201cPersonnel\u201d area of the same office. There is a dispute concerning the exact distance between the workstations. While the USDA claims the work station was relocated by only about ten feet, McKay claims the move was more dramatic and landed her in a cramped and isolated area. McKay\u2019s new workstation had previously been the office of another employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">On May 23, 2006, after receiving a right to sue letter from the EEOC, McKay filed this action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, claiming her work space relocation was the result of purposeful discrimination. Specifically, McKay argues her supervisor\u2019s personal dislike of her appearance and speech impediment motivated him to have her moved in violation of the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s provisions. The USDA denies McKay\u2019s relocation was motivated by discrimination, instead asserting the change was prompted by a nationally mandated office restructuring designed to make room for prospective staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">ll.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s granting of summary judgment, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Gowesky v. Singing River Hosp. Sys., </em>321 F.3d 503, 507 (5th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Kee v. City of Rowlett, </em>247 F.3d 206, 210 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Discrimination claims brought under the Rehabilitation Act are governed by the same standards as claims brought under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d). <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(d). To qualify for relief under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff seeking to establish a prima facie case of discrimination must show that (1) that she has a disability; (2) she is an individual qualified for the job in question; (3) she worked for a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance; and (4) an adverse employment decision was made solely because of this disability. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); <em>Hileman v. City of Dallas, </em>115 F.3d 352, 353 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">The district court granted the USDA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on McKay\u2019s claims on the ground that the act challenged by McKay, her relocation from one workstation to a less favorable workstation, did not constitute an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d We agree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">This court has consistently limited \u201cadverse employment action\u201d in the Title VII context to acts which effect compensation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>duties, and benefits. <em>See, e.g., Pegram v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 272, 282 (5th Cir.2004) (in Title VII discrimination context; \u201can adverse employment action consists of ultimate employment decisions such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating.\u201d). It is not entirely clear that this Circuit\u2019s formulations of the ultimate employment decision standard comports with the Supreme Court\u2019s characterization of the Title VII standard in <em>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2411-12, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) ( ... words in the substantive provisions of Title VII, such as \u201chire,\u201d \u201cdischarge,\u201d \u201ccompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\u201d limit the scope of the provision to actions that affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace). However, we need not decide that issue in the present case because nothing in Title VII or the Supreme Court\u2019s decision indicates that moving an employee to a smaller work station is the type of employment condition that Congress intended to be actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We conclude that similar limitations apply to the similarly worded provisions of the ADA and by extension the Rehabilitation Act. <em>Compare </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) (Title VII\u2019s substantive provision which makes it unlawful for an employer to \u201cfail or refuse to hire or to discharge ... or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment ....\u201d) <em>with </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (The ADA\u2019s substantive provision which forbids discrimination \u201cin regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d). Discrimination claims brought under the Rehabilitation Act are governed by the same standards as claims brought under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d). <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Because McKay\u2019s claim is premised only on the inconvenience and size of a new workstation, and because she does not allege a change in compensation, benefits, or responsibilities, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that McKay has not suffered an actionable adverse employment action. As such, McKay fails to make a prima facie ease of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">. McKay also sued Nick Walters (\"Walters\u201d), Mississippi State Director of USDA, Rural Development, in his individual capacity. This issue was not addressed by the district court and was raised by the USDA on appeal. This court has held that the proper defendant in a suit brought under the Rehabilitation Act is the program or activity receiving federal financial assistance, thus a plaintiff cannot sue an individual under the Act. <em>See Lollar v. Baker, </em>196 F.3d 603, 609 (5th Cir.1999) (recognizing that the Act's enforcement provision provides for suit against \"any program or activity\" and it is the program that is the recipient of federal financial assistance).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
