We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Kumar is barred from asylum relief by virtue of the time limits set forth by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), because the record does not compel the conclusion that the untimely filing of the asylum application should be excused. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The IJ determined that Kumar was not credible because of material inconsistencies in his testimony regarding his first arrest, and because he gave different answers on his adjustment of status application and his asylum application with regard to the number of times he was arrested. Because these inconsistencies go to the heart of Kumar\u2019s claim, the adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Li, </em>378 F.3d at 962. Accordingly, Kumar\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Because Kumar\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same evidence that the IJ found not credible, we deny the CAT claim as well. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156-57 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b635-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
