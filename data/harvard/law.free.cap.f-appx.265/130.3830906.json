Husain appeals pro se from an order of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey denying his motion for default judgment and granting Defendants\u2019 respective motions to dismiss. We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">This case arises out of an alleged incident on August 14, 2006, at the Showboat Casino (\u201cCasino\u201d). According to Husain, he was playing blackjack at a $25 table when a representative of the Casino accused him of cheating. Denying that he ever cheated, Husain complained to Reginald Allen, an inspector at the Casino Control Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) booth, who then filed an incident report. Dissatisfied with the report and his alleged inability to obtain further information from the Commission, Husain commenced a pro se action in the District Court. He identified the Commission itself, the individual Commissioners, Allen, and Commission attorneys as \u201cSecond Party Defendants\u201d (collectively \u201cCommission Defendants\u201d). He further named two Casino employees as \u201cThird Party Defendants\u201d (collectively \u201cCasino Defendants\u201d). In his amended complaint, Husain claimed that the Commission Defendants violated his federal due process and equal protection rights. The District Court also construed his pleading as containing state-law claims, such as for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, against the Commission Defendants and, possibly, the Casino Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">In an order entered on February 6, 2007, the Magistrate Judge granted Husain\u2019s motion to file the amended complaint. Husain then moved for a default judgment against the Commission Defendants on March 6, 2007. Having earlier sought the dismissal of Husain\u2019s initial complaint, the Commission Defendants moved to dismiss his amended complaint, initially on March 2, 2007, and again on March 12, 2007. The Casino Defendants likewise filed a motion to dismiss. In an order entered on August 15, 2007, 2007 WL 2375034, the District Court denied Husain\u2019s motion for default judgment and granted the motions to dismiss. It dismissed with prejudice Husain\u2019s federal claims against the Commission Defendants under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The District Court further dismissed without prejudice his state-law claims against both sets of Defendants pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). Husain timely appealed, and he has filed a motion to strike the Commission Defendants\u2019 appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Husain argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion for default judgment against the Commission Defendants, claiming that they failed to respond to his amended complaint within the twenty-day period in which to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, as the District Court noted, entry of default by the Clerk under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(a) constitutes a general prerequisite for a subsequent default judgment under Rule 55(b). <em>See, e.g., </em>10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2682 (2007) (\u201cPrior to obtaining a default judgment under either Rule 55(b)(1) or Rule 55(b)(2), there must be an entry of default as provided by Rule 55(a).\u201d (footnote omitted)). Contrary to Husain\u2019s characterizations, the Clerk did not enter either a default or a default judgment when it docketed his motion for default judgment on March 6, 2007, or set the return date for his motion on the following day. A review of the District Court docket confirms that no default was ever entered against the Commission Defendants, and the District Court accordingly was correct to deny Husain\u2019s motion for default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Setting aside the issue of entry of default, the District Court\u2019s denial of default judgment was nevertheless appropriate on other grounds. <em>See, e.g., Hi Tech Trans, LLC v. New Jersey, </em>382 F.3d 295, 297 n. 3 (3d Cir.2004) (stating that court of appeals may affirm for any reason supported by record). In deciding whether to grant a default judgment, a court may consider whether: (1) a denial would prejudice the plaintiff; (2) the defendant appeared to have a litigable defense; and (3) the defendant\u2019s delay was caused by culpable conduct. <em>See, e.g., Chamberlain v. Giampapa, </em>210 F.3d 154, 164 (3d Cir.2000). Husain himself appeared to suffer little, if any, prejudice from the denial of his motion, and there is no real indication that the Commission Defendants\u2019 relatively short delay in responding to his amended complaint was due to any misconduct. On the contrary, the docket reveals that the Commission Defendants vigorously defended against Husain\u2019s claims throughout this litigation. For instance, they filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on March 2, 2007, less than a month after the entry of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order granting leave to file an amended complaint and four days before Husain even filed his default judgment motion. As we discuss below, Husain\u2019s own claims lacked merit, and the Commission Defendants therefore possessed, at the very least, a strong defense to his claims. In the end, the District Court\u2019s ultimate disposition of this case was consistent with our well-established policy of \u201cdisfavoring default judgments and encouraging decisions on the merits.\u201d <em>Harad v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>839 F.2d 979, 981 (3d Cir.1988) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">It is unclear whether Husain actually challenges on appeal the District Court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). In any case, we conclude that the District Court properly dismissed his federal due process and equal protection claims against the Commission Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The District Court dismissed Husain\u2019s due process claims on the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>that he failed to establish that the Commission Defendants\u2019 conduct implicated a federally protected right. On appeal, Husain does not specify the liberty or property interests allegedly at issue here, and he fails to address the District Court\u2019s actual finding with respect to the absence of a constitutionally protected interest. We\u2019ve previously observed that there is no constitutionally protected property interest in the opportunity to gamble and that, therefore, efforts like those of the Commission Defendants in this case do not violate due process rights. <em>Doug Grant, Inc. v. Greate Bay Casino Corp., </em>232 F.3d 173, 189-90 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Husain alleged that his equal protection rights were violated by a gaming regulation requiring that casinos conduct recorded surveillance <em>only </em>of gaming tables with posted minimum wagers of <em>$100.00 or more </em>as opposed to mandating such surveillance of <em>all </em>blackjack tables regardless of the wager. <em>See </em>N.J. Admin. Code. \u00a7 19:45-1.10(d). According to Husain, the Commission Defendants thereby created an unconstitutional distinction within the same class of blackjack tables. However, as the District Court pointed out, there is no fundamental constitutional right to gamble or to have one\u2019s gambling efforts under surveillance, and relative poverty or wealth alone do not constitute \u201csuspect classes\u201d for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause. <em>See, e.g., Abdul-Akbar v. McKelvie, </em>239 F.3d 307, 317 (3d Cir.2001) (en banc); <em>Doug Grant, Inc., </em>232 F.3d at 189. Finally, the District Court properly concluded that the surveillance regulation satisfied the applicable \u201crational basis\u201d standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Doug Grant, Inc., </em>232 F.3d at 189 (applying rational basis test and concluding that anti-card-counting measures adopted by casinos and approved by Commission were rationally related to legitimate state interest in protecting casino industry\u2019s financial viability).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Turning to the remaining substantive claims in this litigation, Husain does not challenge on appeal the District Court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of his state-law causes of action against the Commission and the Casino Defendants. With respect to the Casino Defendants, he admits that he only included them as parties in order \u201cto obtain relevant information.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 12.) Accordingly, the District Court properly declined to exercise jurisdiction over supplemental state-law claims after it dismissed all claims \u201cover which it has original jurisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court committed no reversible error by denying Husain\u2019s motion for default judgment and granting the respective motions to dismiss of the Commission Defendants and the Casino Defendants. Likewise, his pending motion to strike the appellate brief of the Commission Defendants is DENIED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">. The Court has appellate jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the denial of a motion for default judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Jorden v. Nat'l Guard Bureau, </em>877 F.2d 245, 250-51 (3d Cir.1989). We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See, e.g., Green v. America Online, </em>318 F.3d 465, 470 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-5\">. We further note that the regulations do require casinos to have the <em>capability </em>of monitoring every gaming table. <em>See </em>N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7 19:45-1.10(b)l(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">. Husain asserts, inter alia, that the Commission Defendants\u2019 appellate brief contains numerous fraudulent statements and that the brief itself was untimely. Nevertheless, the alleged instances of fraud amount, at best, to mere disagreements between the parties regarding such matters as the purpose of the litigation, the underlying facts, the procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>history in the District Court, and the procedural mies and case law. Furthermore, the Commission Defendants requested and were granted an extension of time to file their brief, and their brief was filed within the extended time period. Finally, we note that we would have reached the same result in this appeal even without the benefit of the Commission Defendants\u2019 brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
