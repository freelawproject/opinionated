We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo whether a judicial officer is immune from suit. <em>Harvey v. Waldron, </em>210 F.3d 1008, 1011 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Sedgwick\u2019s claims against the Clerk of the Supreme Court are barred because the Clerk has \u201cabsolute quasi-judicial immunity\u201d for engaging in activities that are \u201can integral part of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Sharma v. Stevas, </em>790 F.2d 1486, 1486 (9th Cir.1986) (order); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1) (United States may be liable for damages under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Sedgwick\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith is moot because Sedgwick was granted in forma pauperis status on appeal. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sedgwick\u2019s motion for reconsideration because Sedgwick failed to demonstrate grounds warranting relief from the order certifying that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah County, Or. v. ACandS, Inc., 5 </em>F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">Sedgwick\u2019s motion to supplement his informal brief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"ACG\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
