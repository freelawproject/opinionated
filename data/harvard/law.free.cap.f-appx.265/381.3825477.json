Sorrells has filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997). Sorrells also seeks appointment of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-17\">In his Rule 60(b) motion, Sorrells alleged that the defendants wrongfully arrested and prosecuted him through fraud and distortion of the facts. He repeats this bare allegation in his appeal of the denial of his motion. These conclusory assertions were and remain insufficient to show the kind of extraordinary circumstances required to warrant Rule 60(b) relief. <em>See Hess v. Cockrell, </em>281 F.3d 212, 216 (5th Cir.2002). Sorrells has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for reconsideration. Moreover, Sorrells additionally raises claims that this court considered and rejected in his appeal of dismissal of his civil rights complaint, which claims are governed by the law of the case. <em>See Fuhrman v. Dretke, </em>442 F.3d 893, 896 (5th Cir.2006). For these reasons, Sorrells\u2019 appeal is without arguable legal merit and is thus frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-20\">The district court\u2019s certification that Sorrells\u2019 appeal is not taken in good faith is upheld, Sorrells\u2019 motions for appointment of counsel and leave to proceed IFP on appeal are denied, and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Sorrells is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
