This court has jurisdiction over the petition pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>See Khan v. Attorney General, </em>448 F.3d 226, 229-33 (3d Cir.2006). We write primarily for the parties, and assume familiarity with the facts, decisions, and records of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-20\">Seeking employment-based permanent residency, petitioner submitted an application for Labor Certification (Form ETA-750) to the Department of Labor. Petitioner requested a continuance of his removal proceedings pending resolution of the application. The Immigration Judge had previously granted two continuances on other grounds, and denied this third request. Petitioner argues that this denial was an abuse of discretion and violated his right of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-21\">We are bound by precedent to reject these arguments. In <em>Khan v. Attorney General, </em>we held that \u201c[wjhere ... an alien has failed to submit a visa petition, an IJ\u2019s decision to deny the alien\u2019s continuance request is squarely within the IJ\u2019s broad discretion, at least absent extraordinary circumstances____\u201d 448 F.3d at 234. Here, petitioner has neither submitted a visa application nor alleged \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that could nevertheless render the IJ\u2019s decision an abuse of discretion. Petitioner\u2019s due process claim, like that presented in <em>Khan, </em>\u201cmerely recasts his abuse-of-discretion argument in constitutional terms and can be denied for the reason[ ] already stated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-23\">Accordingly, the petition for review will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
