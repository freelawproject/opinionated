We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(d) and 1291. We review de novo, <em>Zimmer v. PSB Lending Corp. (In re Zimmer), </em>313 F.3d 1220, 1222 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-22\">The bankruptcy court properly determined that any liability for the causes of action in Ms. Lindquist\u2019s complaint, all of which were fraud-based, was subject to discharge at the completion of Mr. Lindquist\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings under the applicable law. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328(a) (2004) (allowing discharge of fraud-related debts); <em>see also In re Gregory, </em>705 F.2d 1118, 1120 n. 2 (9th Cir.1983) (noting that the applicable version of \u00a7 1328(a) \u201cclearly authorizes the discharge of all debts provided for in the plan, including fraud-related debts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-23\">Contrary to Ms. Lindquist\u2019s contentions, she received adequate notice prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint and an opportunity to object, and, thus, the bankruptcy court did not violate her due process rights. <em>See Rio Prop., Inc. v. Rio Int\u2019l Interlink, </em>284 F.3d 1007, 1016-17 (9th Cir.2002) (stating that due process requires notice \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Accordingly, the district court did not err by dismissing the appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Contrary to Ms. Lindquist\u2019s contentions, the bankruptcy court was not required to submit findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52 because Ms. Lindquist\u2019s action was not \u201ctried on the facts.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) (requiring findings and conclusions where an action is \u201ctried on the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury\u201d); Fed. R. Bank. P. 7052 (applying Fed.R.CivP. 52 to adversary bankruptcy proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Because we affirm the district court\u2019s order, we deny Ms. Lindquist\u2019s request for reassignment to a different bankruptcy judge and her request for costs on appeal. We also deny Mr. Lindquist\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b495-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
