(\u201cSouthwest\u201d), refused to recommend a high rating for a stock that she reported on. Her supervisors questioned this decision in a meeting. She told them that they could recommend a higher rating but that she would not sign on to the report if they did so. The firm later terminated her. She filed a whistle-blower complaint with OSHA pursuant to Section 806 of the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d). OSHA dismissed her complaint, and she requested an administrative hearing. An administrative law judge\u2019s recommended decision concluded that Get-man engaged in protected activity that contributed to her termination. Southwest appealed to the Administrative Review Board. The Board held that Getman had not participated in a protected activity. Getman moved for reconsideration, and the Board denied the motion. She appealed to the Second Circuit; the Second Circuit transferred the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Margot Getman began working as an equity research analyst for Southwest in 2000. She researched companies and wrote reports; Southwest published these reports for their clients. Cholestech had requested a report to distribute to potential investors, as it wanted to raise capital. In November 2001, Getman presented a report on Cholestech Corporation to Southwest\u2019s Review Committee. Getman did not include a company rating in her report on Cholestech but indicated at the meeting that she would recommend a stock rating of \u201caccumulate\u201d\u2014a weak rating compared to the recommendation of \u201cstrong buy.\u201d The Committee questioned her decision, asking for the reasoning behind her recommendation. At the end of the meeting, Getman told the Committee that they could change the rating but that she would not sign on to this change. She did not inform the Committee that she believed that changing the rating would violate any securities law. Nor did anyone on the Committee tell her to change the recommendation. On appeal, she alleges that she did not raise concerns regarding the legality of a rating change because \u201c[t]he very people to who[m] Appellant might have complained or registered her concerns were present at the Investment Committee Meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">After the meeting, Getman\u2019s supervisor allegedly became hostile toward her. Southwest terminated Getman in July 2002. In November 2002, Getman filed a complaint with OSHA under Section 806 of Sarbanes-Oxley. OSHA dismissed her complaint, finding that Getman\u2019s activity was protected but that she had not proven that the activity contributed to her termination. She requested a hearing under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1980.106. The ALJ held a hearing, concluding in February 2004 that Get-man had engaged in protected activity that contributed to her termination. Southwest appealed to the ARB. The Board issued a Final Decision and Order in July 2005, concluding that \u201cGetman\u2019s unexplained refusal to change her recommended rating of the Cholestech stock was not protected activity.\u201d Getman moved for reconsideration in September 2005, and the Board denied reconsideration in March 2006. Getman appealed to the Second Circuit in April 2006. The Second Circuit found improper venue and transferred the case to this court in June 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Sarbanes-Oxley applies to a limited category of protected activity, providing,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">No [publicly-traded securities company] or any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company, may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful act done by the employee\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">(1) to provide information, cause information to be provided, or otherwise assist in an investigation regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of section 1341, 1343, 1344, or 1348, any rule or regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any provision of Federal law relating to fraud against shareholders, when the information or assistance is provided to or the investigation is conducted by\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">(A) a Federal regulatory or law enforcement agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">(B) any Member of Congress or any committee of Congress; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">(C) a person with supervisory authority over the employee (or such other person working for the employer who has the authority to investigate, discover, or terminate misconduct); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-15\">(2) to file, cause to be filed, testify, participate in, or otherwise assist in a proceeding filed or about to be filed (with any knowledge of the employer) relating to an alleged violation of section 1341, 1343, 1344, or 1348, any rule or regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any provision of Federal law relating to fraud against shareholders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">Burdens of proof under Sarbanes-Oxley are governed by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and its underlying regulations. A complainant alleging a Section 806 whistle-blower violation must make a prima facie showing that, <em>inter alia, </em>she \u201cprovided, caused to be provided, or is about to provide (with any knowledge of the employer) or cause to be provided to the employer or Federal Government information relating to any violation or alleged violation\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that \u201c(i) [t]he employee engaged in a protected activity or conduct; (ii) [t]he named person knew or suspected, actually or constructively, that the employee engaged in the protected activity; (iii) [t]he employee suffered an unfavorable personnel action; and (iv) [t]he circumstances were sufficient to raise the inference that the protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable action.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-8\">The ARB accepted the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact but concluded that Getman had not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\">\u201cprovided] information]\u201d at the meeting that she reasonably believed Southwest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Securities was about to commit fraud against shareholders or some other securities violation. In our view, her unspecified \u201crefusal\u201d was not sufficient to \u201cprovide information\u201d to a person with supervisory authority relating to a violation. In the context of a review committee meeting between an analyst and her supervisor, where disagreement over a rating may be a normal part of the process, the analyst must communicate a concern that the employer\u2019s conduct constitutes a violation in order to have whistleblower protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Because Getman timely petitioned for review of an ARB holding, we review that holding under \u201cthe standard established in the Administrative Procedure Act,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> upholding the decision unless it is \u201c \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Whether Getman\u2019s activity was protected activity under Section 806 is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. </em>With or without <em>Chevron </em>deference,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Getman argues that her activity was protected because \u201cthe circumstances forced upon ... [her] allowed only two courses of action; she could comply with the committee by upgrading her rating and in doing so violate federal and industry laws and regulations or she could refuse to upgrade her rating.\u201d In her hearing, however, she testified that the members of the committee did not ask her to upgrade the rating;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rather, they questioned her opinion and asked her to explain why she recommended the lower rating. Furthermore, she concedes that she never expressed her belief that changing the rating would violate securities law. Her indication at the meeting that the committee could change the rating but that if it did so, she would not sign on to the report, could have meant that she did not believe that the company deserved a higher rating and would not agree to a report that suggested otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Because the committee did not express an intent to change the rating, and Getman never expressed a belief to any supervisor that changing the rating would violate any securities laws, we cannot read any protected activities into her behavior. Since her behavior was not protected, we need not review whether her protected activity contributed to her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
