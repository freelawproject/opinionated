No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">McQueen argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court relied on the same factors already used to calculate his Sentencing Guidelines range to impose a sentence 60 months above the advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">Because McQueen was sentenced after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review his sentence for reasonableness in the light of the section 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005). Briefly stated, under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential\u201d; and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">We conclude that McQueen\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Though his 180-month sentence was above the advisory Guidelines range of 100 to 125 months, it was well below the 480-month statutory maximum sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246 (comparing, as one indication of reasonableness, the actual prison term imposed against the statutory maximum). In addition, the district court explained that it considered the section 3553(a) factors and that a sentence above McQueen\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was appropriate. The district court specifically noted that McQueen\u2019s sentence reflected the seriousness of his prior criminal history\u2014which included several unscored firearm offenses and a state murder conviction for which he served only one year in prison\u2014and served to protect the public, promote respect for the law, and deter McQueen from committing more crimes. The district court also considered other of McQueen\u2019s characteristics, including his several probation violations, sparse employment history, and need for drug treatment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court was not required to state on the record that it explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>The district court also could determine the appropriate weight to give to the Guidelines after considering the section 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1185 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that \u201cthe Guidelines ... serve as a starting point for consideration as to whether a given sentence is \u2018reasonable\u2019 in view of the entirety of section 3553(a).\u201d). Here, the district court determined that the Guidelines range did not yield a reasonable sentence; and nothing in the record convinces us the sentence was unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">McQueen also argues that the district court was required, as a matter of due process and under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h), to give him advance notice of its intent to depart upward from the Guidelines range. But here, the court explicitly noted that it was applying a variance based on its consideration of the section 3553(a) factors, not an upward departure based on Guidelines\u2019 departure provisions. And we have concluded that the notice requirement of Rule 32(h) does not apply to <em>Booker </em>variances. <em>United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that \u201c[a]fter <em>Booker, </em>parties are inherently on notice that the sentencing guidelines range is advisory ... [Parties cannot claim unfair surprise or inability to present informed comment ... when a district court imposes a sentence above the guidelines range based on the section 3553(a) sentencing factors.\u201d), cert. <em>granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 828, 169 L.Ed.2d 625 (2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court was not required to give advance notice of its intent to impose a sentence above the advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-11\">. The district court also considered that, as part of the instant offense, McQueen had driven recklessly and fled on foot from police officers when they attempted to apprehend him. These facts were not included in the calculation of his Guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-6\"><em>. </em>In his brief, McQueen opines that the reasonableness standard is unpredictable and creates sentencing disparities. But his disagreement with the mandated standard of review does not demonstrate how his sentence in this particular case was unreasonable. In addition, McQueen\u2019s arguments that his sentence was unreasonable (because it was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment and enhanced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851) are meritless, as the record clearly indicates that the district court sentenced McQueen under advisory guidelines and did not impose a section 851 enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b891-23\">. In his brief, McQueen argues that the <em>Irizarry </em>decision violates Rule 32(h) and notes that other circuits are in disagreement with it. But <em>Irizarry </em>is controlling in the instant case because we have not, sitting <em>en banc, </em>overruled it; nor has the Supreme Court. <em>See Hunt, </em>459 F.3d at 1181 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
