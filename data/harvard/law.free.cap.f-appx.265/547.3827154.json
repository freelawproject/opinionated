Timlin, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In 2002, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued a so-called <em>Gissel </em>bargaining order that required an employer, Desert Toyota, to begin bargaining with a union. <em>See NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). The ALJ issued this unusual remedy after finding that on several occasions Desert Toyota had violated the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-169 (\u201cNLRA\u201d). The ALJ decided that these unfair labor practices (\u201cULPs\u201d) made the chances slight that the union could hold a fair election. Desert Toyota sought National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d or \u201cBoard\u201d) review by filing exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s bargaining order. Three more ALJ decisions and a district court injunction followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">On review, the NLRB, with one of the three panel members dissenting, disagreed with the ALJ bargaining order decision, holding that \u201cthe coercive effects of the Respondent\u2019s unlawful conduct can be alleviated by the use of the Board\u2019s traditional remedies.\u201d <em>TWest Sales &amp; Service, Inc. d/b/a Desert Toyota &amp; Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, Local Lodge 744, AFL-CIO, </em>346 NLRB No. 3 at * 1 (2005) <em>(\u201cDeseR Toyota I </em>\u201d). Such traditional remedies here included issuing a cease-and-desist order, making Desert Toyota post notices at the workplace, and requiring reinstatement and backpay for one discharged worker. <em>DeseR Toyota I </em>also controlled the outcome in three related decisions issued the same day, 346 NLRB No. 1 (2005) <em>(\u201cDeseR Toyota III\u201d), </em>346 NLRB No. 2 (2005) <em>(\u201cDeseR Toyota IV\u201d), </em>and 346 NLRB No. 4 (2005) <em>(\u201cDeseR Toyota II \u201d). </em>Based on <em>DeseR Toyota I, </em>in <em>DeseR Toyota II-IV </em>the Board <em>inter alia </em>rejected ULPs arising from Desert Toyota\u2019s post-bargaining order failure to bargain with the union. <em>See, e.g., DeseR Toyota III </em>at *1 (\u201c[Pjursuant to our decision in <em>[DeseR Toyota I], </em>we reverse the judge\u2019s findings of violations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">The union petitioned for review of <em>DeseR Toyota I\u2019s </em>holding that a <em>Gissel </em>bargaining order was not required; Desert Toyota intervened in support of the Board. The union also brings consolidated petitions for review of <em>DeseR Toyota </em>II-IV\u2019s holdings about the post-bargaining order ULPs; these petitions would require remand only if the Board erred in <em>DeseR Toyota I </em>by refusing to issue a bargaining order, as the latter three petitions rise and fall with <em>DeseR Toyota I. </em>The union does not petition for the review of the other holdings in <em>DeseR Toyota II-IV.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">We apply an abuse of discretion standard to the Board\u2019s remedial decisions. <em>See, e.g., General Teamsters Local No. 162 v. NLRB, </em>782 F.2d 839, 844 (9th Cir.1986) (calling the Board\u2019s remedial discretion \u201cexceedingly broad\u201d and \u201ca reviewing court\u2019s scope of review ... narrow\u201d). We deny the union\u2019s petition for review, finding the Board\u2019s decision not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">The union argues that the Board failed to properly account for the effect of the support of the majority of Desert Toy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>ota workers through recognition cards. But majority support is merely a necessary condition in a Category II <em>Gissel </em>bargaining order case, not a factor to be weighed by the Board in deciding whether to issue a <em>Gissel </em>bargaining order. <em>See NLRB v. Davis, </em>642 F.2d 350, 352 (9th Cir.1981). Therefore, we reject the union\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">The union also argues that the Board abused its discretion in concluding that traditional remedies instead of a bargaining order would suffice to correct for the effects of the ULPs, given the small size of the bargaining unit, the involvement of high-level supervisors, the effect on the organizing drive when Desert Toyota fired a key worker, and other factors, including ULPs committed after the bargaining order was issued. We find, given the NLRB\u2019s broad remedial discretion and our constrained review, that the Board did not abuse its discretion in deciding that traditional remedies were sufficiently curative of Desert Toyota\u2019s violations. <em>See, e.g., Overnite Transp. Co. v. NLRB, </em>280 F.3d 417, 422 (4th Cir.2002). Therefore, we neither order that a bargaining order be issued nor remand the case for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Finally, the union argues that the Board abused its discretion in dismissing certain union testimony as uncorroborated hearsay. Even assuming without deciding that the Board erred, the issue is not significant enough to warrant a remand. <em>Cf. Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 230, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938) (holding that a Board order cannot be grounded in hearsay).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Our decision to deny the <em>DeseR Toyota I </em>petition controls our response to the union\u2019s consolidated petitions for review of the Board\u2019s associated decisions in <em>DeseR Toyota II-TV. </em>We therefore deny those petitions as well, given that the Board\u2019s decision not to issue a bargaining order did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Petitions for review DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b573-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
