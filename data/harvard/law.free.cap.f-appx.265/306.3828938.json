While he was represented by appointed counsel at sentencing, Irving was allowed great latitude to make arguments (and have witnesses testify) on his own behalf. Nevertheless, Irving argues that the district court erred by denying his requests, made for the first time at the sentencing hearing, to dismiss appointed counsel and represent himself. Because he repeatedly stated that he would \u201cdefend\u201d himself but did <em>not </em>intend to \u201crepresent\u201d himself, Irving\u2019s waiver of counsel was not sufficiently \u201cclear and unequivocal.\u201d Bur<em>ton v.
