As no substantial question is presented by the appeal, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-22\">When reviewing the denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition, we conduct plenary review of a district court\u2019s legal conclusions and review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Vega v. United States, </em>493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir.2007). Jackson, currently a federal prisoner, was shuttled between state and federal custody from February 1993 until September 22, 2004, when he was paroled to a federal detainer. In his petition, Jackson claimed that he was in the primary custody of federal authorities during this time, and that he should receive credit on his federal sentence from February 1993 to September 2004. The Magistrate Judge determined that Pennsylvania authorities obtained primary jurisdiction over Jackson on February 10, 1993, that Jackson remained primarily in state custody until his release on parole in September 2004, and that he was only \u201con loan\u201d to federal authorities for prosecution and sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have reviewed the record, and we find that the District Court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-23\">For the foregoing reasons, we will therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-19\">. The District Court adopted and approved the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
