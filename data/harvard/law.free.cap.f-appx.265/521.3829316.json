Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Lo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 934, 937 (9th Cir.2003), we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-20\">Diaz Espinoza\u2019s motion to reopen included a declaration under penalty of perjury that he never received the notice rescheduling his hearing for six weeks earlier than the original date. The BIA abused its discretion in failing to consider whether Diaz Espinoza\u2019s declaration of non-receipt of notice rebutted the presumption of effective sendee. <em>See Sembiring v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 981, 986 (9th Cir.2007) (discussing weaker presumption of delivery of hearing notice sent through regular mail, and noting that a sworn affidavit verifying non-receipt of the notice may be sufficient to rebut the presumption of delivery). Accordingly, we remand for the BIA to apply <em>Sembiring\u2019s </em>\u201cpractical and eommonsensical\u201d test to Diaz Espinoza\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>at 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-21\">The BIA also abused its discretion in determining that notice was sent to counsel without considering Diaz Espinoza\u2019s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he BIA [is] not free to ignore arguments raised by a petitioner.\u201d). The record of proceedings contains no notice of entry of appearance by Diaz Espinoza\u2019s prior counsel and the motion to reopen included an admission by this attorney that he sent the notice of the rescheduled hearing to an incorrect address. We therefore remand for the BIA to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>whether Diaz Espinoza\u2019s counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance was an exceptional circumstance, within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l), requiring rescission of the <em>in absentia </em>removal order pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C). <em>See Lo, </em>341 F.3d at 939; <em>see generally INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b545-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
