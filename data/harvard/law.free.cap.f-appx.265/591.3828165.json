We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the IJ\u2019s denial of Terziyski\u2019s claims on the basis of an adverse credibility finding. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-24\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The inconsistency the IJ noted between Terziyski\u2019s testimony and his asylum application is material and goes to the heart of his claim. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-64 (9th Cir.2004). Terziyski omitted pivotal facts from his asylum application, which also undermines his credibility. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1254 (9th Cir.2003). In the absence of credible testimony, Terziyski also failed to provide sufficient corroborating evidence to support his asylum claim. <em>See Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-25\">Because Terziyski failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>holding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Terziyski\u2019s CAT claim also fails because it is based on the same testimony that the IJ found not credible, and Terziyski points to no other evidence that he could claim the IJ should have considered. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b615-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
