To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-21\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s underlying order dismissing Singh\u2019s appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture because this petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); Mem<em>breno v. Gonzales, </em>425 F.3d 1227, 1229 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-22\">In his opening brief, Singh fails to address, and therefore has waived any challenge to, the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that issues not raised in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b647-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
