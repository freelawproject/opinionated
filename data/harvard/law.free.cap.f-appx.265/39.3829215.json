Bullock filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the New Jersey Department of Corrections and numerous other defendants alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that they were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs caused by schizophrenia while he was incarcerated in New Jersey\u2019s East Jersey State Prison (\u201cE JSP\u201d) from August 2000 through March 2001. After discovery closed, the only remaining claim before the District Court was Bullock\u2019s deliberate indifference action against Correctional Medical Services, Inc. (\u201cCMS\u201d), a private company that served as the health care provider at EJSP. CMS moved for summary judgment. It did not dispute that Bullock\u2019s schizophrenia constituted a serious medical need. CMS asserted, however, that it could not be liable because Bullock\u2019s medical care was consistent with the standard of care for patients with Bullock\u2019s psychiatric condition. In addition, relying on <em>Natale v. Camden County Correctional Facility, </em>318 F.3d 575 (3d Cir.2003), CMS pointed out that Bullock had failed to adduce any evidence to establish that CMS had a policy or custom that caused the alleged constitutional violation. The District Court agreed that Bullock had not established a custom or policy and granted summary judgment in favor of CMS. This timely appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-23\">Bullock contends that the District Court erred because his own deposition testimony \u201cdetailed the methodical and pervasive manner in which CMS refused to properly address his serious medical condition.\u201d He asserts that, under <em>Natale, </em>evidence that a defendant has \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d to an inmate\u2019s obvious medical need can be sufficient to demonstrate a policy or cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>tom of deliberate indifference. 818 F.3d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Bullock fails to appreciate that the record before us does not establish that CMS turned a blind eye to an obvious medical need. To the contrary, the medical records are extensive, documenting continuing care and treatment of his psychiatric symptoms by nurses, psychologists and physicians numerous times each month. Accordingly, we find no error by the District Court in concluding that Bullock failed to establish that CMS had a policy or custom of deliberate indifference to Bullock\u2019s serious medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-21\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Appellate jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review of the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Natale v. Camden County Corr. Facility, </em>318 F.3d 575, 580 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
