We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the agency\u2019s continuous physical presence determination for substantial evidence. <em>See Ibarra-Flores v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 614, 618 (9th Cir.2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Correa-Laguna did not meet the continuous physical presence requirement where the record contains a signed Voluntary Departure Notice issued in 1993, provided in English and Spanish. <em>See Vasquez-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>343 F.3d 961, 974 (9th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (holding that an alien who commits to departure in order to avoid deportation proceedings is not entitled to continue accruing presence).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Correa-Lagunas contends the IJ violated due process by not allowing him to provide evidence about his 1998-1994 voluntary return. Contrary to Correa-Lagunas\u2019 contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Moreover, Correa-Lagunas failed to demonstrate that additional testimony would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>(requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">We grant Correa-Lagunas\u2019 motion to supplement the record and instruct the clerk to file the documents received on June 23, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b538-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
