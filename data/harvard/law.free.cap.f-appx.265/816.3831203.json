From December 2002 through April 2004, Magruda purchased numerous tractors, trailers, and dump trucks from Wallace. When the dealer-customer relationship between the two firms collapsed, and efforts at reconciliation failed, Wallace brought this action, asserting conversion, breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, and an account stated. After the parties joined issue and discovery was completed, the case was tried to the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">On the basis of the evidence presented and counsel\u2019s arguments, the district court found for Wallace and awarded it compensatory damages for breach of contract (Counts II, V, and VII), punitive damages for conversion (Count I) and fraudulent misrepresentation (Count IV), and the balance due on the account stated. The compensatory damages (included the amount due on the account stated) totaled $130,938, punitive damages totaled $179,750, and prejudgment interest amounted to $26,925. Magruda now appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law on the Count I conversion claim and the Count IV fraud claim and its award of punitive damages on those counts. In addition, Magruda takes issue with the court\u2019s calculation of compensatory damages, its refusal to grant Magruda an offset, and its calculation of prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">The primary witnesses at trial were James Boneosky, who presented most of Wallace\u2019s case, and Vernon Magruda, one of Magruda\u2019s principals and the key to its case. Them testimony conflicted in several material respects. The court, as trier of fact, rejected Magruda\u2019s version of what happened, finding him \u201cseverely lacking in believability and credibility,\u201d and accepted Boneosky\u2019s testimony as true. The record fully supports the court\u2019s credibility choices and, given the other evidence before it, its findings of fact. Thus, we find no clear error in the court\u2019s findings of fact or error in its conclusions of law in holding Magruda liable on the counts at issue. We likewise find no clear error or misapplication of the law in the court\u2019s calculation of compensatory damages and its award of punitive damages. The court\u2019s judgment is therefore due to be, and is,</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
