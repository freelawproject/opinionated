We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas petition for failure to comply with the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Rasberry v. Garcia, </em>448 F.3d 1150, 1153 (9th Cir.2006). Hartawan contends that the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations is equitably tolled because he is actually innocent of the assault and robbery charges to which he pled no contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">Assuming that the actual innocence gateway of <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995), provides a basis for equitable tolling for a petitioner who pled no contest,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hartawan has failed to show that \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found [him] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 115 S.Ct. 851. Hartawan\u2019s claim of actual innocence is primarily based on the recantations of two percipient witnesses, Hau and Liu. Considering all the evidence that could have been presented at trial, including the recantations, we do not find it more likely than not that every juror would have believed these recantations. <em>See Smith, </em>510 F.3d 1127, 1142. Because Hartawan failed to make the requisite showing of actual innocence, the district court did not err in dismissing his petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b691-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-15\">. Although a credible claim of actual innocence will excuse a habeas petitioner's procedural default, <em>see Schlup, </em>513 U.S. at 314-15, 115 S.Ct. 851, neither the Supreme Court nor this court has held that a credible claim of actual innocence will toll the one-year statute of limitations. <em>See Majoy v. Roe, </em>296 F.3d 770, 776 (9th Cir.2002). We have also recognized that there is \u201ca potential incongruity between the purpose of the actual innocence gateway announced in <em>Schlup </em>and its application to cases involving ... no contest[ ] pleas.\u201d <em>Smith v. Baldwin, </em>510 F.3d 1127, 1140 n. 9 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
