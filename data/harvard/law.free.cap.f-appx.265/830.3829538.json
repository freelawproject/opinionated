After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">During the course of a police investigation focused primarily on Joel McDermott, a multi-substance trafficker, agents intercepted more than a hundred calls between McDermott and Alvarez. In these calls, Alvarez discussed quantities of narcotics being picked up and delivered and monies owed to McDermott. Agents learned that, beginning in early 2003, McDermott supplied ecstasy pills to Alvarez for Alvarez to sell. At sentencing, the parties agreed that Alvarez was responsible for 26,000 ecstasy pills during the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">A. Mitigating-Role Adjustment</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">On appeal Alvarez argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a mitigating-role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SBl^b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">A mitigating-role adjustment applies to defendants who are \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3. If the defendant was a minor participant in the criminal activity, the district court decreases the offense level by two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5. If the defendant was a minimal participant in the criminal activity, the district court decreases the offense level by four levels. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2(a). A minimal participant is one who \u201cplays a minimal role in concerted activity\u201d and is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4. The defendant has the burden to establish his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>bane).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction applies, the district court considers two principles: (1) the defendant\u2019s role in the offense compared to the relevant conduct attributed to him in calculating his base offense level; and (2) the defendant\u2019s role compared to that of other participants in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 940-45. \u201c[I]n the drug courier context ... the amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct .... [and] may be dispositive\u2014in and of itself\u2014in the extreme case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. Additionally, \u201cwhen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-17\">Here, Alvarez\u2019s base offense level of 34 was determined, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(3), based on the 26,000 ecstasy pills he agrees he obtained from McDer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>mott to sell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Alvarez was held accountable only for the amount of drugs with which he was personally involved, not for the larger drug conspiracy operated by McDermott. Also, we note, as did the district court, that the amount of ecstasy pills involved was substantial. Because Alvarez\u2019s relevant conduct was limited to his own activity, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that Alvarez played an important role in the plan to distribute those ecstasy pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Furthermore, we cannot say that Alvarez was substantially less culpable than the other identifiable participants in the conspiracy to distribute the ecstasy pills. At sentencing, Alvarez asserted that he worked for McDermott as a middleman, obtaining pills from McDermott and taking them to a third person, who would sell them and give the money to Alvarez to take back to McDermott. The fact that Alvarez may be less culpable than McDermott is not determinative, given that it is possible for a conspiracy to have no minor or minimal participants. <em>See id. </em>at 944. Based on the content of Alvarez\u2019s numerous telephone conversations with McDermott, the district court found that Alvarez\u2019s involvement was extensive and that Alvarez was an active participant in the ecstasy conspiracy. The district court also found that Alvarez had some discretion in setting the price for the ecstasy pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Alvarez\u2019s emphasis on his limited involvement in McDermott\u2019s larger drug conspiracy, which involved cocaine as well as ecstasy, is unavailing because Alvarez was held accountable only for the ecstasy pills he personally handled. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that the district court should compare the defendant\u2019s role only to the other identifiable participants in the relevant conduct and that \u201c[t]he conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in denying Alvarez\u2019s request for a mitigating-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">B. Criminal History Score</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Alvarez also argues that the district court miscalculated his criminal history score by assigning two points for his 2001 aggravated battery conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b), two points are added for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least 60 days not counted in \u00a7 4Al.l(a). Further, where a prior sentence of imprisonment resulted from a revocation of probation, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(k) applies. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1 cmt. n. 2. Section 4A1.2(k)(l) states, \u201c[i]n the case of a prior revocation of probation ... add the original term of imprisonment to any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation. The resulting total is used to compute the criminal history points for \u00a7 4Al.l(a), (b), or (c), as applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">In 2001, Alvarez pled guilty in Florida state court to aggravated battery. He was sentenced to ten years\u2019 probation, but no jail time. However, in 2004, Alvarez violated the terms of his probation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>As a result, the state court modified his probation sentence and imposed a 159-day imprisonment sentence, time served. Alvarez argues that his 159-day sentence, imposed after he violated his probation, was a \u201cmodification\u201d of his probation rather than a revocation, and thus his 159-day sentence should not be counted in determining the criminal history points for his aggravated battery offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Alvarez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Glover, </em>154 F.3d 1291, 1294 (11th Cir.1998). In <em>Glover, </em>the defendant, like Alvarez, violated the terms of his probation, which resulted in a modification of his probation that included a 90-day term of imprisonment. <em>Glover, </em>154 F.3d at 1293. Glover argued that his sentence resulting from a modification of probation, rather than a revocation, could not be counted under \u00a7 4Al.l(k)(l). <em>Id. </em>at 1293-94. This Court concluded that \u201c \u00a7 4A1.2(k)(l) contemplates that, in calculating a defendant\u2019s total sentence of imprisonment for a particular offense, the district court will aggregate <em>any </em>term of imprisonment imposed because of a probation violation with the defendant\u2019s original sentence of imprisonment, if <em>any, </em>for that offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1294 (emphasis added). Furthermore, this Court explained that \u201c \u2018the finding of a probation violation coupled with a time-served imprisonment sentence and a resentencing to probation constitutes a \u201crevocation of probation\u201d under section 4A1.2(k)(l).\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1294 (quoting with approval <em>United States v. Reed, </em>94 F.3d 341, 345 (7th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Under <em>Glover, </em>the district court properly considered Alvarez\u2019s 159-day sentence (imposed after he violated his probation) as a sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days under \u00a7 4Al.l(b). Thus, the district court properly added two criminal history points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4Al.l(b) and 4A1.2(k) for his 2001 aggravated battery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-13\">. We review for dear error the district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant qualifies for a mitigating-role reduction. <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b856-6\">. Alvarez now claims that his actual and relevant conduct were not the same because he did not actually sell the entire 26,000 pills of ecstasy, but returned some of them to co-conspirator McDermott. Alvarez pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute ecstasy, not distribution of ecstasy. Thus, Alvarez need not have actually sold all 26,000 pills for those pills to be counted as part of his actual conduct. Alvarez does not dispute that he obtained those pills from McDermott to sell, even if in the end he did not sell all of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b856-14\">. We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d 1294, 1297 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
