To the extent we have jurisdiction it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider, <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791 (9th Cir.2005), and we grant in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The BIA abused its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reconsider because the record reflects that, contrary to the BIA\u2019s statement, Singh requested voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (a motion to reconsider can be based on an error of fact in a prior BIA decision). The BIA also failed to address the other arguments in Singh\u2019s motion to reconsider. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 1006, 1015 (9th Cir.2005) (remanding in light of BIA\u2019s unexplained failure to address petitioner\u2019s claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The BIA abused its discretion when it failed to explain why Singh\u2019s motion to reopen did not set out a prima facie case for adjustment of status. <em>See Franco-Rosendo v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 965, 966 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that the BIA abuses its discretion when it fails to fully explain its reasons for denying a motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">To the extent Singh attempts to challenge the BIA\u2019s March 30, 2005 decision, we lack jurisdiction because this petition is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">In light of our disposition, we need not reach Singh\u2019s due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED in part; DISMISSED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
