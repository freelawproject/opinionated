Shulby (collectively the \u201cIntervenors\u201d), along with Shulby\u2019s client, Johnny Long, appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their verified application for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. No reversible error has been shown; we dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">Long settled his Americans With Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) case with defendant Morton Plant Hospital Association. The settlement agreement provided that the case would be dismissed with prejudice, except for the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees. Long, in July 2006, filed the instant application for fees. In August 2006, defendant filed a suggestion of death about Long. In December 2006, defendant filed a motion to dismiss because no one had been substituted for Long. In response, Intervenors filed a motion to intervene so that they could pursue the application for fees. The district court granted the motion to intervene but denied the application for fees based on Intervenors\u2019 lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-18\">Because Long is deceased and no one made a timely request for substitution on his behalf in the district court or in this appeal, he was not a proper party in the district court and he is not a proper party to this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(a)(1) (providing that, if a motion for substitution is not filed within 90 days of the filing of a suggestion of death, the action shall be dismissed as to the deceased party); Fed. R.App.P. 43(a) (providing for substitution of a deceased party on appeal). Therefore, Long is dismissed from this appeal. <em>See Crowder v. Hous. Auth. of Atlanta, </em>908 F.2d 843, 846 n. 1 (11th Cir.1990) (dismissing appeal as to a deceased party using implied powers under Rule 43 because no request for substitution had been made).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Intervenors argue that they had standing to pursue attorneys\u2019 fees because they had a right to intervene.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Intervenors distinguish the case relied on by the district <em>court\u2014Panola Land Buying Ass\u2019n v. Clark, </em>844 F.2d 1506 (11th Cir.1988)\u2014by noting that the settlement agreement between Long and defendant did not contain a fee waiver provision. Intervenors argue that <em>James v. Home Constr. Co. of Mobile, </em>689 F.2d 1357 (11th Cir.1982), controls the standing issue because Long did not expressly waive attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the settlement agreement. Though Long is identified as a party to the appeal, Intervenors make no arguments about his interest in attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>determinations of standing. <em>Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, </em>405 F.3d 964, 975 (11th Cir.2005). Here, the standing question is whether Intervenors have alleged a personal stake in the outcome of the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees in this litigation to warrant the invocation of federal-court jurisdiction. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). In an ADA case, \u201cthe court ..., in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, including litigation expenses, and costs ...\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">By the plain language of the statute, the right to attorneys\u2019 fees in an ADA case belongs to the prevailing party, not the party\u2019s lawyer. And we have determined that generally, fee-shifting statutes create a claim only for the prevailing party, not the party\u2019s lawyer. <em>Panola, </em>844 F.2d at 1510-1511 (in the context of the fee provision of the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b)); <em>Lipscomb v. Wise, </em>643 F.2d 319, 320 (5th Cir. Unit A April 1981) (Voting Rights Act fee provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 19732(e)). Here, based on the \u201cprevailing party\u201d language of the statute, only Long\u2014or his estate\u2014had standing to apply for attorneys\u2019 fees under section 12205; and Intervenors had no personal claim to fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">In <em>James, </em>the case relied on by Intervenors, we determined that it is the lawyer\u2014not the client\u2014who is entitled to fee awards in a case brought under the Truth-In-Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d) because the TILA provided a right of action for a lawyer to seek fees after settlement. 689 F.2d at 1358-59. In distinguishing <em>James, </em>however, we determined in <em>Panola </em>that <em>James </em>involved a lawyer\u2019s standing to pursue <em>his client\u2019s claim </em>for attorneys\u2019 fees under the TILA, and did not address the situation in <em>Panola, </em>where the client had expressly waived a claim to attorneys\u2019 fees. 844 F.2d at 1512 &amp; n. 17 (quoting <em>Freeman v. B &amp; B Assoc., </em>790 F.2d 145, 148-49 (D.C.Cir.1986)) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Intervenors make no arguments about Long\u2019s claim to attorneys\u2019 fees, but instead, focus their arguments on them own entitlement to fees. Still, the standing Intervenors had was derivative to Long\u2019s claim. <em>See James, </em>689 F.2d at 1358-59 (as construed by <em>Panola, </em>844 F.2d at 1512 &amp; n. 17). And Long was not a proper party in the district court; nor is he a proper party to this appeal because no timely substitution was made after his death. Thus, he no longer had a justiciable claim to fees for Intervenors to pursue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>We conclude that the district court correctly denied the application for attorneys\u2019 fees because Intervenors had no personal claim to fees under section 12205 and could not pursue Long\u2019s claim to fees because he was deceased and no party was substituted for him in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\">. Intervenors main contention in their brief is that they were entitled to intervene under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a). This argument about intervention, however, is not the issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b824-7\">. We also noted in <em>Panola </em>that <em>James </em>dealt with the mandatory fee provisions of the TILA, not the discretionary fee provisions of the EAJA. 844 F.2d at 1512. The ADA\u2019s fee provision also is discretionary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Aaq\">. Intervenors argument that Long\u2019s settlement agreement did not expressly waive attorneys' fees like the agreement in <em>Panola </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>not pertinent to the issue of standing in this case because Long, being deceased, had no extant claim to fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
