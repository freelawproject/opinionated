Daibo argues that his conviction for making a false statement in the course of attempting to purchase a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) does not constitute a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>portable firearm offense or a crime of moral turpitude. Daibo also contends that the BIA erred in determining that he had violated his nonimmigrant student status. We disagree, and we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">As we write only for the parties, we do not set out the facts in great detail. On August 19, 1999, petitioner Bawo Veritas Daibo, a Canadian citizen, was admitted to the United States on an F-l student visa to pursue an undergraduate degree at Columbia University. On November 7, 2001, he was charged with two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) and 924(a) for providing two federally licensed gun dealers in Florida with false information that he was a Florida resident, while attempting to purchase an AK-47 rifle, three semiautomatic pistols, and a semiautomatic rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">A jury found Daibo guilty on both counts and he was sentenced to 38 months incarceration. The Judgment in a Criminal Case, dated December 18, 2003, indicated that \u201cthe court has adjudicated that the defendant is guilty of the following offense(s): Title <em>&amp; </em>Section: 18:924(a)(l)(A) &amp; 924(a).\u201d Administrative Record (A.R.) 150. Under Section 924(a)(1)(A), \u201cwhoever\u2014knowingly makes any false statement or representation with respect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in the records of a person licensed under this chapter or in applying for any license or exemption or relief from disability under the provisions of this chapter ... shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The Department of Homeland Security issued Daibo a notice to appear, charging him with removability pursuant to three provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d): 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(A)\u00ae, (a)(1)(C)\u00ae. The Immigration Judge (IJ) held a hearing and concluded that Daibo was not eligible for voluntary departure and was removable under all three INA sections. The BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s determination that Daibo was ineligible for voluntary departure and that he had violated the conditions of his visa, but remanded for further explanation of the IJ\u2019s decision with respect to the other two grounds of removal. The IJ issued another decision, the BIA affirmed, and this petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231. <em>See Stubbs v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>452 F.3d 251, 253 n. 4 (3d Cir.2006). We review <em>de novo </em>whether Daibo\u2019s offense constitutes a removable firearm offense, because it is a purely legal question. <em>Id. </em>at 253. Although we owe no deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of federal criminal law, we defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the terms in the INA. <em>Chevron, U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We accord <em>Chevron </em>deference to the BIA\u2019s conclusion that a particular crime involves moral turpitude, but accord no deference to its determination that elements of a particular criminal statute implicate moral turpitude. <em>See Partyka v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>417 F.3d 408, 411 (3d Cir.2005) <em>(quoting Knapik v. Ashcroft, </em>384 F.3d 84, 88 (3d Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">Daibo argues that his conviction did not constitute a firearm offense for purposes of removability. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>In order to determine whether a conviction under a statute constitutes a removable or deportable offense, we presumptively apply the \u201cformal categorical approach\u201d under which the adjudicator \u201c \u2018must look only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses\u2019 and may not \u2018consider other evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s prior crimes,\u2019 including, the \u2018particular facts underlying [a] conviction[ ].\u2019 \u201d <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 144, 147-48 (3d Cir.2004) <em>(quoting Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)); <em>see Alaka v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>456 F.3d 88, 105 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We may abandon the formal categorical approach if (1) \u201cthe language of the particular subsection of [the statute on which removal is based] ... invite[s] inquiry into the underlying facts of the case,\u201d or (2) \u201cthe disjunctive phrasing of the statute [of conviction] similarly invites inquiry into the specifics of the conviction.\u201d <em>Joseph v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>465 F.3d 123, 127 (3d Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Here, Daibo argues that \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) is not phrased in the disjunctive, and the BIA, therefore, erred in moving beyond the categorical approach. As the Government notes, however, Daibo was convicted under both \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) <em>and </em>924(a). Appellee Br. at 18-20. Section 924(a), which includes several subsections with different factual predicates and penalties, has relevant disjunctive language that requires inquiry into the specific facts of the case. <em>Singh, </em>383 F.3d at 163. A conviction based on some parts of the section would constitute a removable firearm offense, while others would not.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Applying a modified categorical approach, we look to the record of conviction, which includes the indictment, verdict, and sentence, to determine the nature of the crime Daibo committed. <em>Alaka, </em>456 F.3d at 106. The indictment charged Daibo with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) and 924(a) for knowingly making a false statement and representation on Department of Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Form 4473, Firearms Transaction Record, in connection with attempting to purchase an AK-47 caliber rifle on March 14, 2001, and three .45 caliber semiautomatic pistols and one .50 caliber semiautomatic rifle on April 27, 2001. The judgment described the \u201cNature Of Offense\u201d as: \u201cMaking a False Statement with respect to Information Required by the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44, to be Kept in Records of a Federally License Firearms Dealer, in Connection with the attempted purchase of Firearms in violation of 18 USC 924(a)(1)(A).\u201d A.R. 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">Under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C), \u201c[a]ny alien ... convicted <em>under any law </em>... of attempting ... to purchase ... a firearm <em>... in violation of any law </em>\u201d has committed a removable offense. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C). As the BIA observed, \u201cthe statute\u2019s double reference to \u2018any law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201d constitutes \u201cmore than inartful redundancy.\u201d App. 14. Daibo violated a law requiring the provision of accurate information to firearm dealers while attempting to purchase a firearm. The BIA, thus, correctly concluded that Daibo\u2019s offense fits within the terms of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Furthermore, Daibo\u2019s argument that we should apply the \u201crule of lenity,\u201d under which \u201cdeportation provisions [are] to be narrowly construed so as to give the alien as much protection as possible,\u201d is without merit. Appellant Br. at 12. We have explained that the rule of lenity is \u201ctraditionally reserved for the criminal, not immigration, context,\u201d and may only \u201cbe applied as a canon of last resort to determine the intent of Congress on an ambiguous issue.\u201d <em>Valansi v. Ashcroft, </em>278 F.3d 203, 214 n. 9 (3d Cir.2002). We do not apply the rule, where, as here, \u201cthe intent of Congress is already clear based on an analysis of the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Daibo also argues that his conviction does not constitute a crime of moral turpitude. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In determining whether Daibo has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, we look to the \u201ccriminal statute and the record of conviction, not the alien\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Partyka, </em>417 F.3d at 411. Applying this categorical approach, we must first ask whether the statute of conviction covers only morally turpitudinous acts, as determined by the \u201cleast culpable conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If a statute covers \u201cboth turpitudinous and non-turpitudinous acts, ... it is \u2018divisible,\u2019 and we then look to the record of conviction to determine whether the alien was convicted under that part of the statute defining a crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Daibo was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) and 924(a). Section 924(a) contains both \u201cturpitudinous and non-turpitudinous acts,\u201d but the record of conviction points us to \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A), which prohibits \u201cknowingly mak[ing] any false statement or representation\u201d to a firearms dealer. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Our case law requires us to look to the <em>mens rea </em>required for conviction in determining whether a particular crime involves moral turpitude for purposes of the INA. <em>Partyka, </em>417 F.3d at 413. We have explained that \u201cthe hallmark of moral turpitude is a reprehensible act committed with an appreciable level of consciousness or deliberation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414. In addition, we have noted that moral turpitude \u201ccontains an honesty component ... which includes conduct that is contrary to justice, honesty, or morality.\u201d <em>Smriko v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 279, 283 (3d Cir.2004). The Supreme Court has observed that \u201c[without exception, federal and state courts have held that a crime in which fraud is an ingredient involves moral turpitude.\u201d <em>Jordan v. De George, </em>341 U.S. 223, 227, 71 S.Ct. 703, 95 L.Ed. 886 (1951). The <em>mens rea </em>requirement is satisfied where, as here, the statute of conviction requires \u201cknowingly,\u201d not merely negligently, making a false statement on a government form required to purchase a firearm from a federally licensed dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Daibo relies on <em>Matter of Marchena, </em>12 I. &amp; N. Dec. 355 (BIA 1967), and asserts that convictions for false statements do not necessarily constitute crimes of moral turpitude. In <em>Marchena, </em>the BIA concluded that it could not determine whether Marchena\u2019s conviction was for making a false statement, which would not involve turpitude, or a fraudulent statement, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>would. <em>Id. </em>at 857. In addition, Daibo argues that the BIA\u2019s decision\u2019rested solely on the erroneous assumption that <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>459 F.2d 993 (8th Cir.1972) held that false information provided to dealers under \u00a7 924(a) contained \u201celement[s] of materiality.\u201d App. 16. Daibo contends that <em>Sullivan </em>expressly held that materiality was <em>not </em>an element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A). Appellant Reply Br. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Although Daibo is correct that the BIA erred in relying on <em>Sullivan, </em>the BIA\u2019s analysis did not rest on <em>Sullivan </em>alone. The BIA explained that \u201c[a] crime involving false statements may or may not constitute a crime involving moral turpitude, depending on whether the crime has as an element the intent to deceive, or if the crime is inherently fraudulent.\u201d App. 15. The BIA cited, <em>inter alia, Matter of Correa-Garces, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 451 (BIA 1992), in which the Board observed that \u201c[cjonvictions for making false statements have been found to involve moral turpitude\u201d and concluded that false statements on a passport application constituted a crime of moral turpitude. <em>Id. </em>at 454. The BIA rejected Daibo\u2019s argument that <em>Matter of Marchena., </em>\u201cstands for the blanket proposition that convictions based on \u2018false statements,\u2019 as opposed to those based on \u2018fraudulent statements,\u2019 cannot serve as a basis for a finding that an alien is removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(l) of the Act.\u201d App. 15-16. The BIA emphasized that \u201cthe determination of whether a false statements conviction involves moral turpitude centers on whether the underlying conviction has been proven to involve fraud or an intent to deceive, or is otherwise inherently fraudulent.\u201d App. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In support of its position, the BIA pointed to more recent cases than <em>Marchena, </em>such as <em>Matter of Flores, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 225 (BIA 1980), in which the BIA concluded that selling false or counterfeit papers relating to alien registry was a crime of moral turpitude because the crime was inherently fraudulent and impaired or obstructed an important function of government by \u201cdeceit, graft, trickery, or dishonest means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226-29 (\u201c[Wjhere fraud is inherent in an offense, it is not necessary that the statute prohibiting it include the usual phraseology concerning fraud in order for it to involve moral turpitude.\u201d). In addition, the BIA cited <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>14 I. &amp; N. Dec. 338, 339 (BIA 1973) and explained that the BIA had previously found that a conviction similar to Daibo\u2019s constituted a crime of moral turpitude. <em>Id. </em>at 339. The statute at issue in <em>Acosta, </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6), prohibited false or fictitious statements in the acquisition of a firearm from a licensed dealer that were \u201cintended or likely to deceive ... with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">To determine materiality, the BIA looked to the information required on ATF Form 4473, which included a buyer\u2019s name, address, birth date, criminal background, immigration status, race, sex, height, and weight, and explained that \u201c[t]he materiality of some of these items is obvious; for example, a buyer\u2019s status as a felon or undocumented alien renders him ineligible for firearms purchases. Other information about a buyer\u2019s physical characteristics could aid an investigation into potentially illegal transactions.\u201d App. 16. The BIA concluded that \u201cthere are elements of materiality built into the false statements statute codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Daibo knowingly made false statements on ATF forms in an attempt to procure firearms, and in doing so, obstructed an important government function. We therefore agree with the BIA that Daibo\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>conviction constituted a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Finally, Daibo contends that he did not violate his nonimmigrant student status, because he did not intend to stop attending courses, but rather was prevented from going to school while incarcerated. He argues that the BIA \u201cshould reconsider the applicable standard governing such a charge and adopt a rule limiting this charge to those situations where an alien intentionally does not maintain his non-immigrant status.\u201d Appellant Br. at 19. This argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Contrary to Daibo\u2019s contentions, the BIA did not err in determining that he violated his student status when he was serving his 33-month sentence. Students with F-l visas are admitted to the United States to \u201cpursue a full course of study at an educational institution approved by the Service.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2(f)(5)(i). The BIA has found that \u201cincarceration for a substantial period for a criminal offense constitutes a violation of nonimmigrant [student] status, in that the respondent is no longer pursuing the purpose for which he was admitted.\u201d <em>Matter of Mehta, </em>14 I. &amp; N. Dec. 451, 452 (BIA 1973); <em>but see Matter of Murat-Khan, </em>14 I. &amp; N. Dec. 465 (BIA 1973) (finding that incarceration for 20 days did not constitute a failure to maintain student status where the criminal conduct did not meaningfully disrupt the pursuit of studies).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Here, Daibo\u2019s 33-month sentence interrupted his studies for a far longer period than that considered in <em>Matter of Mehta. </em>The BIA therefore correctly concluded that Daibo was removable because his incarceration, and resulting failure to attend class, violated his student status.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">For the above-stated reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\">. Daibo argues that we cannot consider the Government's contention that Daibo was convicted under both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) and 924(a) because the BIA did not consider that claim. Appellant Reply Br. at 3. Given that we review <em>de novo </em>whether Daibo's offense constitutes a removable firearm offense or a crime of moral turpitude, this argument is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-13\">. Even applying the categorical approach in the manner Daibo advocates, his offense falls within the plain language of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C). Sections 924(a) and 924(a)(1)(A) are part of Chapter 44 of the Federal Criminal Code and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Rules, entitled \u201cFirearms.\u201d Daibo\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) for \u201cknowingly mak[ing] any false statement or representation with respect to the information required by this chapter [namely, Chapter 44, Firearms] to be kept in the records of a person licensed under this chapter,\u201d for example, a firearms manufacturer, importer, or dealer, falls under the broad scope of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
