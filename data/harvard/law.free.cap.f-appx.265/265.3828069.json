William Barnett. The complaint was filed after the deadline to challenge the dischargeability of a particular debt. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 4007(c). The bankruptcy court dismissed Bensen Capital\u2019s complaint as untimely under the Bankruptcy Rules, and the district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A3R\">This Court has held that the fixed time limitations imposed in the Bankruptcy Rules further the goal of finality in proceedings and should be strictly enforced. <em>State Bank &amp; Trust v. Dunlap, </em>217 F.3d 311, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000). Bensen Capital asks this Court to reconsider this position in light of the Supreme Court case of <em>Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004). In its opinion, the Supreme Court held that the deadlines established in Bankruptcy Rule 4004 are not jurisdictional in nature, but the Court expressly refused to address the issue of whether the rules setting out filing deadlines \u201ccould be softened on equitable grounds.... \u201d <em>Kontrick, </em>540 U.S. at 457, 124 S.Ct. 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-18\">Bensen Capital asserts that the actions of Barnett in resisting discovery in the bankruptcy case justifies adoption of the doctrine of \u201cequitable tolling\u201d and applying it to reinstate Bensen Capital\u2019s late-filed complaint. After a hearing in this case, the Bankruptcy Court held that even if equitable tolling were to be adopted, it would not be appropriate here. That was because the delay in Bensen Capital\u2019s filing its complaint was due to the mis-calendaring of the deadline by Bensen Capital\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>attorney and not due to any misconduct on the part of the debtor. A finding of fact by the Bankruptcy Court is reviewed for \u201cclear error.\u201d <em>Carrieri v. Jobs.com, Inc., </em>898 F.3d 508, 517 (5th Cir.2004). Bensen Capital has pointed to no error in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s finding concerning the cause of the delay in filing. We also agree with the conclusion that equity would not support tolling in these factual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Therefore, regardless of whether equitable tolling would be relevant in some cases, it is not appropriate here. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-19\">. The appeal has been docketed with the party\u2019s name spelled \"Benson.\u201d From the briefs and most indications in the record, it appears the proper spelling is \"Bensen.\u201d We leave the official case name alone, but use \"Ben-sen\" in our discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
