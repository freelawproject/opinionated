Azua-Barron contends that he withdrew his application for cancellation of removal under the erroneous belief that he was not eligible for relief. He now believes that, in view of the BIA\u2019s decision in <em>In re Avilez-Nava, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 799 (BIA 2005), he is eligible because his prior departure in 2001 did not interrupt his continuous presence in the United States. He argues that he meets all the requirements and that his removal from the United States would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship for his wife and children who are United States citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-21\">This court reviews the BIA\u2019s conclusions of law de novo, deferring to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration regulations if the interpretation is reasonable. <em>Long v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.2005). The court reviews the BIA\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>A motion filed before the BIA while the IJ\u2019s removal decision is before the BIA on direct appeal is considered a motion to remand. <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 451-52 (5th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ramchandani v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 337, 340 n. 6 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-22\">Azua-Barron does not identify any error in the BIA\u2019s determination that he was advised of and understood the consequences of withdrawing his application and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>chose to withdraw it at the prior removal hearing, and there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s determination. Nor was Azua-Barron\u2019s motion based on circumstances that arose after the prior hearing, as the decision in <em>In re Avilez-Nava </em>was available prior to the removal hearing. Azua-Barron has not shown that the BIA\u2019s decision was \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, Azua-Barron\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
