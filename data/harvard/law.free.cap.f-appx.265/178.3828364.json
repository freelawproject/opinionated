Laurant was charged with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and one count of possession of marijuana. Laurant pleaded not guilty and was convicted on both counts by a jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b202-24\">During voir dire, the district court read Laurant\u2019s indictment to the jury and, in doing so, disclosed Laurant\u2019s prior Louisiana felony conviction for illegal use of a weapon. Defense counsel immediately objected and informed the district court that Laurant had agreed with the Government to stipulate, pursuant to <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997), that he was a felon. The district court informed the parties that it had not received any stipulations. Laurant moved for a mistrial, and the district court denied his motion and issued a cautionary instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-25\">Laurant argues that the district court erred when it informed the jury of the nature of his prior felony during voir dire. We review a district court\u2019s conduct during voir dire for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>150 F.3d 401, 412 (5th Cir.1998). Laurant has not established that the district court was aware of the stipulation before it read the indictment in full. Therefore, he had not shown that the district court abused its discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-26\">Laurant also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dupre, </em>117 F.3d 810, 823 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cA prejudicial remark may be rendered harmless by curative instructions to the jury,\u201d and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>give a district court judge\u2019s assessment of prejudice \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>28 F.3d 477, 483 (5th Cir.1994). A new trial is required only if there is a \u201csignificant possibility\u201d that the prejudicial evidence that the jury heard \u201chad a substantial impact upon [its] verdict, viewed in light of the entire record.\u201d <em>United States v. Paul, </em>142 F.3d 836, 844 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The district court admonished the jury immediately after it read the full indictment that it should disregard the reference that it made to the indictment and informed the jury of the stipulation. The nature of Laurant\u2019s prior conviction was not mentioned again at any time during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In denying his motion for a mistrial, the district court concluded that no harm was done, a finding that we give great weight. Further, \u201c[j]urors are presumed to follow their instructions, and there is no reason to assume that they did not do so in this instance.\u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>483 F.3d 313, 354 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1065, 169 L.Ed.2d 814 (2008). The jury heard ample testimony from a police officer, ATF agents, and Laurant\u2019s ex-girlfriend that calls into doubt the veracity of Laurant\u2019s version of events. Viewed in light of the entire record, Laurant has not demonstrated a \u201csignificant possibility\u201d that the isolated reference to the nature of his pri- or conviction at the start of voir dire \u201chad a substantial impact upon the jury verdict.\u201d <em>See Paul, </em>142 F.3d at 844; <em>Munoz, </em>150 F.3d at 413. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b202-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
