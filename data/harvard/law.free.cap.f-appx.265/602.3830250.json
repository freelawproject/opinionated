We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we grant the petition for review in part, deny it in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Robu\u2019s testimony was not credible because she did not reveal her true reason for leaving Romania to the immigration officer who interviewed her at the border. <em>See Paramasamy v. Ashcroft, </em>295 F.3d 1047, 1052-53 (9th Cir.2002). Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Robu\u2019s testimony was inconsistent and vague with regard to her attackers\u2019 manner of dress. <em>See Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir.2000). Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s finding with regard to the discrepancy regarding the date of the unsuccessful police report. <em>Id. </em>at 1166. Finally, substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s finding that her testimony contained more detail than her asylum narrative statement. <em>See Lopez-Reyes v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 908, 911 (9th Cir.1996). Because none of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings are supported, substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Robu\u2019s testimony, taken cumulatively, was not credible. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1021-22 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review on the asylum and withholding claims and remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this disposition. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Robu failed to establish a CAT claim because she did not show that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if returned to Romania. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283-84 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b627-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
