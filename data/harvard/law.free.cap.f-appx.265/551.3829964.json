Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc), concluding that it would not have imposed a materially different sentence had it known that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. We have jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Dejanu contends that his sentence must be reversed because the district court failed to consider the \u201cparsimony principle,\u201d a consideration in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), when it declined to order full re-sentencing. This contention is not reviewable because the district court determined, on remand, that it would not have imposed a materially different sentence under an advisory Guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Combs, </em>470 F.3d 1294, 1296-97 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Dejanu also contends that the district court erred by declining to consider evidence that his health had deteriorated since his original sentencing. Because the limited <em>Ameline </em>remand only requires that the district court determine what it would have done \u201cat the time\u201d of the original sentencing, the district court did not have to consider the additional evidence. <em>See Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b575-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
