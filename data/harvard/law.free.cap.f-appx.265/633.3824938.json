The district court erred by evaluating the Grabinskis\u2019 complaint under the requirements for sufficiency of proof at trial, instead of the far less stringent requirements for stating a claim under federal pleading standards. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Grabinskis\u2019 complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">This action stems from defendant National Union Fire Insurance Co.\u2019s (\u201cNational Union\u201d) refusal to provide coverage to Thomas Grabinski under directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies issued by National Union. Thomas Grabinski sued and ultimately prevailed in a bad faith and breach of contract action against National Union. A jury entered a $2.5 million judgment in Mr. Grabinski\u2019s favor awarding compensatory damages, punitive damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">The Grabinskis subsequently sued National Union and its counsel, Steven Kent, for abuse of process in state court based on National Union\u2019s conduct during the insurance coverage litigation. National Union removed the action to district court. It then immediately moved to dismiss the Grabinskis\u2019 complaint. The district court, relying heavily on the Arizona Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Crackel v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>208 Ariz. 252, 92 P.3d 882 (Ariz.App.2004), granted the motion and dismissed the Grabinskis\u2019 abuse of process claim for failure to state a claim. The district court went on to dismiss the complaint with prejudice and preemptively denied leave to amend.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>Intri-Plex Technologies, Inc. v. Crest Group, Inc., </em>499 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir.2007). \u201cOn a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, taking all her allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences from the complaint in her favor.\u201d <em>Doe v. United States, </em>419 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir.2005). To comply with the pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), \u201c[specific facts are not necessary; the statement need only \u2018give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam) (citing <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957))).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">The elements of an abuse of process claim under Arizona law are: \u201c \u2018(1) a willful act in the use of judicial process; (2) for an ulterior purpose not proper in the regular conduct of the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crackel, </em>92 P.3d at 887 (quoting <em>Nienstedt v. Wetzel, </em>133 Ariz. 348, 651 P.2d 876, 881 (Ariz.App.1982)). The district court properly recognized these as the two elements of an abuse of process claim. Relying on language from <em>Crackel, </em>however, the district court went on to state that a claimant must also \u201cshow that the use of process \u2018could not be logically explained without reference to ... improper motives\u2019 [and] [m]ere speculation about the defendant\u2019s purposes provides no foundation for an abuse of process claim.\u201d District Court Order (\u201cOrder\u201d) at 8 (quoting <em>Crackel, </em>92 P.3d at 888-89). The district court erred in construing this language from <em>Crackel </em>as a pleading requirement for an abuse of process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">In <em>Crackel, </em>the Arizona Court of Appeals reviewed a trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. 92 P.3d at 887. The <em>Crackel </em>court\u2019s discussion of what a plaintiff must \u201cshow\u201d and \u201cestablish\u201d to avoid a directed verdict after the close of plaintiffs case at trial, relied on by the district court, does not expand the elements of an abuse of process claim that a plaintiff must merely allege to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). <em>See id. </em>at 890-92 (weighing the evidence plaintiff presented at trial under standards for surviving a motion for judgment as a matter of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">The Grabinskis\u2019 complaint sufficiently alleged \u201cwillful act[s] in the use of a judicial process,\u201d to satisfy the first element of an abuse of process claim. <em>Id. </em>at 887. The complaint also generally averred National Union\u2019s improper ulterior purposes, alleging that National Union undertook these willful acts for its \u201cpersonal enrichment and economic well-being ... preferring to look after its own well-being rather than its insureds\u201d and alleging on information and belief that National Union \u201chas a policy of abusing process in situations like those confronting Grabinski.\u201d Complaint 11119, 11. These allegations state a cognizable abuse of process claim under Arizona law. <em>Crackel, </em>92 P.3d at 892 (a defendant\u2019s use of the litigation process \u201cto pursue a corporate policy of deterring future claims\u201d is an improper ulterior motive).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-14\">Relying on <em>Crackel </em>the district court brushed aside the Grabinskis\u2019 allegations of improper purpose, reasoning that \u201ca plaintiff <em>must show </em>that an \u2018alleged improper purpose was the primary motivation for ... the process [used] and that the improper purpose was not merely an inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>dental and collateral motivation.\u2019 \u201d Order at 10 (quoting <em>Crackel, </em>92 P.3d at 891) (emphasis added). But neither <em>Crackel </em>nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a plaintiff to \u201cshow\u201d anything at the pleading stage; a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\u2019 is all that is required. Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). The Grabinskis\u2019 complaint satisfies this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Grabinskis\u2019 abuse of process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b658-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AyP\">. The complaint also asserted a claim of \"continuing bad faith\u201d that was dismissed with prejudice as well. The Grabinskis did not appeal dismissal of that claim, so dismissal of the abuse of process claim is the only issue before us. Because we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal ruling, the question of whether the district court erred in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>the Grabinskis leave to amend is no longer an issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b660-6\">RAWLINSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Avu\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">I respectfully dissent. We have \u201cconsistently emphasized ... that conclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences will not defeat an otherwise proper motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Vasquez v. Los Angeles County, </em>487 F.3d 1246, 1249 (9th Cir.2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The majority disposition faults the esteemed district court judge for relying on language from <em>Crackel v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>208 Ariz. 252, 92 P.3d 882 (Ariz.App.2004) requiring a showing that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s improper purpose was the <em>primary </em>motivation for its actions ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 889 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). <em>Crackel </em>also held that the plaintiff asserting an abuse-of-process claim \u201cmust establish that the defendant used a court process in a fashion inconsistent with legitimate litigation goals.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">The elements that must be established to support a claim must necessarily be alleged in the Complaint. <em>See Jones v. Cmty. Redevelopment Agency of City of Los Angeles, </em>733 F.2d 646, 649 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201c[A] pleading must give fair notice and state the elements of the claim plainly and succinctly.\u201d) (citation, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted). I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that general averments in the Complaint were adequate to survive a motion to dismiss. Indeed, in <em>Crackel, </em>the Arizona Court of Appeals \u201creject[ed] [Plaintiffs\u2019] contention that a generalized allegation that a defendant has misused the litigation process as a whole can support a claim of abuse of process.\u201d <em>Crackel, </em>92 P.3d at 888. Rather, \u201c[s]ome definite act or threat not authorized by the process, or aimed at an objective not legitimate in the course of the process, is required ...\u201d <em>Morn v. City of Phoenix, </em>152 Ariz. 164, 730 P.2d 873, 877 (Ariz.App.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">The majority disposition unfairly characterizes the district court\u2019s ruling as one that \u201cbrushed aside the Grabinskis\u2019 allegations of improper purpose.\u201d Far from brushing the allegations aside, the district court judge explicitly discussed the allegations and concluded that they were speculative and insufficient to support an abuse-of-process claim. District Court Order pp. 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">The majority disposition also finds fault with the district court\u2019s use of the terms \u201cshow\u201d and \u201cestablish\u201d in discussing the pleading requirements. However, the United States Supreme Court has expressly approved the notion that the Plaintiff must make a <em>showing </em>of entitlement to relief. <em>See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965 n. 3, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (\u201cRule 8(a)(2) still requires a 1showing,\u2019 rather than a blanket assertion, of entitlement to relief.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">Because the district court correctly concluded that the Complaint was insufficient to state a claim under Arizona law, I would AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
