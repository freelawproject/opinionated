This is not the identical issue that Carlisle raised in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-28\">At sentencing, when the district court asked the Government whether it was going to make a motion, the AUSA replied that a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>35 motion \u201cis still in the works,\u201d but that the Government was \u201cnot prepared to make that motion at this time.\u201d He explained that \u201cthis defendant\u2019s cooperation is still ongoing and an appropriate motion would be made at the correct time, subsequent to this proceeding.\u201d Carlisle cited to the district court <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>115 F.3d 839 (11th Cir.1997), which he characterized as standing for the proposition that \u201cthere is a temporal distinction between 5(k)l departures and Rule 35 departures,\u201d \u201c[a]nd to the extent that Mr. Carlisle has cooperated to this point ... it would be our objection that Mr. Carlisle is due cooperation departure at this time for what is\u2014has happen [sic] up to now and a Rule 35 for what has happened after.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">The district court responded that it had \u201cabsolutely no jurisdiction, authority or ability to make them file a 5(k) motion.\u201d Carlisle conceded that was correct but explained that he wanted to \u201cpreserve it for the record\u201d because the decision in <em>Alvarez, </em>as he interpreted it, meant that the court would not be able to grant a Rule 35 post-sentencing motion based on cooperation that had preceded sentencing. The court disagreed, stating that any cooperation Carlisle had provided before sentencing could be considered \u201coverall in the 35.\u201d While Carlisle \u201ctend[ed] to agree with that,\u201d he wanted to preserve the point \u201cin an abundance of caution, [because] there are several Circuits that have followed that rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">There is a dispute as to which standard of review we should apply in this case. According to Carlisle, the appropriate standard is <em>de novo. </em>The Government, on the other hand, contends we should review only for plain error, since Carlisle did not specifically claim the Government breached the plea agreement in district court. In the end, it does not matter which standard of review we use, as the result is the same under both. There was no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The plea agreement could not be clearer that the decision about whether Carlisle had provided assistance that was substantial enough to persuade the Government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 or Rule 35 motion was reserved exclusively to the Government. The agreement expressly states that whether Carlisle\u2019s cooperation had been \u201ccomplete, truthful and substantial\u201d and had resulted in \u201csubstantial assistance to the United States in the investigation or prosecution of another criminal offense,\u201d is \u201ca decision specifically reserved by the United States in the exercise of its sole discretion.\u201d And it reiterates that: \u201cThe United States specifically reserves the right to make the decision relating to the extent of any such departure request made under this agreement based upon its evaluation of the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s cooperation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Carlisle\u2019s position in the district court and much of his position before us is based on the erroneous premise that the cooperation he provided before sentencing could not be considered in deciding whether and to what extent he had provided substantial assistance for purposes of a post-sentence Rule 35 motion. That was the state of the law when the <em>Alvarez </em>case was decided in 1997, but the law changed when Rule 35 was amended in 1998. As amended, the rule explicitly provides that \u201c[i]n evaluating whether the defendant has provided substantial assistance, the court may consider the defendant\u2019s presentenee assistance.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(3). To the extent Carlisle is arguing, or other circuits have held, that presentenee assistance that is by itself substantial may not be considered in a post-sentencing Rule 35 departure, that is simply wrong. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 advisory committee\u2019s note to 1998 amendment. (\u201cThus, the amendment permits the court to consider, in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>the substantiality of post-sentencing assistance, the defendant\u2019s pre-sentencing assistance, irrespective of whether that assistance, standing alone, was substantial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">To the extent that Carlisle is arguing that the Government was obligated to decide one way or the other at the time of sentencing whether his cooperation up to that point had been substantial, there is no error. The plea agreement reserved the substantial assistance motion to \u201cthe United States in the exercise of its sole discretion,\u201d and does not plainly require it to make that decision at sentencing, instead of later. In fact, the plea agreement specifies that if the Government decides Car-lisle has rendered substantial assistance, it will move for a downward departure either \u201cin accordance with Section 5K1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines or Rule 85 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, <em>whichever the United States deems applicable.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The second contention Carlisle raises is that the district court erred in denying him an acceptance of responsibility reduction in the calculation of his advisory guidelines range. That issue is barred from review by the valid appeal waiver that Carlisle agreed to as part of the plea bargain. It is also frivolous in light of the fact that he violated the terms of his pretrial supervisory release by using methamphetamine and by absconding; he had to be apprehended by law enforcement. <em>See United States v. Hromada, </em>49 F.3d 685, 691 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-10\">.
