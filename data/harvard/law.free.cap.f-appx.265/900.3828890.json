The gist of Reyes\u2019s allegations is that TruGreen retaliated against him for filing a worker\u2019s compensation claim and for giving deposition testimony in a worker\u2019s compensation retaliation case filed by another TruGreen employee. After the parties joined issue and engaged in discovery, TruGreen moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-21\">In a comprehensive order in which it dealt at length with each of Reyes\u2019s allegations, the district court found no merit in Reyes\u2019s claims and granted TruGreen summary judgment. Record, Vol. 2 at Tab 62. Reyes now appeals, claiming error in each of the district court\u2019s dispositive rulings. We find no error, and for the reasons the court gave in its order granting summary judgment, we conclude that Reyes\u2019s claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
