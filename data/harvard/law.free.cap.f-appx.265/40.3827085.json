After two years, Sambuaga discontinued his studies at the Seminary, but nevertheless remained in the United States. On May 5, 2003, Sambuaga was charged with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(C)\u00ae for failing to comply with the conditions required while holding nonimmigrant status. On October 22, 2003 he submitted a defensive application for relief in the form of asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT on the basis of his Christian religion. In his application, Sambuaga asserted that he feared future persecution from Muslims in Indonesia because of his religious practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">On April 18, 2005, following a hearing on the merits of Sambuaga\u2019s asylum application, the IJ issued a thorough and well-reasoned opinion denying Sambuaga\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding, and protection under CAT. The IJ found Sambuaga credible, but because the Petitioner filed his asylum application well-after the asylum filing deadline of one year,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the IJ determined that Sambuaga\u2019s application was pretermitted. The IJ determined that Sambuaga was not eligible for withholding of removal because he had failed to prove, other than through his testimony, that he would endure persecution because of his faith. Furthermore, the IJ found that Sambuaga had failed to demonstrate that he warranted protection under the CAT because he provided no evidence that he would be detained or tortured by the Indonesian government or with the agreement or encouragement of the Indonesian government. On August 30, 2006 the BIA dismissed Sambuaga\u2019s appeal and this timely petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">As a preliminary matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Sambuaga\u2019s asylum application. Having been filed beyond the one-year deadline, it was untimely. <em>See Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627, 634 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">An application for withholding of removal precludes the removal of an alien \u201cif the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s ... religion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). To obtain relief under this provision, an alien must establish by a \u201cclear probability\u201d that his life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of deportation. <em>I.N.S. v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 413, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). This \u201crequires that an application [for withholding of deportation] be supported by evidence establishing that it is more likely than not that the alien would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>subject to persecution on one of the specified grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429, 104 S.Ct. 2489. In <em>Fatin v. I.N.S., </em>12 F.3d 1233 (3d Cir.1993), we acknowledged that the BIA had interpreted the term \u201cpersecution\u201d \u201cto include threats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1240 (citing <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 229 (BIA 1985)). We also noted that the \u201cBIA suggested that \u2018[generally harsh conditions shared by many other persons\u2019 do not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We determined that the BIA\u2019s \u201cconcept of persecution does not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional\u201d and found the BIA\u2019s interpretation was permissible. <em>Id. </em>Whether Sambuaga has demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his religion \u201cis a factual determination reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The IJ issued a lengthy and thorough opinion where his findings that Sambuaga had not demonstrated a reasonable fear of future persecution were supported by substantial evidence. We decline to find Sambuaga eligible for withholding or protection under the CAT in light of our holding in <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 537 (3d Cir.2005) (finding that there is insufficient evidence to establish that there is \u201can individualized risk of persecution ... [of] Chinese Christians in Indonesia.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">For the reasons stated above, we will deny Sambuaga\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\">. The IJ had jurisdiction pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.2(b). The BIA had appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(b).
