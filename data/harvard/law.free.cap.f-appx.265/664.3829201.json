We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, see <em>Batzel v. Smith, </em>333 F.3d 1018, 1024 (9th Cir.2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Am4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>California\u2019s anti-SLAPP provision provides protection from a strategic lawsuit filed \u201cagainst a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the persons\u2019s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue .... \u201d Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 425.16(b)(1). The provision \u201cwas enacted to allow early dismissal of meritless first amendment cases aimed at chilling expression through costly, time-consuming litigation.\u201d <em>Metabolife Int\u2019l v. Wornick, </em>264 F.3d 832, 839 (9th Cir.2001). As the district court correctly found, La Marca\u2019s statements were an \u201cact in furtherance\u201d because they were \u201cmade in ... a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest.\u201d Cal.Civ. Proc.Code \u00a7 425.16(e)(3). His statements were communicated via internet postings and contained topics of public interest, such as Capella\u2019s allegedly discriminatory treatment of disabled students and La Marca\u2019s assessment of Capella as an educational institution. <em>See Damon v. Ocean Hills Journalism Club, </em>85 Cal.App.4th 468, 476\u201478, 102 Cal.Rptr.2d 205 (2000); <em>Wilbanks v. Wolk, </em>121 Cal.App.4th 883, 895-97, 17 Cal.Rptr.3d 497 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Still, the district court was required, under the anti-SLAPP provision, to deny La Marca\u2019s motion to strike if Capella established a probability of prevailing on its counterclaim. <em>See </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 425.16(b)(1). To establish a probability of prevailing, Capella is required to show that its claims are \u201clegally sufficient\u201d and \u201csupported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by [Capella] is credited.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Wilson v. Parker, Covert &amp; Chidester, </em>28 Cal.4th 811, 821, 123 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 50 P.3d 733 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">The district court did not err in finding that Capella met this burden. Under California law, libel, along with slander, are the defamation torts. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 44. \u201cLibel is a false and unprivileged publication by wilting ... which exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or which causes him to be shunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.\u201d Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 45. Among other invectives, La Marca accused Capella\u2019s president of lying when the president said that \u201c[La Marca\u2019s] tuition for the classes he left before completing was refunded; he only paid for those classes he completed.\u201d Because La Marca admitted that Capella sent, and he received, a check refunding his tuition, we agree with the district court that prima facie evidence of the falsity of La Marca\u2019s statement exists, even applying the higher actual malice standard applicable to public figures.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 280-81, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). Regardless of whether Capella characterized the check as a refund, or whether La Marca actually cashed the check, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that La Marca\u2019s statement that Capella\u2019s president lied about refunding La Marca\u2019s tuition implies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>a fact capable of being proven true or false. <em>See Steam Press Holdings, Inc. v. Hawaii Teamsters, Allied Workers Union, Local 996, </em>302 F.3d 998, 1005-06 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Partington v. Bugliosi, </em>56 F.3d 1147, 1153 (9th Cir.1995) (noting that \u201ca statement that may ... imply a false assertion of fact is actionable\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, the context of the statement did \u201cnot negate the impression that [La Marca] was making a factual assertion about\u201d Capella\u2019s president. <em>Unelko Corp. v. Rooney, </em>912 F.2d 1049, 1054 (9th Cir.1990). Also, contrary to La Marca\u2019s assertions, La Marca can defame Capella by defaming its president. <em>See Palm Springs Tennis Club v. Rangel, </em>73 Cal.App.4th 1, 6-7, 86 Cal.Rptr.2d 73 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Thus, if Capella\u2019s evidence is credited, it has demonstrated that its counterclaim for defamation is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The district court did not err in basing its decision on one actionable statement. Capella\u2019s showing that it has a probability of prevailing on its defamation claim with respect to a single actionable statement is sufficient for the district court to deny the motion and proceed to the next stage of litigation. <em>See Mann v. Quality Old Time Service, Inc., </em>120 Cal.App.4th 90, 106, 15 Cal.Rptr.3d 215 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b688-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-6\">. La Marca did not waive his right to argue that his statements were not prima facie defamatory. In his opening brief, La Marca argued, with support, that his statements are not defamatory. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). He also referenced the allegedly defamatory tuition refund statement. In any event, any deficiency in La Marca\u2019s submitted excerpts of record was remedied by Capella's supplemental excerpts. <em>See United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers of America v. Oliver Corp., </em>205 F.2d 376, 389 (8th Cir.1953) (deficiency in the record was \"supplied to some extent by plaintiff\u2019s supplemental record\u201d); <em>cf. </em>Fed R.App.P. 10(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b689-11\">.
