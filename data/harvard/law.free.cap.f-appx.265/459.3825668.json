R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b483-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-22\">Yungan Zheng and Airong Chen, natives and citizens of China, petition for review of the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) that affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of their application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-23\">The record does not compel the conclusion that the untimely filing of the asylum application should be excused. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(5). Accordingly, the petitioners are statutorily ineligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-24\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination based upon inconsistencies between Zheng\u2019s testimony and petitioners\u2019 asylum application regarding the nature of the injuries he sustained while in detention, and the type of medical treatment he received. <em>See id. </em>at 963. Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Zheng gave inconsistent testimony regarding the petitioners\u2019 claim of persecution under China\u2019s coercive family planning policy. <em>See id. </em>These findings go to the heart of petitioners\u2019 asylum claim. We therefore conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decision that the petitioners failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s finding that petitioners failed to credibly establish that they are eligible for relief under the CAT. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b483-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
