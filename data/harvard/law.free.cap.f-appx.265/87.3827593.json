Taylor, III, appeals the order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granting motions for summary judgment filed by Mooney Aircraft Corp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>(\u201cMooney\u201d) and Honeywell International, Inc. (\u201cHoneywell\u201d). For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the result reached by the District Court, albeit on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Because we write only for the parties, familiarity with the facts is presumed, and we include only those facts that are relevant to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">On November 22, 2000, Peter Sandek, piloting a single engine plane, flew himself, his wife Jo Ellen, and their son Kyle from them home in Georgia to visit relatives in New York for Thanksgiving. Due to bad weather, the Sandeks were unable to land in New York as planned, and instead landed in Pennsylvania, where they stowed their plane in a hangar and completed their trip to New York by car. Following the holiday, on November 26, 2000, they drove from New York to Pennsylvania where they boarded their plane and took off, planning to return to Georgia. Tragically, however, the plane experienced mechanical trouble shortly after take off, crashing in Pennsylvania approximately 10 miles from the airport. Peter, Jo Ellen and Kyle Sandek all died in the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">As a result of the crash, on November 25, 2002, the Sandek estates filed suit in Pennsylvania state court against several manufacturers, including Mooney, who manufactured the plane, and Honeywell, who manufactured an attitude indicator installed in the plane, alleging liability based on a number of theories, including negligence and strict products liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 15, 2008, the case was removed to the District Court, which had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">On November 21, 2006, the District Court granted motions for summary judgment filed by Mooney and Honeywell. In its decision, the District Court, applying Pennsylvania\u2019s choice of law rules, held that Georgia\u2019s 10-year statute of repose for strict products liability and negligence actions applied to bar the Sandeks\u2019 claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The District Court reasoned that because the crash site in Pennsylvania was \u201cwholly fortuitous,\u201d Pennsylvania had no interest in applying its substantive products liability law. (App.13.) On the other hand, Georgia, as the place where the Sandeks lived, purchased the plane, and kept the plane, was \u201cthe only jurisdiction with an interest in this litigation.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Taylor, as representative of the Sandek estates, filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">On appeal, Taylor claims that the District Court\u2019s analysis improperly focused on \u201cthis litigation\u201d as a whole, rather than proceeding issue-by-issue as Pennsylvania\u2019s choice of law rules require. As a result, the District Court failed to examine the policies underlying the relevant Pennsylvania and Georgia laws to determine whether either\u2014or both\u2014state\u2019s interests would be impaired if its law were not applied. According to Taylor, had the District Court followed the proper analysis, it would have concluded that Georgia has no interest in applying its statute of repose in this dispute and, therefore, that Pennsylvania law should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201cIn reviewing a grant of summary judgment we exercise plenary review and apply the same standard as the District Court.\u201d <em>Marten v. Godwin, </em>499 F.3d 290, 295 (3d Cir.2007). Summary judgment should be granted \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">This Court exercises plenary review. over the District Court\u2019s choice of law analysis. <em>See Berg Chilling Sys., Inc. v. Hull Corp., </em>435 F.3d 455, 462 (3d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Garcia v. Plaza Oldsmobile Ltd., </em>421 F.3d 216, 219 (3d Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">\n<em>A. This Court Must Apply Pennsylvania Choice Of Law Rules.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">In a diversity case, such as this one, \u201cwe determine which state\u2019s substantive law governs by applying the choice-of-law rules of the jurisdiction in which the district court sits.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>421 F.3d at 219 (citing <em>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., </em>313 U.S. 487, 496, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941)). Here, because the District Court sits in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania\u2019s choice of law rules govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">\n<em>B. Pennsylvania\u2019s Choice Of Law Rules.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">Pennsylvania follows a \u201cflexible [choice of law] rule which permits analysis of the policies and interests underlying the particular issue before the court.\u201d <em>Griffith v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>416 Pa. 1, 203 A.2d 796, 805 (Pa.1964). Under this approach, the court first must identify whether there are relevant differences between the states\u2019 laws that would affect the disposition of the litigation. If not, there is no conflict, and the court \u201cmay refer to the states\u2019 laws interchangeably.\u201d <em>Hammersmith v. TIG Ins. Co., </em>480 F.3d 220, 229 (3d Cir.2007). If there are relevant differences, there is a conflict, and the court must \u201cexamine the governmental policies underlying each law, and classify the conflict as a \u2018true,\u2019 \u2018false,\u2019 or an \u2018unprovided-for\u2019 situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230. The policy underlying a state\u2019s law is relevant only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the extent it is implicated by that state\u2019s contacts with the litigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 232 (finding that, based on the relevant states\u2019 contacts with the parties, \u201cboth states\u2019 interests are implicated on the facts of this case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">A true conflict exists \u201cwhen the governmental interests of <em>both </em>jurisdictions would be impaired if them law were not applied.\u201d <em>Lacey v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>932 F.2d 170, 187 n. 15 (3d Cir.1991) (emphasis in original). If there is a true conflict, the court should apply the \u201claw of the state having the most significant contacts or relationships with the particular issue.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>421 F.3d at 220 (citation omitted). \u201cThis analysis requires more than a \u2018mere counting of contacts,\u2019 \u201d as the court \u201cmust weigh the contacts on a qualitative scale according to their relation to the policies and interests underlying the particular issue.\u201d <em>Hammersmith, </em>480 F.3d at 231 (citations and alteration omitted). A false conflict exists when \u201conly one jurisdiction\u2019s governmental interests would be impaired by the application of the other jurisdiction\u2019s law.\u201d <em>Lacey, </em>932 F.2d at 187. If there is a false conflict, the court should apply the law of the only interested jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>Finally, \u201cthere are unprovided-for cases in which neither jurisdiction\u2019s interests would be impaired if its laws are not applied.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>421 F.3d at 220. In that case, the court should apply \u201c[t]he principle of <em>lex loci delicti, </em>the law of the place of the wrong.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Although Pennsylvania courts have not explicitly addressed it, this Court has assumed that Pennsylvania\u2019s choice of law analysis employs <em>depecage, </em>the principle whereby \u201cdifferent states\u2019 laws may apply to different issues in a single case.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Berg Chilling, </em>435 F.3d at 462 (assuming that Pennsylvania\u2019s choice of law analysis employs <em>depecage); see also Broome v. Antlers\u2019 Hunting Club, </em>595 F.2d 921, 924 (3d Cir.1979) (predicting that \u201ca Pennsylvania court ... would consider applying the law of different states to the separate issues of liability and damages\u201d). This assumption is based on the pronouncement in <em>Griffith </em>that Pennsylvania\u2019s choice of law analysis focuses on \u201cthe policies and interests underlying the <em>particular issue </em>before the court.\u201d <em>Griffith, </em>203 A.2d at 805 (emphasis added). By suggesting that the court must analyze each issue separately, <em>Griffith </em>implies that different states\u2019 laws could apply to different issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\n<em>A. The District Court\u2019s Analysis.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">Although the District Court articulated the proper analytical framework for addressing Pennsylvania choice of law questions, its analysis was inadequate. First, it never identified the \u201cparticular issue before the court\u201d (as required by <em>Griffith), i.e., </em>whether Taylor\u2019s suit was time-barred under Georgia\u2019s statute of repose. Instead, it framed its choice of law analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>in terms of \u201cthis litigation\u201d and \u201cthis action\u201d as a whole. <em>(See </em>App. 11-18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Second, and perhaps as a result of failing to identify the relevant issue, the District Court never identified the relevant Pennsylvania and Georgia laws or the policies underlying those laws. That requirement is crucial, because it is impossible to classify the conflict (as \u201ctrue,\u201d \u201cfalse,\u201d or an \u201cunprovided-for case\u201d) without first determining whether either or both states\u2019 interests will be impaired if its law is not applied. Nevertheless, the District Court essentially weighed the contacts, and determined that Georgia\u2019s contacts with the litigation were qualitatively more significant than Pennsylvania\u2019s contacts. Such an analysis would have been proper only if the Court had already determined, based on its assessment of policies underlying the relevant Pennsylvania and Georgia laws, that it was presented with a true conflict. Here, however, that determination had not been made and the necessary steps (identifying and examining the underlying policies) to make such a determination had not been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In the end, the District Court concluded that Georgia had an interest in applying its law because of the numerous Georgia contacts with this litigation, while Pennsylvania, which had only one fortuitous contact, had no such interest. Presented with what it deemed a \u201cfalse conflict,\u201d the District Court held that the law of the only interested jurisdiction (Georgia) applied, and that Taylor\u2019s strict products liability and negligence claims were barred by Georgia\u2019s statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\n<em>B. Taylor\u2019s Claims On Appeal Are Not Barred Under The Doctrine Of Judicial Estoppel.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">As a preliminary matter, Honeywell claims that Taylor should be estopped from arguing that Georgia law (i.e., the statute of repose) does not bar his suit because he previously argued before the District Court that Georgia law <em>should </em>apply to a different issue in the case. Earlier in the litigation, another manufacturer defendant (who has since been dismissed from the case) moved for summary judgment on the ground that any claim against it had been discharged as a result of two general releases executed by the former administrator of the Sandeks\u2019 estates. Because Georgia law and Pennsylvania law differed in how they would interpret the releases, the District Court was presented with a choice of law question. Taylor argued that Georgia had a significant interest in applying its law to the releases, while Pennsylvania had no such interest. The District Court agreed, finding that Georgia law applied to the releases. Taylor now argues that Georgia has no interest in applying its statute of repose, while Pennsylvania has a strong interest in applying its products liability law.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\u201c[Jjudicial estoppel bars a litigant from asserting a position that is inconsistent with one he or she previously took before a court or agency.\u201d <em>Montrose Med. Group Participating Savings Plan v. Bulger, </em>243 F.3d 773, 779 (3d Cir.2001). Three requirements must be met before a court may apply judicial estoppel: (1) \u201cthe party to be estopped must have taken two positions that are irreconcilably inconsistent\u201d; (2) \u201cthe party changed his or her position \u2018in bad <em>faith\u2014i.e., </em>with intent to play fast and loose with the court\u2019 \u201d; and (3) \u201cit is \u2018tailored to address the harm identified\u2019 and no lesser sanction would adequately remedy the damage done by the litigant\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 779-80 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Taylor contends that his argument on appeal (Georgia\u2019s statute of repose should not apply) is not inconsistent with his previous argument (Georgia\u2019s law on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>releases should apply) because Pennsylvania employs <em>depecage. </em>As discussed above, we have assumed that Pennsylvania\u2019s choice of law analysis employs <em>depecage. See Berg Chilling, </em>435 F.3d at 462. <em>Depecage </em>permits Taylor to argue that one state\u2019s law applies to one issue in the case <em>(e.g., </em>the release issue), while another state\u2019s law applies to a different issue <em>(e.g., </em>the timeliness issue). It follows that his claims are not irreconcilably inconsistent, and to the extent he can be viewed as having changed his position, it plainly was not in bad faith. Therefore, the requirements for judicial estoppel are not met.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\n<em>C. This Case Presents An Actual Conflict.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">This case presents an actual conflict, as Pennsylvania\u2019s products liability law would permit Taylor\u2019s suit to go forward, while under Georgia law, it would be time-barred by that state\u2019s 10-year statute of repose. Therefore, we must classify the conflict as true, false or unprovided-for by examining the policies underlying the relevant laws. <em>See Hammersmith, </em>480 F.3d at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\n<em>D. Georgia\u2019s Interest In Applying The Statute Of Repose.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Georgia\u2019s products liability law includes a ten-year statute of repose for strict products liability and negligence actions. The Georgia Supreme Court has explained that the statute of repose \u201cwas enacted in order to address problems generated by the open-ended liability of manufacturers so as to eliminate stale claims and stabilize products liability underwriting.\u201d <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Batten, </em>264 Ga. 723, 450 S.E.2d 208, 212 (Ga.1994). That court has suggested that the policies underlying the statute of repose are reflected in the legislative history, specifically the 1978 Report of the Georgia Senate Products Liability Study Committee (\u201c1978 Report\u201d). <em>See Love v. Whirlpool Corp., </em>264 Ga. 701, 449 S.E.2d 602, 605 (Ga.1994) (citing the 1978 Report). The 1978 Report was created to address problems due to the \u201cradical alteration by the courts of the concept of product liability\u201d and the related \u201cskyrocket[ing]\u201d product liability insurance rates. (1978 Report at 1-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">After tracing the evolution of products liability litigation nationally, the 1978 Report addressed the effect of such litigation on products liability insurance rates in Georgia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-12\">[T]he Committee found that premium rates are based on national experience. As a result of the interstate nature of products commerce and the inability to generate Statewide experience of meaningful size, the [Georgia] Insurance Department allows product liability rates to be based on national data. Therefore, experience in other states is reflected in the premiums paid by Georgians.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">(1978 Report at 13.) The Report identified \u201cfive basic goals the Committee believes must be met if the product liability problem is to subside.\u201d (1978 Report at 17.) In order, those goals were (1) reducing \u201c[t]he instability and unpredictability associated with product liability litigation on a national level\u201d; (2) reducing \u201cthe number of accidents by placing the incentive for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>risk prevention on those parties best able to accomplish it\u201d; (3) ensuring \u201c[t]he entitlement of a person injured by an unsafe product to receive reasonable compensation\u201d; (4) ensuring \u201c[t]he availability and affordability of product liability insurance\u201d; and (5) establishing \u201c[a]n adequate data base ... to be used by insurance companies in establishing premium rates and by the Insurance Department in monitoring rates.\u201d (1978 Report at 17-19.) The Report concluded by making several recommendations to achieve those goals. The first such recommendation, and the only one relevant to this litigation, was to \u201c[e]stablish a ten-year statute of repose\u201d for products liability actions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (1978 Report at 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The 1978 Report makes clear that Georgia has an interest in applying its statute of repose here. Doing so would obviously advance Georgia\u2019s interest in stabilizing products liability litigation on a national level (i.e., it would result in one less litigation). Given that \u201cpremium rates are based on national experience\u201d and \u201cexperience in other states is reflected in the premiums paid by Georgians\u201d (1978 Report at 13), barring suits by plaintiffs such as Taylor will ultimately lead to decreased premium rates for Georgia manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Taylor claims that a policy of stabilizing national products liability litigation would only be implicated if either (1) the relevant products were designed, manufactured, distributed, or sold into the stream of commerce in Georgia, or (2) the defendant manufacturers were Georgia residents. This argument lacks merit because it creates a requirement beyond that which is required under Pennsylvania\u2019s choice of law analysis. For purposes of that analysis, it is sufficient that Georgia\u2019s contacts with this litigation implicate the policy. <em>See Hammersmith, </em>480 F.3d at 232. The policy to stabilize national products liability litigation is implicated whenever a party to a products liability case is a Georgia resident. In other words, Georgia has determined that run-away products liability litigation on a national level has led to increased products liability insurance rates for all manufacturers, including those from Georgia. Georgia has sought to address this problem by barring strict products liability (and negligence) suits after ten years. Therefore, Georgia has an interest in barring any such suit, and its interest is implicated anytime a party to such a suit is a Georgia resident. Here, Taylor is a Georgia resident, and thus Georgia has an interest in applying its statute of repose to bar his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\n<em>E. Pennsylvania\u2019s Interest In Applying Its Products Liability Law.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Pennsylvania has adopted Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A, which provides in relevant part: \u201cOne who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property.\u201d <em>Francioni v. Gibsonia Truck Corp., </em>472 Pa. 362, 372 A.2d 736, 738 (Pa.1977) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>(quoting Restatement \u00a7 402A). Unlike Georgia, Pennsylvania has no statute of repose that would bar Taylor\u2019s suit. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has explained that the \u201cthe policy basis for strict liability ... supports application of the rule to any supplier of a product who, because he is in the business of supplying products, assumes a special responsibility toward the consuming public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Restatement does not take a position as to whether a manufacturer of a defective product may be strictly liable to the general public <em>(ie., </em>one who is neither a user nor a consumer). <em>See </em>Restatement \u00a7 402A, cmt. o (\u201cThe Institute expresses neither approval nor disapproval of expansion of the rule to permit recovery by [bystanders].\u201d). Pennsylvania courts have not taken a position either, and federal courts attempting to predict the position Pennsylvania courts would take have reached different conclusions. <em>Compare Fedorchick v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc., </em>438 F.Supp. 60, 63 (E.D.Pa.1977), <em>aff'd </em>577 F.2d 725 (3d Cir.1978) (\u201c[W]e have no hesitancy in holding that Pennsylvania appellate courts, if faced with this issue, would extend \u00a7 402A\u2019s coverage to innocent bystanders.\u201d), and <em>Herman v. Welland Chemical, Ltd., </em>580 F.Supp. 823, 829 (M.D.Pa.1984) (same), <em>with Berrier v. Simplicity Corp., </em>413 F.Supp.2d 431, 439-42 (E.D.Pa.2005) (collecting cases and expressing doubt that Pennsylvania courts would permit bystanders to recover under a theory of strict liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Although Taylor argues that Pennsylvania\u2019s products liability law is based on a policy of protecting the general public, he points to no authorities in support of that position. To the contrary, the policy rationale articulated by Pennsylvania courts suggests that it was enacted only to protect \u201cthe consuming public.\u201d <em>Francioni, </em>372 A.2d at 738. Given that Pennsylvania\u2019s products liability law is based on Restatement \u00a7 402A, which itself takes no position as to whether the general public is protected under a strict liability theory, it does not appear that Pennsylvania adopted its strict products liability law to further its interest protecting the general public. Accordingly, Pennsylvania has no interest that would be impaired if Georgia law were applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\n<em>F. This Case Presents A False Conflict.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Because Georgia has a strong interest in applying its statute of repose, while Pennsylvania has no interest that would be impaired if its law were not applied, we are presented with a false conflict, and the law of the only interested jurisdiction should be applied. <em>See Lacey, </em>932 F.2d at 187. Accordingly, Georgia\u2019s statute of repose should be applied to bar Taylor\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">Although the District Court\u2019s choice of law analysis was insufficient, the District Court reached the correct result when it held that Georgia\u2019s statute of repose applied. Accordingly, we will affirm the result reached by the District Court, but for the reasons stated herein. <em>See Brumfield v. Sanders, </em>232 F.3d 376, 379 n. 2 (3d Cir.2000) (\u201cAn appellate court may affirm a result reached by the District Court on different reasons, as long as the record supports the judgement.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\">.

Of course, to the extent that Taylor has made statements of fact in prior court filings, he is barred from taking any position inconsistent with those statements under the doctrine of judicial admissions. <em>See Berckeley Inv. Group, Ltd. v. Colkitt, </em>455 F.3d 195, 211 n. 20 (3d Cir.2006). Honeywell argues that Taylor previously stated that Georgia law should apply broadly to the entire case, irrespective of the particular issue before the court. The statements identified by Honeywell are taken out of context. When viewed in context, it is clear that Taylor took no such position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\">.
