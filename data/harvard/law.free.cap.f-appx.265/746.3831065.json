Because Mr. Coburn has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-26\">Mr. Coburn pleaded guilty to one count of obtaining money by false pretense after former conviction of two or more felonies. The state court sentenced him to six years imprisonment. Mr. Coburn applied for post-conviction relief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and an excessive sentence, which was denied by the state trial court and affirmed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA). R. Doc. 13, Ex. 2-3. Mr. Coburn then filed his federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>petition raising the same two issues. R. Doc. 1 at 5-6. The district court determined that both issues had been exhausted, and denied the petition holding that the state courts\u2019 resolution of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not unreasonable, and that Mr. Coburn could not overcome the state procedural bar on his excessive sentence claim. <em>Coburn v. Howard, </em>No. 05-0647, 2007 WL 2111216, *4-*5 (ND.Okla. July 19, 2007). Seeking a COA, Mr. Coburn raises three issues: (1) ineffective assistance of counsel; (2) due process violations; and (3) denial of a fair trial because no counsel was present. We only address the first issue, because the other issues were not raised in his petition. <em>Tele-Communications, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>104 F.3d 1229, 1233 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">A petitioner may obtain federal habeas relief only if the state court decision was contrary to or \u201cinvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). State court factual findings are presumed correct; the presumption yields only based on clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The district court determined that the OCCA\u2019s adjudication of the ineffective assistance claim was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. <em>Coburn, </em>2007 WL 2111216, *4. First, construing Mr. Co-burn\u2019s argument as a factual argument, Mr. Coburn argues that he never met or communicated with his attorney, Richard Clark, and his attorney did not attend pretrial hearings or sentencing. The record shows that Mr. Clark attended sentencing, R. Doc. 13, Ex. 5 at 3, and that Mr. Coburn indicated on a form filed with the state court, \u201cFindings of Fact\u2014Acceptance of Plea,\u201d that he talked with his lawyer Richard Clark, R. Doc. 13, Ex. 6 at 2. Mr. Coburn presents no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Second, construing Mr. Coburn\u2019s argument as a legal argument, a petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the petitioner was prejudiced as a result. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To show prejudice in the context of a guilty plea, a petitioner \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). Applying these standards, the district court noted that Mr. Coburn does not allege any prejudice from the claimed deficient performance, only that being counseled by a legal intern was improper. The district court concluded that this prejudice is insufficient to meet the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test and was not an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent by the OCCA. <em>Coburn, </em>2007 WL 2111216, *4. We conclude that the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2254(d) to petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims was not reasonably debatable among jurists. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">We DENY the motion for a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
