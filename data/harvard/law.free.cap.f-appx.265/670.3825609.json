We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Neal-Allen\u2019s depression did not \u201cremain \u2018disabling\u2019 for at least 12 continuous months.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1509. Neal-Allen was diagnosed with symptoms of depression for a period of, at most, 11 months. Furthermore, several of the diagnoses during this period made it clear that her mental impairment, standing alone, did not rise to the level of severity necessary to be considered disabling under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">Substantial evidence also supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Neal-Allen\u2019s subjective complaints about the side effects of her medications were not credible. At the hearing, Neal-Allen indicated that she was taking Elavil to help her sleep at night, and Ultracet to control her pain. She stated that both of these medications made her drowsy. To the extent Neal-Allen was claiming that this drowsiness precluded her from working, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit that testimony. In particular, the ALJ found that \u201cshe takes care of three children all day, drives a car, goes to church three times a week, and otherwise leads a normal, active life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">Substantial evidence also supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that work \u201cexists in significant numbers\u201d in the regional economy for someone, with Neal-Allen\u2019s physical limitations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A). The hypothetical posed by the ALJ to the Vocational Expert (VE) was only required to contain those limitations that the ALJ found credible and supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Bayliss v. Barnhart, </em>427 F.3d 1211, 1217-18 (9th Cir.2005). Accordingly, he was not required to include depression in his hypothetical, and the VE\u2019s response to his first hypothetical provided substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">Finally, Neal-Allen has failed to demonstrate that her waiver of counsel was anything but knowing and well-informed, nor has she shown any prejudice or unfairness arising from that waiver. <em>See Key v. Heckler, </em>754 F.2d 1545, 1551 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
