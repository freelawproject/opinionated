In this petition, Hess challenges the November 2001 decision of the Oregon Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (\u201cBoard\u201d) to postpone his parole release date because it found that he exhibits \u201ca psychiatric or psychological diagnosis of a present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community.\u201d Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 144.125(3) (1991). Hess argues that section 144.125(3) is unconstitutionally vague and that the Board violated the Ex Post Facto Clause by applying the statute to him. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>1. Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Oregon Revised Statute \u00a7 144.125(3) is not facially vague because it \u201callows the Board to make a \u2018principled distinction\u2019 between those whose parole should be postponed and those whose parole should not.\u201d <em>Hess v. Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision, </em>514 F.3d 909 (9th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Jeffers, </em>497 U.S. 764, 776, 110 S.Ct. 3092, 111 L.Ed.2d 606 (1990)). We further hold that it was not vague as applied to Hess in November 2001, because the Board\u2019s decision was based on a psychological diagnosis that Hess suffers from Mixed Personality Disorder with Antisocial and Narcissistic Features, which the Board concluded was a severe condition such as to make Hess a danger to health or safety of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">\n<em>2. Ex Post Facto Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The Board may not apply a parole release statute that was not in effect at the time the prisoner committed his crimes if it \u201cworks to some significant disadvantage to the prisoner, creating a significant risk that the statute\u2019s application will increase the length of incarceration.\u201d <em>Brown v. Palmateer, </em>379 F.3d 1089, 1095 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Oregon courts have held that the pre1993 version of Oregon Revised Statute \u00a7 144.125(3), which existed at the time Hess committed his offenses, requires a \u201cpsychiatric or psychological diagnosis [a]s a prerequisite to the Board\u2019s consideration of whether the statutory criteria have been met.\u201d <em>Christenson v. Thompson, </em>176 Or. App. 54, 31 P.3d 449, 451 (2001) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); <em>see also Godleske v. Morrow, </em>161 Or.App. 523, 984 P.2d 339, 340 (1999). Because the Board\u2019s decision was based on a psychological diagnosis, the postponement of Hess\u2019 parole did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
