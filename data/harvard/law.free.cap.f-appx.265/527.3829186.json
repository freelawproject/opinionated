To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s credibility finding that Petitioners did not establish eligibility for asylum because of inconsistencies between their testimony and asylum applications. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938, 940 (9th Cir.2000) (upholding adverse credibility finding based on contradictions between the documentary evidence and female petitioner\u2019s testimony, as well as internal contradictions within her testimony, and contradictions between male petitioner\u2019s testimony and his asylum application).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-23\">The adverse credibility finding also supports the denial of withholding of removal. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156. Because Petitioners have cited to no other evidence in the record to support their claim that they would more likely than not be tor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>tured, we also uphold the agency\u2019s determination that Petitioners are not eligible for protection under CAT. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal on hardship grounds. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v.
