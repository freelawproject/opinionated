He was sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment. In his sole issue on appeal, DeLeon maintains the district court abused its discretion by replacing an impaneled, with an alternate, juror after the close of evidence but before deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The district court has the discretion to remove a juror who is \u201cunable to perform or ... [is] disqualified from performing [his] duties\u201d. Fed.R.CrimP. 24(c)(1); <em>United States v. Huntress, </em>956 F.2d 1309, 1312 (5th Cir.1992). The removal of the juror fell within the wide discretion afforded to the district court, in the light of its stated concern that, during deliberations, the juror could reveal the particularized information he possessed and act as a witness, thereby calling into question the validity of the verdict. <em>See Huntress, </em>956 F.2d at 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
