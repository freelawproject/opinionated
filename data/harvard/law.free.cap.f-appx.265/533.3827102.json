To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Murti does not dispute that his motion to reopen was filed more than ninety days after the BIA\u2019s June 23, 2004 decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that evidence of historical discrimination faced by Dalit caste members and of ongoing tensions between Sikhs and Indian authorities failed to establish that circumstances have changed in India so that Murti now has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also Malty, </em>381 F.3d at 945. The articles and Murti\u2019s affidavit were too general to establish changed circumstances in India. <em>See Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 530 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">We lack jurisdiction to review Murti\u2019s contention that the evidence supporting his claim for asylum on account of his membership in the Dalit caste was previously undiscoverable under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii) because he did not raise this argument before the BIA. <em>See Camposeco-Montejo v. Ashcroft, </em>384 F.3d 814, 821 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review a legal argument not raised by petitioner before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
