Johnson raises three issues on appeal. He argues that (1) the sentence for each of his firearms convictions should have been determined by \u00a7 924(c) (1) (A) (ii), which governs a defendant\u2019s first firearms offense; (2) his cumulative sentences for the underlying carjacking offenses and the firearms offenses violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the offenses arose out of the same conduct; and (3) Count Four of the indictment failed to allege that he caused serious bodily harm, and, thus, it was improper to sentence him under \u00a7 2119(2). We review each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-18\">Johnson first argues that \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) does not apply to his second and third firearms offenses, as the existence of the first firearms count does not make the later two \u201csubsequent convictions.\u201d Rather, he claims that each of his firearms convictions should have been de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>termined by \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), which governs a defendant\u2019s first firearms offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The interpretation of a criminal statute is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2004). Section 924(c)(1) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-6\">(A) any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-7\">(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-8\">(C) In the case of a second or subsequent conviction under this subsection, the person shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-9\">(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT-\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), (C)(i). The Supreme Court, in <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 131-37, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 1995-99, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993), rejected a defendant\u2019s argument that the \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d language of \u00a7 924(c)(1) was ambiguous and should be construed in his favor under the rule of lenity, instead finding that the language of the statute, when read in context, made it clear that it referred not only to prior judgments of conviction, but also to subsequent offenses alleged within the same indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Because the Supreme Court has rejected the position that the enhanced penalty for a \u201csecond or successive\u201d firearms conviction under \u00a7 924(e)(l)(C)(i) applies only to prior judgments of conviction, the district court did not err by imposing a 25-year sentence for Johnson\u2019s second and third firearms counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">Next, Johnson asserts, without explanation, that his convictions for both the underlying carjacking offenses and the firearms offenses violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the offenses arose out of the same conduct. We review a double jeopardy claim de <em>novo </em>as a question of law. <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>78 F.3d 501, 503 (11th Cir.1996). We explicitly have held that \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the imposition of cumulative punishments for violating sections 924(c) [the firearm statute] and 2119 [the carjacking statute] of Title 18.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>43 F.3d 568, 574 (11th Cir.1994). We acknowledged that the Double Jeopardy Clause is intended to protect against multiple punishments for a single offense when Congress did not intend to set forth cumulative punishments, but concluded, based on the plain language of \u00a7 924(c), that Congress clearly intended to punish cumulatively violations of \u00a7 2119 and \u00a7 924(c). <em>Id. </em>at 571-73. Accordingly, the district court did not err in imposing such punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">Finally, Johnson asserts that Count Four of the indictment did not allege that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>he caused serious bodily harm, and, thus, it was improper to sentence him under \u00a7 2119(2), which sets forth a maximum sentence of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment if the carjacking results in serious bodily injury. Johnson refers to <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 240, 252, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 1222, 1228, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), where the Supreme Court held that the \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d language in \u00a7 2119(2) states a distinct offense element, rather than a sentencing factor, and, as such, must be alleged specifically in the indictment in order to sustain the enhanced penalty provided for in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Count Four of the second superseding indictment, however, <em>did in fact </em>allege that the carjacking resulted in serious bodily injury, and therefore Johnson is factually incorrect in his assertion to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">For the above reasons, we affirm Johnson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-10\">. In response to the defendant\u2019s argument that such an interpretation would subject him to a \"glaringly unjust\u201d sentence, given his lack of prior convictions, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-11\">Even under the dissent\u2019s reading of \u00a7 924(c)(1) (which would require that a defendant have received a prior judgment of conviction before the \"second or subsequent conviction\u201d provision applied], some criminals whose only offenses consist of six armed bank robberies would receive a total sentence of 105 years in prison. We see no reason why it is \"glaringly unjust\u201d that petitioner be treated similarly here, simply because he managed to evade detection, prosecution, and conviction for the first five offenses and was ultimately tried for all six in a single proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-16\"><em>Deal, </em>508 U.S. at 137, 113 S.Ct. at 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
