Gay, Jr., Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Western District of Texas, San Antonio, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Before HIGGINBOTHAM, STEWART and OWEN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b408-5\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The district court granted Eric James Dixon\u2019s request to represent himself at his criminal trial on charges of possession of a firearm by a felon and appointed stand-by counsel to assist Dixon. After a jury convicted Dixon, the district court sentenced him to an 87-month term of imprisonment. Dixon is represented by appointed counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Dixon argues that the trial court\u2019s comments on his pro se performance prejudiced the jury against him and caused his trial to be fundamentally unfair. We conclude that Dixon preserved this argument for appellate review by objecting to the court\u2019s comments during a sidebar conference. Dixon also argues that the trial court plainly erred at sentencing when it determined that his prior Texas conviction for attempted deadly conduct was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">We review a defendant\u2019s complaints about a trial judge\u2019s conduct to determine \u201cnot ... whether the [ ] conduct left something to be desired or even whether some comments would have been better left unsaid ... [but to] determine whether the judge\u2019s behavior was so prejudicial that it denied [the defendant] a fair, as opposed to a perfect, trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>809 F.2d 1072, 1086 (5th Cir.1987) (quoting <em>United States v. Pisani, </em>773 F.2d 397, 402 (2d Cir.1985)). A federal judge may \u201ccomment on the evidence, ... question witnesses, ... and may maintain the pace of the trial by interrupting or cutting off counsel as a matter of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">All of the judicial comments that Dixon challenges on appeal were directed to Dixon\u2019s persistent attempts to argue to the jury issues that had been resolved against him in pretrial motions. Dixon ignored the court\u2019s repeated explanation that Dixon could raise the issues for appeal, but that he could not present them for the jury to consider at trial. Dixon does not suggest that he is entitled to appellate relief based on any of the defense theories that he attempted to raise at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">The district court instructed the jury to base its verdict solely on the evidence and not to construe the court\u2019s comments as indicating any opinion as to Dixon\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>See United States v. Johnston, </em>127 F.3d 380, 388 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Williams, </em>809 F.2d at 1088. When viewed as a whole, the trial court\u2019s efforts to exclude a legally irrelevant defense theory were not an abuse of discretion and did not cause the trial to be constitutionally unfair. <em>See United States v. Bermea, </em>30 F.3d 1539, 1569 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Williams, </em>809 F.2d at 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">Because Dixon did not argue at sentencing that his prior conviction for attempted deadly conduct is not a crime of violence under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), the issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 3031, 168 L.Ed.2d 748 (2007). Dixon must show that there is a clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The Sentencing Guidelines provide that the base offense level for unlawful possession of a firearm by a prohibited person is 14. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6). If the offense \u201cinvolved a firearm,\u201d as did Dixon\u2019s offense, the base offense level is increased to 18. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(5). The base level is increased to 20 if the defendant has a prior conviction for a crime of violence. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). In relevant part, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is an offense or attempted offense punishable under federal or state law by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year that either \u201c(1) has as an element the use attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) ... involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n. 1); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), (2) and comment, (n. 1). To be considered a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), the conduct presenting a serious potential risk of physical injury to another must be expressly charged in the count of conviction. \u00a7 4B2.1, comment, (n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">A person commits the Texas offense of deadly conduct if he: \u201c(a) ... recklessly engages in conduct that places another in imminent danger of serious bodily injury [or] (b) ... knowingly discharges a firearm at or in the direction of ... (1) one or more individuals; or (2) a habitation, building, or vehicle and is reckless as to whether the habitation, building, or vehicle is occupied.\u201d Tex Penal Code \u00a7 22.05. In the conviction at issue, Dixon was indicted for aggravated assault, but he pleaded guilty to attempted deadly conduct pursuant to a plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">We disagree with the Government\u2019s contention that <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>479 F.3d 845, 348 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014-, 128 S.Ct. 61, 169 L.Ed.2d 51 (2007), and <em>United States v. Hernandez-Rodriguez, </em>467 F.3d 492 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1350, 167 L.Ed.2d 143 (2007) compel the conclusion that the Texas offense of deadly conduct is a crime of violence. <em>Dominguez </em>is not relevant to the issue in this ease and <em>Hernandez-Rodriguez </em>dealt with a conviction under \u00a7 22.05(b)(1), which prohibits the knowing discharge of a firearm at or in the direction of one or more individuals. <em>See Hernandez-Rodriguez, </em>467 F.3d at 494; \u00a7 22.05(b)(1). <em>Hernandez-Rodriguez </em>does not hold that a generic conviction under \u00a7 22.05 is a crime of violence. <em>Hernandez-Rodriguez, </em>467 F.3d at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">We employ the categorical approach established in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) to determine whether a prior offense is a crime of violence because it has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of force or because it inherently presents a serious potential risk of physical injury. <em>Hernandez-Rodriguez, </em>467 F.3d at 494; <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Jaimes, </em>481 F.3d 283, 286 (5th Cir.2007). If a statute contains multiple, disjunctive subsections, we may consider other conclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt in order to determine which statutory subsection applies to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Hernandez-Rodriguez, </em>467 F.3d at 494. It is not possible from the documents available in this case to identify the specific subsection of \u00a7 22.05 that Dixon was convicted of violating.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">We conclude that a generic conviction for violating \u00a7 22.05 is not a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l) because that guideline requires \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d while \u00a7 22.05(b)(2) prohibits the knowing discharge \u201cof a firearm at or in the direction of a habitation, building, or vehicle, with reckless disre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>gard as to whether the habitation, building, or vehicle is occupied.\u201d \u00a7 22.05(b)(2); \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l); <em>see United States v. Alfaro, </em>408 F.3d 204, 206-09 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rodriguez-Jaimes, </em>481 F.3d at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Absent the crime of violence enhancement, Dixon\u2019s base offense level would have been 18 and the applicable sentencing guidelines range would have been 57-to-71 months, \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6); U.S.S.G., Sentencing Table, a range that does not include the 87-month sentence Dixon received. Because the PSR does not reveal any other prior convictions that would qualify as a crime of violence, Dixon has shown clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Dixon\u2019s conviction, VACATE his sentence, and REMAND the case for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
