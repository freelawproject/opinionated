Qazi argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because the Government did not prove that he knew that he was prohibited from possessing a firearm because of his immigration status. Qazi argues that the Due Process Clause requires a heightened level of <em>mens rea </em>because possession of a firearm by a non-immigrant visa holder is a passive offense that would not be viewed as a criminal act by the average person.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-22\">Qazi concedes that this court has rejected his arguments in analogous firearm-possession cases and raises the issues solely to preserve them for further review. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>325 F.3d 553, 564 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Emerson, </em>270 F.3d 203, 215-16 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Dancy, </em>861 F.2d 77, 81-82 (5th Cir.1988). Based on this concession, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the Government has moved that this court summarily affirm Qazi\u2019s conviction without additional briefing. The Government represented that Qazi did not object to summary affirmance and stipulated that Qazi\u2019s brief preserved his issues for further review. Alternatively, the Government moved for an extension of time to file a brief should summary affirmance be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Given the foregoing, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
