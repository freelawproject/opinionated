We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Ocampo contends that the district court erred in erred in applying a two level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), for possession of a firearm. We disagree. The district court properly determined that Ocampo possessed a firearm during the commission of the conspiracy, <em>see United States v. Lopez-Sandoval, </em>146 F.3d 712, 715 (9th Cir.1998), and it was not \u201cclearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 3. Accordingly, the district court properly applied a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm. <em>See United States v. Restrepo, </em>884 F.2d 1294, 1296 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Ocampo further contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately weigh or discuss the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors generally, and specifically failed to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities, as required by \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Upon review of the record, we are satisfied that the district court followed the appropriate procedures: it properly calculated the Guidelines range, gave consideration to each of</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, considered the parties\u2019 arguments, and provided sufficient reasons for the sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Ocampo\u2019s sentencing disparity argument fails because Ocampo is dissimilar to his co-defendants in a number of material respects and his relatively long sentence is therefore not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Corona-Verbera, </em>509 F.3d 1105, 1119-20 (9th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">Ocampo\u2019s motion for leave to file a supplemental transcript designation, filed on March 20, 2007, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

R.App. P. 28(j), to consider the recent Supreme Court decisions in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Neither <em>Gall </em>nor <em>Kimbrough </em>alters the result in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
