Bazan Garza appeals his sentence. He argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it is the result of an erroneous balancing of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Specifically, he contends that the district court failed to give sufficient mitigating weight to his history of mental illness and improperly relied on this factor to support its chosen term of imprisonment, which was contrary to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a). Bazan Garza also challenges this court\u2019s application of a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to a sentence that falls within the defendant\u2019s guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Our review of the record shows no clear error in connection with the district court\u2019s exercise of its broad sentencing discretion. <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). Bazan Garza\u2019s \u00a7 3582 argument is likewise nonpersuasive, as the record reflects that the district court gave proper weight to Bazan Garza\u2019s need for treatment. <em>See United States v. Giddings, </em>37 F.3d 1091, 1096 &amp; n. 17 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Lara-Velasquez, </em>919 F.2d 946, 956 n. 13 (5th Cir.1990). Bazan Garza\u2019s challenge to the presumption of reasonableness is unavailing. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Bazan Garza has failed to show error in connection with his sentence. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b185-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that tins opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
