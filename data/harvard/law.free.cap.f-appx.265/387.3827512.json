Causey, </em>752 So.2d 287, 289 (La.Ct.App.2000). The trial court adjudicated Causey as a third felony offender and sentenced him to life imprisonment without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence. <em>Id. </em>Causey filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition challenging that conviction and sentence. Causey now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 petition as time barred. Causey argues that the district court erred in finding that he did not place his state certiorari petition in the prison mail on or before February 25, 2000, the deadline for filing. Although Causey challenges the reliability of the state\u2019s evidence of the date of filing, he has not shown that the district court clearly erred in its factual finding. <em>See Alexander v. Cockrell, </em>294 F.3d 626, 628 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-25\">Causey\u2019s equitable tolling argument is beyond the scope of remand and therefore is not before this court. Nonetheless, Causey has not shown the \u201crare and exceptional circumstances\u201d necessary to warrant equitable tolling. <em>See Felder v. John</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>son, </em>204 F.3d 168, 170-71 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
