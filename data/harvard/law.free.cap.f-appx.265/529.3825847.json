To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings, <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen, where the BIA considered the evidence they submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-16\">To the extent the petitioners contend that the BIA failed to consider some or all of the evidence they submitted with the motion to reopen, they have not overcome the presumption that the BIA did review the record. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-17\">Petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions are not availing.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-18\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s underlying order dismissing the petitioners\u2019 direct appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision because this petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b554-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
