Lobato pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(A). Mr. Lobato was sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, five years\u2019 supervised release, and a $1,500 fine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After Mr. Lobato timely filed a notice of appeal, his counsel filed an <em>Anders </em>brief and motion to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Mr. Lobato was served with a copy of the <em>Anders </em>brief but did not file a response. The government contends that this case should be remanded to the district court for a further hearing on the application of an enhancement used to calculate the sentence. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), we have independently reviewed the record and we deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The <em>Anders </em>brief addresses whether the district court erred by imposing a three-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). In considering whether the enhancement is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, Mr. Lobato argues that the court failed to resolve a factual dispute concerning whether Mr. Lobato acted as a manager or supervisor in a conspiracy involving five or more participants. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) found that a \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) enhancement was warranted because Mr. Lobato managed or supervised at least two people and the overall conspiracy involved at least five or more participants. After receiving the PSR, Mr. Lobato objected to its factual findings, claiming that he did not manage or supervise five or more people. The probation office rightly responded that \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) only requires that a defendant manage or supervise at least one person so long as the conspiracy involves at least five people. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) &amp; cmt. n. 2. Armed with the correct understanding of \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), Mr. Lobato objected at sentencing to the PSR, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(l)(D), claiming that he did not manage or supervise anyone. The district court considered the merits of Mr. Lobato\u2019s objection, but overruled it based solely upon the facts presented in the PSR. The government concedes this constituted error because Mr. Lobato\u2019s factual objection was sufficient to invoke the district court\u2019s Rule 32 fact-finding obligation. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B); <em>United States v. Guzman, </em>318 F.3d 1191, 1198 (10th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Mr. Lobato also argues that the enhancement effectively denied him his three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. However, as the application of advisory Guidelines enhancements and adjustments are cumulative, this argument is wholly frivolous. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 lBl.l(c), (e) &amp; cmt. n. 4(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">Because counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw was based on his belief that Mr. Lobato had no meritorious arguments on appeal and because the government concedes error, we DENY counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We REMAND to the district court to VACATE Mr. Lobato\u2019s sentence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>resentence him in accordance with this order and judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b732-30\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-6\">. The district court imposed Mr. Lobato's sentence using the 2006 version of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \"Guidelines\u201d). With a total offense level of 38 and a criminal history category of VI, the advisory guideline range was 360 months to life. The total offense level included a three-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3 B 1.1(b) for an aggravating role as a manager or supervisor in a conspiracy involving five or more people, and a three-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b733-12\">. This error was not harmless as a three-level reduction in Mr. Lobato\u2019s offense level would yield a Guidelines range of 292 to 365 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
