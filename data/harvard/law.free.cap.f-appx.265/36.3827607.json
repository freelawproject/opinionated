Horn, denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yun Qin Lian, </em>No. A98 690 005 (B.I.A. Apr. 23, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 690 005 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 24, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, <em>ie., </em>\u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Belortaja v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 619, 623 (2d Cir.2007). Nevertheless, we may vacate and remand for new findings when we determine that the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See, e.g., Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">Here, we cannot avoid being troubled by language in the IJ\u2019s decision positing that because Lian recently terminated two pregnancies voluntarily in the United States due to poor fetal health, she may be infertile, incapable of \u201chaving healthy children,\u201d or otherwise afflicted with \u201ca propensity for having abortions for medical reasons.\u201d <em>In re Yun Qin Lian, </em>slip. op. at 30. To the extent these assertions represent a finding by the IJ that Lian would be physically incapable of carrying a child to term, they are misplaced; no medical evidence in the record could support such a conclusion, even assuming it has relevance to her claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>In addition, we have significant reservations about the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Lian gave \u201cscant and flimsy testimony\u201d when describing the abortion procedures she claimed to have been subjected to while in China. As we often note, when an IJ has concerns about the credibility of an alien\u2019s vague testimony, the appropriate course is to probe for further details. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 151-52 (2d Cir.2003), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007). Because there always exists the potential for more description, a standard permitting an IJ \u201cto rule against a petitioner who fails to anticipate the particular set of details that the fact-finder desires (but does not request, through questions directed to the applicant) is no standard at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Lian testified before the IJ that with nurses holding her down and her legs bound in the air, she \u201chear[d] some kind of scratch metal noise and then some kind of equipment they put into my lower part of my body.\u201d She explained that she felt someone \u201cput something inside of me and stirred it up. I only feel my lower abdomen was in pain, my back was in pain and my heart was feeling nausea.\u201d Neither Government counsel nor the IJ asked Lian to elaborate any further, and she could hardly have been expected to volunteer additional details about the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">When \u201ca case, like this one, rises and falls purely on an IJ\u2019s credibility finding, courts have been particularly concerned that the decision-maker carefully detail the reasoning leading to the adverse finding.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). A determination based on flawed reasoning will not satisfy the substantial evidence standard. <em>Id. </em>at 309. Remand is therefore necessary in this case because the errors we have described undermine several of the grounds supporting the IJ\u2019s decision, making it impossible for us to state with confidence that the IJ would reach the same decision absent error. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339 (2d Cir.2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">On remand, the Government is free to argue that the socalled \u201cabortion certificates\u201d Lian submitted to the IJ were either inauthentic or otherwise inconsistent with her claim that she underwent forced abortions. <em>See generally Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006). But inasmuch as the BIA once again \u201cintends to take administrative notice of potentially dispositive facts, it must warn a petitioner and provide the petitioner with an opportunity to respond before it ... enters a final order of removal on the basis of the administratively noticed facts.\u201d <em>See Burger v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 131, 132-33 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED, and the case REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of Lian\u2019s removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-11\">. In connection with this petition, Lian referenced an article from the Journal of the American Medical Association suggesting that the complications during her pregnancies may be attributable to the forced abortion procedures. We are sympathetic to the point that Lian\u2019s health issues, if relevant at all, can give rise to competing inferences. But because she never provided this article to the BIA, we may not consider it in this case. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b62-6\">. Under the circumstances, we strongly urge that this case be assigned to a different IJ. <em>See Wu Zheng Huang v. INS, </em>436 F.3d 89, 101-02 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
