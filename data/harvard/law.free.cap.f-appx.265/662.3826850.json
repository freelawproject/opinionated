Sandoval, United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">After a hearing before an IJ, Gabriel Benavides-Pina was denied discretionary relief from deportation under sections 212(c) and 241(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(c), 1251(a)(1)(H) (1994). He filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, asserting that he was denied due process because the IJ was biased against him. The district court denied the petition and Benavides-Pina appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Because the appeal was pending in this court upon enactment of the REAL ID Act, we treat it as a timely filed petition for review. <em>Alvarez-Barajas v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1050, 1053 (9th Cir.2005). As a petition for review, we review the agency\u2019s decision, not the district court\u2019s order. <em>Id. </em>Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, \u201cwe evaluate the IJ\u2019s decision as we would that of the Board.\u201d <em>Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 917, 925 (9th Cir.2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">This court lacks jurisdiction to review any discretionary \u201cdecision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). However, we retain jurisdiction to review colorable constitutional claims or questions of law pertaining to the agency\u2019s discretionary hardship determination. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">The record does not reflect that the IJ violated Benavides-Pina\u2019s due process rights by failing to act as a neutral adjudicator. Nothing in the record suggests that the IJ prejudged the merits of the case. The IJ heard testimony from Benavides-Pina\u2019s four witnesses and made no statements indicating that he reached any conclusions about the case before he heard testimony. <em>Cf. Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 963-64 (9th Cir.2002) (due process violation where IJ said at the beginning of the hearing \u201cI believe you have no basis for a claim to asylum\u201d). Benavides-Pina\u2019s characterization of the IJ\u2019s questioning of witnesses as \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d is also inaccurate. From the transcript, the IJ\u2019s interventions were appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-15\">Benavides-Pina\u2019s argument that the IJ prevented him from describing the DEA agent\u2019s alleged lie is also unsupported by the record. The IJ allowed Benavides-Pina to speak at length about his conviction. Further, viewing the transcript as a whole, Benavides-Pina had ample opportunity to present his case. His four witnesses gave over 180 pages of testimony. <em>Cf. Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (due process violation where IJ\u2019s remark indicated that he pre-judged claim and IJ would not let asylum applicant testify about anything in his written application).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-16\">Benavides-Pina also argues that the IJ \u201cerroneously and unconstitutionally\u201d found that (1) he was not rehabilitated for his past actions and (2) his family was not close. In substance, he is challenging the fact that the IJ considered these factors in denying discretionary relief. We lack jurisdiction to review an abuse of discretion argument merely re-characterized as a due process argument. <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>Martinez-Rosas v.
