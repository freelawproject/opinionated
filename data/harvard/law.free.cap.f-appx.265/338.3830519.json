He argues that the district court erred when it increased his offense level by two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) for his role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">A defendant qualifies for an adjustment under \u00a7 3B 1.1(c) if he was the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of at least one other participant. <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>476 F.3d 369, 390 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2893, 167 L.Ed.2d 1164 (2007); \u00a7 3B1.1 (comment, n. 2.). Factors that the district court considers include the exercise of decisionmaking authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others. \u00a7 3B1.1 (comment, n. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Testimony established that without Ca-son\u2019s computer and expertise, neither Hunsuckle nor Julian could have committed fraud. Hunsuckle\u2019s testimony established that Cason directed her as a secretary when he advised her as to what mail to keep, what mail to throw out, and what to record. Cason mischaracterizes Hun-suckle\u2019s testimony that she did not \u201clike\u201d to write checks over a certain amount as testimony that she maintained decision-making authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">Moreover, Cason\u2019s emphasis on testimony that he recruited Hunsuckle and that she profited the most from the venture is unavailing. In light of the record as a whole, the finding that Cason functioned as a leader or organizer of the fraud is plausible and is not clear error. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 560, 584 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1139, 126 S.Ct. 2045, 164 L.Ed.2d 799, <em>and cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1180, 126 S.Ct. 2362, 165 L.Ed.2d 280, <em>and cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1180, 126 S.Ct. 2363, 165 L.Ed.2d 280, <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 157, 166 L.Ed.2d 39 (2006); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>319 F.3d 716, 725 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Parker, </em>133 F.3d 322, 330 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
