Plaintiffs contend that they made a prima facie case of each of their claims, that the nondiscriminatory reasons proffered by TCE for each of the challenged employment decisions were factually inaccurate, and that they have raised a sufficient fact question on the issue of pretext to survive summary judgment. Plaintiffs argue that the district court applied the incorrect legal standard in concluding that they failed to raise a fact question regarding pretext, relying on <em>Laxton v. Gap Inc., </em>333 F.3d 572, 578 (5th Cir.2003). However, we conclude that the district court applied the proper legal standard, as <em>Laxton </em>defines an employer\u2019s \u201cexplanation [a]s false or unworthy of credence <em>if it is not the real reason for the adverse employment action,\u201d </em>not merely if the employer may have been mistaken in its good faith belief in its proffered explanation. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-23\">The district court\u2019s thorough and detailed memorandum and order stating its reasons for granting TCE\u2019s motion for summary judgment comprehensively addressed each and every one of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. The memorandum explained that Plaintiffs failed to make a prima facie case of some of their claims, including their hostile work environment claim (which was raised in Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, abandoned in their summary judgment responses, but resurrected in their briefs on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>appeal), and failed to raise a fact issue regarding pretext on <em>any </em>of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Because we could not improve upon the reasoning of the district court, we AFFIRM the judgment for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
