Burr, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yifeng Shao, </em>No. A96 389 856 (B.I.A. Mar. 24, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 389 856 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 4, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">As an initial matter, although Shao is challenging the denial of relief in \u201casylum-only\u201d proceedings\u2014as opposed to an actual removal order\u2014we nonetheless have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) because the denial of relief in these circumstances is the functional equivalent of a removal order. <em>See Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 134 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>See Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. The multiple specific examples of discrepancies between Shao\u2019s testimony and the record\u2014e.g., his failure to mention during his airport interviews<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> any of the events that would later serve as the basis for his asylum claim and the inconsistency with his friend\u2019s letter regarding whether they were arrested, detained, and beaten separately or together\u2014provided sufficient bases on which the agency could conclude that he was not credible. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overmled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). Although Shao offered explanations for most of the discrepancies found by the agency, no reasonable fact-finder would have been compelled to accept them. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, because Shao\u2019s testimony was not otherwise credible, it was not improper for the agency to rely on the absence of hospital records, which may have corroborated his injuries at the hands of police, as further support for its adverse credibility determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006). Rather, the absence of such evidence merely rendered Shao unable to rehabilitate his testimony, which had already been called into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">In addition, given that Shao bore the burden of demonstrating that he possessed a subjective basis for his fear of persecution, <em>see Ramsameachire, </em>357 F.3d at 178, the BIA reasonably found that his bald statement that he started practicing Falun Gong subsequent to his merits hearing was insufficient to support a well-founded fear of persecution. Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Finally, because Shao failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of his CAT claim in his brief to the BIA, as a statutory matter, we are without jurisdiction to consider any challenge to the denial of that relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Accordingly, we dismiss Shao\u2019s petition for review with respect to CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. As we have completed our review, Shao\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. In addition, the pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1). Finally, Shao\u2019s pending motion for summary reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-10\">. We agree with the BIA that the airport interview statements were sufficiently reliable to merit consideration in the credibility determination. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179-80 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-14\"><em>. </em>Because our review is limited to \"the administrative record on which the [challenged] order of removal is based,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A), we may not consider a medical report discussing an X-ray examination of Shao\u2019s damaged finger, submitted here for the first time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
