We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-20\">Burruel-Bojorquez contends that the district court erred by denying him safety valve relief. The district court denied relief because Burruel-Bojorquez failed to truthfully provide the government all the information and evidence he had concerning the offense by the time of the sentencing hearing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Burruel-Bojorquez failed to meet this criterion. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Pimental, </em>477 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2007) (explaining good faith effort under \u00a7 3553(f)(5) requires a defendant to provide the government with truthful and complete information by the time of the sentencing hearing); <em>see also United States v. Ajugwo, </em>82 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir.1996) (affirming denial of safety valve reduction where district court found that defendant had not been as forthcoming as she could have been).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b620-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
