For the reasons given below, his petition will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Petitioner, a native and citizen of India, entered the United States without inspection in 1999. He was ordered removed <em>in absentia </em>in 2001. In 2004, he successfully moved to reopen the proceeding. At a subsequent hearing before an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), he conceded removability. He applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), arguing that he would be subject to persecution and torture in India on account of his Hindu faith. The IJ found petitioner\u2019s testimony not credible and ordered his removal on October 8, 2004. Shah appealed, and the BIA affirmed on July 17, 2006. Shah moved for reconsideration and reopening. On November 17, 2006, the BIA denied that motion. Shah has petitioned this court for review of the BIA\u2019s order of November 17, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">We review the denial of a motion to reconsider and reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 562 (3d Cir.2004). \u201cUnder the abuse of discretion standard, the Board\u2019s decision must be reversed if it is arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 175 (3d Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law, including whether a petitioner\u2019s right to due process was violated. <em>See Mudric v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>469 F.3d 94, 98 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-16\">Petitioner makes two claims of error with regard to the denial of his motion to reopen and reconsider.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-17\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-18\">First, petitioner contends that the BIA denied him due process of law and abused its discretion because the BIA refused to consider the evidence petitioner submitted in support of his motion on the ground that the evidence was \u201ctime-barred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-19\">Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), a motion to reopen \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered ... was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d <em>See Caushi v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>436 F.3d 220, 231 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-20\">The BIA did not fail to consider the evidence presented by petitioner. The BIA\u2019s opinion discusses the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>detail, concluding that the evidence was not properly presented in a motion to reopen because it could have been discovered or presented at petitioner\u2019s 2004 hearing. Petitioner does not identify errors in the BIA\u2019s determination that the evidence could have been presented in 2004; nor are any such errors apparent. Accordingly, we find no merit in petitioner\u2019s challenge, on this ground, to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen and reconsider.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Second, petitioner contends that the BIA denied him due process of law \u201csince he was never given the opportunity to present his case to a judge prior to the original order being entered\u201d in 2001, <em>in absentia </em>and allegedly without notice to petitioner. This argument is without merit, because petitioner was not removed on the basis of the 2001 order of removal. Rather, following the reopening of his case in 2004, petitioner was given a full and fair opportunity to present evidence on his own behalf at a hearing held on October 8, 2004. Petitioner, represented by counsel, conceded removability and presented evidence in support of his applications for relief. His petition will therefore be denied on this ground as well.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-12\">. Petitioner has petitioned for review only of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen and reconsider. Because petitioner did not petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order of July 17, 2006, dismissing his appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial of relief, we lack jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 404-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Accordingly, we cannot consider petitioner's contention that the BIA erred in that order in affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-22\">. Petitioner does not contend that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) is itself unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
