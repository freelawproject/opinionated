He presents two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-23\">Zarazua maintains the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement, pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), based on determining his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence (COV). Zarazua recognizes our court has held that an offense committed under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) (burglary of a habitation), the statute of his conviction, is a COV for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, but he maintains the recent decision in <em>James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1599-1600, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), overrules our court\u2019s precedent. This contention is without merit; <em>James </em>does <em>not </em>concern enumerated offenses and pertains only to a residual provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), which \u00a7 2L1.2 does not contain. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d 301, 303 n. 1 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number><em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 156, 169 L.Ed.2d 106 (2007). The district court did not err in applying the COV enhancement. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Zarazua challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors, rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This contention is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872,169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
