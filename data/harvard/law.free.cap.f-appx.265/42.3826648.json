On appeal, Curaj argues that the IJ erred in denying his claims for relief and that the IJ\u2019s hostility toward Curaj violated his due process rights. Because we conclude that the IJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and that Curaj\u2019s due process rights were not violated, we will deny the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-16\">Curaj is a native and citizen of Albania. He claims numerous instances of past persecution by the Socialist Party because of his membership in the Democratic Party, including four assaults by Socialist Party members between 1997 and 2001; vandalism of his mother\u2019s home in 2000; harassment and threats of imminent imprisonment at his wedding in 2002; and threatening phone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-17\">The IJ concluded that many of the alleged instances of persecution were nothing more than isolated acts of violence, and moreover, Curaj\u2019s testimony was not credible. The IJ deemed that a newspaper article submitted to the court \u201csmacks of unreliability,\u201d because it was incompletely translated and appeared to be concocted in order to support Curaj\u2019s asylum application. (App.48.) Moreover, the IJ found Curaj to be \u201ctotally incredible and totally unbelievable\u201d as to his account of his 2002 wedding. (App.70.) The IJ elaborated that it was unreasonable for Curaj to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>been intimidated by the arrival of four Socialist Party members, or to fear arrest despite no wrongdoing, when 100 attendants were present and could corroborate Curaj\u2019s innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">We review the IJ\u2019s or BIA\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are based on substantial evidence. \u201cUnder this deferential standard of review, we must uphold [a factual] determination of the BIA or IJ unless \u2018any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)). Applying this standard to the record before us, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and the resulting denial of relief were supported by substantial evidence. <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 247 (3d Cir.2003) (\u201cAn alien\u2019s credibility, by itself, may satisfy his burden, or doom his claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Curaj also argues that the IJ denied him due process of the law by constantly interrupting him and his attorney, and berating him when he testified that he left his mother at home alone to go into hiding. An IJ\u2019s statements and behavior while conducting a hearing may rise to the level of a due process violation where the IJ insults and belittles a petitioner. <em>See Wang v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>423 F.3d 260, 265-69 (3d Cir.2005) (calling the petitioner a \u201chorrible father,\u201d and stating that she found it \u201cinfuriating\u201d that Wang \u201cnever even one time did anything honest\u201d). However, mere discourtesy on the part of an IJ is insufficient to constitute a due process violation. <em>See Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 597 (3d Cir.2003) (stating that a due process violation had not occurred even though the IJ\u2019s language \u201creflect[ed] an annoyance and dissatisfaction with [the alien]\u2019s testimony that is far from commendable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In this case, assuming the IJ\u2019s comments reflected impatience and annoyance, they did not rise to the level of a due process violation. Moreover, the IJ\u2019s interruptions did not preclude Curaj from testifying fully. Therefore, we hold that there was no denial of due process of the law based upon the IJ\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-18\">. The BIA\u2019s jurisdiction arose under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b)(3) and (9). This Court has jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
