To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the agency\u2019s continuous physical presence determination for substantial evidence. <em>See Ibarra-Flores v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 614, 618 (9th Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s application of a statute de novo. <em>See Khourassany v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 1096, 1101 (9th Cir.2000). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that neither petitioner met the continuous physical presence requirement where the record shows they were placed in expedited removal proceedings during the statutory time period. <em>See Juarez-Ramos v. Gonzales, </em>485 F.3d 509, 512 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that expedited removal interrupts an alien\u2019s continuous physical presence for cancellation purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The agency did not err in finding Huerta Bravo ineligible for voluntary departure because it correctly applied the statute barring an alien who has assisted in alien smuggling from meeting the good moral character requirement for voluntary departure. <em>See Khourassany, </em>208 F.3d at 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s denial of Vergara Vildozola\u2019s re,quest for voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f) (no court shall have jurisdiction over an appeal from the denial of voluntary departure); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 654 (9th Cir.2007) (notwithstanding any other statutory jurisdictional bar, the court retains jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) to review questions of law, including the application of law to undisputed facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
