The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the City and Leon. De Angelis appeals that ruling, as well as the district court\u2019s denial of De Angelis\u2019s recusal motion and the district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions against De Angelis for a frivolous motion to compel. We 'affirm all of the district court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">In April 2003, Frank Gonzalez told his brother-in-law Commander Michael Czerwinsky of the EPPD that retired EPPD Assistant Chief of Police George De Angel-is had threatened former EPPD Chief of Police Carlos Leon. Specifically, De Angel-is allegedly said of Leon, who was not present, \u201cone of these days the first chance I get, I am going to put two rounds right here.\u201d De Angelis then gestured behind his ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Czerwinsky relayed Gonzalez\u2019s story to Deputy Chief Robert Almonte, who in turn told Leon. Leon filed a complaint against De Angelis and requested Amonte investigate the matter further. The next day, Amonte directed two detectives, Jesus Pantoja and David Samaniego, to investigate the threat further. Samaniego interviewed Gonzalez and found his story credible. Czerwinsky further vouched for Gonzalez\u2019s credibility given the two men\u2019s personal relationship. Pantoja met with Leon and concluded Leon legitimately feared De Angelis\u2019s threat. Pantoja then drafted an affidavit demonstrating probable cause and delivered it to Judge Kosturakis Oaxaca, who reviewed the affidavit and signed an arrest warrant. Later that night, Pantoja, Samaniego, and several EPPD officers went to De Angelis\u2019s house and arrested him. The parties dispute whether De Angelis permitted the detectives inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">De Angelis sued the City and Leon, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of both defendants. On appeal, De Angelis alleges the district court erred by: (1) improperly granting summary judgment in favor of the City and Leon; (2) improperly denying De Angelis\u2019s motion to recuse; and (3) sanctioning De Angelis.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">De Angelis first argues that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of both the City and Leon. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summary judgment is proper when the record shows that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To defeat summary judgment, the non-moving party must introduce specific facts demonstrating a genuine issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>must view the evidence in the most favorable light to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">De Angelis argues that summary judgment in favor of the City was inappropriate. As an initial matter, he argues that the district court acknowledged in its summary judgment order that \u201ca dispute exists as to whether the Detectives were invited in or entered the house without permission.\u201d Since summary judgment is appropriate only if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> De Angelis concludes that the district court clearly erred. But as the district court further wrote, \u201c[t]his factual dispute is immaterial to the Court\u2019s analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The Supreme Court has held that a municipality is liable under \u00a7 1983 when its official policies or customs violate the Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, a municipality will not face liability under a <em>respondeat supe\u00f1or </em>liability theory.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, even if the City\u2019s detectives entered De Angelis\u2019s house without permission, the City is not liable unless its customs or policies caused the unlawful entrance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We pause to note that De Angelis pleaded that a City custom existed that would establish liability, but he has waived that argument on appeal since he presents no argument or evidence establishing that custom.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">The Supreme Court has held that a municipal policy maker\u2019s single decision might constitute an official policy, thus subjecting the municipality to liability.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In some situations, a municipality \u201cchooses a course of action tailored to a particular situation and not intended to control decisions in later situations.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If an authorized decision maker\u2014i.e., an individual with final authority under state law to establish municipal policy\u2014adopts the particular course of conduct, this decision may constitute official policy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, \u201cmunicipal liability under \u00a7 1983 attaches where\u2014and only where\u2014a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among various alternatives by the official or officials responsible for establishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in question.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has rejected the argument that merely identifying some decision properly attributable to the municipality is sufficient to prove liability.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather, the plaintiff must prove that the municipality was the \u201cmoving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>force\u201d through \u201cdeliberate conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plaintiff should demonstrate \u201cthe requisite degree of culpability and ... a direct causal link\u201d between the municipal action and the rights violation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cWhere a plaintiff claims that the municipality has not directly inflicted an injury, but nonetheless has caused an employee to do so, rigorous standards of culpability and causation must be applied to ensure that the municipality is not held liable solely for the actions of its employee.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Thus, it is unsurprising that case law generally requires a close nexus between the policy maker\u2019s decision and the constitutional violation. For example, in <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati </em>a county prosecutor\u2014an authorized decision maker\u2014ordered police officers to enter the plaintiffs office to execute a warrant against a third person, a constitutional violation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In other words, the official ordered the actual violation. By contrast, in <em>Bryan County v. Brown, </em>the Supreme Court rejected plaintiffs argument that the county was liable for a deputy\u2019s use of excessive force because the Sheriff, the final decision maker under state law, had hired the deputy after only a cursory review, thereby setting in motion events leading to the injury.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court further stated: \u201cWhere a claim of municipal liability rests on a single decision, not itself representing a violation of federal law and not directing such a violation, the danger that a municipality will be held liable without fault is high.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">De Angelis argues that Leon, as the final decision maker, \u201chand picked the person, his own employee, who was to head the investigation.\u201d But De Angelis does not argue, and the record does not indicate, that Leon ordered the officers to enter De Angelis\u2019s house, or even ordered the officers to go to his house. De Angelis provides no evidence of a causal link between Leon\u2019s choice of investigators and the alleged rights violation. Like the hiring decision in <em>Bryan County, </em>Leon\u2019s mere choice of investigators, a lawful action, does not, without more, subject the City to liability for those officers\u2019 acts. To hold the City liable for Leon\u2019s decision to appoint certain investigators, who allegedly violated De Angelis\u2019s rights, is to hold the City liable under a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory, which the Supreme Court has explicitly rejected.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">Moreover, we also reject De Angel-is\u2019s argument that Leon\u2019s decision constituted deliberate indifference, another possible predicate for municipal liability. The Supreme Court has said \u201c \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 is a stringent standard of fault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A mere showing of generalized risk is insufficient to establish de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>liberate indifference;<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> rather the plaintiff must show that a reasonable policy maker would conclude that the rights deprivation that occurred was a \u201cplainly obvious consequence\u201d of his decision.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">De Angelis has pointed to no evidence, and we find none in the record, suggesting that the plainly obvious consequence of Leon\u2019s decision to appoint Almonte was a violation of De Angelis\u2019s rights. De Angelis speculates that since Leon was the alleged victim, his appointed investigators would use any means necessary to please their superior. This is, at best, a speculative showing of generalized harm and misses the high bar the Supreme Court has set. We conclude that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">De Angelis also argues that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of Leon. We construe De Angelis\u2019s brief to argue two theories: Leon is liable, first, in his personal capacity for pressing charges against De Angelis and, second, in his official capacity for appointing Almonte as the lead investigator. We note at the outset that Leon is not liable under \u00a7 1983 for pressing charges, because he was not acting under color of state law,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> a point De Angelis concedes. De Angelis fails to provide further arguments in favor of personal liability or cite contrary authority supporting personal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">We now determine whether Leon is liable in his official capacity. Leon invoked qualified immunity. When a defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense, the plaintiff bears the burden to prove its inapplicability.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The district court agreed Leon was entitled to qualified immunity, determined that under the first prong<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> of the qualified immunity analysis no constitutional violation occurred, and granted Leon summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">On appeal, De Angelis barely attempts to meet his burden. The brief does not argue that qualified immunity is inapplicable. The brief provides no legal analysis regarding qualified immunity, cites no case law for any legal propositions regarding qualified immunity, and in fact does not even use the term \u201cqualified immunity.\u201d Rather than discussing qualified immunity, De Angelis\u2019s brief argues that the officers who arrested De Angelis, and who are not parties, lacked probable cause. De Angel-is further notes that Gonzalez had a criminal record, whereas De Angelis was awarded the \u201c1998 El Paso Police Department Executive of the Year.\u201d Thus, he argues no reasonable officer could have concluded probable cause existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">Even if we construe these statements as an argument regarding the first prong of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>qualified immunity analysis,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> we do not find it persuasive and conclude no constitutional violation occurred. The arresting officers obtained a warrant signed by a magistrate. When reviewing a warrant\u2019s issuance, we defer to the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The magistrate must have a substantial basis for concluding probable cause exists.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In this case, the magistrate reviewed affidavits and other documents that detailed what Gonzalez had heard and the reasons the investigating officers believed Gonzalez credible. Under our case law, the magistrate had a substantial basis for finding probable cause.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The fact that De Angel-is was not ultimately charged or convicted does not make his arrest unconstitutional. \u201cThe Constitution does not guarantee that only the guilty will be arrested.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Moreover, this court has held that \u201cif the facts supporting an arrest are put before an intermediary such as a magistrate or grand jury, the intermediary\u2019s decision to issue a warrant or return an indictment breaks the causal chain and insulates the initiating party.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Thus, De Angelis\u2019s arrest pursuant to a properly issued warrant is not unconstitutional. Without proving a constitutional violation, De Angelis has failed to meet his burden under the qualified immunity analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">De Angelis next challenges the district judge\u2019s denial of De Angelis\u2019s motion to recuse. Leon, but not the City, argues that this court lacks jurisdiction for this portion of the appeal, because De Angelis\u2019s notice of appeal only references the final judgment entered October 2, 2006, 2006 WL 4511946 and not the July 14, 2005 Order denying De Angelis\u2019s motion to recuse. Citing <em>Warfield v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Company,</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Leon argues \u201cthe Court cannot fairly infer [De Angelis\u2019s] intent to appeal from the [recusal order].\u201d We note that the rule articulated in <em>Warfield </em>is inapplicable when the notice of appeal is from the final judgment<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> as it is here.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny the motion to recuse for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It is an abuse of discretion to deny recusal where a \u201creasonable man, cognizant of the relevant circumstances surrounding the judge\u2019s failure to recuse, would harbor legitimate doubts about that judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>As a general matter, a judge shall grant the recusal motion if \u201chis impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> More specifically, a judge must also grant recusal if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">He or his spouse, or a person within the third degree of relationship to either of them, or the spouse of such a person: (i) is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party; (ii) is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding; (iii) is known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding; (iv) is to the judge\u2019s knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">De Angelis moved for recusal, arguing that the City\u2019s mayor had recently hired the district judge\u2019s nephew, Matthew Briones, as an executive assistant. De Angelis argued in his motion that Matthew Briones\u2019s employment as an executive assistant \u201cwas the equivalent to being an officer or a party,\u201d and thus \u00a7 455(b)(5)(i) required recusal. After the motion was denied, De Angelis identified Matthew Briones as a witness against the City. On appeal, De Angelis argues the district judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned because his nephew both works for the City and was a potential witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">Contrary to De Angelis\u2019s assertion, Matthew Briones\u2019s mere employment as an executive assistant does not make him an officer, director, or trustee for the City or the equivalent of a party to this lawsuit. Moreover, several cases in this and other circuits hold that the mere salary interest of a judge\u2019s relative generally is not a \u201cfinancial interest\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> as \u00a7 455 defines.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Thus, Matthew Briones\u2019s position with the City was not automatic grounds for the district judge\u2019s recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">We also think that the judge\u2019s failure to recuse himself after De Angelis designated Matthew Briones a witness was, at the worst, harmless error. Again, \u00a7 455(b)(5) requires a judge to recuse himself if his spouse or relative within the third degree \u201cis to the judge\u2019s knowledge likely to be a <em>material </em>witness in the proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> De Angelis has shown, and the record exhibits, little evidence demonstrating that Matthew Briones would have been a material witness. De Angelis\u2019s own recusal motion establishes that Matthew Briones was hired long after the events at issue to work for a new mayor elected over two years after those events occurred. Ultimately, since Matthew Briones never testified because the case was dismissed at summary judgment, we cannot determine whether he would have been a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>witness. Nonetheless, we have reviewed de novo the grant of summary judgment and concluded it was proper. Therefore, no conflict arose and any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">De Angelis filed a motion to compel and a request for a temporary restraining order; in both, De Angelis incorrectly represented that the City had illegally attached secret grand jury testimony to a pleading filed in another federal proceeding. In fact, the attached document was an indictment against De Angelis, which was a public record. De Angelis\u2019s motion to compel sought to continue deposing the City\u2019s attorney, who had attached the document, regarding where she had obtained it. The court denied De Angelis\u2019s motion to compel as frivolous since the document was publicly available and awarded the City costs and expenses for defending the motion. De Angelis argues that the district court erred when it sanctioned De Angelis for filing a frivolous motion. We review the district court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">A judge who denies a motion to compel \u201cmust, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require the movant, the attorney filing the motion, or both to pay the party or deponent who opposed the motions its reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the motion, including attorney\u2019s fees\u201d unless \u201cthe motion was substantially justified.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>the Supreme Court wrote that a motion is \u201csubstantially justified\u201d if \u201cthere is a \u2018genuine dispute,\u2019 or \u2018if reasonable people could differ as to [the appropriateness of the contested action].\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Reasonable people cannot have a genuine dispute regarding whether the City improperly disseminated secret grand jury testimony when the document at issue is not secret grand jury testimony but a public record that is clearly labeled \u201cindictment.\u201d We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">We conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgement. Additionally, we find the district court committed no error in denying De Angel-is\u2019s motion to recuse or in ordering costs and expenses assessed against De Angelis. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
