He contends that the district court erred in ruling that his prior Idaho rape conviction constituted the enumerated offense of statutory rape, triggering the 16-level enhancement contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). He also contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">As Villa preserved his Guidelines argument in the district court, we review that court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Carbajal-Diaz, </em>508 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2007). The Idaho statute of conviction criminalizes sexual intercourse with a female younger than 18 years of age. The charging document, to which Villa pleaded guilty, stated that the female victim was 13 years of age. Thus, Villa\u2019s crime may be narrowly defined as unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year old female. <em>See id. </em>at 807-10. This crime is encompassed within the generic, contemporary meaning of statutory rape. Accordingly, application of the 16-level enhancement was proper. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Relying on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Villa challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
