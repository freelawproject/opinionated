We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-21\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because the motion was filed nearly three years after the BIA\u2019s September 29, 2003 order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Lin\u2019s deepening commitment to her Christian faith is not sufficient by itself to establish changed circumstances under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), the regulatory exception to untimely motions to reopen. <em>See He v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1128, 1132 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that a change in personal circumstances is not sufficient to establish changed circumstances for the purpose of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii)). Lin otherwise failed to provide sufficient evidence of changed circumstances in China to establish that she now has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Malty, </em>381 F.3d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-22\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b560-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
