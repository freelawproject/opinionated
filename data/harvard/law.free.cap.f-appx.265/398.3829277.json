In December 2006 the district court sentenced him to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment, and he now appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-18\">Alvarado-Ayala claims that the circumstances attendant to his manslaughter conviction counsel in favor of a sentence below the guidelines range. He asserts that his manslaughter conviction was, ultimately, the product of a mistake that Oregon authorities made when they improperly prosecuted him for murder although he was a juvenile. The ensuing murder conviction was later reduced to first degree man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>slaughter as the result of a stipulation between Alvarado-Ayala and the State of Oregon in a federal habeas proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We do not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Alvarado-Ayala\u2019s motion for a downward departure. <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). There is an exception to this rule where the defendant points to something in the record indicating that the district court held an erroneous belief that it lacked the authority to depart. <em>United States v. Valencia-Gonzales, </em>172 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.1999). Based on a review of the record, we see no indication that the district court believed that it lacked the authority to grant a downward departure. Nor does anything in the record even suggest that the district court believed it lacked the authority to impose a below-guideline sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Nevertheless, a defendant, like Alvarado-Ayala, whose motion for a downward departure has been overruled may still argue on appeal that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court \u201cfailed adequately to consider factors counseling in favor of a downward departure.\u201d <em>Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d at 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">This court reviews a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). In reviewing for reasonableness, an appellate court \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). It is proper for an appellate court to rebuttably presume the reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence which reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 2462-63. A district court\u2019s sentencing decision is entitled to great deference. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (fact that appellate court might reasonably impose different sentence is insufficient justification for reversal of district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">Our review of the record does not reveal that the district court committed any procedural error or failed to address or improperly balanced the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Moreover, when a sentence is within a properly calculated guidelines range, this court infers that the district court considered all of the guidelines factors. <em>United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 473 (5th Cir.2006). Having considered Alvarado-Ayala\u2019s arguments, the district court crafted a sentence at the bottom of the advisory guideline range that it believed to be just. The district court did not abuse its discretion in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">Alvarado-Ayala alternatively contends, for the first time on appeal, that his sentence is infected with error because this court\u2019s <em>post-Booker </em>jurisprudence erroneously and unduly restricted the ability of district courts to give nonguideline sentences. As neither this contention nor anything like it was raised below, our review is only for plain error. There is none. It is not clear or plain that our <em>post-Booker </em>jurisprudence is erroneous in this respect. Nor does anything in the record suggest that the district court likely would have given a lesser sentence but for some such aspect of our <em>post-Booker </em>jurisprudence (or that it otherwise felt constrained to give a within guideline range sentence despite believing that a lesser sentence would be more appropriate under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) apart from the guidelines). That the district court consciously elected to sentence within the guidelines does not suffice to demonstrate reversible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>error. Nor may error be predicated on the fact that this court on appeal affords a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to a district court\u2019s sentence that reflects a proper application of the guidelines, <em>despite </em>the fact that it \u201cmay be correct that the presumption -will encourage sentencing judges to impose Guidelines sentences.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2467.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Finally, light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Alvarado-Ayala challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated-felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has stated that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
