The BIA relied solely on the Castros\u2019 failure to meet the requirement of \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d set out in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). This is a discretionary determination that Congress has \u201ccarved out of our appellate jurisdiction\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 888 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-22\">We nevertheless retain jurisdiction to review colorable constitutional claims. The Castros argue that the IJ in this case displayed bias that infected every part of his decision, amounting to a denial of due process. They argue further that the BIA\u2019s review failed to cure this denial. Their argument fails to persuade: The IJ did not impede the development of a full evidentiary record on the hardship issue, and if he felt animus toward the Castros, there is no evidence such animus affected the BIA\u2019s review of the record or its final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>For the reasons stated, the petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
