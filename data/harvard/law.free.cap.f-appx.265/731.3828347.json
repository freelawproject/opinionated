He appeals the district court\u2019s sentence, specifically the application of an enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">Mr. Stupka pawned a Smith and Wesson handgun on June 9, 2004. Ill R. at 4. He previously pled guilty to three counts of burglary II in 1991 after he broke into apartments 358, 380, and 458 at the Rail-head Apartments complex in Oklahoma City by using a master key. <em>Id. </em>at 11; Aplee. Add. at 1-2. He stole various household furnishings. <em>Id. </em>The Presentence Investigation Report accordingly recommended that he be sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) as an armed career criminal within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 subject to a minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ill R. at 6. Mr. Stupka objected to the application of this enhancement in a sentencing memorandum and at the sentencing hearing held on May 30, 2007. I R. Doc. 31 at 1; II R. at 4. The district court overruled his objection and sentenced Mr. Stupka to a term of imprisonment at the bottom of his calculated sentencing guideline range of 180 to 210 months. II R. at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">We review the district court\u2019s application of a sentencing enhancement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) de novo. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>401 F.3d 1220, 1226 (10th Cir.2005). \u201c[A] person has been convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>burglary for purposes of a \u00a7 924(e) enhancement if he is convicted of any crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2148, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). In determining whether the enhancement applies, a district court \u201cdetermining the character of an admitted burglary is generally limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 18, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Mr. Stupka challenges the enhancement on two grounds. First, he argues that his three previous burglary convictions cannot be considered \u201cviolent felonies]\u201d \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another\u201d as required under \u00a7 924(e)(1) because he committed the burglaries on apartments under the possession and control of the same people, on the same day, at the same address, and by using a master key. Aplt. Br. at 11. Apparently, the apartments were unoccupied and uninhabitable at the time because they were undergoing renovation. II R. (5/30/2007 Sent. Tr.) at 15-16, 20. Second, he argues that the circumstances surrounding his prior burglary convictions were impermissibly found by the district judge and should have been submitted to a jury under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Neither of Mr. Stupka\u2019s arguments persuade us. With respect to his first argument, we simply note that the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 924(e)(1) includes \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that ... is burglary.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). Mr. Stupka was convicted of three counts of burglary meeting the elements explained in <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143 and therefore committed three violent felonies. Aplee. Add. at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">He also committed these three burglaries \u201con occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Our precedent is clear on this point. In <em>United States v. Tisdale, </em>we interpreted \u00a7 924(e)(1) within the context of a defendant who committed three burglaries on the same date after breaking into a shopping mall. 921 F.2d 1095, 1098 (10th Cir.1990). The defendant burglarized two private businesses and a post office within the mall on a single night. <em>Id. </em>He was tried and convicted of three counts of burglary. <em>Id. </em>We held that \u201cthe defendant could not simultaneously burglarize three separate businesses\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 924(e)(1) because he chose to burglarize two additional businesses after burglarizing the first and had to physically break and enter three separate structures to commit the burglaries. <em>See id. </em>at 1099. The defendant\u2019s sentence was therefore properly enhanced under \u00a7 924(e)(1). <em>See id.; see also United States v. Michel, </em>446 F.3d 1122, 1134 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cIn affirming the district court, we are governed by our ruling in <em>Tisdale.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The district court correctly determined, based upon the information and judgment for Mr. Stupka\u2019s burglary convictions, that his case is not different than <em>Tisdale </em>in any meaningful way. II R. (5/30/2007 Sent. Tr.) at 23-25. After he chose to burglarize one apartment, he had to choose to burglarize another, regardless of whether he might have used the master key to open all three doors before removing the items from each apartment. Mr. Stupka could not have simultaneously bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>glarized all three apartments. In addition, although the apartments were in the same complex (much like the businesses and post office in Tisdale), he had to \u201cbreak and enter\u201d each apartment separately. There simply is no question that Mr. Stupka committed three violent felonies \u201con occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Moreover, Mr. Stupka is not entitled to a jury trial to determine the circumstances surrounding his prior burglary convictions, including whether the burglaries were \u201cviolent felon[ies]\u201d or were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States </em>that recidivism does not need to be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See </em>523 U.S. 224, 239, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). The Court reaffirmed this holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>when it concluded that <em>\u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prtor conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (emphasis added). <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law despite Justice Thomas\u2019s statement that a majority of the Court is prepared to overturn it. <em>See Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 27-28, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (Thomas, J., concurring). If there is to be any change in the law in this area, it cannot come from us. <em>See id.; see also Moore, </em>401 F.3d at 1224 (\u201cAlthough the Court may overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>at some point in the future, it has not done so, we will not presume to do so for the Court, and we are bound by existing precedent to hold that the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>exception to the rule announced in <em>Apprendi </em>and extended to the Guidelines in <em>Booker </em>remains good law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-18\">. Mr. Stupka's offense level was 24 with a criminal history category of VI. Ill R. at 6, 25. With the enhancement, his offense level was 33, resulting in an advisory guideline range of 235 to 293 months. <em>Id. </em>at 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
