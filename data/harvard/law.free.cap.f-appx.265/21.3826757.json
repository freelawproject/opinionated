DeFonzo, denying Sosa\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>In re Elmer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>Maheli Sosa Palacios, </em>No. A70 811 429 (B.I.A. Mar. 9, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A70 811 429 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sep. 14, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">We have held that issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). In his counseled brief to this Court, Sosa fails to make any argument that the agency erred in its determination that he had failed to meet his burden of proof to establish that he would suffer persecution at the hands of guerrillas if he were returned to Guatemala. Indeed, the only assertion that can be construed as an argument in Sosa\u2019s brief to this Court is that an excerpt from a human rights report in the record provides \u201cevidence that his return to his country\u2019s rural area would have likely subjected him to persecution.\u201d However, the quote concerns criminality and corruption in Guatemala and does not even mention guerrilla activity. We therefore deem waived any challenge to the agency\u2019s dispositive burden of proof finding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
