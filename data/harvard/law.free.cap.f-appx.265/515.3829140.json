To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>See Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-24\">The record does not compel a finding that Nikoghosyan\u2019s alleged persecutors actually imputed a political opinion to him, <em>see id. </em>at 1489, or that they acted on account of an imputed political opinion rather than with a criminal intent. <em>See id. </em>at 1486-87. Substantial evidence therefore supports the agency\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Nikoghosyan did not raise his claim for CAT protection before the BIA and we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider his contentions regarding CAT relief. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b539-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
