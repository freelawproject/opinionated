Because he did not raise in the district court his argument that the Government breached the terms of the plea agreement by failing to recommend a sentence of 120 months of imprisonment or less, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>328 F.3d 787, 790 (5th Cir.2003). The Government did not agree to recommend a sentence below the guideline range, and Gonzalez-Herrera fails to establish the alleged breach. <em>See United States v. Cantu, </em>185 F.3d 298, 304 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Gonzalez-Herrera\u2019s argument that the presumption of reasonableness afforded sentences within the guideline range does not apply to drug cases is without merit. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (an appellate court may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range). Contrary to Gonzalez-Herrera\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s sentencing consideration was improperly constrained, the district court gave \u201cboth parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem[ed] appropriate,\u201d and Gonzalez-Herrera\u2019s counsel requested a sentence at the lower end of the guideline range. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596. The district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range, and Gonzalez-Herrera has failed to show that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
