ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant and appellant Joseph N. White pled guilty to one count of knowing possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The district court <em>sua sponte </em>advised the parties it was considering an upward departure from the advisory Guideline range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After giving the parties an opportunity to respond, the court departed upward from the Guideline range by eighty-seven months, and sentenced White to 147 months\u2019 imprisonment. He appeals his sentence, which we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A4m\">On April 12, 2006, during an investigation by the Sedgwick County, Kansas, Sheriffs Office, White sold approximately .43 grams of crack cocaine to a confidential informant at a convenience store in Wichita, Kansas. During the sale, White\u2019s two young children were in his car at the convenience store. Law enforcement officers conducting surveillance saw White, another man, and two young children drive from White\u2019s residence to the convenience store in a Ford Crown Victoria.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-15\">On April 25, 2006, White sold .40 grams of crack cocaine to a confidential informant at White\u2019s residence. During the sale, White\u2019s two young children were inside his residence, which is within 1,000 feet of a school. On April 27, 2006, law enforcement officers executed a search warrant at White\u2019s residence and found 11.45 grams of crack cocaine, a box of baggies, a digital scale, two razor blades, and a plate. The plate, scale and razor blades were covered with a powdery residue. The officers also found White\u2019s four-year-old son in a bedroom, in which they also found a loaded 9 mm Glock pistol on a closet shelf. A magazine containing additional rounds was on the shelf next to the gun. In the living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>room, officers found a loaded .45 caliber Glock Model 21 on the top shelf of a computer desk.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Beneath White\u2019s clothing in another bedroom closet, the officers found an Olympic Arms PCR3.22S caliber rifle with two 30-round magazines, a double magazine adapter, an LED light, and a thumb-activated laser light. In that same bedroom, the officers found more ammunition magazines for the Glock handguns, a gun box for a .357 Glock, one round of .357 ammunition, and a plastic cover for a digital scale that had marijuana and cocaine residue on it. Additionally, the officers found a rifle in a gun case in the trunk of a Ford Crown Victoria parked in the driveway. This was the same car used to deliver the crack cocaine to the convenience store on April 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">On May 9, 2006, the confidential informant called White and arranged to purchase crack cocaine. The confidential informant met with White\u2019s co-defendant, Shonnetta Gabriel, in Wichita and bought .45 grams of crack cocaine. The residence where the transaction took place is within 1,000 feet of an elementary school. On May 16, the confidential informant purchased .40 grams of crack cocaine from White at an Autozone in Wichita. Law enforcement personnel conducting surveillance of White\u2019s residence saw him leave his residence and drive to the Autozone. On May 19, the confidential informant called White and arranged to purchase crack cocaine at the same Autozone. Law enforcement officers conducting surveillance of White\u2019s residence saw another black male, Wendale Gasper, Sr., leave the residence and drive to the Autozone, where he sold .40 grams of crack cocaine to the confidential informant. On May 23, the confidential informant called White and arranged another purchase of crack cocaine at the same Autozone. Law enforcement officers observed co-defendant Gabriel leave White\u2019s residence, drive to the Autozone, and sell .37 grams of crack cocaine to the confidential informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">On May 30, officers again executed a search warrant at White\u2019s residence. Two of White\u2019s children, ages eight and two, were in the living room. In the southeast bedroom, where White was sleeping with his four-year-old son, officers found an unloaded 9mm Taurus handgun in a gun case on a top shelf in the closet, a plastic baggie with 2.54 grams of crack cocaine under the mattress, and White\u2019s wallet containing $245 on the nightstand. In the kitchen, officers found three scales, one of which had a powdery residue which tested positive for cocaine. In the dining room, officers found one round of 9 mm ammunition in a cell phone box. In the children\u2019s bedroom, they found a plate on which there was a razor blade and a white powdery residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">On June 7, 2006, the confidential informant called White and asked to purchase some crack cocaine. A few minutes later, the confidential informant received a call from co-defendant Gabriel concerning the sale. Law enforcement personnel conducting surveillance of White\u2019s house saw White and Gabriel drive away and meet another man. A short time later, officers followed Gabriel to a gas station where Gabriel met a female. Following this meeting, officers stopped the female and found crack cocaine in her vehicle. Officers watched Gabriel then drive and pick up White. Later that same day, Gabriel called the confidential informant and arranged to meet at a restaurant in Wichita. They did so, and the confidential informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>purchased .37 grams of cocaine from Gabriel. The restaurant is within 1,000 feet of an elementary school. Later that evening, officers stopped White\u2019s vehicle for a traffic violation and found four baggies containing approximately 4.42 grams of crack cocaine in White\u2019s underwear and a baggie containing an additional .19 grams of crack cocaine in the driver\u2019s side door of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">On August 22, 2006, White was charged in a sixteen-count indictment with: one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine; four counts of distributing crack cocaine; three counts of distributing crack cocaine within 1,000 feet of a public school; two counts of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine within 1,000 feet of a public school; two counts of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime; one count of possession with the intent to distribute crack cocaine; one count of maintaining a residence within 1,000 feet of a public school for the purpose of distributing crack cocaine; and two counts of being an unlawful user of a controlled substance in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">On October 20, 2006, White pled guilty to one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). As stated in his plea agreement, White admitted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">On April 27, 2006, in Wichita, Kansas, the defendant possessed a Glock Model 17, 9mm handgun, and a Glock Model 21, .45 caliber handgun. At the time he possessed these firearms the defendant was engaged in the distribution of crack cocaine. These firearms were for the defendant\u2019s protection and used by him to further his drug trafficking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">R. Vol. I, doc. 27 at 2. In exchange for his plea of guilty to this one count (count 12 of the 16-count indictment), the government agreed not to file any additional charges against White, to recommend a sentence at the low end of the applicable guideline range, and in any event, not to exceed 60 months, to recommend a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and to not request an upward departure if White agreed not to request a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">In preparation for sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepared a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR noted that the minimum statutory term of imprisonment for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) is five years, and that the Guideline sentence is that minimum statutory term. The PSR found no factors warranting a departure from the Guideline sentence or a sentence outside the advisory Guideline range. Neither the government nor White objected to the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">On December 8, 2006, the district court sent a letter to all counsel stating that it was contemplating an upward departure to a sentence greater than five years. The court explained its reasons as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-11\">For reasons not apparent in the record, defendant has been able to negotiate a guilty plea to count 12 of a 16 count indictment charging numerous serious drug and firearm violations. Count 12 charges a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment and maximum sentence of life in prison. Although the advisory guidelines do not offer any explanation for what seems to be an illogical result, the guideline sentence is the same as the mandatory minimum sentence. I am hard pressed to understand how the Sentencing Commission would come to such a conclusion when Congress presumably believed that a \u00a7 924(c) violation was sufficiently serious to carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Nevertheless, [United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cUSSG\u201d) ] \u00a7 2K2.4, Application Note 2(B), provides for an upward departure!<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">Section 5K2.21 of the advisory guidelines allows <em>me to . </em>depart upward to reflect the actual seriousness of the offense based on conduct (1) underlying a charge dismissed as part of a plea agreement in the case or underlying a potential charge not pursued in the case as part of a plea agreement or for any other reasons; and (2) that did not enter into a determination of the applicable guideline range.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">The Tenth Circuit has recognized the application of \u00a7 5K2.21 in both pre<em>Booker </em>and <em>post-Booker </em>cases: <em>United States v. Gilmore, </em>62 Fed.Appx. 857 (10th Cir.2003), and <em>United States v. Zunie, </em>444 F.3d 1230, 1237 (10th Cir.2006).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">Taken together, then, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] and the advisory guidelines allow me to consider many more things about defendant than the guideline sentence, and most of them are unfavorable to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGS\">Letter dated 12/08/06 at 1-2, R. Vol. I, tab 44, Ex. A. The court then discussed the plea agreement, including White\u2019s acknowledgment that the government\u2019s recommendation of a five-year sentence was not binding on the court. The court recounted the plea colloquy, in which the court discussed relevant conduct and informed White that \u201call these other counts of this indictment, even though you\u2019re not pleading guilty to these counts, can be taken into consideration in setting your sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The court subsequently described all of White\u2019s conduct underlying the remaining counts of the sixteen-count indictment, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-12\">Notwithstanding these events in April 2006, defendant continued to sell crack cocaine in May 2006, either personally or through others, including his codefendant. On May 30, 2006, Defendant\u2019s residence was again searched pursuant to a warrant. Three children, ages 2, 4 and 8 were in the residence along with an unloaded weapon, crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia. Then, in June 2006, defendant participated in additional crack cocaine sales.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 5. The court\u2019s letter went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-14\">I must consider certain factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. But keep in mind that I am providing this information pursuant to Rule 32(h)[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>], not as an all-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>inclusive list of the factors which I may ultimately consider after the defendant has had the opportunity to comment....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">According to the presentence report, defendant is 28 years old and has been using illegal drugs on a regular basis for 13 years. He has five children and one stepchild who he apparently does not support, at least on a regular basis. His employment history is somewhat irregular but his educational attainments are sufficient that he could work regularly and support his dependents should he be inclined to do so. In other words, there is no demonstrable economic reason for defendant to be selling drugs and taking money from a girlfriend, assuming that selling drugs can ever be justified by economic need. On the contrary, based on the record, I assume defendant sells drugs to support his own drug habit and because he is too lazy to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">All of the charges in the indictment are very serious. Defendant\u2019s conduct demonstrates complete lack of respect for the law. It is clear that even when confronted by authorities with selling drugs, he was not deterred from doing so. The public needs to be protected from that type of conduct and, in particular, his children need to be protected. The conduct of a parent who exposes young children to the drug trade is beneath contempt. I don\u2019t have to dwell on the fact that children who are exposed to drugs are more likely to become involved in the illegal drug trade and the use of illegal drugs. Anyone who believes otherwise is either terminally naive or completely ignorant of the drug culture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">I asked [the probation officer who prepared the PSR] to give me some information regarding the types of sentences which would have been available had defendant pled to other counts in the indictment....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">Finally, while I have not seen the presentence report regarding Shonnetta Gabriel, defendant\u2019s codefendant, it is my understanding that her sentencing range is 46-57 months. Gabriel is charged in only four of the 16 counts of the indictment. Defendant is charged in all 16. There would appear to be no sentencing disparity if defendant receives a sentence greater than 60 months if, for no other reason, because his criminal conduct is substantially more serious than that of Gabriel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 6. On December 12, the court sent another letter supplementing his December 8 letter, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, Application Note 7 (2006 Guidelines Manual) states, in pertinent part: \u201cThe Commission has not established a fine guideline range for the unusual case in which there is no conviction for the underlying offense, although a fine is authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571.\u201d It is clear from reading the other application notes that an underlying offense would include a drug trafficking crime. Thus, the Sentencing Commission would view this case as \u201cunusual\u201d because the parties have agreed to allow defendant to plead guilty to the 924(c) count alone, rather than in addition to one or more underlying drug counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">I believe this analysis of the commentary supports my view that this is an \u201cunusual\u201d case in which a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>greater than 60 months will be reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Letter dated 12/12/06, R. Vol. I, tab 44, Ex. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The court invited the parties to submit memoranda addressing the issues set forth in the court\u2019s two letters, and \"White did so. In his memorandum, White pointed out that he \u201cwas not a distributor of large amounts of drugs, or considered by law enforcement officers to be a high level drug dealer,\u201d and that \u201cthe total amount of crack cocaine involved in this case is merely 21.89 grams.\u201d Response to Court\u2019s Notice to Depart at 7, R. Vol. I, tab 34. Furthermore, \"White argued he \u201chas no felony criminal history, or criminal record of dealing drugs in the past.\u201d <em>Id. </em>White also offered a DVD of an interview with his sister, \u201cwho describes in a very intimate and personal way, the abuse suffered by she and Mr. \"White as children [of a] life time drug addict, who abused and abandoned her children in exchange for men and drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. \"White then stated that \u201c[t]he type of offenses with which [he] is charged are not at all representative of his true character\u201d and he \u201cis a gentle and respectful young man, but also a seat of inner conflict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9 (footnote omitted). He also pointed out that \u201c[a]l-though numerous firearms were located in Mr. White\u2019s house and in his automobile trunk, [which belonged to him ... ], \"White did not present those firearms or threaten to use them in any drug transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 2. With respect to the allegation that he endangered his children, he noted that \u201cthese children belonged also to Shonetta Gabriel, their mother. If this regrettable factor should result in an increase in Mr. \"White\u2019s sentence, should it not likewise result in an increase of Ms. Gabriel\u2019s sentence?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Following a hearing at which both parties presented argument, the district court issued its sentencing decision, in which the court \u201cadhere[d] to [its] belief that an upward departure from the advisory guideline sentence is warranted.\u201d Sentencing Dec. at 1, R. Vol. I, tab 44. After observing that the law regarding sentence departures is \u201cnot totally settled\u201d in our circuit, the district court stated that it was obligated \u201cto consult both the advisory guidelines and the statutory factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. The court held that its two letters adequately discussed the advisory guidelines and explained \u201cthat an upward departure is allowable under the advisory guidelines.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">The court then turned to its analysis of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In considering the \u201chistory and characteristics\u201d of White, the court observed, \u201c[t]here is no question that the circumstances of defendant\u2019s upbringing were far worse than the \u2018normal\u2019 law-abiding, two parent, nurturing home which some might contend to be a base-line for consideration of a defendant\u2019s history and characteristics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. After articulating the critical question as \u201cwhether defendant\u2019s unfortunate history militates against an upward departure,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cwhen all the circumstances and statutory factors are considered, defendant\u2019s unfortunate childhood does not prevent an upward departure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5. The court then commented on White\u2019s involvement of his children in his drug transactions, stating, \u201c[t]he court supposes that it is possible for some persons to feel love and concern for the welfare of one\u2019s children while, at the same time, exposing young children to drug trafficking and the danger of firearms, but the court cannot identify with such persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. It further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-10\">What the court does know with certainty from hands-on experience of sentencing defendants (as opposed to reading about sentencing) is that cases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>this type fall in the category of a self-fulfilling prophecy. In other words, the child of a parent who uses and/or sells illegal drugs is very likely to follow in the parent\u2019s footsteps, which is exactly what defendant has done. When, as here, a defendant takes his small children with him when engaging in drug transactions, that defendant has to be separated from his children. This falls within the category of protecting the public from further crimes of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><em>Id. </em>The court then explained its sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">In an effort to formulate a sentence which will be acceptable under the advisory guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court requested the probation officer to prepare a sentence calculation which takes into consideration the offense of conviction (count 12, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) which carries a minimum and advisory guideline sentence of 60 months) plus the \u201cunderlying offense\u201d charged in count 4, possession with intent to distribute cocaine base within 1,000 feet of a school in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 842(a)(1) and 860....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">Using defendant\u2019s criminal history category II and a total offense level of 26, the advisory guideline range for count 4 becomes 70-87 months. The court will impose a 60 month sentence on count 12 enhanced by an upward departure of 87 months for a controlling sentence of 147 months. The court finds that such a sentence is consistent with the advisory guidelines and is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the sentencing purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">White appeals, arguing the upward departure or variance to a 147-month sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">Since <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201cwe review sentencing decisions for reasonableness, which has both procedural and substantive components.\u201d <em>United States v. Atencio, </em>476 F.3d 1099, 1102 (10th Cir.2007). Procedural reasonableness involves the manner in which a court calculates a sentence. \u201cIn setting a procedurally reasonable sentence, a district court must calculate the proper advisory Guidelines range and apply the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Substantive reasonableness relates to the overall length of the sentence. \u201cA substantively reasonable sentence ultimately reflects the gravity of the crime and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as applied to the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Most recently, the Supreme Court in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S. \u2014-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), made it clear that \u201ccourts of appeals must review all sentences\u2014whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range\u2014under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">White argues the district court: did not \u201cprovide a clear statement of reasons sufficient to justify the extreme upward departure of 87 months in addition to an advisory guideline sentence of 60 months;\u201d \u201cconsider[ed] inappropriate factors such as disagreement with the government\u2019s plea negotiation decisions and the policy decisions of the Sentencing Commission;\u201d failed to explain why the court\u2019s upward departure resulted in a sentence sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); failed to explain why the factors upon which the court relied, either individually or collectively, constituted \u201cextraordinary circumstances jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>tifying the extreme upward departure;\u201d and \u201cimposed [a] substantively unreasonable [sentence] after consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Op. Br. at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">I. Procedural reasonableness:</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">We begin by considering our standard of review for White\u2019s claim that the district court imposed his sentence in a procedurally unreasonable way. The government, citing <em>United States v. Romero, </em>491 F.3d 1173 (10th Cir.2007), argues that, since White failed to object following imposition of sentence to the government\u2019s calculation of his sentence or explanation for the sentence imposed, we must review his claim of procedural unreasonableness for plain error. White responds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANl\">as <em>Romero </em>makes clear, the law prior to that decision was inconsistent and confusing as to whether an objection had to be made after a procedurally erroneous sentence in order to preserve that error. Since <em>Romero </em>was decided well after the sentencing in this case, it would be manifestly unjust to apply that rule in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 1. White concedes, however, that at least two of our decisions prior to <em>Romero </em>had \u201cexpressly held that a contemporaneous objection to a procedural error in sentencing was required to avoid a plain error standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">We agree with the government that White was sufficiently on notice that a contemporaneous objection is required to avoid a plain error standard, and <em>Romero </em>simply reiterated and further clarified that. As in <em>Romero, </em>it is clear from the record in this case that, although White presented arguments against the court\u2019s proposed upward departure from the advisory Guidelines range, he \u201cdid not raise the procedural objection he now asserts after the district court imposed sentence.\u201d <em>Romero, </em>491 F.3d at 1176. We took the opportunity in <em>Romero </em>to reassert \u201c[o]ur conviction that the requirement of contemporaneous objection to procedural errors is consistent with our precedent and represents a reasonable burden on defendants____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1177.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, a plain error standard of review applies to White\u2019s allegations of procedural unreasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">\u201cWe find plain error only when there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) which affects substantial rights, and (4) which seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1178. \u201cThe plain error standard presents a heavy burden for an appellant, one which is not often satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. See United States v. Toro-Pelaez, </em>107 F.3d 819, 827 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201c[T]he plain-error exception to the contemporaneous-objection rule is to be used sparingly, solely in those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\u201d) (further quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">White has failed to establish that the district committed any error which affected his substantial rights. He argues that the district court failed to \u201cclearly set forth the factors upon which it relied to justify either its decision to grant an upward departure or the extreme degree of the departure imposed.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. He also argues the court considered inappropriate factors and failed to explain why departing upward on the basis of a dismissed count and running it concurrent to the count of conviction resulted in a reasonable sentence. We disagree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>White\u2019s complaints about the district court\u2019s methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">First, as the district court noted, USSG \u00a7 5K2.21 permits the court to \u201cdepart upward to reflect the actual seriousness of the offense based on conduct (1) underlying a charge dismissed as part of plea agreement in the case or underlying a potential charge not pursued in the case as part of a plea agreement or for any other reasons.\u201d Thus, the district court asked the probation office to calculate a sentence for count four (possession with the intent to distribute crack cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school), which was the count underlying count twelve (the count of conviction).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The connection between counts four and twelve is, therefore, obvious. Furthermore, the five-year sentence imposed under \u00a7 924(c) is required to be consecutive to any sentence for the underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Second, rather than failing to explain his reasons for departing upward from five years, the court\u2019s letters and sentencing decision amply explained its reasons for doing so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> White had distributed cocaine and possessed multiple firearms while his young children were present; he continued to sell cocaine even after being confronted by law enforcement authorities and having his residence searched; he had been charged with sixteen counts, all of which were serious, but ended up only pleading guilty to one; his conduct demonstrated a complete lack of respect for the law; the public and his young children needed to be protected from his conduct; and he was harming his children by exposing them to the drug trade. Even if some of the reasons the district court gave were of questionable propriety, or were extraneous comments, those reasons were overwhelmed by the permissible reasons given and were not structurally fatal to the whole sentencing proceeding. It is clear that the judge not only stated, but relied principally upon, appropriate reasons, under any standard of review. Thus, even if there was error, White cannot demonstrate that any procedural error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">II. Substantive reasonableness:</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\"><em>Gall </em>has made clear that we review \u201call sentences\u2014whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range\u2014under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 591. A substantively reasonable sentence re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>fleets the gravity of the crime and the \u00a7 8553(a) factors as applied to the case. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>509 F.3d 1290, 1297-98 (10th Cir.2007). The sentence in this case satisfies that standard. The court found an upward departure was appropriate under USSG \u00a7 5K2.21 \u201cto reflect the actual seriousness of the offense based on conduct ... underlying a charge dismissed as part of a plea agreement ...\u201d It further stated its awareness that it must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court discussed, and the record reflects, the nature and characteristics of White, the seriousness of his criminal conduct, the need to protect society from him, and the need for deterrence. We cannot say that, under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, the court abused its discretion in imposing the sentence it did on White.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b744-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

While we use the word \"departure\u201d throughout most of this opinion, we occasionally use the word \"variance.\u201d The district court used language suggestive of both, and, as our discussion below indicates, it is of no moment whether we call the above-Guidelines sentence in this case a \"departure\u201d or a \"variance.\u201d A variance occurs \"[w]hen a court enhances or detracts from the recommended range through application of \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v.

White spends a considerable amount of time arguing that the court\u2019s upward departure (or variance), from sixty months to 147 months, was extraordinary, and therefore required extraordinary circumstances. This argument was based upon our prior jurisprudence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cage, </em>451 F.3d 585 (10th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>469 F.3d 896 (10th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2973, 168 L.Ed.2d 706 (2007). However, these cases were overruled by <em>Gall v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), which specifically rejected \"an appellate rule that requires \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range\u201d or an appellate court's \"use of a rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595. The Gall Court did, however, state that \u201cappellate courts may ... take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
