The district court denied Dixon leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-21\">In his IFP motion, Dixon contends that prison officials\u2019 failure to log his mailing of a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, which was denied as untimely filed, deprived him of the opportunity to prove that he had timely filed his petition under the prison mail box rule and, consequently, denied him access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-22\">Dixon did not avail himself of the prison\u2019s legal mail system and, therefore, deprived himself of its benefits, including the prison mail log. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 25(a)(2)(C). Dixon has not demonstrated that the defendants denied him access to the courts. His appeal has no arguable basis in law or fact and, therefore, is frivolous. Moreover, as Dixon failed to address the district court\u2019s stated grounds for certifying that his appeal was not taken in good faith, he has waived the issue. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, Dixon\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as well as the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim each count as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Dixon is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
