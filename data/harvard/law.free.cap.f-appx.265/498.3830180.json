Restani, Chief Judge, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">The evidence compels a finding that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not based on substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, the IJ based his credibility determination on four factors: (1) the discrepancy between Gill\u2019s testimony and his father\u2019s affidavit about the political affiliation of Gill\u2019s two cousins, (2) the discrepancy over whether the photographs of Gill introduced were taken in California or Washington, (3) Gill\u2019s inability to identify who signed the All India Sikh Student Federation letter, and (4) Gill\u2019s inability to recall his father\u2019s exact age. Each of these reasons either inaccurately reflect the record or have no bearing on Gill\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">The IJ claimed that Gill was silent when asked about the discrepancy between Gill\u2019s testimony and his father\u2019s affidavit regarding the political affiliation of Gill\u2019s two cousins. The record reflects that Gill actually stated that the discrepancy may have been due to clerical error, or that his cousins may have been a member of two parties, Akali Dal Mann and All India Sikh Student Federation, at the same time. The dissent incorrectly claims that Gill was \u201cabsolutely silent\u201d when asked how often individuals are members of both organizations. Although he was asked about the frequency of dual membership, instead of being allowed to answer, he was interrupted by a question from the judge, \u201cHow old is your father?\u201d Neither the judge nor the lawyers remembered to give him a chance to answer the question about dual membership in these ideologically similar Sikh organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">Whether photographs of Gill were taken in California or Washington is a minor inconsistency that does not affect Gill\u2019s credibility pertaining to his asylum claim. The \u201cinaccuracies\u201d regarding the photographs were merely over whether they were taken in Fremont or Blaine, an inaccuracy easy for anyone to make about his photos.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">Gill\u2019s inability to identify the signature on the All India Sikh Student Federation letter does not relate to his credibility since there were no allegations pertaining to the letter\u2019s authenticity. We disagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>with our dissenting colleague that Gill \u201crecanted\u201d his testimony about his party membership. He just amplified and clarified what he had said in response to questions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Gill\u2019s inability to recall his father\u2019s exact age is also a minor issue that does not affect Gill\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The petition for review is GRANTED and we REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b523-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

And he is in addition to that also the propaganda secretary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao8\">A. There like he told his secretary to write this letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-31\">Q. Well, sir, earlier I asked you who wrote this letter and you said it was Mr. Gill. So Mr. Gill did in fact not write the letter. A. Like he ordered his secretary to write the letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-32\">(Transcript of Removal Proceeding at 78-79, November 14, 2002).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b524-6\">RAWLINSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AM5\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. I simply cannot agree that the record compels a finding of credibility. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (requiring affirmance unless \u201cthe evidence not only supports, but compels\u201d reversal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">As we have repeatedly held, if any one of the bases for the adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, the adverse credibility finding must be sustained. <em>See Chebchoub v. 1. N.S., </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001). In this case, at least three of the adverse credibility determinations are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Gill testified that he was a member of the All-India Sikh Students Federation. As proof of his membership, Gill submitted a document that he represented was signed by the Federation\u2019s president. When asked whether he knew the president, Gill recanted his testimony that the document was signed by the president and stated that it was signed by the president\u2019s secretary. Although it was not important whether the president or his secretary signed the letter, it was important that Gill was not truthful about his purported connection to the president of the Federation.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-18\">The majority disagrees on this point. However, there is no denying that Gill previously testified that he <em>knew </em>the author of the letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-19\">Q: You also submitted a letter from the All-India Sikh Student Federation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-20\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-21\">Q: Do you know the author of that letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-22\">A: It\u2019s also sent from the office in Amritsar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-23\">Q: My question was do you <em>know </em>who wrote this letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-24\">A: Herminder Sigh Gill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-25\">Q: Do you personally know Mr. Gill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-26\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-27\">Q: If I were to call him now and ask him about you, would he recognize your name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-28\">A: It\u2019s\u2014since a long time I am here, so I\u2019m not sure about this. (Transcript of Removal Proceeding at 135, 139, November 14, 2002).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-29\">If not a recantation, there was at a minimum, a conflict in Gill\u2019s testimony that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>would support an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Pal v. I.N.S., </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also Chebchoub, </em>257 F.3d at 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Gill also testified that he took a photograph with \u201cMr. Mann,\u201d president of Shiromani Akali Dal Mann, who was visiting Fremont, California. The import of this testimony is clear: Gill sought to align himself with a renowned activist to support his claim that he was persecuted due to his similar activities. Accordingly, any discrepancy in the details of this corroborating information would be material. <em>See Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 741-42 (9th Cir.2007). Gill testified that he had only taken pictures with Mr. Mann once. When confronted with certain inaccuracies regarding the photographs, Gill presented a witness whose testimony failed to corroborate Gill\u2019s testimony. This discrepancy on a material point constitutes substantial evidence supporting the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Finally, Gill was unable to adequately explain inconsistencies in the affidavits submitted by his father and his uncle concerning one of the arrests. Gill\u2019s uncle stated that Gill\u2019s cousins were members of the Akali Dal Mann, while his father described the cousins as members of the All India Sikh Students Federation, the group to which Gill purportedly belonged. Gill was absolutely silent when asked how often individuals are members of both organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The majority maintains that my reference to Gill\u2019s absolute silence is incorrect. The majority seeks to re-characterize the silence as an interruption by the IJ. However, an examination of the transcript reveals that there was no interruption by the IJ. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">MR. MAINA TO MR. GILL Q: As far as you know is it possible for someone to be a member of the Akali Dal Mann and the All-India Sikh Students Federation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">A: Yes, one can be a member of both parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">Q: Is that a common occurrence as far as you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">A: I couldn\u2019t understand, could you repeat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-14\">Q: Do you know if that happens a lot, where somebody\u2019s a member of both organizations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-15\">JUDGE TO MR. GILL Q: How old is your father?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">(Transcript of Removal Proceeding at 94-95, November 14, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-17\">This exchange is easily contrasted with one reflecting an actual interruption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-18\">MR. MAINA TO MR. GILL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-19\">Q: Can you tell us what this document is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-21\">A: That, too, is an affidavit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-22\">Q: Okay. This one says\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-23\">JUDGE TO MR. GILL From whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-24\">JUDGE TO MR. MAINA Hold on a second.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-25\">JUDGE TO MR. GILL Q: From whom? Whom? Whose affidavit?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-26\">(Transcript of Removal Proceeding at 103, August 9, 2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-27\">The IJ was not required to accept Gill\u2019s equivocal explanation of the discrepancies in the affidavits, particularly in view of the other inconsistencies in the record. <em>See Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1062 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Cir.2005) (recognizing that discrepancies may support an adverse credibility determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Although I may have made a different determination if viewing the evidence as a trier of fact, that is not our standard of review. As I am not compelled to find that Gill was credible, I would deny the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\">.
