To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-21\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than ninety days after the BIA\u2019s March 1, 2004 order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Singh did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that conditions in India have changed so that he now has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii); <em>see also Malty, </em>381 F.3d at 945. Singh\u2019s reliance on <em>Franco-Rosendo v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 965 (9th Cir.2006) is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its sua sponte authority. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b553-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
