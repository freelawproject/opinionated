The IJ ruled that although Ten\u2019s testimony was credible, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>events and incidents she described do not amount to past persecution or give rise to an objectively reasonable fear of future prosecution. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">To establish her eligibility for asylum, Ten was required to prove she suffered actual past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). For withholding of removal, she had to show it is more likely than not she would be subjected to persecution if she returned to Indonesia. <em>Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1070 (9th Cir.2007). Ten\u2019s experiences in Indonesia do not amount to the type of past persecution that would make her eligible for relief. <em>See id. </em>(noting persecution \u201cis an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). The general discrimination and harassment she suffered as a Chinese Christian in Indonesia, is not sufficient to <em>compel </em>a conclusion that she suffered past persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir.2003) (noting \u201cit is significant that Nagoulko never suffered any significant physical violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Ten also failed to establish she has an objective fear of future persecution. As we recently explained, \u201charassment, discrimination, and sporadic violence may be a fear shared by millions of ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia,\u201d but such fear is not sufficient to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Lolong, </em>484 F.3d at 1181. Moreover, Ten did not leave Indonesia when she was given that opportunity by her employer. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000) (noting petitioner remained for two years after an alleged incident). Ten\u2019s family has not been harmed or persecuted even though her sisters continue to practice their Christian religion. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 817 (9th Cir.2001) (noting remaining family members were never \u201ccharged, arrested or physically harmed\u201d for practicing their religion). Finally, notwithstanding \u201cthe long history of ethnic and religious strife in Indonesia,\u201d the State Department reports indicate the Indonesian Government has made a \u201ccommitment to freedom of religion\u201d and has taken \u201cconcrete steps to suppress ethnic and religious violence and to encourage reconciliation between opposing groups.\u201d <em>See Lolong, </em>484 F.3d at 1180-81 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\"><em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922 (9th Cir.2004), does not compel a contrary result. In <em>Sael, </em>we reviewed \u201cIndonesia\u2019s history of anti-Chinese violence and official discrimination\u201d and concluded the Chinese minority is \u201cat least a disfavored group\u201d whose members, particularly Christians, \u201ccould have a well-founded fear of persecution in Indonesia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 927 (internal quotations omitted). Because Sael was both Chinese and Christian, she was required to \u201cdemonstrate a \u2018comparatively low\u2019 level of individualized risk in order to prove that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She did this by testifying \u201ccredibly at her asylum hearing about various incidents of discrimination, harassment, and threats to her safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, she recounted that her house was stoned, her car was broken into and destroyed, she was chased by rioters, and threatened personally with physical harm. <em>Id. </em>at 927-28. Ten did not suffer this type of individualized persecution. Rather, other than general discrimination and harassment, she was only a witness to the events that gave rise to her claim of future persecution. <em>Lolong </em>makes clear there must be a showing of an individual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>ized risk of persecution in contrast to a \u201cgeneral, undifferentiated claim.... \u201d <em>Lolong, </em>484 F.3d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"A-8p\">Finally, we reject Ten\u2019s claim that her due process rights were violated because the IJ did not give her an opportunity to correct or explain any flaws in the record and because the IJ relied upon generalized State Department reports rather than requesting an advisory opinion based upon her particular circumstances. Ten did not raise these issues before the BIA and thus she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. <em>See Morgan v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 1084, 1090 n. 2 (9th Cir.2007) (explaining exhaustion is required for procedural due process claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b536-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
