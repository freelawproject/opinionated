R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b580-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Fletcher Corey appeals the district court\u2019s order granting defendants United States Postal Service\u2019s (\u201cUSPS\u201d) and Dannie Murphy\u2019s motion to dismiss Corey\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b), and state law based negligence, negligent supervision, and intentional infliction of emotion distress claims arising from the USPS allegedly transmitting Corey\u2019s \u201cStep 1\u201d labor union grievance documentation regarding an involuntary work reassignment to the counsel of a USPS employee in a separate state action Corey had brought against that USPS employee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Corey challenges the following district court rulings: (1) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his state law based negligence claims because he failed to and otherwise cannot plead the United States\u2019 waiver of sovereign immunity under the Federal Tort Claims Act; (2) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his Privacy Act claim because the grievance documentation that is the subject of Corey\u2019s federal suit is not contained in the USPS\u2019 \u201csystem of records,\u201d which is what the Privacy Act protects from disclosure; and (3) the court lacked personal jurisdiction over defendants USPS and Murphy due to Corey\u2019s failure to complete service of process against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, <em>see Christensen v. Stevedoring Servs. of Am., Inc., </em>430 F.3d 1032, 1034 (9th Cir.2005), and we affirm on the grounds the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Corey\u2019s tort and Privacy Act claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">The only remedy available for torts allegedly committed by the United States or its agencies is through the Federal Tort Claims Act. <em>FDIC v. Craft, </em>157 F.3d 697, 706 (9th Cir.1998). The district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Corey\u2019s claims for negligence and negligent supervision because Corey failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the Federal Tort Claims Act. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>704 F.2d 1431, 1442 (9th Cir.1983) (\u201cExhaustion of the claims proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>dures established under the Act is a prerequisite to district court jurisdiction.\u201d). The grievance Corey\u2019s labor union filed on his behalf does not satisfy the Federal Tort Claims Act requirement to file an administrative claim before filing suit. We need not address all the reasons this grievance may not satisfy 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a), because it is sufficient to rest our holding on the grievance\u2019s failure to request a \u201csum certain.\u201d <em>See Blair v. IRS, </em>304 F.3d 861, 865 (9th Cir.2002). Even if Corey\u2019s grievance regarding the release of his earlier grievance documents was a proper administrative claim, which it was not, he filed the instant federal action against the wrong parties. <em>See Craft, </em>157 F.3d at 706 (\u201cAlthough [FTCA] claims can arise from the acts or omissions of United States agencies ..., an agency itself cannot be sued under the FTCA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">As to Corey\u2019s Privacy Act claim, the district court should have converted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction into a motion for summary judgment because the \u201cstatute provides the basis for both the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal court and the plaintiffs substantive claim for relief\u2019 and, thus, the question of jurisdiction and the merits of an action are intertwined. <em>See Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, </em>373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotations marks omitted). The Privacy Act applies only to documents contained within an agency\u2019s system of records. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b); <em>Baker v. Department of Navy, </em>814 F.2d 1381, 1384 (9th Cir.1987). Corey offered no evidence to counter the USPS\u2019 evidence that Corey\u2019s Step 1 Grievance documentation, the disclosure of which forms the basis of Corey\u2019s federal action, is not part of the USPS \u201csystem of records.\u201d Accordingly, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the disclosed documents are a part of the USPS \u201csystem of records\u201d, and summary judgment for defendants is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">As there remains no claim which invoked federal question jurisdiction, there can be no pendent jurisdiction for the state law based tort claims. <em>See Herman Family Revocable Trust v. Teddy Bear, </em>254 F.3d 802, 806 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b580-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
