The district court dismissed Derrow\u2019s suit because it was barred by the principles of res judicata; it was an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion; it was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2864, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); and it was barred by the statute of limitations. The district court also denied Derrow\u2019s request to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Derrow\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Derrow does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his lawsuit. Because he fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, the argument is abandoned. <em>See Brinkmaun v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Derrow has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The dismissal of Derrow\u2019s lawsuit by the district court as frivolous and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Derrow is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
