We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm. Because the facts are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>familial- to the parties, we do not recite them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Strong\u2019s certified claim based on the voluntariness of his plea is proeedurally barred. <em>See Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 729, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991) (The federal court \u201cwill not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\u201d). On direct appeal, the California Court of Appeal denied his claim because he failed to comply with California Penal Code \u00a7 1287.5, an independent and adequate state procedural ground. <em>See People v. Mendez, </em>19 Cal.4th 1084, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 301, 969 P.2d 146 (1999). Strong has not shown cause and prejudice to overcome this bar. <em>Poland v. Stewart, </em>169 F.3d 573, 587 (9th Cir.1999)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We also deny the motion to expand the Certificate of Appealability (COA) to include a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-l(e) (construing the inclusion of an uncertified issue in the opening brief as a motion to expand the COA). Strong has not made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d as required for a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Lambright v. Stewart, </em>220 F.3d 1022, 1025 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b513-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
