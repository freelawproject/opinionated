Paolini appeals the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to Defendants-Appellees Albert-son\u2019s, Inc. and the Plan Administrator of Albertson\u2019s Amended and Restated Stock-Based Incentive Plan (hereinafter, \u201cAlbert-son\u2019s\u201d). In consolidated case No. OS-35724, Albertson\u2019s also seeks attorneys\u2019 fees incurred on appeal. In both appeals, Albertson\u2019s basis for the fees request is Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3), an Idaho statute that provides for recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees in civil actions on a \u201ccommercial transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We reverse the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 12-120(3) to Albertson\u2019s for defending against Paolini\u2019s claims related to the attempted exercise of stock options. We affirm the award of attorneys\u2019 fees for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Albertson\u2019s counterclaim to collect on a promissory note, but only for those fees actually attributable to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">An award of attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to state law is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson v. Columbia Prop. Anchorage, </em>437 F.3d 894, 898-99 (9th Cir.2006). A district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a particular state statute to permit an award of attorneys\u2019 fees is, however, reviewed <em>de novo. Kona Enter., Inc. v. Estate of Bishop, </em>229 F.3d 877, 883 (9th Cir.2000). We review the applicability of \u00a7 12-120(3) to Paolini\u2019s and Albertson\u2019s claims <em>de novo. Resolution Trust Corp. v. Midwest Federal Sav. Bank, </em>36 F.3d 785, 799 (9th Cir.1993) <em>(de novo </em>standard applies to whether the \u201capplication for attorneys\u2019 fees was proper under state law and [the parties\u2019 contract]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The district court awarded fees to Albertson\u2019s for its defense of Paolini\u2019s claims four, five, nine and eleven. The district court reasoned that Albertson\u2019s was entitled to fees under \u00a7 12-120(3) for claims four, five, nine and eleven \u201cbased on the stock option agreement, because it is a type of employment contract and thus a commercial transaction[.]\u201d The district court erred; \u00a7 12-120(3) is not applicable to these claims. First, contrary to the district court\u2019s stated basis for awarding fees, the stock option plan and agreements were not employment contracts\u2014each of those agreements expressly disclaimed any right to employment. Second, although Paolini and Albertson\u2019s were engaged in a commercial relationship as employer-employee, this relationship does not automatically render Paolini\u2019s attempt to enforce option rights into claims based on a \u201ccommercial transaction.\u201d <em>Tolley v. THI Co., </em>140 Idaho 253, 92 P.3d 503, 512 (2004) (\u201c[Idaho] precedent clearly states that a commercial transaction does not arise in every instance in which a commercial relationship exists.\u201d). We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s award of fees to Albert-son\u2019s for defense of Paolini\u2019s claims four, five, nine and eleven.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Albertson\u2019s is, however, entitled to recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees for its promissory note counterclaim. \u00a7 12-120(3) (applicable to actions \u201cto recover on ... [a] note\u201d). We affirm the $15,933.40 fee award for Albertson\u2019s counterclaim, the amount the district court found actually attributable to prosecution of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">The district court\u2019s fee award included $142,165.37 for fees related to \u201cprocedural matters.\u201d This district court arrived at this figure by calculating fees on a pro rata basis for the five claims on which Albert-son\u2019s had recovered attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 12-120(3). The district court elected to calculate \u201cprocedural matter\u201d fees pro rata because neither it nor Albertson\u2019s could \u201cprecisely allocate the fees between the work on procedural matters which relate to [claims on which Albertson\u2019s recovered] and the work on procedural matters which rekate [sic] to those claims for which the Court has not authorized attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d We reverse the award of attorneys\u2019 fees for procedural matters in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">As the district court acknowledged, it is \u201cdifficult, if not impossible\u201d to discern what amount of the procedural matter fees were incurred on a particular claim. And, in light of our disposition, even if procedural matter fees could be traced back to a particular claim, Albertson\u2019s would only be entitled to those fees connected to the promissory note counterclaim. Accordingly, we limit Albertson\u2019s fees for prosecution of its promissory note counterclaim in the district court to $15,933.40, the amount the court found actually attributable to that claim. <em>Brooks v. Gigray Ranches, </em>128 Idaho 72, 910 P.2d 744, 751 (1996) (no award of fees under \u00a7 12-120(3) where fees attributable to contract claim \u201ccould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>not be separated\u201d from claims outside the scope of \u00a7 12-120(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Finally, we deny Albertson\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal. Because we substantially reverse the district court\u2019s fees order, Albertson\u2019s is not entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal pursuant to \u00a7 12-120(3), notwithstanding our prior affirmance of the district court\u2019s merits decision. <em>J.R. Simplot Co. v. Rycair, Inc., </em>138 Idaho 557, 67 P.3d 36, 44-45 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 39 and Ninth Circuit R. 39-1, Paolini shall recover costs incurred in the appeal of attorneys\u2019 fees order and in responding to Albert-son\u2019s request for fees on appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 39(a)(4) (\u201cIf a judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, modified, or vacated, costs are taxed only as the court orders.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">AFFIRMED, in part; REVERSED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b692-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
