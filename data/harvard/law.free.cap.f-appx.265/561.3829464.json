He was subsequently indicted and pled guilty to a charge of illegally attempting to enter the United States after having previously been deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Gutierrez-Cruz was sentenced to a 60-month term of imprisonment. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-27\">The district court did not err in failing to dismiss the indictment for failure to state a specific overt act that is a substantial step towards the completion of the crime charged. <em>United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, </em>549 U.S. 102, 127 S.Ct. 782, 787-88, 166 L.Ed.2d 591 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-28\">The district court also did not err in imposing a 16-level sentence enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), based on its finding that Gutierrez-Cruz\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>prior conviction under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11351 categorically qualified as a drug trafficking offense. <em>See United States v. Morales-Perez, </em>467 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that a conviction under California Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11351.5 categorically qualifies as a drug trafficking offense). Gutierrez-Cruz\u2019s claim that section 11351 is categorically overbroad because it prohibits the possession or purchase for sale of a wider range of controlled substances than does federal law is misplaced. To the extent that California\u2019s list of controlled substances contains substances not specifically defined as \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d under federal law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> those substances fall within the definition of \u201ccontrolled substance analogues,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and therefore are treated as schedule I controlled substances. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Gutierrez-Cruz\u2019s argument that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Covian-Sandoval, </em>462 F.3d 1090, 1097 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(6) defines \"controlled substance\u201d as \"a drug or other substance, or immediate precursor included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V of part B of this subchapter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 802(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\">.
