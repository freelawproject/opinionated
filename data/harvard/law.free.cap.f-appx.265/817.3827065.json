After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b842-21\">While a lawful permanent resident, Sammour was convicted of several criminal offenses, including 1985 convictions for two counts of receiving stolen property, a 1992 conviction for attempted receipt of stolen property and 1992 federal convictions for two counts of bank fraud. In 1992, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued an Order to Show Cause, charging Sammour with deportability under former INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(ii), because his criminal convictions constituted two or more crimes involving moral turpitude. In 1995, an IJ ordered Sammour deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-22\">That same year, Sammour filed an application for waiver of deportation under former INA \u00a7 212(c). In 1996, Congress passed two pieces of legislation (\u201cthe 1996 amendments\u201d) that significantly changed immigration law, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>Pub. L. No. 104-182, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), enacted on April 24, 1996; and the Illegal Immigration Removal and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C., 110 Stat. 8009-546, enacted on September 30, 1996. Among other things, the 1996 amendments eliminated \u00a7 212(c) relief for aliens convicted of certain disqualifying offenses, including \u201ccrimes of moral turpitude.\u201d <em>See </em>AEDPA \u00a7 440(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In 1997, the IJ denied Sammour\u2019s application because his 1985 receipt of stolen property and 1992 bank fraud convictions were \u201ccrimes of moral turpitude\u201d and the 1996 amendments had rendered aliens convicted of such crimes ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. In 1998, the BIA affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">In 2001, Sammour filed with the BIA a \u201cSpecial 212(c) Motion to Reopen and Remand\u201d based on <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2293, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), which held that the provisions of the 1996 amendments eliminating \u00a7 212(c) relief could not apply retroactively to aliens who were eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time they pled guilty to a disqualifying offense. The BIA granted Sammour\u2019s motion to reopen and remanded the ease to an IJ for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">On remand, the DHS filed a motion to pretermit Sammour\u2019s application for \u00a7 212(c) relief, which was denied. The DHS filed a renewed motion to pretermit Sammour\u2019s \u00a7 212(c) application, charging Sammour with deportability under another immigration statute, former INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(C), based on a 1982 Ohio conviction for possessing an unregistered firearm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">The IJ granted the DHS\u2019s renewed motion. The IJ concluded that the 1996 amendments\u2019 elimination of \u00a7 212(c) relief applied to Sammour, despite <em>St. Cyr, </em>because Sammour was convicted following a trial, rather than a guilty plea. Alternatively, the IJ concluded that Sammour was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because his 1982 firearms offense did not have a comparable ground for exclusion, and thus could not be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">The BIA declined to adopt the I J\u2019s denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief based on the fact that Sammour\u2019s 1982 firearm conviction resulted from a jury verdict. The BIA concluded that \u00a7 309(c) of IIRIRA and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(g) preserved \u00a7 212(c) relief requests for aliens, like Sammour, who were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>placed in deportation proceedings before enactment of the 1996 amendments. Thus, the BIA determined that Sammour\u2019s conviction by a jury, rather than a guilty plea, did not affect the availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Instead, the BIA concluded that Sammour was statutorily ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. However, this ineligibility was not based on the 1996 amendments, but based on a separate ground. A former \u00a7 212(c) waiver was available to removable lawful permanent residents only to the extent the grounds for removal were analogous to grounds for exclusion under INA \u00a7 212(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a). The BIA concluded that Sammour was ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver of removability based on his 1982 firearm offense because there was no comparable ground for exclusion under \u00a7 212(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Sammour filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">As a threshold matter, we first determine whether we have jurisdiction over Sammour\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Bahar v. Ashcroft, </em>264 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). We lack jurisdiction \u201cto review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed [certain enumerated criminal offenses].\u201d INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Moore v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 919, 922-23 (11th Cir.2001). One of the enumerated criminal offenses is a conviction \u201cunder any law of ... possessing ... any weapon, part, or accessory which is a firearm....\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C); INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (referencing, for the purpose of identifying disqualifying offenses, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C)). When judicial review is limited by statutory conditions, we retain jurisdiction to determine only whether these statutory conditions exist. <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). Thus, our review is limited to the threshold issues of whether a petitioner is (1) an alien; (2) who is removable; (3) based on having committed a disqualifying offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">In 1982, Sammour was convicted in Ohio of possessing an unregistered firearm. Sammour does not dispute that his firearm conviction is a disqualifying offense for purposes of depriving this Court of jurisdiction to review his final removal order. Therefore, to the extent Sammour seeks review of his removal order, we lack jurisdiction and dismiss his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">We still must consider Sammour\u2019s \u00a7 212(c) claim for waiver of removability. As to the discretionary aspect of that relief, we also lack jurisdiction to review denials of discretionary relief, including waiver of removability under INA \u00a7 212(c). <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae; <em>see also Camacho-Salinas v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>460 F.3d 1343, 1347-48 (11th Cir.2006). However, we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231; <em>Balo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number><em>gun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1359-60 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, we have jurisdiction to review the legal question of whether Sammour\u2019s firearm conviction rendered him ineligible for \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s waiver of removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Under \u00a7 212(c), the Attorney General has the discretion to waive an alien\u2019s inadmissible status if the alien was a lawful permanent resident who had lived continuously in the United States for seven years. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1996). Although \u00a7 212(c) originally provided for a waiver of exclusion for aliens who had temporarily gone abroad, the provision was \u201cextended to provide relief from deportation orders as well.\u201d <em>Asencio v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 614, 616 (11th Cir.1994). However, as already noted, the \u00a7 212(c) waiver is available to removable lawful permanent residents only to the extent the grounds for removal are analogous to grounds for exclusion under INA \u00a7 212(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Here, the BIA concluded that Sammour was ineligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver of removability based on his firearms offense because there is no comparable ground for exclusion under \u00a7 212(a). This Court has reached the same conclusion. <em>See Rodriguez-Padron v. INS, </em>13 F.3d 1455, 1460-61 (11th Cir.1994) (concluding that an alien convicted of a firearms violation is not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because there is not a comparable ground for exclusion); <em>see also Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1031 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc) (same). Accordingly, the BIA correctly concluded that Sammour\u2019s firearm conviction rendered him ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. With respect to this issue, Sammour\u2019s petition for review is denied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-15\">. In 2003, the INS was abolished and its enforcement functions were transferred to the newly created DHS. <em>See </em>Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, \u00a7\u00a7 441, 471, 116 Stat. 2135.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\">. Section 440(d) of AEDPA amended INA \u00a7 212(c) to expand the types of offenses that could disqualify an alien for \u00a7 212(c) relief to include an alien who is deportable \"by reason of having committed any criminal offense covered in section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) [aggravated felonies], (B) [controlled substances convictions], (C) [certain firearm offenses], or (D) [miscellaneous crimes], or any offense covered by section 241(a)(2)(A)(ii) [multiple criminal convictions] for which both predicate offenses are covered by section 241(a)(2)(A)(i) [crimes of moral turpitude].\" Later, IIRIRA repealed \u00a7 212(c) altogether. <em>See </em>Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C Title III \u00a7 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-597.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\">. INA \u00a7 241 authorized the Attorney General to enter an order deporting an alien who fell within certain classes of deportable aliens. Included within this list of deportable aliens were aliens convicted of certain firearm offenses, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-14\">(C) Certain firearm offenses Any alien who at any time after entry is convicted under any law of purchasing, selling, offering for sale, exchanging, using, owning, possessing, or carrying, or of attempting or conspiring to purchase, sell, offer for sale, exchange, use own, possess, or carry, any weapon, part, or accessory which is a firearm or destructive device (as defined in section 921(a) of Title 18) in violation of any law is deportable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(C) (1996) (currently codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(C)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">. Sammour argues that the IJ erred in finding that he was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief under <em>St. Cyr </em>because he was convicted after trial. However, the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s ruling on this point. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that we review the IJ's reasoning only to the extent the BIA adopts it).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b844-13\">. The government filed a motion to dismiss Sammour's petition for lack of appellate jurisdiction. We review issues of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b845-23\">. Although Sammour\u2019s deportation proceedings began before April 1, 1997, his petition for review is governed by IIRIRA. <em>Huang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>429 F.3d 1002, 1008 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that, after the REAL ID Act, \u2018\u2018[t]he date on which a petition is filed is no longer important, as Congress has now directed that all petitions for review will be governed under the permanent provisions of IIRIRA\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b845-26\">.
