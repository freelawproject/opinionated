On a petition for review of a BIA decision, this court reviews factual findings for substantial evidence and questions of law de novo. <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). The substantial-evidence standard requires only that the BIA\u2019s conclusion be based on the evidence presented and that the decision is substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). The IJ has the duty to make credibility determinations concerning witnesses. <em>Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-21\">Imtiaz\u2019s brief supporting his petition for review points to no evidence in the record, other than his own testimony, to support his argument attacking the credibility determination. Imtiaz has not shown that the record compels that the finding be reversed. The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>termination, adopted by the BIA, is supported by substantial evidence and should be upheld. <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79. To the extent that Imtiaz\u2019s brief raises his other claims of non-discretionary withholding of removal and CAT relief, substantial evidence also supports the rejection of his applications for withholding of removal and for CAT relief. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906-08 (5th Cir.2002). Imtiaz\u2019s petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
