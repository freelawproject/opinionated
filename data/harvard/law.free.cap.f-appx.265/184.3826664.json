The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the order of the immigration judge (IJ). The respondent moves for summary disposition based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Mortera-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 246, 255-56 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1031, 126 S.Ct. 733, 163 L.Ed.2d 569 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-21\">Cardenas argues that the BIA erred by determining that he was not eligible for adjustment of status. Because he was inadmissible pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I), the BIA did not act arbitrarily when it determined that Cardenas was not eligible for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l)(A)(i). <em>Mortera-Cruz, </em>409 F.3d at 255-56. Although Cardenas contends that <em>MorieraCruz </em>was wrongly decided and asks this court to overrule it, one panel of this court cannot overrule a prior panel determination. <em>See Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-22\">Cardenas urges that he could have obtained adjustment of status if he had been granted permission to reapply for admission, and he asserts that he should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>given the opportunity to obtain a nunc pro tunc 1-212 waiver to retroactively cure his illegal reentry. However, Cardenas never affirmatively sought permission to apply for readmission, and he does not specify on what grounds any such request would have been based. Moreover, Cardenas\u2019 argument is based on Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Perez-Gonzalez v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 783 (9th Cir.2004), which was specifically rejected by this court in <em>Mortera-Cruz. See </em>409 F.3d at 255-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Cardenas opines that the BIA\u2019s decision leaves it open to constitutional attack, but he has abandoned any such constitutional challenge by failing to brief it. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because this court is bound by <em>Mortera-Cruz, </em>there is no substantial question as to the outcome of the case, and summary disposition is appropriate. <em>See NLRB v. Evans Plumbing Co., </em>639 F.2d 291, 292 n. 1 (5th Cir.1981). The petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">MOTION FOR SUMMARY DISPOSITION GRANTED; PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
