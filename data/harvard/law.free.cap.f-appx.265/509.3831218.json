R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b534-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-16\">Lijuan Yang, a native and citizen of China, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 decision that adopted and affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we dismiss in part and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-17\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Yang\u2019s asylum application was untimely because it was based on disputed facts. <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition as to Yang\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-18\">Yang\u2019s contention that the one-year bar is unconstitutional as applied to her because she arrived in the United States prior to its implementation and she was never advised of the change in the law, fails. <em>See Antonio-Martinez v. INS, </em>317 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2003) (applying the general rule that \u201cignorance of the law is no excuse\u201d to the immigration context).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-19\">In regard to withholding of removal, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Yang was unable to explain how the police harassed her husband. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>INS, </em>188 F.3d 1147, 1153 (9th Cir.1999) (approving IJ\u2019s finding that an applicant\u2019s testimony was suspicious given its lack of specificity). In addition, Yang gave conflicting statements regarding her motivation for overstaying her visa. <em>See Li, </em>378 F.3d at 962. Accordingly, we deny the petition as to Yang\u2019s withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Because Yang\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony that the IJ and BIA found not credible, and because she points to no other evidence that the IJ and BIA should have considered in determining CAT relief, substantial evidence supports the denial of CAT relief. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b534-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
