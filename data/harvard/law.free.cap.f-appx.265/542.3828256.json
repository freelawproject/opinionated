The parties are familiar with the facts of this case, and we refer to them here only to the extent necessary to explain our disposition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s findings of facts for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>See Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Entm\u2019t Distrib., </em>429 F.3d 869, 879 (9th Cir.2005). The district court reviewed the decision of the Administrative Appeals Office (\u201cAAO\u201d) pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702, 706. Under the APA, agency decisions may be set aside if they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>see also United States v. Bean, </em>537 U.S. 71, 77, 123 S.Ct. 584, 154 L.Ed.2d 483 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Here, Assuta submitted substantial evidence that Chandrasekhar had been, and would be, acting as its Management Information Systems Manager (\u201cMIS Manager\u201d). This evidence included, <em>inter alia, </em>two detailed letters that explained Chandrasekhar\u2019s significant past and future duties and Assuta\u2019s reliance on his technological and business expertise. The letters demonstrated that Chandrasekhar\u2019s job fit the Occupational Outlook Handbook\u2019s (\u201cHandbook\u201d) definition of a MIS Manager and that Assuta required his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">The AAO, however, misconstrued both Assuta\u2019s evidence and the Handbook to conclude that a small medical company like Assuta had no need of a MIS Manager. The Handbook contemplates that MIS Managers will perform a variety of technological and financial tasks for their companies, depending on those companies\u2019 needs. Nonetheless, the AAO criticized Chandrasekhar for his involvement in a \u201cmixture\u201d of non-technical tasks, and arbitrarily reclassified each of those tasks to determine that Chandrasekhar was actually performing a variety of non-specialty occupations. At the same time, the AAO criticized Chandrasekhar for being too involved in the day-to-day implementation of Assuta\u2019s information systems. These contradictory criticisms appear driven by the belief that only large computer companies require MIS Managers. This misguided belief was not supported by the Handbook, Assuta\u2019s evidence, or common sense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">Because the AAO\u2019s decision ran counter to the evidence in the record, it was arbitrary and capricious, and the district court erred in affirming it. <em>See Sw. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>100 F.3d 1443, 1448 (9th Cir.1996) (explaining that an agency\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious if \u201cthe agency ... offered an explanation for its decision that [ran] counter to the evidence before the agency....\u201d). We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law and remand for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\">. The AAO's decision is also undermined by its approval of Assuta's original H-1B visa petition. Notably, in an apparent violation of its own policies, the AAO failed to explain why that prior approval was erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
