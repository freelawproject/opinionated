Recinos-Duarte challenges the district court\u2019s determination that his previous California robbery conviction was a crime of violence warranting a 16-level adjustment to his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Our review of Reeinos-Duarte\u2019s contention is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-24\">Although robbery is an enumerated crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2, the Guideline, Recinos-Duarte argues that robbery under CalPenal Code \u00a7 211 does not meet the generic, contemporary definition of robbery because the California statute may be violated not only by the use of force but also by threats to property. Thus, Recinos-Duarte argues, the offense does not comport with the contemporary meaning of the enumerated offense of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-25\">The district court\u2019s characterization of a prior offense is a question of law that this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir.2006). Section 2L1.2 of the Guidelines provides that the offense level for unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States shall be increased by 16 levels if the defendant has a prior conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as (1) any specific enumerated offense, including \u201crobbery,\u201d or (2) \u201cany offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ment the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. (B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">When determining whether a state conviction constitutes a specifically enumerated, but undefined, offense for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s erime-of-violence adjustment, this court uses a \u201ccommon sense approach.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 274 (5th Cir.2005). Under this approach, we determine whether a violation of the underlying statute constitutes the enumerated offense as the enumerated offense is understood in its \u201c \u2018ordinary, contemporary, [and] common\u2019 meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275. If the underlying statute encompasses prohibited behavior that is not within the plain, ordinary meaning of the enumerated offense, the defendant\u2019s sentence cannot be upheld. <em>Id. </em>at 276-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In <em>Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d at 379-80, this court addressed whether the Texas offense of robbery is a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2. We noted that the generic, contemporary meaning of an offense generally corresponds to the definition in a majority of the States\u2019 criminal codes; sources of meaning also include the Model Penal Code, treatises, federal and state law, dictionaries, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. <em>Id. </em>at 379. We concluded: \u201cthe generic form of robbery may be thought of as aggravated larceny, containing at least the elements of misappropriation of property under circumstances involving [immediate] danger to the person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is this \u201cimmediate danger element [that] makes robbery deserving of greater punishment than that provided for larceny and extortion....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Such danger is inherently present when property is taken by force or putting in fear. <em>Id. </em>at 380-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The California robbery statute proscribes \u201cthe felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d CalPenal Code \u00a7 211. Fear is defined as either the \u201cfear of an unlawful injury to the person or property of the person robbed\u201d or \u201cfear of an immediate and unlawful injury to the person or property of anyone in the company of the person robbed at the time of the robbery.\u201d CalPenal Code \u00a7 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Although Recinos-Duarte maintains that a conviction under the California robbery statute is not a crime of violence because the statute criminalizes threats to property as well as persons, his assertion is based on a misunderstanding of the essential language of the statute defining robbery as a crime committed: (1) directly against the victim or in his presence; and (2) against his will. Like the Texas statute at issue in <em>Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>the California robbery statute involves the misappropriation of property under circumstances involving danger to the person. 469 F.3d at 380. Regardless of how the robbery occurs, that danger is inherent in the criminal act. Thus, even when the statute is violated by placing the victim in fear of injury to property, the property has been misappropriated in circumstances \u201cinvolving [immediate] danger to the person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Accordingly, robbery under \u00a7 211 of the California Penal Code falls within the generic or contemporary meaning of robbery as understood by this court. The \u00a7 2L1.2 adjustment was proper, and the district court properly calculated the advisory guidelines range. Recinos-Duarte has failed to show error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Recinos-Duarte challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v.
