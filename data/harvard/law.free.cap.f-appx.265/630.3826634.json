To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s determination that Sakka failed to file his asylum application within one year of his arrival to the United States. <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 648 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-23\">We also lack jurisdiction to review Sakka\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because he failed to raise it before the BIA and thereby failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Ontiveros-Lopez v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Sakka failed to establish he was persecuted or fears persecution on account of a protected ground where he failed to show the problems he had with a Syrian general were other than personal in nature. <em>See Kozulin v. INS, </em>218 F.3d 1112, 1116-17 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-25\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Sakka was ineligible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>CAT relief. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001) (recognizing that it is petitioner\u2019s burden \u201cto establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b654-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
