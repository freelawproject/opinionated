Specifically, Gallegos challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his request for an evidentiary hearing and his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion by not holding an evidentiary hearing and because it properly concluded that Gallegos failed to establish that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">On July 21, 2000, Gallegos was involved in an altercation with Alfredo \u201cLittle Freddy\u201d Lopez (Lopez) and Jesse Hernandez (Hernandez). Hernandez testified at trial that following a verbal exchange with Gallegos, Lopez took off running while Hernandez stayed behind to face Gallegos. Gallegos approached Hernandez and stated that he was only interested in Lopez. Gallegos fired a shot into the air and Hernandez ran. While he was running Hernandez heard a second shot but did not see who fired it. Hernandez returned to the area where the shots were fired and found Lopez lying on the ground, apparently dead, shot once in the back. Albert Ayala (Ayala) was on his front porch across the street from where Lopez was shot. Ayala testified that he heard the first shot and saw Hernandez and Lopez running. Ayala also saw the muzzle blast from the second shot, and immediately lay on the ground. \u201cWhen he looked up, he saw Lopez lying on the street and Gallegos walking away. Later that evening, Gallegos was stopped by police, who found a pistol in the truck in which he was traveling. Investigators found one .40 caliber casing that was fired from the pistol in the area where the shots were fired. Police conducted a handwiping test on possible suspects and only Gallegos tested positive for recently firing a gun. After his arrest, Gallegos admitted in a written statement to the police that he fired two shots, one in the air and one in the direction of Lopez. However, he maintained that neither shot hit Lopez and that Lopez continued running after both shots were fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">On April 16, 2001, a Texas state court jury found Gallegos guilty of first-degree murder. The court sentenced Gallegos to fifty years in prison. After Gallegos exhausted his direct appeals, he filed a state habeas corpus application alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. Specifically, Gallegos alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present any forensic evidence at trial. Gallegos believed that forensic evidence would have shown that Lopez was shot while he lay on the ground and not while he was running as Ayala had testified. Gallegos also requested an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">The state habeas court did not hold an evidentiary hearing but did request two affidavits from Gallegos\u2019s trial counsel, Anthony Calisi (Calisi). The affidavits stated that: (1) Calisi\u2019s decisions \u201cwere well thought out and appropriately implemented\u201d; (2) Gallegos was provided with \u201ceffective assistance of counsel\u201d; (3) he hired a \u201cforensic scientist\u201d; (4) he obtained Lopez\u2019s clothing for the forensic scientist to study; and (5) he \u201cvisit[ed] with the Medical Examiner at her office.\u201d Calisi also stated that he ultimately presented only those witnesses he believed to be credible:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\u201cIn that regard, it was quite difficult to present witnesses for the defense.... \u201d The state habeas court also considered the affidavit of Raul Guajardo (Guajardo), submitted by Gallegos. Guajardo, a forensic scientist, stated his belief that the evidence, which he had examined after the trial at Gallegos\u2019s request, showed that Lopez was struck while he was either \u201cfalling and close to the ground\u201d or was \u201cin a prone position and on the ground.\u201d This conclusion contradicted Ayala\u2019s eye-witness testimony that Lopez was running when the fatal shot was fired. The state habeas court found Calisi\u2019s affidavits to be \u201ctrue, correct, and dispositive\u201d of Gallegos\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims, and thus recommended denial of Gallegos\u2019s habeas application. On October 20, 2004, the State Court of Criminal Appeals denied his habeas application without a written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">On January 5, 2005, Gallegos filed a \u00a7 2254 petition with the federal district court, raising the same issues as he did in his state habeas claim and again requesting an evidentiary hearing. The magistrate judge issued its \u201cfindings, conclusions and recommendations,\u201d concluding that the state court\u2019s decision was not an unreasonable application of federal law, nor was it based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2). The magistrate judge also concluded that Calisi\u2019s affidavits implied that a forensic scientist had been hired but was not called as a witness because his testimony ultimately would not have aided Gallegos\u2019s defense at trial. On June 21, 2007, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and denied Gallegos\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application. Gallegos timely filed a notice of appeal and request for a Certificate of Appealability (COA), which was denied by the district court. The Fifth Circuit granted Gallegos a COA on the issue of whether his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain and present forensic evidence. <em>Gallegos v. Quarterman, </em>No. 05-10885, slip op. at 2 (5th Cir. Aug.10, 2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">On appeal, Gallegos contends that Ayala was the star witness against him at trial, and that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to present forensic evidence to rebut Ayala\u2019s testimony prejudiced him. Gallegos also asserts that the state habeas court relied on Calisi\u2019s \u201cvague\u201d affidavits rather than conduct an evidentiary hearing, which resulted in a decision that was an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented. Finally, Gallegos asserts that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing in the district court because the state habeas court improperly denied his request for a hearing, which would have allowed him to develop the factual basis of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AE6\">A. Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Gallegos filed his habeas petition in district court on January 5, 2005, after the effective date of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). We therefore review his appeal pursuant to AEDPA.- <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253; <em>Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 336, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997). AEDPA provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus ... shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim ... resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Federal habeas relief is only available when the state court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>decision was incorrect and objectively unreasonable. <em>Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 5, 124 S.Ct. 1, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2008). Further, state court findings of fact are presumed correct unless the defendant rebuts this presumption with clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">B. Denial of evidentiary hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Before we address whether Gallegos received ineffective assistance of counsel, we consider Gallegos\u2019s assertion that the district court erred by not holding an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a request to hold an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>Clark v. Johnson, </em>202 F.3d 760, 765 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">A petitioner must develop the factual basis of his claim in state court to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing in federal court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2). However, a petitioner who has not developed the factual basis of his claim may still be granted an evidentiary hearing if one of the two conditions set forth in \u00a7 2254(e)(2) is met.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(e)(2)(A),(B). \u201c \u2018Under the opening clause of \u00a7 2254(e)(2), a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless there is a lack of diligence, or some greater fault, attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner\u2019s counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dowthitt v. Johnson, </em>230 F.3d 733, 758 (5th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 420, 432, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Assuming without deciding that Gallegos\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing is not barred by the preclusive effect of \u00a7 2254(e)(2), we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Gallegos an evidentiary hearing. \u201c[Ojvercoming the preclusive effect of \u00a7 2254(e)(2) does not <em>guarantee </em>an evidentiary hearing, it only opens the door for one.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>202 F.3d at 765. The district court still has the discretion to grant or deny an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>There is no requirement for a federal habeas court to conduct a hearing with live testimony. <em>McDonald v. Johnson, </em>139 F.3d 1056, 1060 (5th Cir.1998). When \u201c[t]he district court ha[s] sufficient facts before it to make an informed decision on the merits of [the habeas petitioner\u2019s] claim\u201d it does not abuse its discretion in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing, even where no factual findings are explicitly made by any state court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">Furthermore, the lack of an evidentiary hearing in state court does not effect the presumption that the state court findings of fact are correct. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>see also Valdez v. Cockrell, </em>274 F.3d 941, 950-51 (5th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 883, 123 S.Ct. 106, 154 L.Ed.2d 141 (2002). In contrast to the pre-AEDPA law, deference to a state habeas court\u2019s factual determinations is not dependent upon the quality of the state court\u2019s evidentiary hearing. <em>Valdez, </em>274 F.3d at 950. \u201c[A] full and fair hearing is not a precondition to according \u00a7 2254(e)(l)\u2019s presumption of correctness to state habeas court findings of fact nor to applying \u00a7 2254(d)\u2019s standards of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Gallegos argues that an evidentiary hearing would have allowed him to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>evidence to establish his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. However, when requesting an evidentiary hearing, Gallegos offered only Guajardo\u2019s affidavit for support. Guajardo\u2019s affidavit essentially calls into question Gallegos\u2019s liability for the shooting; it does not raise an issue as to whether \u2022 Calisi provided ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. Thus, Gallegos\u2019s primary argument for ineffective assistance of counsel is that Calisi either lied in his affidavits or that the affidavits lacked enough specificity for Gallegos to determine whether Calisi developed an effective forensic defense strategy. Gallegos has not presented any evidence to support his claim, relying instead on unsubstantiated attacks on Calisi\u2019s affidavits. The state habeas court found that Calisi\u2019s affidavits were correct and dispositive of Gallegos\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Calisi\u2019s affidavits make clear that he hired a forensic scientist, obtained evidence for the forensic scientist to examine, and discussed Gallegos\u2019s case with the Medical Examiner. Both the state habeas court and the federal district court determined that a hearing was unnecessary and a decision could be rendered based on the affidavits before the court. We find no error with the federal district court\u2019s decision. Gallegos has failed to marshal clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of correctness afforded the state court\u2019s findings of fact. The district court did not improperly rely on the state habeas court\u2019s factual findings or improperly infer from the affidavits that the expert was not called at trial because his testimony would not have aided Gallegos. When a state court\u2019s rulings are vague, its implied factual findings and legal rulings are still entitled to deference. <em>See, e.g., Young v. Dretke, </em>356 F.3d 616, 629 (5th Cir.2004) (implicit factual findings are entitled to deference); <em>Santellan v. Cockrell, </em>271 F.3d 190, 193-94 (5th Cir.2001) (ultimate ruling of state court entitled to deference even if no explanation for ruling is given). Because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by not holding an evidentiary hearing, we turn to Gallegos\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">C. Ineffective assistance of counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and issues of law <em>de novo </em>when reviewing the denial of habeas relief. <em>Moody v. Johnson, </em>139 F.3d 477, 480 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">To establish his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, Gallegos must show (1) that his counsel was deficient and (2) that the deficiency prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The court applies an objective standard of reasonableness, as measured by professional norms, to determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>Id. </em>To prove deficiency, Gallegos must show that his trial counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed him by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>Our scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance is \u201chighly deferential\u201d and there is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that any alleged deficiency \u201cfalls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To demonstrate prejudice, Gallegos \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A failure to establish either deficiency or prejudice defeats the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Calisi\u2019s affidavit states that he hired a forensic expert and obtained evidence for the expert to analyze, indicating that he did some forensic investigation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Gallegos\u2019s case. Gallegos has not overcome the presumption we afford Calisi\u2019s trial strategy and decision not to call the forensic expert to the stand at trial. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. Cain, </em>125 F.3d 269, 278-79 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201c[F]ailure to present ... evidence would not constitute \u2018deficient\u2019 performance within the meaning of <em>Strickland </em>if [counsel] could have concluded, for tactical reasons, that attempting to present such evidence would be unwise.\u201d). Gallegos failed to establish that his trial counsel was deficient in his representation at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Furthermore, Gallegos has failed to show a reasonable probability that but for his trial counsel\u2019s failure to call a forensic expert he would have been found not guilty of fatally shooting Lopez. Although Guajardo\u2019s affidavit calls into question the path of the bullet in relation to the position of Lopez\u2019s body when he was shot, testimony from the Medical Examiner at trial indicated that the path of a bullet could be influenced by a number of factors, including the victim\u2019s body movement, the shooter\u2019s movement, and whether the bullet struck a bone or an organ. Gallegos also admitted to shooting in Lopez\u2019s direction, was found with a pistol in his brother\u2019s truck, and tested positive for firing a gun the night of the shooting. Finally, there was eye-witness testimony from Ayala who saw the second shot being fired and moments later saw Lopez lying in the street as Gallegos walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Because Gallegos has failed to establish his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
