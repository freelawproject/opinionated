She appeals both her sentence and the district court\u2019s accompanying forfeiture order. After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Espinosa\u2019s sentence and the district court\u2019s forfeiture order.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-16\">Sometime in January 2005, the FBI began investigating a drug conspiracy headed by Carlos Gomez, also known as Abel Aranda-Salgado (\u201cGomez\u201d). For six months, the FBI monitored a telephone used by Gomez, and in several calls Espinosa and Gomez discussed distribution of multiple kilograms of cocaine. In December 2005, the FBI witnessed Espinosa deliver approximately three kilograms of cocaine to Edwin Parker. The FBI subsequently arrested Espinosa.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-17\">After her arrest, Espinosa admitted to a relationship with Gomez and admitted that she learned about Gomez\u2019s drug-related activities in 2004. Espinosa further admitted that, after a burglary at Gomez\u2019s apartment, she obtained two safe deposit boxes in which to store Gomez\u2019s drug proceeds. She acted as courier\u2014storing and retrieving drug proceeds from the safe deposit boxes at Gomez\u2019s request\u2014but also kept her own money in the safe deposit boxes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She also admitted that, in addition to the transaction the FBI witnessed, she had picked up drug proceeds from Parker on numerous other occasions. At sentencing, over Espinosa\u2019s objection, the district court admitted testimonial statements from a co-defendant detailing four other drug transactions, involving a total of 30 to 40 kilograms of cocaine, in which Espinosa participated. After her arrest, the agents seized approximately $120,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>from the safe deposit boxes, $25,000 of which Espinosa claimed was her own, earned by making small loans in her community and by \u201cslow dancing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Based on the above facts, Espinosa pleaded guilty to participating in Gomez\u2019s drug conspiracy. The PSI concluded that Espinosa\u2019s relevant conduct included the conspiracy\u2019s full amount of cocaine\u2014more than the Guidelines maximum of 150 kilograms.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, her base offense level was 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2005). Espinosa qualified for a two-level safety valve reduction, U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(7) &amp; 5C1.2 (2005), and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 (2005). Given her criminal history category of I, and the total offense level 33, the PSI calculated a Guidelines range of 135 to 168 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Espinosa challenged two aspects to the PSI Guidelines calculation. First, she argued that she was only responsible for five to fifteen kilograms of cocaine,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> so her base offense level should have been much lower. Second, she urged the court to grant her a two to four level minor/minimal role adjustment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 (2005). The district court rejected her first argument, finding that though \u201cthe specific connection of [Espinosa] to actual discrete instances may not rise to the level of 150 [kilograms], her participation in an enterprise that did involve that level of drugs was known to her.\u201d R. Vol. 8, DE 290 at 171. The court agreed with her second argument, however, reasoning that \u201chaving held her accountable for all of the activities of the conspiracy, I should gauge her conduct and her role in looking at the conspiracy as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171-72. The court therefore granted Espinosa a two-level adjustment for her minor role in the conspiracy, and the incident four-level reduction in base-offense level. <em>Id. </em>at 172; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3B1.2(b) &amp; 2Dl.l(a)(3) (2005). With a total offense level of 27 and a criminal history category of I, Espinosa\u2019s Guidelines range was 70 to 87 months imprisonment. The district court, considering the admitted facts, the Guidelines, and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), sentenced Espinosa to 87 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Espinosa raises five issues on appeal: (1) whether the district court erred in finding her accountable for more than 150 kilograms of cocaine; (2) whether the district court violated her Sixth Amendment rights by sentencing her based on more than 150 kilograms of cocaine when the facts were found by a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) whether the district court violated her Sixth Amendment rights, or evidentiary rules applicable at sentencing, when it admitted the out-of-court statements of her codefendant; (4) whether the 87-month prison sentence was unreasonable; and (5) whether the forfeiture order was supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual determination of the drug quantity for which Espinosa is accounta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ble. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">We review de novo Espinosa\u2019s Sixth Amendment challenges\u2014one to the standard for fact-finding in the <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>federal sentencing scheme, and one based on the admission of testimonial hearsay during sentencing. <em>United States v. Yates, </em>438 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">We review a criminal sentence for a procedural or substantive abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">When a district court orders a criminal forfeiture, we review its findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>201 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">\n<em>A. Drug Quantity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">Espinosa argues that the district court clearly erred when it concluded that her relevant conduct included the full amount of drugs in Gomez\u2019s conspiracy. The Guidelines define \u201cRelevant Conduct\u201d for sentencing purposes to include \u201cin the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity ..., all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">The Application Notes clarify that, in the case of contraband, the conspirator\u2019s relevant conduct includes amounts directly attributable to the conspirator and \u201call reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that [the conspirator] jointly undertook.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 2. The \u201cscope of the criminal activity that [the conspirator] jointly undertook,\u201d however, is not the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy; rather, the jointly undertaken criminal activity is limited to \u201cthe scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant\u2019s agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, \u201cthe criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, and the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that criminal activity, are not necessarily identical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For this reason, we have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2P\">to determine a defendant\u2019s liability for the acts of others, the district court must first make individualized findings concerning the scope of criminal activity undertaken by a particular defendant. Once the extent of a defendant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy is established, the court can determine the drug quantities reasonably foreseeable in connection with that level of participation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-15\"><em>United States v. Ismond, </em>993 F.2d 1498, 1499 (11th Cir.1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">The judge overruled Espinosa\u2019s relevant-conduct objection because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9o\">[Though] the specific connection of the defendant to actual discrete instances may not rise to the level of 150 [kilograms], her participation in an enterprise that did involve that level of drugs was known to her. She was aware enough of what was going on, of the money that was moving through the organization. She continued to derive benefits from that and to facilitate that such that she was connected sufficiently to the conspiracy and its activities, that she is accountable for the entirety of the conspiracy and its activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">R. Vol. 3, DE 290 at 171. In other words, the district court found that her multiple individual acts in support of the conspiracy were sufficient to find that she agreed to the conspiracy in its entirety. Espinosa challenges that finding as clear error be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>cause she claims she participated in the conspiracy on a favor-by-favor basis, agreeing only to the specific favors, so she only jointly undertook the specific acts and objectives of each favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">We have held that \u201cthe Guidelines establish that the fact that the defendant knows about the larger operation, and has agreed to perform a particular act, does not amount to acquiescence in the acts of the criminal enterprise as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>323 F.3d 1314, 1320 (11th Cir.2003). The Guidelines provide a concrete illustration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">Defendant 0 knows about her boyfriend\u2019s ongoing drug-trafficking activity, but agrees to participate on only one occasion by making a delivery for him at his request when he was ill. Defendant 0 is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the drug quantity involved on that one occasion. Defendant 0 is not accountable for the other drug sales made by her boyfriend because those sales were not in furtherance of her jointly undertaken criminal activity <em>(ie., </em>the one delivery).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, illus. (c)(5) (2005). The question here is whether it is clear error for the district court to find, where Defendant 0 performs more than 38 individual favors for her boyfriend,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that she agreed to join the boyfriend\u2019s entire operation. We hold that such a finding is not clear error. At some point, where a defendant knows the scope of a large operation and agrees to multiple acts assisting that operation, the discrete acts can be aggregated to constitute assent to jointly undertake the operation as a whole. In essence, at some point the defendant ceases to be performing favors for her boyfriend, and is instead performing tasks for the conspiracy. Therefore, though the conclusion was not compelled by the record, it was not clear error for the district court to find that Espinosa agreed to jointly undertake Gomez\u2019s entire conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">\n<em>B. Fact-finding Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">Espinosa argues that the district court\u2019s fact-finding at sentencing, based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, violated her Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Espinosa concedes that the argument is foreclosed by binding circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1281 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cBecause the court understood it was operating under an advisory [Guidelines] scheme, its fact-finding did not implicate the Sixth Amendment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">\n<em>C. Hearsay Declarations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">Espinosa argues that the district court violated her Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against her by admitting her codefendant\u2019s testimonial statement at her sentencing hearing. This argument is also foreclosed by binding circuit precedent. <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1146 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1281 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cBecause the court understood it was operating under an advisory [Guidelines] scheme, its fact-finding did not implicate the Sixth Amendment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">In the alternative, Espinosa argues that the district court erroneously admitted her codefendant\u2019s testimonial statements despite a lack of sufficient indicia of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>reliability to support its probable accuracy. We need not address the issue because, even if the district court erred by admitting the statement into evidence, the error was harmless. As detailed above, the district court attributed more than 150 kilograms of cocaine, the Guidelines maximum, to Espinosa because it found that she agreed to jointly undertake Gomez\u2019s entire conspiracy, and because she knew the conspiracy involved a massive amount of cocaine\u2014100 to 200 kilograms per month. That conclusion rests on grounds entirely separate from her codefendant\u2019s statement, which implicated her in four drug transactions totaling 30 to 40 kilograms. In short, the district court\u2019s findings, unrelated to the codefendant\u2019s statement, require that she be held to the maximum Guidelines range, so any error in admitting the statement was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">\n<em>D. Sentence Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Espinosa attacks her sentence as substantively unreasonable and as the product of procedural error. First, we reject Espinosa\u2019s procedural argument. The Supreme Court summarized the proper sentencing procedure as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-7\">As we explained in Rita <em>[v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) ], a district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range. As a matter of administration and to secure nationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark. The Guidelines are not the only consideration, however. Accordingly, after giving both parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate, the district judge should then consider all of the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party. In so doing, he may not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable. He must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-11\"><em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The sentencing transcript demonstrates that the district court followed this procedure precisely. R. Vol. 8, DE 290. The court calculated the applicable Guidelines range, <em>id. </em>at 171-73, heard Espinosa\u2019s argument in favor of a lenient sentence, <em>id. </em>at 158-170, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>id. </em>at 173-75, afforded the Guidelines no presumption of reasonableness, <em>id. </em>at 174-75 (\u201cI have considered both the Sentencing Guidelines and the [\u00a7 ]3553 factors in arriving at this sentence and believe that this is a reasonable sentence under all the circumstances.\u201d), and explained the sentence, <em>id. </em>at 173-75. The law requires nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">Likewise, an 87-month prison sentence for substantial involvement in a massive drug conspiracy is not substantively unreasonable. A district court, taking account of the totality of the circumstances in an individual defendant\u2019s case, has broad discretion to craft \u201ca sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), to satisfy the purposes of criminal punishment set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Espinosa\u2019s 87-month prison sentence is well within that discretionary range.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">\n<em>E. Forfeiture Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">Finally, Espinosa argues that the district court failed to make adequate findings to support its order that the $25,000 recovered from a safe deposit box, and claimed by her, be forfeited. She maintains that there was insufficient evidence to establish that she obtained this money during the period of the conspiracy, or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>there was no other source aside from Gomez\u2019s drug-related business fi'om which this money could have been derived, and therefore, the presumption under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(d) was not triggered. Further, she argues, even if the presumption did arise, it was rebutted by her post-arrest statements, as well as the findings in the presentence report, and the wire recordings, which corroborated that she obtained funds independently of Gomez.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">We review the legality of a forfeiture order <em>de novo </em>and the court\u2019s factual findings for the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264, 1275 (11th Cir.2003). Section \u00a7 853(a)(1) subjects to forfeiture \u201cany property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of [a narcotics] violation.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(a)(1). Because forfeiture is part of sentencing and not an element of the offense, the elements of criminal forfeiture under section 853(a)(1), must be proven only by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Elgersma, </em>971 F.2d 690, 697 (11th Cir.1992). Section 853(d) creates a rebut-table presumption that any property of a person convicted of a narcotics violation is subject to forfeiture if the government establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that such property was acquired during the period of a narcotics violation, or within a reasonable time after such period, and there was no likely souree for such property other than that violation. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Testimony at sentencing, which established that Espinosa was not engaged in any employment during the pendency of the investigation, was sufficient to trigger the presumption under \u00a7 853(d). Because Espinosa failed to rebut that presumption, the district court\u2019s finding that the $25,000 was subject to forfeiture was based on sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Espinosa\u2019s sentence and the district court\u2019s forfeiture order.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-11\">. The Court derives the facts from the uncontested portion of the plea colloquy, R. Vol. 4, DE 286 at 6-9, and the admitted facts in the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b895-18\">. The PSI notes that Espinosa accessed one safe deposit box 28 times and the other 11 times, but only identifies three instances where a trip to a safe deposit box correlates with a phone call from Gomez directing her to deposit or withdraw funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b896-6\">. She did not contest that one member of the Gomez conspiracy alone, <em>viz. </em>her sister \u201cReyna,\u201d trafficked more than 150 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b896-7\">. Espinosa apparently bases this figure on the amount of cocaine the cash deposited in the safe deposit boxes would have purchased\u2014 approximately six kilograms. R. Vol. 8, DE 290 at 162; <em>see also United States v. Tokars, </em>95 F.3d 1520, 1542 (11th Cir.1996) (holding \u201cthat money attributable to ... drug transactions may be converted to the equivalent amount of drugs for purposes of determining the drug quantity\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b897-13\">. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b898-7\">. We note that if each favor was simply another drug delivery, Defendant O would be equivalent to a \u201cstreet-level drug dealer\u201d or a middle-man as discussed in \u00a7 IB 1.3, illustrations (c)(6) and (c)(7). In such situations, it would be clear error to include the entire conspiracy's drug quantity in Defendant O's relevant conduct. Here, however, Espinosa not only made at least one drug delivery, she also handled money for the operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
