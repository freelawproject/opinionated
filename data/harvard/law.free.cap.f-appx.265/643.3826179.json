INS, </em>213 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>F.3d 1192, 1197 (9th Cir.2000). This court reviews questions of law de novo, <em>see Kankamalage v. INS, </em>335 F.3d 858, 861-62 (9th Cir.2003), and reviews factual findings for substantial evidence, <em>see Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). Under the substantial evidence standard, this court reverses the IJ\u2019s factual determinations only if \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioners are not entitled to withholding of removal. This court does not reach the question of whether the disfavored group analysis, which was formulated in <em>Kotasz v. INS, </em>31 F.3d 847, 852-55 (9th Cir.1994), and applied to ethnic Chinese in Indonesia seeking asylum in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 925-29 (9th Cir.2004), applies to withholding of removal claims because, even if petitioners were permitted to make a lesser showing of individualized risk under the disfavored group analysis, the record does not compel the conclusion that they will \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be persecuted on account of race or religion upon return to Indonesia. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Petitioners are not eligible for relief under the CAT because they have not demonstrated that they will \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be tortured upon return to Indonesia. <em>Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1221 (9th Cir.2005); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">For the reasons stated, the petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ApQ\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
