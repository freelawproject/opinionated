To the extent we have jurisdiction it is pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider. <em>See Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005). We grant in part and dismiss in part the petition for review, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-20\">An intervening change in the law requires us to remand on the issue of continuous physical presence. In <em>Ibarra-Flores v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 614, 618 (9th Cir.2006), we held that administrative voluntary departure under threat of deportation breaks the accrual of continuous physical presence only where the alien is informed of the terms of the departure and knowingly and voluntarily accepts the terms of departure. <em>See id. </em>at 619. In the record, there is no documentation showing that Cruz Casa was informed of the terms of his departure or that he accepted them voluntarily or knowingly, and the agency did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Ibarra-Flores </em>at the time it addressed this issue. Accordingly, we grant the petition for review in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with <em>Ibarra-Flores.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-21\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s October 17, 2005 orders summarily affirming an Immigration Judge\u2019s decision denying petitioners\u2019 cancellation applications because they failed to timely petition this court for review of that decision. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-22\">Petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED in part; DISMISSED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b542-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
