Videla denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Bao Chen, </em>No. A97 327 579 (B.I.A. Feb. 21, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 327 579 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 9, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">A petitioner\u2019s attorney must \u201cinclude his most cogent arguments in his opening brief, upon pain of otherwise finding them waived.\u201d <em>McCarthy v. SEC, </em>406 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir.2005). Here, Chen failed to address the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in his brief to this Court. Although he offered conclusory assertions that his testimony was \u201ccredible and detailed,\u201d he did not point to any errors in the IJ\u2019s findings; indeed, he did not even acknowledge in the argument section of his brief that the IJ made an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">Where the petitioner has been represented by counsel throughout these proceedings, \u201cit is not our obligation to ferret out [his] arguments. That, after all, is the purpose of briefing.\u201d <em>McCarthy, </em>406 F.3d at 186. Accordingly, because we do not find that manifest injustice would result if we decline to reach the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we deem waived any challenge thereto. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Thus, because the finding stands as a valid basis for the agency\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">In light of the waiver of any challenge to the dispositive basis for the denial of relief, we must note that the Petitioner\u2019s brief is seriously deficient. To \u201cargue\u201d that an asylum applicant is eligible for relief without addressing an adverse credibility determination violates Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9), which requires an appellant\u2019s brief to address all issues and explain the reasons for its contentions. Counsel is warned that future failure to comply with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure may result in discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
