Cantu argues that the district court erred in increasing his base offense level by four levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-19\">When Cantu was sentenced, \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) provided for a four-level increase if the defendant \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense----\u201d Relying on <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>166 F.3d 748 (5th Cir.1999), Cantu asserts that the cocaine at issue in the enhancement and the firearms found in the car with the narcotics lacked a sufficiently close relationship to support a 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement. <em>Mitchell </em>is inapposite. <em>Mitchell </em>involved the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l), which applies when \u201cthe defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with the <em>commission or attempted commission </em>of another offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(e)(l) (emphasis added). We held the Government to a higher burden in <em>Mitchell </em>because of this additional language. <em>See </em>166 F.3d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-22\">Because the firearms were located directly behind Cantu\u2019s seat in the car with the illegal narcotics, they were \u201creadily available\u201d to Cantu and \u201cwere possessed and could have been used to facilitate\u201d his drug-related activities. <em>See United States v. </em>Armstead, 114 F.3d 504, 512 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1200 (5th Cir.1994). The firearms thus were possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d Cantu\u2019s drug possession within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-23\">Cantu additionally contends that this court should reconsider its jurisprudence regarding the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>\u00a7 922(g)(1) in light of <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000). Cantu\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
