The IJ found Talwar was not credible and denied Talwar\u2019s application for asylum, for withholding of removal, and for relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">We review the BIA\u2019s affirmance for substantial evidence. <em>Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 884 (9th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s affirmance must be upheld if it is supported by \u201creasonable, substantial and probative evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, which was adopted by the BIA, is supported by substantial evidence and deny Talwar\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">To determine whether an adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence, we consider whether the IJ had a legitimate articulable basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility and whether the IJ offered a specific and cogent reason for the adverse credibility finding. <em>Id.; Osorio v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 928, 931 (9th Cir.1996). If inconsistent statements are the basis for an adverse credibility finding, these inconsistent statements must go to the heart of the asylum claim. <em>Kaur, </em>379 F.3d at 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">In this case, the IJ stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-16\">On cross-examination, the Service counsel challenged the respondent\u2019s testimony in several aspects, particularly whether the respondent\u2019s parents were baptized Sikhs or whether they were devout. The respondent\u2019s testimony was that his parents are Keshdhari Sikhs and that his parents are not baptized. However, in the declaration, it states, and I quote: \u201cI used to visit the Sikh gurdwara functions along with my mother who is a baptized Sikh woman, and practiced strict Sikh codes and customs.\u201d There is a discrepancy or inconsistency in the testimony and the declaration. The respondent later went on to state that he could not remember whether his mother was baptized or not. The Court finds this to be extremely unusual for someone to be so closely related to another family member and not know whether they are practicing their religion or whether they were even baptized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-17\">The respondent was also asked on cross-examination as to whether or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>he had observed his father being politically active with other political party workers. The respondent testified that he did not see his father working with others, but in the declaration, he states that, \u201cI saw my father busy with other workers of his party.\u201d The respondent was also questioned as to whether or not the organization which he was a member of (All-India Sikh Students Federation) supported other candidates for political office. The respondent testified that prior to 2001 that he was unaware that the AISSF supported political candidates; however, later, the respondent testified that, well, they supported Simranjit Singh Mann. This testimony by the respondent shows that he was not even politically active or maybe not even a Sikh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">Furthermore, the documentation in Exhibit 4 shows the respondent\u2019s ID card from the AISSF and the driver\u2019s license, but counsel for the Department of Homeland Security is correct. The signature of the respondent in the driver\u2019s license and that on the asylum application is clearly not the same. The Court finds that for the reasons stated above regarding the inconsistencies in the respondent\u2019s testimony and the declaration in the documentation at Exhibit 4 that the respondent is not credible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANm\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s lack of credibility finding and that the discrepancies go to the heart of Talwar\u2019s claims and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b531-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
