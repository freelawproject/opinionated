As Reyna concedes, this argument is foreclosed under <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Reyna further contends that the district court did not give sufficient reasons when denying his request for a variance from the guideline range and that his sentence is unreasonable under the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court gave sufficient reasons for sentencing Reyna within the guideline range. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469. Additionally, Reyna\u2019s sentence within the guideline range was presumptively reasonable, and Reyna has not shown that \u201cthe sentence ... constitute[s] a clear error in the court\u2019s exercise of its broad sentencing discretion\u201d as to whether the sentence \u201c(1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor; or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Reyna challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 28, 2007)(No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
