Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3927 renders an alien removable as an aggravated felon under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). We find that it does and will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Petitioner Martina Margot Cummings, a 44 year-old native and citizen of Germany, entered the United States in November 1982 as a parolee and was admitted as a lawful permanent resident in August 1983. She has lived and worked in the United States since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">On November 3, 2005, Cummings pleaded guilty to one count of access device fraud in violation of 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 4106 and one count of theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received in violation of 18 Pa Cons.Stat. \u00a7 3927. Contemporaneous with her plea, she was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment of four to twelve months and one to twelve months, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The Department of Homeland Security subsequently served Cummings with a notice to appear, charging her with removal pursuant to both 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) (alien convicted of two or more crimes of moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (alien convicted of an aggravated felony). The notice to appear indicated that Cummings was removable as an aggravated felon because she had been convicted of \u201ca theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment of at least 1 year was imposed.\u201d (App. at 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Cummings filed a motion to terminate the proceedings arguing that her convictions were neither \u201ctheft offenses\u201d nor \u201ccrimes of moral turpitude,\u201d but the IJ denied the motion and ordered her removed. Specifically, the IJ found that Cummings was deportable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony because her conviction of theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received in violation of 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 3927 constituted a \u201ctheft offense\u201d pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). As this finding rendered Cummings automatically deportable and ineligible for cancellation of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3), the IJ expressly declined to decide whether her conviction for access device fraud in violation of 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 4106 was also a theft offense and whether she had been convicted of two or more crimes of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on October 30, 2006, holding that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3927 \u201cfits neatly within the Third Circuit\u2019s decision of a \u2018theft offense.\u2019 \u201d (App. at 11.) The BIA stated that \u201c[w]hile it might be better practice to rule upon all chai\u2019ges of removability, because the aggravated felony was dispositive here, the Immigration Judge did not need to determine whether the other charges were sustainable.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>This timely petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">While 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) prohibits judicial review of final orders of removal issued against aliens convicted of aggravated felonies, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) clarifies that we have jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law. Cummings acknowledges this limitation and asks us to review only the purely legal question of whether 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u00a7 3927 is a \u201ctheft offense\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). We exercise <em>de novo </em>review of the BIA\u2019s legal decisions. <em>Kamara v. Attorney General, </em>420 F.3d 202, 211 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) provides that \u201c[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d The definition of the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes \u201ca theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). The only issue before us is whether theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received in violation of 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. 3927 constitutes a \u201ctheft offense\u201d pursuant to Section 1101(a)(43)(G).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In order to determine whether an individual has committed a \u201ctheft offense,\u201d we apply the formal categorical approach to the state law at issue \u201cto see if it encompasses acts beyond those subject to prosecution under the federal [theft offense] definition^] as contemplated by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G).\u201d <em>Nugent v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 162, 170 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Drakes v. Zimski, </em>240 F.3d 246, 249 (3d Cir.2001)). \u201cUnder that approach, [we] \u2018must look only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,\u2019 and may not consider \u2018other evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s prior crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 144,147-48 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)). Only when \u201cwe are unable to determine from the face of the statute whether [the petitioner\u2019s] conviction is among those that qualify as an aggravated felony ... [are we permitted to] take the additional step of examining the underlying facts to determine whether [the petitioner] pled guilty to\u201d an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>at 160 (citing <em>Valansi v. Ashcroft, </em>278 F.3d 203, 214 (3d Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">In <em>Nugent, </em>we reasoned that by using the term \u201ctheft offense,\u201d rather than simply \u201ctheft,\u201d \u201c\u2018Congress signaled that it was not presenting an exhaustive list of offenses (i.e. just theft and receipt); rather, with its word choices, Congress indicated that the phrase ought to be given a broad read.\u2019 \u201d 367 F.3d at 173-74 (quoting <em>Hernandez-Mancilla v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1002, 1008 (7th Cir.2001)). We adopted the Seventh Circuit\u2019s definition of \u201ctheft offense\u201d as \u201ca taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent,\u201d and held that Pennsylvania\u2019s theft by deception statute is a \u201ctheft offense\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) because it did not punish behavior that fell outside of the federal definition of the term. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hernandez-Mancilla, </em>246 F.3d at 1009); <em>see also United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1205 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (also adopting the Seventh Circuit\u2019s definition of \u201ctheft offense\u201d), superseded on other grounds by statute as explained in <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>Gomez-Mendez, </em>486 F.3d 599, 604-05 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The statute at issue in this case, entitled \u201ctheft by failure to make required disposition of funds received,\u201d states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">A person who obtains property upon agreement, or subject to a known legal obligation, to make specified payments or other disposition, whether from such property or its proceeds or from his own property to be reserved in equivalent amount, is guilty of theft if he intentionally deals with the property obtained as his own and fails to make the required payment or disposition....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">18 Pa Cons.Stat. \u00a7 3927. It is well settled that there are four elements of the crime at issue: \u201c1) the obtaining of the property of another; 2) subject to an agreement or known legal obligation upon the receipt to make specified payments or other disposition thereof; 3) intentional dealing with the property obtained as the defendant\u2019s own; and 4) failure of the defendant to make the required disposition of the property.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Morrissey, </em>540 Pa. 1, 8, 654 A.2d 1049, 1052 (Pa.1995) (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Turrell, </em>526 Pa. 42, 584 A.2d 882 (Pa.1990); <em>Commonwealth v. Van Nest, </em>517 Pa. 44, 534 A.2d 473 (Pa.1987); <em>Commonwealth v. Ohle, </em>503 Pa. 566, 470 A.2d 61 (Pa.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Pennsylvania\u2019s statute is copied nearly verbatim from a subsection within Article 223 (Theft and Related Offenses) of the Model Penal Code. <em>See </em>MPC \u00a7 223.8 (1980).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As explained in the commentary to the Code, the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">is designed to bring within the law of theft certain situations that traditionally have occasioned difficulty. The problem arises whenever the actor\u2019s behavior arguably constitutes merely a breach of contract rather than a misappropriation of property of another. Section 223.8 recognizes that in some situations one who promises to make certain payments or other disposition of property should be punished for dealing with the property as his own. At the same time, the section does not purport generally to substitute criminal prosecution for civil remedies under the law of contract. The challenge, therefore, is to distinguish default that should be assimilated to theft from non-performance that should be left to the traditional remedies for breach of contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">MPC \u00a7 223.8 cmt., at 255-56. The drafters stated that \u201c[t]he words \u2018deals with the property as his own\u2019 are designed to import the element commonly referred to by other statutes as conversion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">We agree that 18 Pa Cons.Stat. \u00a7 3927 \u201cfits neatly\u201d within our definition of the term \u201ctheft offense.\u201d The statute covers situations where property is voluntarily turned over to the defendant in a fiduciary capacity with the understanding that he or she will dispose of the property in a specific manner at a later point in time. Simply dealing with the funds as one\u2019s own is not sufficient for an individual to violate the statute; \u201c[i]t is only at the moment when the required payments are not made that criminal liability attaches.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Fritz, </em>323 Pa.Super. 488, 493-94, 470 A.2d 1364, 1366 (Pa.Super.Ct.1983). As the statute is violated only after the defendant has exceeded the terms of the owner\u2019s consent to hold the property, it falls within the latter half of our definition of theft offense as \u201can exercise of control over property without consent.\u201d <em>Nugent, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>367 F.3d at 174. We are not persuaded by Cummings\u2019 reading of Pennsylvania cases addressing the statute and find that, contrary to her assertion, the cited cases support our conclusion that it does not encompass any behavior that falls outside the federal definition of the term theft offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\">. We look to the term of imprisonment actually imposed to determine if the petitioner was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least one year. <em>United States v. Graham, </em>169 F.3d 787, 790-91 (3d Cir.1999). \"Under Pennsylvania law, the minimum term imposed on a prison sentence merely sets the date prior to which a prisoner may not be paroled,\" <em>Rogers v. Pa. Bd. of Probation &amp; Parole, </em>555 Pa. 285, 289 n. 2, 724 A.2d 319, 321 n. 2 (Pa. 1999), so the maximum range controls whether the term of imprisonment is at least one year. <em>Bovkun v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 166, 170-71 (3d Cir.2002). Because Cummings was sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment of twelve months on each count, she does not, and could not, argue that her term of imprisonment for her conviction under 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 3927 was not at least one year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-12\"><em>. </em>That the statute is included within the \"theft\u201d section of the Model Penal Code is not dispositive. <em>See Nugent, </em>367 F.3d at 174.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
