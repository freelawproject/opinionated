Mitchell brought suit against his insurance provider, defendant-appellee Ace American Insurance Company, after it denied Mitchell\u2019s application for disability benefits. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Ace American Insurance Company. Mitchell appeals the judgment with respect to his breach of contract cause of action. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-18\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b445-19\">On March 20, 2003, plaintiff-appellant Donald R. Mitchell, a professional football player, signed to play for the Dallas Cowboys (the \u201cCowboys\u201d), a member of the National Football League (the \u201cNFL\u201d), as a defensive back. In April 2003, he purchased a $1 million athlete\u2019s individual disability income policy (the \u201cpolicy\u201d) from defendant-appellee Ace American Insurance Company (\u201cAce\u201d), covering the period from April 21, 2003 to April 21, 2004. On August 28, 2003, Mitchell injured his left ankle during a pre-season game. The Cowboys\u2019 medical staff diagnosed the injury as acute posterior tibial tendinitis, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Mitchell did not play for the remainder of the 2003 football season due to the injury. On February 9, 2004, Mitchell was released from the Cowboys\u2019 rehabilitation program. At that time, the Cowboys\u2019 medical reports indicated that he was \u201crunning and working ... with no complaints or problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">On June 4, 2004, the Cowboys\u2019 team physician cleared Mitchell \u201cfor all practice activities,\u201d and Mitchell participated in full practices for the Cowboys\u2019 \u201cmini-camp\u201d from June 5, 2004 through June 11, 2004. According to Mitchell, he missed at least two days of mini-camp and was unable to fully participate in all camp activities because he experienced pain and swelling in his left ankle. On July 30, 2004, at the start of the Cowboys\u2019 \u201ctraining camp,\u201d Mitchell signed an Acknowledgment of Receipt of Medical Information in which he attested that he was \u201cnot [at that time] suffering from any physical and/or mental disability\u201d that prevented him from playing professional football. Mitchell reports that after approximately three days of training camp, he again started to feel pain in his left ankle. Nevertheless, he continued to participate in the training camp and even played in the Cowboys\u2019 first three pre-season games. Mitchell maintains that the condition of his left ankle limited his movement, causing his performance to suffer during those pre-season games. However, the Cowboys\u2019 episode recap report indicates that Mitchell participated in each of those games with \u201cno limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">On August 31, 2004, following the third pre-season game, the Cowboys cut Mitchell from the roster. Upon his dismissal, Mitchell signed a medical waiver acknowledging that \u201che [was] not [at that time] suffering from any disability, physical or mental, incurred as a result of his service as a professional football player for the Club[, the Cowboys].\u201d The waiver further stated that, so far as Mitchell could determine, \u201che [was] not physically unable to play professional football for the Club as a result of any injury suffered during the period of employment with the Club.\u201d Mitchell claims, however, that after his release from the Cowboys, he consulted a foot and ankle specialist and learned that he could not continue as a professional football player because of the condition of his ankle.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">On September 22, 2004, Mitchell filed an application for disability benefits with Ace. Ace denied the claim by letter dated December 9, 2004. Mitchell then filed suit against Ace in state court on February 14, 2006, and the case was removed to federal district court on June 8, 2006. Ace filed a motion for partial summary judgment on Mitchell\u2019s causes of action for breach of contract and violations of the Texas Insurance Code, which the district court granted on January 26, 2007. Subsequently, Mitchell filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the remainder of his claims. On May 21, 2007, the court issued a final judgment dismissing all of Mitchell\u2019s claims. Mitchell timely filed his notice of appeal on June 18, 2007. Mitchell only appeals the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his breach of contract claim with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>Stotter v. Univ. of Texas at San Antonio, </em>508 F.3d 812, 820 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cA party is entitled to summary judgment only if \u2018the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). We view the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>in the light most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment motion and draw all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In diversity cases, such as this one, we look to the substantive law of the forum state. <em>Texas Indus., Inc. v. Factory Mut. Ins. Co., </em>486 F.3d 844, 846 (5th Cir.2007). Under Texas law, insurance policies are governed by the same rules of construction that apply to contracts generally. <em>Balandran v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>972 S.W.2d 738, 740-41 (Tex.1998). The primary goal is to give effect to the written expression of the parties\u2019 intent. <em>Id. </em>at 741. \u201cThe terms used in an insurance policy are to be given their ordinary and generally accepted meaning, unless the policy shows that the words were meant in a technical or different sense.\u201d <em>Canutillo Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., </em>99 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Sec. Mut. Cas. Co. v. Johnson, </em>584 S.W.2d 703, 704 (Tex.1979)). The policy should be considered as a whole so as to give effect and meaning to each part. <em>Id.; see Balandran, </em>972 S.W.2d at 741 (\u201cWe must read all parts of the contract together, ... striving to give meaning to every sentence, clause, and word to avoid rendering any portion inoperative.\u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u201cTexas contract interpretation law indicates that \u2018[i]f policy language is worded so that it can be given a definite or certain legal meaning, it is not ambiguous and we construe it as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Texas Indus., Inc., </em>486 F.3d at 846 (quoting <em>Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, </em>124 S.W.3d 154, 157 (Tex.2003)). Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to decide. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe fact that the parties offer different contract interpretations does not create an ambiguity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An ambiguity exists only if the contract language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. <em>Id.; Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. CBI Indus., Inc., </em>907 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex.1995). The court must adopt the insured\u2019s construction of an ambiguous provision, \u201cas long as that construction is not unreasonable, even if the construction urged by the insurer appears to be more reasonable or a more accurate reflection of the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Hudson Energy Co., </em>811 S.W.2d 552, 555 (Tex.1991); <em>see Balandran, </em>972 S.W.2d at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Pursuant to the policy, Mitchell must satisfy five conditions precedent for coverage. Ace based its summary judgment motion on Mitchell\u2019s purported failure to meet the third condition\u2014that he did not \u201csatisfly] the Elimination Period as shown in the SCHEDULE.\u201d The SCHEDULE defines the Elimination Period as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">\n<em>Twelve (12) consecutive months.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">No covered claim shall exist and no benefit shall be due or payable under this Policy until the Insured has been Totally Disabled for this period and certified to be Permanently Totally Disabled at the end of the period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">The Definitions section of the policy further provides that the \u201cElimination Period\u201d means a \u201ccontinuous period of time ... during which the Insured must be Totally Disabled and for which no benefits are due or payable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Therefore, coverage depends on whether Mitchell was \u201cTotally Disabled\u201d for a consecutive twelve month period. The policy defines \u201cTotal Disablement, Totally Disabled or Total Disability\u201d as \u201cthe Insured\u2019s complete and total physical inability as a result of the Accidental Bodily Injury or Sickness or Disease to Participate, as defined in the Policy, in his or her Occupation as stated in the SCHEDULE.\u201d \u201cParticipate,\u201d in turn, means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-13\">1) in a team sport, that the Insured is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>a) on the active roster of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">(1) the professional sports team as stated in the SCHEDULE for which the Insured is contractually obligated to play; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">(2) the collegiate sports team as stated in the SCHEDULE for which the Insured plays; <em>and/or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">b) <em>dressed (in uniform) or available or physically able to practice or play for a team in the League as defined in the Policy.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">R. 165 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Ace argues that it did not breach the policy when it declined to pay Mitchell\u2019s claim because Mitchell was not \u201cTotally Disabled\u201d for twelve consecutive months after sustaining his ankle injury since he \u201cparticipated\u201d in professional football during that time. As evidence of Mitchell\u2019s \u201cparticipation,\u201d Ace points to Mitchell\u2019s involvement in the Cowboys\u2019 mini and training camps in the summer of 2004 and the three pre-season games that Mitchell played in August 2004, prior to the start of the 2004 season. The district court agreed with Ace and determined that Mitchell failed to satisfy the policy\u2019s Elimination Period because \u201cMitchell was necessarily in uniform and was not only available and physically able to practice and play for an NFL team, but he actually did practice and play for an NFL team within a year of injuring his left ankle.\u201d Since Mitchell had failed to meet an essential condition of coverage, the district court concluded that \u201cAce did not breach the policy in denying Mitchell\u2019s claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">Mitchell first contends that the district court erred because Ace\u2019s use of the conjunctive-disjunctive phrase \u201cand/or\u201d in the definition of \u201cparticipate\u201d created a patent ambiguity in the policy. Mitchell, however, did not present this argument in his response to Ace\u2019s motion for summary judgment, even though Ace had clearly relied on the disjunctive, \u201cor,\u201d to maintain that Mitchell had \u201cparticipated\u201d and thus had failed to satisfy one of the conditions precedent for coverage under the policy. Instead, Mitchell claimed that ambiguity was caused by the use of the undefined term \u201cactive roster\u201d in the \u201cparticipate\u201d definition. \u201cAlthough on summary judgment the record is reviewed de novo, this court for obvious reasons, will not consider evidence or <em>arguments </em>that were not presented to the district court for its consideration in ruling on the motion.\u201d <em>Guar. Nat\u2019l Cos. v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa, </em>149 F.3d 1177, 1177 (5th Cir.1998) (emphasis added). Consequently, we will not consider this point of error raised for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Mitchell\u2019s second argument relies on the policy\u2019s \u201crehabilitation clause,\u201d which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>REHABILITATION PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aok_\">The Insured shall be deemed conclusively to have been fully-rehabilitated and no claim shall be payable hereunder:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">(a) if the Insured signs a new professional contract and passes a professional team physical, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">(b) in the event the Insured Participates in four (4) or more Regular Season, play-off or championship games, or any combination thereof, during the period of twelve (12) months from the commencement of a Total Disablement or before the end of the immediately following Regular Season from the one in which the Insured became Totally Disabled, whichever period is the longer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Mitchell argues that, considering the policy as a whole, the rehabilitation clause modifies the Elimination Period and the \u201cparticipate\u201d definition so that an insured is permitted a rehabilitation period to practice and play in pre-season games before he is deemed ineligible for coverage. In effect, Mitchell\u2019s argument is that even though he did not meet the requirements of the Elimination Period, he is still entitled to coverage because he did not satisfy the terms of the rehabilitation provision, as he only played in three pre-season games rather than four regular season games. Moreover, Mitchell contends that the definition of \u201cparticipate\u201d must be informed by the rehabilitation clause to mean that an insured \u201cparticipates\u201d in a team sport only if he plays in four or more regular season games, otherwise the rehabilitation clause would be rendered inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cplain terms of the policy cannot bear Mitchell\u2019s interpretation, which would vitiate the Elimination Period and/or the meaning of \u2018participate\u2019 as defined in the policy.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s interpretation disregards the purpose of the rehabilitation clause and amounts to a complete re-writing of the policy\u2019s \u201cparticipate\u201d definition, an unreasonable construction that we cannot accept. The rehabilitation clause describes a set of circumstances under which an insured will be conclusively presumed to have been \u201cfully-rehabilitated\u201d such that no claim is payable. The purpose of the rehabilitation clause is to restrict, not to enlarge, the scope of coverage by providing more ways in which claims may be denied even if the insured remains totally disabled for the duration of the Elimination Period. For example, in a case where an insured satisfied the Elimination Period, he may still be denied coverage under the rehabilitation clause if he: (1) signed a new professional contract and passed a professional team physical; or (2) participated in four or more regular\u2019 season games before the end of the season immediately following the regular season in which he had become totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">In short, considering the policy as a whole, the rehabilitation clause only functions to limit coverage under the policy and cannot reasonably be read to increase Ace\u2019s exposure by doing away with the Elimination Period, a condition precedent for coverage, or the policy\u2019s meaning of the term \u201cparticipate.\u201d Accordingly, Mitchell\u2019s point of error fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\">. Even if Mitchell had not waived this specific issue, he would not prevail on appeal. According to Mitchell, the definition of \"participate\u201d should be read to mean that the insured is \"participating\u201d only if he is on the active roster <em>and </em>is dressed, available, or physically able to practice or play. But Mitchell's interpretation ignores the term \"or\u201d\u2014the same error of which he accuses the district court and Ace with respect to the use of the word \u201cand.\u201d The plain and unambiguous meaning that gives effect to the parties\u2019 intent is that the insured \"participates\u201d if the insured: (1) is on the active roster of the Cowboys <em>and </em>is dressed, available, or physically able to practice or play; OR (2) is on the active roster of the Cowboys; OR (3) is dressed in uniform, available, or physically able to practice or play for an NFL team. Because Mitchell was dressed in uniform, available to play, and actually did play in three pre-season games for the Cowboys, he \"participated\u201d and thus was not totally disabled for the duration of the Elimination Period, a condition precedent to Ace\u2019s liability under the policy. Consequently, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mitchell\u2019s breach of contract cause of action was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
