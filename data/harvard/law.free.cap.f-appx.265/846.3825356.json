Dale, Dale Law Firm, P.A., Orlando, FL, for Defendant-Appellant Alicia Marie Riedel.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b871-12\">Peggy Morris Ronca, Orlando, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b871-14\">Before DUBINA, BLACK and PRYOR, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b871-15\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b871-16\">Appellants Alicia Riedel and Derrick Clark both appeal their convictions and sentences for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(l)(A)(iii), and possession with intent to distribute and distribution of 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(iii). The district court sentenced Riedel to 121 months imprisonment and Clark to 240 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-18\">Riedel argues that she was entrapped and that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that she was predisposed to sell drugs. She also argues that the district court erred in its application of the Sentencing Guidelines by applying an obstruction-of-justice enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, declining to adjust her sentence for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, and not granting her safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5C1.2 and 2Dl.l(b)(9). Furthermore, she argues for the first time in her reply brief that the recent crack cocaine amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines should apply to her sentence. Clark argues that the evidence did not support finding that the offense involved crack cocaine, and Riedel adopts this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-19\">I. Entrapment</p>\n<p id=\"b871-20\">After the jury returned the guilty verdict, Riedel renewed her motion for acquittal on this issue, which preserved it for appeal. <em>United States v. Allison, </em>616 F.2d 779, 784 (5th Cir.1980). Because entrapment is generally a jury question, review of an entrapment claim is, as a matter of law, a sufficiency-of-the-evidence inquiry. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>71 F.3d 813, 815 (11th Cir.1996). We review a jury\u2019s rejection of an entrapment defense <em>de novo, </em>viewing all of the evidence and inferences in favor of the government. <em>United States v. Francis, </em>131 F.3d 1452, 1456 (11th Cir.1997). \u201c[W]e cannot overturn the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>verdict if any reasonable construction of the evidence would allow the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If a defendant testifies, the jury may conclude that the opposite of the testimony is true and use the statement as substantive evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">There are two elements in a valid entrapment defense: \u201c(1) government inducement of the crime, and (2) defendant\u2019s lack of predisposition to commit the crime prior to the inducement.\u201d <em>Francis, </em>131 F.3d at 1455-56. \u201cOnce the defendant has produced evidence of inducement, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime absent the government\u2019s role in assisting such commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1456. \u201cPredisposition is a fact intensive inquiry into the defendant\u2019s readiness and willingness to engage in the crime absent any contact with the government\u2019s officers or agents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Predisposition may be demonstrated by the following: (1) the defendant\u2019s ready commission of the charged crime; (2) evidence that the defendant had the opportunity to back out of the illegal transaction, but failed to do so; and (3) the jury\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s demeanor and credibility. <em>Miller, </em>71 F.3d at 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Because we conclude from the record that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Riedel was predisposed to sell drugs, we affirm her convictions. <em>See Miller, </em>71 F.3d at 816-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">II. Application of the Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we established a two-part process for district courts to use in calculating sentences. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). First, the district court must consult and correctly calculate the range recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines. Second, the district court must fashion a reasonable sentence by considering the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>Here, Riedel only challenges aspects of the sentencing court\u2019s guidelines calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">A. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, if the defendant willfully obstructs the administration of justice with respect to the prosecution of the instant offense and the obstructive conduct related to the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction, the district court should increase the offense level by two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. A defendant qualifies for the obstruction of justice enhancement when she \u201ctestifies untruthfully concerning a material fact during the course of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>904 F.2d 603, 604 (11th Cir.1990) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n. 1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">When a district court imposes an enhancement under the Guidelines for obstruction of justice; we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, but review its application of the Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Bradberry, </em>466 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWhere the district court must make a particularized assessment of the credibility or demeanor of the defendant, we accord special deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, and we review for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d 1305, 1318 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">After viewing the record, including Riedel\u2019s testimony, we conclude that it was not a clear error for the judge to determine that Riedel had lied while testifying. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">B. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"Aql\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), a defendant\u2019s offense level should be reduced by two levels if she clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). An adjustment is not warranted when the defendant falsely denied relevant conduct. <em>United States v. Coe, </em>79 F.3d 126, 127 (11th Cir.1996) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 1)). \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility only for clear error.\u201d <em>Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d at 1320. \u201cA district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is not entitled to acceptance of responsibility will not be set aside unless the facts in the record clearly establish that a defendant has accepted personal responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1320-21 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Since the district court did not clearly err in finding that Riedel lied about relevant conduct, an adjustment due to acceptance of responsibility was not warranted. Thus, we conclude that it was not clear error for the district court to deny an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">C. Safety-Valve Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of safety-valve relief for clear error. <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>261 F.3d 1071, 1073 (11th Cir.2001). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, a defendant qualifies for safety-valve relief if the district court finds, among other things, that the following criterion was met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-9\">not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the Government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5). If a defendant qualifies for safety-valve relief, the district court must disregard the mandatory minimum sentence and sentence the defendant based upon the applicable guideline range and the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Quirante, </em>486 F.3d 1273, 1275-76 (11th Cir.2007). Thus, if the defendant qualifies for safety-valve relief, the district court may sentence the defendant below the mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See id. </em>If a defendant qualifies for safety-valve relief, the district court should decrease the offense level by two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(9) (2006). If the defendant lies, she must make a complete and truthful proffer \u201c[n]ot later than the time of the sentencing hearing\u201d to qualify for safety-valve relief. <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">Because the judge had information that Riedel had not made a complete and truthful proffer, we conclude that it was not clear error for the district court to deny Riedel safety-valve relief. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of safety-valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">D. Recent Crack Cocaine Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"b873-14\">Issues not raised in a party\u2019s initial brief are deemed waived, although raised in supplemental briefs. <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-15\">Because Riedel did not raise this issue in her initial brief, we deem it waived and will not consider the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>III. Involvement of Crack Cocaine</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Neither Clark nor Riedel preserved this issue for appeal. Thus, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Straub, </em>508 F.3d 1003, 1011 (11th Cir.2007). Plain error review \u201crequires the petitioner to establish (1) that there was error (2) that was plain; (3) that affected his substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii), a defendant who was convicted of a prior drug-related felony is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years imprisonment if the offense involved \u201c50 grams or more of a mixture of substance ... which contains cocaine base.\u201d Addressing materially similar language in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b), this court held in <em>Munoz-Realpe </em>that \u201ccocaine base\u201d should only include \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d <em>United States v. Munoz-Realpe, </em>21 F.3d 375, 377-79 (11th Cir.1994). \u201c \u2018Crack\u2019 is the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Since several witnesses testified that the substance in question was crack cocaine, the evidence supports a finding of \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d as opposed to a more general finding of \u201ccocaine base.\u201d Accordingly, there was no error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error and therefore affirm Clark\u2019s and Riedel\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
