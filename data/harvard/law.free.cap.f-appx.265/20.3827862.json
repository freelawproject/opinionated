Sept. 13, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 676 580 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 12, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-20\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-21\">Pursuant to our recent decision in <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc), Chen is not <em>per se </em>eligible for asylum based on his wife\u2019s alleged forced abortion. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 (2d Cir.2007) (noting that \u201ca claim of persecution based <em>solely </em>on a forced abortion\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>brought by someone other than \u201cthe individual who has undergone the procedure ... is doomed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">An alien may establish eligibility for asylum by demonstrating past persecution based on his or her own \u201cresistance\u201d to a coercive population control program or a well-founded fear that he or she will be subjected to persecution for such resistance. <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 312-13 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)). However, as Chen failed to raise any such argument before either the agency or this Court, we deem it abandoned. <em>See Gui Yin Liu, </em>508 F.3d at 723 n. 6 (\u201c[Bjecause Liu failed to argue before either this Court or the BIA his claims for relief based on the illegal nature of his departure from China, we consider that basis for relief abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Similarly, because Chen\u2019s brief to this Court does not challenge the agency\u2019s denial of his CAT claim, we deem that claim waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
