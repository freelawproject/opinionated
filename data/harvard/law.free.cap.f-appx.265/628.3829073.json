We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">In filing his petition, Smith clearly stated that each of his claims had been adjudicated by the California Supreme Court. He also responded affirmatively to the following question on a court-provided form: \u201cIs any petition, appeal or other post-conviction proceeding now pending in any court?\u201d The exhibits attached to Smith\u2019s petition suggest that the pending \u201cpetition\u201d was in fact a civil commitment petition <em>against </em>Smith, which Smith wished to challenge through federal habeas as a violation of his plea agreement. A summary dismissal based on such a filing is erroneous in one of two ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-15\">If, on the one hand, the district court understood that the pending state proceeding in question was an allegedly illegal civil commitment proceeding, the exhaustion requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) and (c) would pose no obstacle to review. <em>See Coe v. Thurman, </em>922 F.2d 528, 530-531 (9th Cir.1990); <em>Hartley v. Neely, </em>701 F.2d 780, 781 (9th Cir.1983). If, on the other hand, the district court did not infer the nature of the pending state proceeding from Smith\u2019s petition, the dismissal was based on insufficient information. Were Smith a trained lawyer, it would be fair to assume that his response on the court-provided form indicated that he was maintaining a collateral attack on his conviction in state court. But coming from a pro se petitioner, Smith\u2019s representation that there was \u201cany petition, appeal or other post-conviction proceeding now pending in any court\u201d was ambiguous. The exhibits attached to Smith\u2019s petition made it even less clear that Smith was maintaining a suit in state court that would bar his federal claims. In light of the courts\u2019 duty to liberally construe pro se pleadings, <em>Haddock v. Board of Dental Examiners of California, 111 </em>F.2d 462, 464 (9th Cir.1985), as well as the principle that a court should summarily dismiss a habeas petition only where it is \u201cpatently frivolous or false,\u201d <em>Hendricks v. Vasquez, </em>908 F.2d 490, 491 (9th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 76, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977)), such an ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>filing by a pro se petitioner does not warrant summary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b653-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
