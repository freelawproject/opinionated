(\u201cGladwell\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of its copyright infringement action for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). We reverse. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b649-19\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Knievel v. ESPN, </em>393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir.2005). At this stage, we take as true allegations of material fact in the complaint and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Id. </em>Our review is generally limited to the contents of the complaint, but we \u201cmay consider evidence on which the complaint \u2018necessarily relies\u2019 if: (1) the complaint refers to the document; (2) the document is central to the plaintiffs claim; and (3) no party questions the authenticity of the copy attached to the 12(b)(6) motion.\u201d <em>Morder v. Lopez, </em>450 F.3d 445, 448 (9th Cir.2006). As the parties concede, we may consider the 1999 contract between Glad-well and Marin under the foregoing exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-20\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b649-21\">The central claim raised on appeal is that Gladwell had authored and obtained copyright protection in certain material (\u201cPre-Existing Materials\u201d) that predated the Marin contract that resulted in the creation of the retention schedules (\u201cMarin Schedules\u201d). The Copyright Act provides that copyright ownership \u201cvests initially in the author or authors of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>work.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(a). However, if the work is made \u201cfor hire,\u201d \u201cthe employer or other person for whom the work was prepared is considered the author ... and, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument signed by them, owns all of the rights comprised in the copyright.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b). Section 101 of the Copyright Act defines a \u201cwork made for hire\u201d as \u201ca work specially ordered or commissioned ... if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire____\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(2). The plain language of the statute indicates that a work-for-hire agreement cannot apply to works that are already in existence. Works \u201cspecially ordered or commissioned\u201d can only be made <em>after </em>the execution of an express agreement between the parties. <em>See Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Dumas, </em>53 F.3d 549, 558-59 (2d Cir.1995); <em>Schiller &amp; Schmidt, Inc. v. Nordisco Corp., </em>969 F.2d 410, 412-13 (7th Cir.1992) (\u201cThe writing must precede the creation of the property\u201d to qualify as a work-for-hire agreement). Accordingly, Marin could not acquire copyright ownership in Gladwell\u2019s Pre-Existing Materials through a work-for-hire agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Additionally, the agreement did not transfer Gladwell\u2019s copyright interest in the Pre-Existing Materials to Marin. The agreement provides that \u201c[a]ll reports, information, data, work product, findings, and conclusions furnished to or collected, prepared, assembled, and/or made by [Gladwell\u2019s agents] under this Agreement (\u201cWork Product\u201d) shall be the property of [Marin].\u201d This language by itself cannot operate to effect a copyright transfer as a matter of law. <em>See </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (requiring that a transfer of copyright ownership must be made in a signed writing); <em>Effects Assocs., Inc. v. Cohen, </em>908 F.2d 555, 557 (9th Cir.1990). Transfer of a copyright interest must be made expressly. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cThe rule is really quite simple: If the copyright holder agrees to transfer ownership to another party, that party must get the copyright holder to sign a piece of paper saying so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Because Gladwell has alleged a protectable copyright interest in the PreExisting Materials that cannot be transferred except in conformity with the requirements of the Copyright Act, Gladwell has standing to sue for copyright infringement and has stated a claim for relief sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">Although Gladwell has stated a claim sufficient to avoid a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, it is far from evident that it has a legitimate claim. The record is simply too undeveloped to make that conclusion. It is unclear what, if anything, comprises the Pre-Existing Materials, and whether the Pre-Existing Materials or the Marin Schedules are, in fact, copyrightable\u2014that is, whether they involve the requisite \u201cminimal degree of creativity\u201d necessary for copyright protection. <em>See Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Sen. Co., </em>499 U.S. 340, 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">It is also unclear from the record whether the contract, setting aside the question of the Pre-Existing Materials, actually created a work-for-hire agreement as contemplated by the Copyright Act. The district court\u2019s determination was based on a misreading of several parts of the contract. For instance, the district court read the contract to provide that all work product \u201cfurnished to [Marin]\u201d shall be the property of Marin, when in fact it states that all work product \u201cfurnished to [Gladwell]\u201d shall be the property of Marin. Additionally, the district court reported that Glad-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>well cannot \u201cuse or publish\u201d the Marin Schedules without Marin\u2019s prior authorization, but the contract only prohibits Glad-well from publishing (or making available) the Marin Schedules without Marin\u2019s authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">All of these matters are committed to the careful consideration of the district court on remand, and we express no opinion on any of these questions. Our holding simply is that Gladwell has standing to sue and its complaint survives the minimal requirements of Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
