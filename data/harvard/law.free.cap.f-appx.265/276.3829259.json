(\u201cSBC\u201d), denied Irene Hernandez\u2019s appeal of a decision terminating her disability benefits. About a month later, Hernandez submitted additional medical information that SMAART refused to consider. Hernandez sued SBC, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that SMAART abused its discretion in refusing to review the additional evidence. The district court granted summary judgment, holding that even if the additional evidence is considered, SMAART\u2019s determination was permissible. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In January 2002, Hernandez began short-term disability leave under SBC\u2019s disability plan. She was treated by\u2014 among other doctors\u2014Cesar Maldonado and Natalie Bornstein, both of whom are physicians; Elizabeth Young, a mental health therapist; and Roberta Fennig, a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">SMAART continued to extend Hernandez\u2019s short-term disability through early August 2002 based on medical information it had received from her doctors. SMAART received no additional medical information to substantiate her status after August 1 and consequently denied her benefits. In September, SMAART spoke again with Fennig, and Hernandez\u2019s benefits were extended through October 16. On October 17, SMAART received a letter from Bornstein stating that Hernandez would be unable to return to her performance level. SMAART asked Bornstein for additional information to support that position; Bornstein did not immediately respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">SMAART denied Hernandez\u2019s benefits beginning October 29. On November 13, Bornstein contacted SMAART, stating that Hernandez felt that she could not \u201csit, stand, or lie down for more than 20 minutes at a time.\u201d SMAART\u2019s position was that Bornstein\u2019s letter merely re-stated Hernandez\u2019s own claims and was not based on observable data.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">In early December, SMAART informed Hernandez that she could appeal, but her doctors needed to provide evidence of her level of functionality, a description of how her level of functionality impacted her ability to work and perform daily activities, and a detailed rationale with clinical documentation of those conclusions. Two independent physician advisors (\u201cIPA\u201d) were selected by SMAART to assess the matter. One of them, Jack Greener, reported that Fennig had opined that Hernandez\u2019s physical condition was the cause of her depression, and Greener concluded that Fennig did not describe \u201csevere anxiety, concentration and attention or memory problems of such severity that [Hernandez] could not perform her regular job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">The other IPA, Jose Perez, Jr., reported that Bornstein had stated that most of Hernandez\u2019s symptoms were related to fatigue and were subjective and that her lab work for Hernandez was not specific for any diagnosable disease.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Perez noted that evidence of recent examinations was lacking, concluding that according to \u201cthe information provided and from an internal medicine perspective, Ms. Hernandez is not disabled from her job from 10/29/02 to the present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Based on its review of the file and those reports, in late March 2003 SMAART upheld the termination of benefits, noting that Hernandez was unable \u201cto substantiate a severe condition preventing [her] return to work in some capacity....\u201d The disability policy at issue stated that short term disability was available only when \u201can Employee is unable to perform all of the essential functions of his job or another available job assigned by the Participating Company with the same full- or part-time classification for which the Employee is qualified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">In May 2003, Hernandez contacted SMAART to provide more medical information, including the records of three additional doctors: R.J. Abresch, R. Marwah, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>and Steven Crouse. Hernandez said that she informed SMAART about those three doctors and that SMAART had assured her it would obtain them records too; SMAART refused to consider the documents. Hernandez contends that those treatment records corroborate her other doctors\u2019 opinions that she suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and/or Epstein-Barr virus. Hernandez contends on appeal that it was an abuse of discretion for SBC and SMAART not to review the additional doctors\u2019 records.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. <em>See, e.g., TIG Ins. Co. v. Sedgwick James, </em>276 F.3d 754, 759 (5th Cir.2002). A summary judgment will be affirmed \u201conly if \u2018the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\u2019 when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant, \u2018show that there is no genuine issue of material fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). \u201cOnce the moving party has initially shown \u2018that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party\u2019s cause,\u2019 the non-movant must come forward with \u2018specific facts\u2019 showing a genuine factual issue for trial.\u201d <em>TIG, </em>276 F.3d at 759 (quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). Although the \u201ccourt must draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the non-moving party,\u201d a genuine dispute about a material fact exists only \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u201cERISA provides the federal courts with jurisdiction to review determinations made by employee benefit plans, including health care plans.\u201d <em>Vega v. Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Servs., Inc., </em>188 F.3d 287, 295 (5th Cir.1999) (en banc) (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B)). \u201c[W]hen an administrator has discretionary authority with respect to the decision at issue, the standard of review [is for] abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989)). \u201cThe existence of a conflict is a factor to be considered in determining whether the administrator abused its discretion in denying a claim. The greater the evidence of conflict on the part of the administrator, the less deferential our abuse of discretion standard will be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297. Where a plaintiff has \u201cdemonstrated the minimal basis for a conflict\u201d but has \u201cpresented no evidence with respect to the degree of the conflict,\u201d we review the administrator\u2019s decision \u201cwith only a modicum less deference\u201d than usual. <em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The \u201c \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 standard [is] part of abuse-of-discretion review,\u201d and \u201cwe affirm an administrator\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence. A decision is arbitrary only if made without a rational connection between the known facts and the decision or between the found facts and the evidence.\u201d <em>Meditrust Fin. Svcs. Corp. v. Sterling, </em>168 F.3d 211, 215 (5th Cir.1999) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\u201cOut of an abundance of caution,\u201d the district court reviewed the additional medical reports, declining to decide whether evidence provided by claimants to plan administrators after the administrators have rendered a final disposition but before the filing of a lawsuit must be considered by the administrators under <em>Vega. </em>The court ruled that though SMAART\u2019s decision should be reviewed with less deference because of possible self-interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>and even if the additional records were considered, there was no abuse of discretion. We affirm the district court essentially for the reasons it offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">SMAART denied Hernandez\u2019s appeal based on the reports of, <em>inter alia, </em>two independent physician advisors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was a rational connection among their recommendations, the other evidence in Hernandez\u2019s file, and SMAART\u2019s conclusions that Hernandez could perform her duties. That is enough in light of our standard of review. Even if Hernandez was suffering from illnesses of some sort, SMAART did not abuse its discretion in denying her appeal, because there were no documented findings that her illnesses were sufficiently severe to prevent her from doing her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The additional documents that Hernandez argues should be considered do not change this. SMAART never determined that she was not suffering from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or the like, but only that there was insufficient evidence of impaired working ability as a result of the illness. Nothing in the additional records undermines SMAART\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
