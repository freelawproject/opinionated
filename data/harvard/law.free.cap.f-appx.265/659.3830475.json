We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). We grant the petition and remand to the BIA for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-22\">Casas-Castrillon was granted temporary resident status in April 1989 and became a lawful permanent resident in September 1990. In 1993, he pled guilty to vehicle burglary in violation of Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 459. The administrative record contains a felony complaint and minute order evidencing the 1993 conviction. In 2000, Casas-Castrillon again pled guilty to vehicle burglary in violation of Section 459. There is a felony complaint and abstract of judgment evidencing the 2000 conviction in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-23\">The BIA held that Casas-Castrillon\u2019s 1993 conviction stopped the accrual of the seven years of continuous residence required to be eligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(d)(l)(B), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>1229b(a)(2). In so holding, the BIA found his convictions under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 459 were crimes involving moral turpitude. Casas-Castrillon contends the BIA erred in concluding that his convictions involved moral turpitude and in retroactively applying the \u201cstop-time\u201d rule of \u00a7 1229b(d)(l)(B) to prevent him from fulfilling the continuous residence requirement of \u00a7 1229b(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We review de novo \u201cwhether a state statutory crime constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude,\u201d <em>Navarro-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1063, 1067 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (citation omitted), and whether application of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) is impermissibly retroactive. <em>See Sinotes-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1190, 1194 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Although we have not, thus far, decided whether a violation of CahPenal Code \u00a7 459 is a crime involving moral turpitude,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we have held that residential burglary does not categorically involve moral turpitude. <em>See Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 1013, 1020 (9th Cir.2005) (interpreting Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.52.025(1)). The BIA\u2019s order in this case was issued before <em>Cuevas-Gaspar </em>was decided and did not contain a reasoned analysis of the moral turpitude question.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore remand with instructions that the BIA reconsider whether a violation of CahPenal Code \u00a7 459 is a crime of moral turpitude under the categorical and modified categorical approaches established by the Supreme Court in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and whether under the modified categorical approach the documentation for the conviction is legally sufficient to show that Casas-Castrillon pled guilty to a crime of moral turpitude. <em>See, e.g., Sandoval-Lua v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 1121, 1129-30 (9th Cir.2007). <em>See also INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (remand is appropriate where an agency can \u201cmake an initial determination.\u201d); <em>Couveau v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>218 F.3d 1078, 1081 (9th Cir. 2000) (\u201cAppellate review is a particularly difficult process when there is nothing to review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">We agree with Casas-Castrillon that application of \u00a7 1229b(d)(l)(B)\u2019s stop-time rule to his 1993 conviction would be impermissibly retroactive. Enacted as part of IIRIRA, the stop-time rule took effect on April 1,1997. The stop-time rule does not apply retroactively to the seven-year continuous residence requirement \u201cfor an alien who pled guilty before the enactment of IIRIRA and was eligible for discretionary relief at the time IIRIRA became effective.\u201d <em>Sinotes-Cruz, </em>468 F.3d at 1202-03. Casas-Castrillon met the sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>en-year continuous residence requirement and was eligible for cancellation of removal before IIRIRA was enacted. <em>Cf. Valencia-Alvarez v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 1319, 1328 (9th Cir.2006) (retroactive application of \u00a7 1229b(d)(l)(B) did not impair petitioner\u2019s rights because petitioner was not eligible for discretionary relief at the time IIRIRA became effective). We therefore hold that the permanent stop-time rule of \u00a7 1229b(d)(l)(B) does not apply retroactively to stop Casas-Castrillon\u2019s accrual of seven years of continuous residence under \u00a7 1229b(a)(2), and deny the government\u2019s motion to remand the retroactivity question to the BIA. We do not otherwise determine Casas-Castrillon\u2019s eligibility for cancellation of removal. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b685-9\">. In <em>Sareang Ye v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1128, 1135 n. 5 (9th Cir.2000), we described vehicle burglary as a <em>crime of </em>moral turpitude. This cursory statement, however, was not central to the holding and is distinguishable as nonbinding dicta. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>256 F.3d 895, 915 (9th Cir.2001) (Kozinski, J., concurring) (defining dictum as a statement incidental \"to another legal issue that commands the panel's full attention\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-14\">. It is unclear whether Casas-Castrillon\u2019s moral turpitude claim was exhausted before the BIA under <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1186 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc), but under the circumstances it is appropriate for the BIA to consider the issue on remand. Assuming that Casas-Castrillon did not adequately present the moral turpitude argument in his opening brief on appeal to this court, application of the waiver rule would result in manifest injustice. <em>See Koerner v. Grigas, </em>328 F.3d 1039, 1048 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
