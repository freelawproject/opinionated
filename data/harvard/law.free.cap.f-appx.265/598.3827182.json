We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Reviewing de novo, <em>id., </em>we conclude that, contrary to Villareal\u2019s contention, he is ineligible for relief under the Immigration and Nationality Act\u2019s former \u00a7 212(c) with respect to his 1999 conviction. <em>See United States v. Velasco-Medina, </em>305 F.3d 839, 850 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cTo the extent [an alien] anticipated the continued availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief after [1996], his expectations were neither reasonable nor settled under <em>[INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) ].\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(h)(3) (\u201cSection 212(c) relief is not available with respect to convictions arising from plea agreements made on or after April 1,1997.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">We also reject Villareal\u2019s alternative contention that, despite the contents of his plea agreement, his 1999 conviction under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a) does not constitute a bar to relief eligibility. Applying the modified categorical approach, it is clear that Villa-real\u2019s plea agreement provides a sufficient factual predicate to conclude that his eonviction \u201crelat[es] to a controlled substance\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b623-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
