Page denying Cutanda-Hierrezuelo\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of deportation, relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), adjustment of status, and waiver of inadmissibility. We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case, and arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-20\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 66 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam). Further, under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), this Court lacks jurisdiction to review a petitioner\u2019s removal order if he is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense that constitutes an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); <em>Jobson v. Ashcroft, </em>326 F.3d 367, 371 (2d Cir.2003). However, this Court maintains jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). The term \u201cquestions of law\u201d encompasses \u201cthe same types of issues that courts traditionally exercised in habeas review,\u201d and would include application of law to fact. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 326-27 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-21\">To the extent that Cutanda-Hierrezuelo argues that the pre-AEDPA and pre-IIRIRA definition of an aggravated felony should be applied to his convictions, which occurred prior to the 1996 amendments, that argument has been foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 319, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (noting that \u201cIIRIRA\u2019s amendment of the definition of \u2018ag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>gravated felony\u2019 ... clearly states that it applies\u201d retroactively). Thus, the IJ was correct in his determination that Cutanda-Hierrezuelo was not eligible for asylum under INA \u00a7 208(d), or withholding of deportation under INA \u00a7 243(h)(2)(B), because his convictions constituted aggravated felonies. Further, Cutanda-Hierrezuelo has not presented a constitutional claim or question of law that allows this Court to review the denial of CAT relief because he challenges only the IJ\u2019s factual determination that he did not prove that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to the Dominican Republic. <em>See Carcamo v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>498 F.3d 94, 98 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">With regard to Cutanda-Hierrezuelo\u2019s assertion that he obtained derivative citizenship through his mother, his claim fails for two reasons. First, because Cutanda-Hierrezuelo failed to raise a claim of derivative citizenship in his proceedings below, this issue has not been exhausted and, therefore, has not been preserved for review in this Court. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see also Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 120 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 343 (2d Cir.2006). Second, even if this Court chose to address this issue, Cutanda-Hierrezuelo\u2019s claim for derivative citizenship fails because his mother naturalized after he had reached the age of eighteen. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 322(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Additionally, Cutanda-Hierrezuelo\u2019s argument that he qualifies for relief as a non-citizen national under INA \u00a7\u00a7 341(b) and 325 is without merit. This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Marquez-Almanzar v. INS, </em>418 F.3d 210 (2d Cir.2005), forecloses Cutanda-Hierrezuelo\u2019s argument that he should be considered a United States national because he has pledged his permanent allegiance to this country. <em>Marquez-Almanzar </em>makes clear that an individual\u2019s permanent allegiance alone is not sufficient to confer national status on an applicant and that one can become a national only by birth or naturalization. <em>See </em>418 F.3d at 218. Rather, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408 describes four categories of persons who qualify as non-citizen nationals. Because Cutanda-Hierrezuelo is not a non-citizen national of the United States as provided in this statutory scheme, he is not eligible for relief under INA \u00a7\u00a7 341(b) and 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Insofar as petitioner argues that he is eligible for waivers under INA \u00a7\u00a7 212(c) and 212(h), based on the hardship to his citizen mother and children, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review these factual and discretionary decisions. <em>See Camara v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>497 F.3d 121, 124 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\"> With regard to Cutanda-Hierrezuelo\u2019s challenge of the IJ\u2019s decision to deny his application for adjustment of status, his argument is also without merit. This Court has held that it lacks jurisdiction to review any claim that an IJ or the BIA erred in weighing factors relevant to the grant or denial of adjustment of status. <em>See Guyadin v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 465, 469 (2d Cir.2006). Here, although the IJ stated that he would deny Cutanda-Hierrezuelo\u2019s application \u201cas a matter of discretion,\u201d he first determined that Cutanda-Hierrezuelo was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status. Thus, \u201cbefore reaching the question of whether we lacks jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s alternative basis for denying [petitioner] relief,\u201d this Court must \u201cfirst consider the issue of [petitioner\u2019s] statutory eligibility for an adjustment of status.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 135, 138 (2d Cir.2006). The IJ\u2019s determination that Cutanda-Hierrezuelo was ineligible for adjustment was correct in light of the fact that Cutanda-Hierrezuelo was not admissible because he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>been convicted of a controlled substance offense and a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7\u00a7 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), (II). To the extent that the IJ also denied Cutanda-Hierrezuelo\u2019s application on discretionary grounds, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review those bases for the decision. <em>See Guyadin, </em>449 F.3d at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Finally, because Cutanda-Hierrezuelo did not file a petition for review from the BIA\u2019s December 2006 denial of his motion to reopen, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 167 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
