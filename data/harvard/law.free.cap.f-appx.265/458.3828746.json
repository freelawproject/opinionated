We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000), and we grant the petition for review in part, deny it in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-21\">The BIA abused its discretion in rejecting Cao\u2019s contention that she was not provided proper written notice of the hearing she missed. The BIA reaffirmed its pri- or, incorrect determination that Cao was personally served with the notice of hearing and, as a consequence, did not properly consider the allegations in Cao\u2019s affidavit. <em>See Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 888, 892 (9th Cir.2002) (allegations in alien\u2019s affidavit supporting motion to reopen must be accepted as true unless inherently unbelievable). Moreover, the BIA\u2019s decision does not indicate that it considered factors we have held are relevant: the sufficiency of the government\u2019s evidence supporting the government\u2019s contention that the notice of hearing was mailed to Cao\u2019s address; and whether Cao had a motive to avoid the hearing, given her potential eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture, and the $5,000 bond she paid. <em>See Sembiring v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 981, 988 (9th Cir.2007) (adopting a \u201cpractical and commonsensical\u201d test to determine whether proper notice was provided). Accordingly, we remand for the BIA to reconsider Cao\u2019s motion under <em>Sembiring </em>and <em>Salta v. INS, </em>314 F.3d 1076 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the aspect of Cao\u2019s second motion to reopen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel because it was untimely and Cao was not entitled to equitable tolling. Cao\u2019s motion was filed more than six years after the BIA\u2019s earlier decision and Cao did not demonstrate that she exercised due diligence in discovering prior counsels\u2019 alleged errors. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2003) (equitable tolling is available to a petitioner who establishes deception, fraud, or error, and exercised due diligence in discovering such circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED in part; DENIED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b482-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
