Navarro-Padilla argues that the district court plainly erred in finding that his prior New York conviction for sexual abuse in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>first degree was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">As Navarro-Padilla did not object in the district court to the enhancement of his offense level under \u00a7 2L1.2, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-87, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). As the presentence report\u2019s assertion that Navarro-Padilla\u2019s offense of sexual abuse was a crime of violence was the only basis for the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement, the district court committed error that was clear or obvious. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Vega, </em>471 F.3d 559, 562 (5th Cir.2006). We determine whether the error is plain, however, at the time of appellate consideration, not at the time of trial. <em>Id. </em>at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The record, as supplemented on appeal, makes clear that Navarro-Padilla was indicted for one count of sodomy in the first degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.50(3) for engaging in \u201cdeviate sexual intercourse with another person who [was] less than eleven years old, to wit: a six year old male.\u201d The certificate of his conviction indicates that he pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of sexual abuse in the first degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.65. Although the offense of sexual abuse in the first degree can be committed in various ways, the indictment makes clear that Navarro-Padilla pleaded guilty to \u00a7 130.65(3) for having sexual contact with a person under 11 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The New York offense of sexual abuse in the first degree under \u00a7 130.65(3) constitutes the enumerated offense of sexual abuse of a minor under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275-76 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Navarro-Padilla has failed to show that the district court\u2019s error in enhancing his offense level under \u00a7 2L1.2 is plain at the time of appellate consideration. <em>See Martinez-Vega, </em>471 F.3d at 563; <em>see also United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 388 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 194, 166 L.Ed.2d 158 (2006). Navarro-Padilla\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
