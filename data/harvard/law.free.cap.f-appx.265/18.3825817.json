Apr. 20, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A46 426 009 (Immig. Ct. Buffalo Nov. 5, 2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">When the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision and supplements it, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>Niang v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 138, 145 (2d Cir.2007). The determination that an alien has abandoned her status as a permanent resident is fact-specific and reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Ahmed, v. Ashcroft, </em>286 F.3d 611, 612 (2d Cir.2002) (per curiam). We treat the agency\u2019s factual finding as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Generally, in order to gain admission into the United States, an immigrant must present a valid, unexpired immigrant visa and passport or other suitable travel document. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1181(a). While a person who fails to produce such entry documents is usually inadmissible, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), an exception exists for an immigrant who qualifies as a \u201creturning resident,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1181(b). A \u201creturning resident\u201d is a lawful permanent resident \u201creturning from a temporary visit abroad,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(27)(A), which this Court has established is a visit made with \u201cthe intention of the departing immigrant ... to return within a period relatively short, fixed by some early event.\u201d <em>Ahmed, </em>286 F.3d at 613 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Trombati abandoned her status as a lawful permanent resident. Trombati left the United States shortly after receiving this status in 1999 and spent the following four years living in Morocco and Canada. She testified that she intended to return to the United States only when her common law husband\u2019s investments made it possible for him to obtain a visa to live in Canada. In light of Trombati\u2019s testimony that her husband failed to take any affirmative steps to secure a Canadian visa, her return to the United States was contingent on an event\u2014her husband\u2019s obtaining a Canadian visa\u2014that \u201cwas not likely to occur within a reasonably short period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The record provides additional evidence supporting the conclusion that she did not intend to return to the United States within a short period of time. Trombati lived in an apartment in Canada with a one-year lease, obtained Canadian passports for her children, and did not have any property, business, financial, or family ties to the United States. The fact that Trombati entered the United States for a few hours by driving across the Canadian border in 2000 does not alter this conclusion. Her brief trip may demonstrate that she intended to retain her status as a lawful permanent resident, but it does not show that she intended to return to the United States \u201cwithin a period relatively short, fixed by some early event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">While Trombati contends that her husband\u2019s abuse was a cause for her long absence from the United States, she testified only to one instance of abuse that took place approximately three and a half years after she first left this country in 1999. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>We find this claim and Trombati\u2019s other arguments to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b43-9\">. The petitions of Trombati's three minor children are contingent upon the disposition of this appeal. <em>In re Fahad Al Olayan, </em>No. A97 913 536 (B.I.A.
