Wright, proceeding <em>pro se </em>on appeal, appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of her <em>pro se </em>\u201cMotion for Relief,\u201d which the district court construed as a civil complaint. Wright does not include an argument section in her brief. She lists two \u201cissues\u201d in the briefs \u201cStatement of Issues/Facts/Summary\u201d: (1) \u201cTSA staff with disregard, destroyed patrons [sic] carry-on luggages and valuable contents;\u201d and (2) \u201c[p]etitioner seeks monetary damages for necessary medical/legal records evidence and published manuscripts, etc.\u201d The brief also includes a \u201cClaim for Losses/Statutory Provisions\u201d section, which reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>Petitioner seeks relief for losses $591,635.00 plus costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">Fed. R. C. V. p. (8)a [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-6\">Fed. Tort Claims Act 284 \u00a7 C 52671, et seq.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">A copy of the district court\u2019s order dismissing Wright\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint is attached to the brief. Additionally, the notice of appeal states: \u201cI am trying to appeal to this Court on a dismissal.\u201d For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">We decline to review passing references to issues unsupported by argument. <em>Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (deeming issue waived where party failed to include substantive argument and only made passing reference to the order appealed from). Further, a party may not \u201cincorporate by reference\u201d arguments presented to the district court, but must specifically and clearly identify the issues presented for review, with citations to the authorities and portions of the record on which the appellant relies. <em>Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, B.V. v. Consorcio Barr S.A., </em>377 F.3d 1164, 1167 n. 4 (11th Cir.2004). While we read briefs tiled by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, <em>Lorisme v. I.N.S., </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444 n. 3 (11th Cir.1997), issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned, <em>Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Here, Wright\u2019s brief does not present any argument regarding the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint or any other issue. The brief contains no argument section. As noted above, the briefs \u201cStatement of Issues/Facts/Summary\u201d states two purported issues and a \u201cClaim for Losses/Statutory Provisions\u201d section lists the damages for loss that she seeks and cites the Federal Tort Claims Act. It appears clear from the inclusion of the district court\u2019s order, together with the statement of intent to appeal included in the notice of appeal, that the issue Wright raises on appeal is the propriety of the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint. However, the issue is not supported by any semblance of an argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">In light of the foregoing, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wright\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-10\">. We note that even if we were to consider the merits of Wright's appeal, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint because amendment of the complaint would have been futile.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
