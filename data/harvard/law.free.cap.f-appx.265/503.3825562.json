Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Lo v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 934, 937 (9th Cir.2003), we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">The agency abused its discretion in denying Sanchez-Perez\u2019s motion to reopen because the evidence of record shows reasonable cause for Sanchez-Perez\u2019s failure to appear. <em>See Urbina-Osejo v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 1314, 1316 (9th Cir.1997) (observing that \u201creasonable cause\u201d under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) can exist if petitioner does not receive adequate notice of hearing). The government was required to inform Sanchez-Perez that he must advise the INS of any change in address. <em>See Lahmidi v. INS, </em>149 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Urbina-Osejo, </em>124 F.3d at 1317). The Order to Show Cause issued in 1989 did not inform Sanchezr-Perez that he must advise the INS of his current or changed address. Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings in light of Sanchez-Perez\u2019s showing of reasonable cause for failing to atr tend the hearing. <em>See generally INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam). In light of our disposition, we need not address Sanchez-Perez\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b528-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
