For the reasons that follow, we will enforce the order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">I. Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Respondent is a nursing home and rehabilitation center located in Dover, New Jersey, and owned and operated by David Gross. In April 2008, James Robinson, the president of Local 300S (\u201cLocal 300\u201d), a union affiliated with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, informed Gross by letter that Local 300 was attempting to organize Respondent\u2019s employees. Gross agreed to recognize Local 300 if an arbitrator determined that the union had obtained authorization cards from a majority of employees in Respondent\u2019s service and maintenance unit. On May 21, 2003, an arbitrator conducted a \u201ccard-check\u201d and determined that a majority of eligible employees had selected Local 300 as their collective bargaining representative. By Award dated May 22, 2003, the arbitrator directed Respondent to recognize Local 300, and it did. No public announcement or written statement of the recognition was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">More than seven months later, on January 8, 2004, Respondent entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Local 300. The next day, Respondent announced in a meeting with employees that a card count had taken place and that it had entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Local 300. On February 19, 2004, Intervenor SEIU Local 1199 (\u201cSEIU\u201d) filed charges with the Board against Respondent, alleging that Respondent violated the National Labor Relations Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) by recognizing Local 300 at a time when Local 300 did not have authorization cards from a majority of unit employees. On September 30, 2004, SEIU amended its charge to further allege that Respondent entered into an agreement with a \u201cminority union,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> also in violation of the Act. The same day, General Counsel for the Board filed a complaint containing both of these allegations. Respondent filed an answer denying any unfair labor practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">A hearing was held before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). The ALJ concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that Respondent violated Sections 8(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Act by recognizing and entering into an agreement with a minority union. The ALJ relied primarily on the credited testimony of 81 employees, \u201cnot one of [whom] testified ... that he or she signed a card for Local 300S, and ... 74 [of whom] affirmatively stated that they did not sign a card authorizing [Local 300] to represent them\u201d prior to that union\u2019s recognition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>(App.13.) He also relied on circumstantial evidence, including the actions and behavior of both Gross and Robinson, and the circumstances surrounding the card check itself. Such evidence led the ALJ to conclude that \u201cRespondent sought to conceal from the employees, and ultimately from SEIU, the fact that it had recognized Local 300S.\u201d (App.12.) Respondent\u2019s defenses, including the defense that the allegations against Respondent were time-barred, were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Pursuant to the Board\u2019s rules and regulations, Respondent filed timely exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision. The Board issued a decision affirming but modifying the ALJ\u2019s rulings, findings, and conclusions, and adopting the ALJ\u2019s Order, also with modifications. The Board rejected Respondent\u2019s defense that the charges were untimely pursuant to Section 10(b) of the Act. Subsequent motions for reconsideration by Respondent were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The Court \u201cmust defer to the requirements imposed by the Board if they are rational and consistent with the Act, and if the Board\u2019s explication is not inadequate, irrational or arbitrary.\u201d <em>Allentown Mack Sales &amp; Serv., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>522 U.S. 359, 364, 118 S.Ct. 818, 139 L.Ed.2d 797 (1998) (quotations and citations omitted). When reviewing the Board\u2019s decision in a particular case, the Court must \u201caccept the Board\u2019s factual determinations and reasonable inferences derived from [those] determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Stardyne, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>41 F.3d 141, 151 (3d Cir.1994); <em>see also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Where the Board adopts the ALJ\u2019s decision in part, the Court reviews both the ALJ and Board decisions. <em>Trafford Distribution Center v. N.L.R.B., </em>478 F.3d 172, 179 (3d Cir.2007). The Board\u2019s decision whether to defer to an arbitrator\u2019s award is reviewed for abuse of discretion only. <em>NLRB v. Yellow Freight, </em>930 F.2d 316, 322 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Respondent makes three arguments in its brief. First, Respondent argues that the charges against it were time-barred by Section 10(b) of the Act. Second, Respondent asserts that deferral to the arbitrator was required by NLRB and Third Circuit case law. Finally, Respondent argues that the remedy imposed by the Board was punitive. We address each of the arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">Respondent\u2019s first argument is that the charges against it were time-barred when they were filed. Section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b), provides that \u201cno complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge.\u201d The initial charge in this case was filed February 19, 2004, about 8 months after Respondent recognized Local 300. The amended charge was filed on September 30, 2004, about 9 months after Respondent entered into an agreement with Local 300. Although 10(b) would normally bar both claims, the ALJ and the Board found that the charges were timely pursuant to exceptions to Section 10(b). (App.3,13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">Applying the doctrine of intentional concealment, the ALJ and the Board concluded that the initial charge was timely because it was filed within six months of January 9, 2004, the day SEIU and Respondent\u2019s employees were informed of Respondent\u2019s recognition of Local 300. (App.3, 13-14.) The ALJ and Board also found the amended charge to be timely under <em>Redd-I, Inc., </em>290 NLRB 1115 (1988), which held that otherwise untimely allegations are not barred by Section 10(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>if they are \u201cclosely related\u201d to the initial, timely charge. The ALJ and the Board concluded that the amended charge was \u201cclosely related\u201d to the initial charge and was therefore timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The crux of Respondent\u2019s timeliness argument is that the doctrine of intentional concealment does not apply to the facts of this case. The Board has held that fraudulent concealment tolls the 10(b) statute of limitations when \u201c(1) deliberate concealment has occurred; (2) material facts were the object of the concealment; and (3) the injured party was ignorant of those facts, without any fault or want of due diligence on its part.\u201d <em>See Brown &amp; Sharpe Mfg., </em>321 NLRB 924 (1996). Similarly, \u201cthe Board has consistently held that the 10(b) period does not commence until the charging party has clear and unequivocal notice of the violation.\u201d <em>Vallow Floor Coverings, </em>335 NLRB 20 (2001) (quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also N.L.R.B. v. Public Service Elec. and Gas Co., </em>157 F.3d 222, 228-29 (3d Cir.1998). Respondent asserts that it never deliberately concealed recognition of Local 300 from its employees or SEIU and that if the employees and SEIU were unaware of the recognition, their ignorance was due to want of due diligence on their part.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The ALJ assiduously laid out the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, supporting a finding of fraudulent concealment. The evidence includes (1) Gross\u2019 request to Robinson that they \u201ckeep everything at a low, quiet, even-keel pace;\u201d (2) Gross\u2019 inability to name a single employee with whom he claimed to have spoken about the union\u2019s recognition, or to recall when any conversations took place; (3) the fact that employees who were allegedly informed of the recognition were not told which union was recognized; (4) the fact that not a single employee who testified stated that he or she had knowledge of Local 300\u2019s recognition; (5) the seven-month delay in making any public announcement about Local 300\u2019s recognition; and (6) the fact that prior to January 9, 2004, the union never held a meeting with any of the Regency Grande employees for any purpose. Because substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Respondent engaged in fraudulent concealment, the Board\u2019s determination that the charges were timely must be upheld.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Respondent\u2019s second argument is that the Board erred by not deferring to the arbitrator. Respondent maintains that deferral to the arbitrator is required unless proceedings before the arbitrator were unfair and irregular. As stated above, this Court reviews the Board\u2019s decision whether to defer to an arbitrator for abuse of discretion only.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">The Board has held that it is \u201cnot bound by a neutral party\u2019s authorization card count where it was shown that particular cards which were counted toward a union\u2019s majority status were, in fact, invalid.\u201d <em>Sprain Brook Manor, </em>219 NLRB 809 (1975) <em>enforced sub nom. NLRB v. Book, </em>532 F.2d 877 (2d Cir.1976). Where a majority of unit employees testify that they did not sign union authorization cards, as in this case, the Board is not required to defer to the arbitrator\u2019s award. - <em>Id.; see also Windsor Castle Health Care Facilities, </em>310 NLRB 579 (1993); <em>cf. Yellow Freight, </em>930 F.2d at 322 (\u201c[I]t makes little sense to defer to the arbitrator\u2019s specific factual findings where deference overall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>was refused because of the inadequacy of the factual presentation to the arbitrator.\u201d) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The record reflects that a majority of employees-74 out of a unit of 117-testified that they did not sign authorization cards for Local 300 prior to that union\u2019s recognition. Thus, in declining to follow the arbitrator\u2019s decision, the ALJ and the Board did not abuse their discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Finally, Respondent argues that requiring it, but not Local 300, to refund dues is a penalty and not proper make-whole relief. Respondent cites no case law in support of this argument. In an October 31, 2006 Order, the Board rejected Respondent\u2019s argument on the ground that it was not previously raised on exception to the Board. On November 29, 2006, upon Respondent\u2019s request to reconsider, the Board again rejected the argument. The November 29, 2006 Order stated that the request to reconsider \u201cfail[ed] to raise any matter that was not previously considered\u201d and was \u201clacking in merit.\u201d (App.1505.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The Board\u2019s rules provide that \u201c[n]o matter not included in exceptions ... may thereafter be urged before the Board, or in any further proceeding.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.46(g). The rules further provide that exceptions \u201cshall set forth specifically the question of procedure, fact, law, or policy to which exceptions are taken\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny exception to a ruling, finding, conclusion or recommendation which is not specifically urged shall be deemed to have been waived.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.46(b). Although the Board argues that the Court is precluded by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.46(g) from considering Respondent\u2019s objection to the Board\u2019s remedy, we note that Respondent included in its exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s opinion an exception to \u201c[t]he sections entitled \u2018Conclusions of Law5 \u2018Remedy and \u2018Order.\u2019 \u201d (SA 15.) We further note that in an Order dated April 19, 2006, the Board declined to reject Respondent\u2019s exceptions on the ground that they did not conform to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.46(b)(1) and (c)(2), the rules requiring specificity, although that Order did not specifically address the sufficiency of the exception to the remedy. On the basis of the record, we conclude that Respondent\u2019s exception to the Board\u2019s remedy is minimally sufficient to warrant our consideration of the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\u201c[T]he Board\u2019s power to fashion remedies for unfair labor practices is a \u2018broad and discretionary one, subject to limited review.\u2019 \u201d <em>St. George Warehouse, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>420 F.3d 294, 299 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Fibreboard Paper Prods. Corp. v. NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 216, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964)). Our review of the Board\u2019s choice of remedy is limited to asking whether the remedy goes beyond the Board\u2019s scope of authority. <em>See Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>467 U.S. 883, 899, 104 S.Ct. 2803, 81 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984). The Board\u2019s remedy in this case restores the status quo ante. We do not find that this remedy exceeded the Board\u2019s broad discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Upon review of the record, we find that substantial evidence in this case, including the testimony of a majority of bargaining unit employees who affirmatively testified that they did not sign authorization cards for Local 300, supports the Board\u2019s finding that Respondent violated Sections 8(a)(1), (2), and (3) of the Act. We will enforce the Board\u2019s Order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-9\">. The Court exercises jurisdiction over this application pursuant to Section 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b99-10\">. A \u201cminority union\" is a union that operates as the exclusive bargaining representative of a group of workers without the consent and agreement of a majority of those workers. <em>See International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union, AFL-CIO v. N.L.R.B., </em>366 U.S. 731, 737-38, 81 S.Ct. 1603, 6 L.Ed.2d 762 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b99-16\">. The bargaining unit consisted of 117 employees. Thus, the testimony from 74 unit employees that they did not sign cards for Local 300 makes majority support for that union mathematically impossible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\">. Because we find that recognition was concealed from Respondent's employees, we need not address Respondent's argument that enforcing this Order will allow rival unions to file belated charges against employers on the grounds that <em>they </em>were not notified of another union\u2019s recognition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
