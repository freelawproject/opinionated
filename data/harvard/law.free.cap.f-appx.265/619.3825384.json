We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-25\">Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), we conclude that the IJ acted within his discretion in denying Elmquist\u2019s motion to reopen, because she does not dispute that her hearing notice was delivered to the correct address. The circumstances that led- Elmquist to miss her removal hearing are attributable to subsequent \u201cinternal workings of the household,\u201d <em>Matter of G-Y-R-, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 181, 189 (BIA 2001) (en banc), including Elmquist\u2019s admitted failure to go through the mail in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>We also conclude that in these circumstances the IJ did not violate Elmquist\u2019s due process rights by failing to consider her pending application for relief in determining whether the hearing notice was properly served. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cTo prevail on a due process challenge ... [a petitioner] must show error and substantial prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">We grant Elmquist\u2019s motion to file her untimely reply brief. The Clerk shall file the brief received on November 28, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b643-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
