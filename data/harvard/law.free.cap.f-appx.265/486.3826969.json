The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioners\u2019 untimely motion to reopen removal proceedings. The petitioners failed to demonstrate that \u201ccircumstances [in Indonesia] have changed sufficiently\u201d such that they now have a legitimate claim for asylum when they previously lacked \u201ca well-founded fear of future persecution\u201d and sufficient cause to excuse the breach of the 90-day filing-deadline. <em>See Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C). Although the evidence reflects a subjective belief of future persecution\u2014continuing violence in Indonesia and a deterioration of conditions adverse to the ethnic Chinese, Christians, women, the mentally ill, and political dissidents\u2014 our case law requires, and the record here is devoid of, an individualized threat of persecution \u201cdistinct from [that] felt by all other ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia\u201d that establishes the petitioners\u2019 fear is objectively reasonable. <em>Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1181 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). The BIA\u2019s determination therefore was not \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">2. The IJ\u2019s determination, affirmed without opinion by the BIA, that the petitioners were ineligible for asylum, withholding from removal, and protection under CAT is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As discussed above, the petitioners are unable to point to record evidence that their fear of future persecution was objectively reasonable. In short, the evidence does not distinguish the situation the petitioners potentially would face upon return to Indonesia from that experienced by all members of the groups to which they allege they belong. The IJ therefore correctly determined that the petitioners did not satisfy their burden of proof. <em>See Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">Because the petitioners are unable to establish the lower evidentiary threshold of entitlement to asylum, they are necessarily ineligible for withholding from removal and protection under CAT. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>458 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">3. The IJ\u2019s statement during the removal proceedings that \u201cI have made an effort to try and look\u201d over the 500 pages of materials the petitioners submitted in support of then- applications and conclusion that \u201cI did not see anything specific to personal problems that they\u2019ve had\u201d did not violate the petitioners\u2019 due process rights. It is apparent that the IJ in fact had reviewed the materials because he articulated what he felt was a critical deficiency\u2014the lack of any individualized nexus. Significantly, the IJ solicited comments from the petitioners to ensure his understanding was accurate. There was no due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The remainder of the petitioners\u2019 due process contentions similarly lack merit. The IJ appropriately relied on the State Department country report, <em>see Lolong, </em>484 F.3d at 1181 n. 5; the IJ did not impermissibly exclude relevant case law, <em>see Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 799, 807 n. 5 (9th Cir.2004); the BIA permissibly affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, <em>see Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 855 (9th Cir.2003); and the BIA did not improperly omit a statement of the petitioners\u2019 appellate remedies. Finally, we lack jurisdiction to consider whether the BIA should have exercised its discretion to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen removal proceedings. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1160 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-10\">. We previously dismissed as untimely a petition for review in this matter challenging the same IJ's decision. <em>See Shalimar v. Ashcroft, </em>117 Fed.Appx. 618 (9th Cir.2004). However, the petitioners subsequently applied for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 challenging their order of removal. Within days, Congress enacted the REAL ID Act, which prompted the district court, under section 106(c), to transfer the case to us. <em>See </em>Pub L. No. 109-13 \u00a7 106(c). The REAL ID Act mandates that we \u201ctreat die [transferred case as a] petition for review under section 242 [of the INA], except that subsection (b)(1) [the thirty-day time limitation] of such section shall not apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore have held that we have jurisdiction over what would otherwise be an untimely filed petition for review and that our standard of review remains unaltered. <em>See Alvarez-Barajas v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1050 (9th Cir.2005) (reasoning that the thirty-day time limitation is inapplicable to transferred cases and that \u201c[t]he fact that we construe Alvarez-Barajas\u2019 habeas petition as a petition for review <em>does not affect our standard for review </em>\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
