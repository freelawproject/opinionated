The plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case was that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>the-Division of Consumer Affairs of Palm Beach County (\u201cDCA\u201d) and its director, Moore, treated complaints made against White Lion differently, and less favorably, than those made against moving companies on the DCA\u2019s Moving Task Force, and that the DCA and Moore otherwise unconstitutionally implemented the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">A jury found Moore not liable but found that the County had violated the due process and equal protection rights of White Lion and Fischer. The district court subsequently granted the County\u2019s renewed motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, concluding that the evidence presented at trial did not support imposition of municipal liability upon the County. \u201cWhite Lion and Fischer appeal from that judgment. We affirm because no evidence in the record supports the conclusion that the County Commissioners were aware of or ratified any custom or policy that violated the equal protection or due process rights of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
