These motions are treated as civil equitable proceedings and, therefore, a district court must exercise \u2018caution and restraint\u2019 before assuming jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Ramsden v. United States, 2 </em>F.3d 322, 324 (9th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). Here, the district court\u2019s tersely-worded order stated only that \u201cthe motion to return the property of Mr. Kwan seized pursuant to the investigation of this matter is DENIED.\u201d It is evident, however, and Kwan does not contend otherwise, that Kwan did not make the four-factor showing which <em>Rams-den </em>requires as a predicate to the district court assuming jurisdiction over a preindictment Rule 41(g) motion. <em>See id. </em>at 324-25; <em>see also United States v. Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., </em>473 F.3d 915, 929 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The order of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED without prejudice to Kwan renewing his Rule 41(g) motion on a proper showing of the <em>Ramsden </em>factors before the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b519-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
