Jones, Mississippi prisoner # R5912, filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint alleging that he was exposed to inhumane conditions of confinement during his nine-month stint in the South Mississippi Correctional Institution II Lockdown Unit. He sought injunctive relief as well as monetary damages. The magistrate judge (MJ) dismissed the complaint with prejudice following an omnibus hearing on Jones\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Jones argues that the MJ erred in dismissing his case as moot. The MJ dismissed only Jones\u2019s request for injunctive relief as moot because Jones was no longer housed in the Lockdown Unit. Jones has not demonstrated a reasonable expectation that he will once again be imprisoned in the Lockdown Unit and subjected to the same conditions. Thus, despite Jones\u2019s contention to the contrary, his case does not fall within the exception to the mootness doctrine. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 17-18, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Jones argues that the MJ erred in dismissing his complaint on the grounds that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The MJ\u2019s dismissal in this regard relied on Jones\u2019s statements made at the omnibus hearing. We cannot effectively review this issue because Jones has failed to provide a transcript of the hearing. We therefore dismiss Jones\u2019s appeal. <em>Richardson v.
