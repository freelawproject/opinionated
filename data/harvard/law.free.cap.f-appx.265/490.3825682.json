We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Robinson v. Ignacio, </em>360 F.3d 1044, 1055 (9th Cir.2004). We review the \u201clast reasoned decision\u201d by a state court, which in this case is the decision of the California Court of Appeal. <em>Id. </em>Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history we do not include them here, except as necessary to explain our disposition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">We granted Bennet\u2019s, certificate of appealability with respect to the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-16\">[W]hether the <em>Miranda </em>warnings given mid-interrogation, after Bennet gave an unwarned confession, were ineffective, thereby making Bennet\u2019s subsequent <em>post-Miranda </em>confession inadmissible at trial. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3); <em>Missouri v. Seibert </em>[542 U.S. 600], 124 S.Ct. 2601 [159 L.Ed.2d 643] (2004).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-17\">Bennet argues that \u201cThe California state court\u2019s denial of [Bennet\u2019s] Fifth Amendment claim was both contrary to and an unreasonable application of\u2019 the law under <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Specifically, he contends the state court\u2019s reliance on <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985) \u201cto find that neither coercion nor improper tactics were used to obtain the prisoner\u2019s two deliberately unwarned confessions ... is an unreasonable application of that decision to the facts in [his] case.\u201d In support of this, he argues that, \u201c[t]he <em>Seibert </em>... plurality condemned the deliberate failure to Mirandize a suspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>until after he made an inculpatory statement that was the result of a police protocol which [the Supreme Court] characterized as a question-first strategy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Our review is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">... a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim ... resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\n<em>The California Court of Appeals\u2019 Application of the Law Was Not \u201cObjectively Unreasonable\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">We are bound to evaluate Bennet\u2019s claim according to \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d at the time of the decision in Bennet\u2019s case. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 380, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (explaining that the relevant governing law for habeas purposes is the law that was clearly established \u201cat the time the state conviction became final\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">In Bennet\u2019s case, the state court correctly determined that, at the time of its decision, the \u201cclearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d was <em>Elstad. </em>The court looked at the facts of Bennet\u2019s case, and applying <em>Elstad, </em>found that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings given to him were sufficient, that his <em>post-Miranda </em>confession was voluntary, and therefore properly admitted during trial. While it is possible that another court applying <em>Elstad </em>could have come to a different conclusion, we cannot say that the court\u2019s application of federal law was \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">\n<em>Seibert Does Not Alter This Result</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Bennet urges us to consider his petition in light of <em>Seibert. Seibert, </em>however, cannot be retroactively applied to Bennet\u2019s case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, we must evaluate Bennet\u2019s claim with respect to \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d at the time the conviction became final in his case. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 380, 120 S.Ct. 1495; <em>see also Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (\u201cUnless they fall within an exception to the general rule, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">The Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[a] new rule applies retroactively in a collateral proceeding only if (1) the rule is substantive or (2) the rule is a watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Whorton v. Bockting, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 1180, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-16\">Even if <em>Seibert </em>did constitute a new rule of criminal procedure, it did not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>a \u201cwatershed rul[e] of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding,\u201d and therefore cannot be applied retroactively to Bennet\u2019s case. <em>See id.; Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. at 315, 109 S.Ct. 1060; <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>423 F.3d 1119, 1120 (9th Cir.2005) (stating that when a new procedural rule is not a \u201cwatershed rule\u201d under <em>Teague, </em>it could not be retroactively applied).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">To the extent that Bennet is arguing that if <em>Seibert </em>did not constitute an applicable new rule, nonetheless it makes the state court\u2019s application of <em>Elstad </em>objectively unreasonable, we cannot agree. <em>Seibert </em>was a plurality opinion in which four justices of the Court concluded that <em>Elstad </em>compelled them to vacate the state Supreme Court\u2019s decision excluding a post-<em>Miranda </em>confession. <em>See Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 622-623, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., Sealia and Thomas, JJ.) (\u201cWe are bound by <em>Elstad </em>to reach a different result, and I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri.\u201d). We cannot say that the state court in Bennet\u2019s case was \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d when, on similar facts, it came to the same conclusion that four justices of the Supreme Court came to in the later <em>Seibert </em>plurality.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Because the state court\u2019s application of \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d was not \u201cobjectively unreasonable,\u201d Bennett is not entitled to federal habeas corpus relief. The decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b515-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-13\">. Bennet makes passing mention in his brief that the state court\u2019s decision was \"contrary to\u201d clearly established federal law under <em>Miranda, </em>which requires that a suspect be clearly advised of his rights. However, the state court did not hold it unnecessary for a defendant to be clearly advised of his rights. Rather, the court cited to controlling law and explained that \u201cBennet was told he could ask for an attorney, at state expense, at that moment, and have him present during questioning. He was told he could choose to be silent. He was informed that statement could be used against him. He answered affirmatively when asked if he understood.\u201d The court then found that the elements of <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985) were met. We cannot say that, in so doing, the court acted \"contrary to\u201d clearly established federal law. <em>See Gautt v. Lewis, </em>489 F.3d 993, 1002 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\">. Because <em>Seibert </em>cannot be retroactively applied to Bennet's case regardless of its precedential value, we need not consider what precedential value it might have as a plurality opinion. <em>See United States v. Antelope, </em>395 F.3d 1128, 1133 n. 1 (9th Cir.2005) (stating that, with respect to plurality opinions, \"when 'no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds ... \u2019 \" (quoting <em>Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977))).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
