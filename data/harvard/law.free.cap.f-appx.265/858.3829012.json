We granted a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of \u201cwhether the district court erred in denying as procedurally barred appellant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.\u201d On appeal, McKinzie argues that the substance of his argument before the state courts was that the State had failed to meet its burden of establishing that he had concealed a firearm in a location that was not his residence. He argued that his claim was one of insufficient evidence, and it was fairly presented to the state courts. He con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>tended that he referred to the due process reasonable doubt standard before the state courts, which provided them with an opportunity to address his federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">We conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of a district court\u2019s determination that a habeas petitioner is procedurally barred from raising a claim in federal court. <em>Atwater v. Crosby, </em>451 F.3d 799, 809 (11th Cir.2006), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 951, 166 L.Ed.2d 725 (2007). In <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state prisoner\u2019s claim that the evidence in support of his conviction was insufficient to have led a rational trier of fact to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt constitutes a federal constitutional claim that is cognizable in a federal habeas proceeding, \u201cassuming that state remedies have been exhausted, and that no independent and adequate state ground stands as a bar.\u201d 443 U.S. 307, 321, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2790, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">As <em>Jackson </em>indicates, before bringing a habeas petition in federal court, the petitioner must exhaust all state court remedies that are available for challenging his conviction, either on direct appeal or in a state post-conviction motion, 443 U.S. at 322-23, 99 S.Ct. at 2791; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b), (c). To exhaust state remedies, the petitioner must \u201cfairly present[]\u201d his federal claims to the state court, providing it with \u201can opportunity to apply controlling legal principles to the facts bearing upon them.\u201d <em>Henry v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>197 F.3d 1361, 1366 (11th Cir.1999) (internal quotation and citation omitted). \u201cIf state courts are to be given the opportunity to correct alleged violations of prisoners\u2019 federal rights, they must ... be alerted to the fact that the prisoners are asserting claims under the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Duncan v. Henry, </em>513 U.S. 364, 365-66, 115 S.Ct. 887, 888, 130 L.Ed.2d 865 (1995). However, the petitioner is not necessarily required to cite \u201cbook and verse on the federal constitution.\u201d <em>Picard v. Connor, </em>404 U.S. 270, 278, 92 S.Ct. 509, 513, 30 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971) (citation omitted). The Supreme Court has held that \u201cordinarily a state prisoner does not \u2018fairly present\u2019 a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief (or a similar document) that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material, such as a lower court opinion in the case, that does so.\u201d <em>Baldwin, v. Reese, </em>541 U.S. 27, 32, 124 S.Ct. 1347, 1351, 158 L.Ed.2d 64 (2004). \u201cIt is not enough that all the facts necessary to support the federal claim were before the state courts, or that a somewhat similar state-law claim was made.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Harless, </em>459 U.S. 4, 6, 103 S.Ct. 276, 277, 74 L.Ed.2d 3 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">\u201cThe purpose of a motion for judgment of acquittal is to test the legal sufficiency of the evidence presented by the [Sjtate.\u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>954 So.2d 1260, 1261 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007). The Florida Supreme Court has held that there is \u201csufficient evidence to sustain a conviction if, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of fact could find the existence of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Baugh v. State, </em>961 So.2d 198, 204 (Fla.2007). The statutory provisions with respect to a concealed firearm do not apply when an individual possesses the firearm within his own home. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.25(3)(n) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">We may review the merits of a claim in the first instance when a district court improperly finds that a claim is procedurally barred. <em>See Peoples v. Campbell, </em>377 F.3d 1208, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">In reviewing a state court\u2019s decision denying habeas relief, we are prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>from granting habeas relief unless the state decision was (1) \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or (2) \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Moreover, factual findings of state courts are presumed to be correct, and the petitioner can rebut them only by clear and convincing-evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law if either \u201c(1) the state court applied a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by Supreme Court case law, or (2) when faced with materially indistinguishable facts, the state court arrived at a result different from that reached in a Supreme Court case.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1241 (11th Cir.2001). An \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law may occur if the state court \u201cidentifies the correct legal rule from Supreme Court case law but unreasonably applies that rule to the facts of the petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn unreasonable application may also occur if a state court unreasonably extends, or unreasonably declines to extend, a legal principle from Supreme Court case law to a new context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A state court\u2019s summary, unexplained rejection of a constitutional issue qualifies as an adjudication that is entitled to deference. <em>Wright v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>278 F.3d 1245, 1254 (11th Cir.2002). For \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to apply, the state court is required only to reject a claim on the merits, not to provide an explanation. <em>Id. </em>at 1255. A state court decision \u201cthat does not rest on procedural grounds alone is an adjudication on the merits, regardless of the form in which it is expressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The Supreme Court has held that, in an appeal that challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, the \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 318-19, 99 S.Ct. at 2788-89. The Supreme Court noted that it is the duty of the trier of fact \u201cto resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u201d and a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment as to whether it believes the evidence to be sufficient to sustain a conviction. <em>Id. </em>In weighing the sufficiency of the evidence, it is not required that the evidence rule out every hypothesis except that of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Martin v. State of Alabama, </em>730 F.2d 721, 724 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Florida law prohibits an individual from \u201ccanyljng] a concealed firearm on or about his or her person.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.01(2) (1995). A concealed firearm is defined \u201cas any firearm carried on or about a person in such a manner as to conceal the firearm from the ordinary sight of another person.\u201d <em>Dorelus v. State, </em>747 So.2d 368, 370 (Fla.1999) (quoting Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.001(2)). The firearm need not be absolutely invisible. <em>Id. </em>at 370-371.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Here, necessarily underlying the state court decisions was a determination that the evidence was sufficient to uphold a concealment conviction, a standard identical to federal sufficiency review. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court erred in finding this claim procedurally barred. However, the evidence in this case, viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, demonstrates that a rational juror could have found McKinzie guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>cealing a firearm. The state courts did not unreasonably apply <em>Jackson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Because we conclude from the record that McKinzie\u2019s underlying due process claim is without merit, we affirm the denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
