Because Aegis knew of its right to compel arbitration, but made an intentional decision not to compel arbitration in order to take advantage of the judicial forum, and because the plaintiffs incurred costs as a direct result, the district court did not err in concluding that Aegis waived its right to arbitrate. Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   June Newirth, Margaret Pierce, and Barbara Feinberg were residents of three different senior living communities, all operated by Aegis Senior Communities, LLC (Aegis).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each of them (through a representative holding a valid power of attorney) entered into an agreement with Aegis which included an arbitration provision. The provision stated \"that any legal claim or civil action arising out of or relating to care or services provided\" by Aegis \"will be determined by submission to arbitration as provided in accordance with California law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Notwithstanding her arbitration agreement, Newirth filed a class action complaint against Aegis in California state court in April 2016, alleging that Aegis engaged in a scheme to defraud seniors by falsely representing that staffing levels would be determined by the overall needs of the residents, when in fact staffing was based on budget considerations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aegis removed the complaint to district court in July 2016, and filed a motion to compel arbitration as well as a motion to dismiss a week later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Instead of pursuing these motions, however, Aegis and Newirth filed a stipulated agreement a week later. Pursuant to the stipulation, Newirth filed a second amended complaint in August 2016, adding additional plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For its part, Aegis withdrew its motion to compel arbitration and its motion to dismiss. In September 2016, it filed a new motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, in which it made no mention of arbitration or the arbitration agreements. The following day, the parties filed an agreement stating they were attempting mediation of their dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Over the next 11 months, while the second motion to dismiss was pending, the parties actively engaged in the discovery process. The parties participated in a discovery conference, entered into a court-approved stipulation regarding the production of documents and electronic records, and submitted a proposed joint conference report that included a proposed schedule for discovery, class certification briefing and hearing dates, and a date for trial. In December 2016, the parties served their initial disclosures. In the early stages of discovery, Aegis disclosed a copy of the relevant agreements with Newirth, Pierce, and Feinberg; each agreement included an arbitration provision initialed by the party's representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Feinberg and Aegis entered into a settlement agreement later that month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The remaining parties continued to meet and confer regarding moving forward with the discovery process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court finally denied Aegis's pending motion to dismiss Newirth's second amended complaint in May 2017. Aegis filed a new motion to compel arbitration two months later, almost a year after it had withdrawn its initial motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September 2017, the district court denied Aegis's renewed motion to compel arbitration on the ground that Aegis had waived its right to arbitrate.

Park Place Assocs., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237474\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/563/907/#p921\">\n    563 F.3d 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 921 (9th Cir. 2009). In context, such actions do not evince an intentional decision to forgo arbitration in favor of a judicial forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Applying this framework, Newirth carried her burden of showing that Aegis took actions inconsistent with its known right to arbitrate. Although Aegis promptly filed a motion to compel arbitration, Aegis intentionally withdrew the motion and proceeded to take advantage of the federal forum by filing a motion to dismiss Newirth's arbitrable claims, with prejudice, for failure to state a claim. As we have explained, \"[w]hen defendants move for dismissal with prejudice on a key merits issue that would preclude relief as to one or more of plaintiffs' claims ... they are seeking a ruling on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339769\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/1118/#p1125\">\n    829 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1126 n.4. Only after receiving an adverse ruling on this motion did Aegis refile the motion to compel arbitration that it had withdrawn a year earlier. Under the totality of these circumstances, we conclude that Aegis knowingly decided to defer its right to compel arbitration to avail itself of the benefits of the federal court forum, an intentional action inconsistent with its known right to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Aegis makes several arguments to avoid this conclusion. First, it argues that it never expressly waived its right to compel arbitration. But parties to a contract can impliedly waive a right, so long as the parties' actions amount to a knowing relinquishment of that right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Ness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825494\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/862/754/#p756\">\n    862 F.2d at 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Aegis argues that its initial filing of a motion to compel arbitration is evidence that it did not intend to waive the right. But again, Aegis's withdrawal of the motion to compel arbitration and failure to renew it for a year while it sought a determination on the merits provides strong support for Newirth's argument that Aegis intentionally waived its right to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, Aegis argues that it \"engaged in only the minimum amount of litigation activity required ... to comply with its obligations under the applicable court rules and orders, and therefore did not act inconsistently with its right to arbitrate.\" This argument also fails. Aegis could have filed a renewed motion to compel arbitration at any time after withdrawing its initial motion, but waited a year to do so. In\n   the meantime, Aegis sought a judgment on the merits from the district court. Nor did Aegis avail itself of local rules that would have allowed it to seek relief from case management and discovery obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D. Cal. Civil L.R. 16-2(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Aegis argues that the one-year delay in filing its second motion to dismiss was not inconsistent with its arbitration right because the lengthy delay was due to its mistaken belief that Feinberg had not signed an arbitration agreement, and could pursue her claims in court. Rather than defend against the same claims in court and in arbitration proceedings, Aegis asserts, it decided to proceed in court until Feinberg withdrew as a class representative. The record does not support this argument. Aegis provided the plaintiffs with a copy of Feinberg's signed and initialed arbitration agreement in December 2016, more than seven months before renewing its motion to compel arbitration. Moreover, Feinberg settled with Aegis on December 19, 2016, again, more than seven months before Aegis renewed its motion to compel arbitration, and Aegis's renewed motion was filed nearly three months before Feinberg was removed as a class representative. In any event, a decision \"to avoid severance of the arbitrable and non-arbitrable claims\" by proceeding with litigation on all claims may be \"inconsistent with the agreement to arbitrate [the arbitrable] claims\" in some circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Van Ness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1825494\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/862/754/#p756\">\n    862 F.2d at 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Newirth carried her burden of showing that Aegis took actions inconsistent with its known right to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, we consider whether appellees were prejudiced by the inconsistent actions taken by Aegis. A party is not prejudiced by self-inflicted wounds \"incurred as a direct result of suing in federal court contrary to the provisions of an arbitration agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339769\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/1118/#p1125\">\n    829 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1126 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549378\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/791/691/#p694\">\n    791 F.2d at 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When a party agrees to arbitrate disputes, and then breaches that agreement by filing a lawsuit, \"[a]ny extra expense incurred as a result of the [plaintiffs'] deliberate choice of an improper forum, in contravention of their contract, cannot be charged to [the defendant].\"\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549378\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/791/691/#p694\">\n    791 F.2d at 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

She was prejudiced, however, by the costs incurred in defending against Aegis's motion to dismiss her complaint on the merits. Aegis attempted to take advantage of the judicial forum to prevail on the merits of Newirth's arbitrable claims, and did not file a motion to compel arbitration until after receiving an adverse ruling. If the court had granted the motion to compel arbitration, Newirth would have been forced \"to relitigate a key legal issue [on the merits] on which the district court has ruled in [her] favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339769\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/1118/#p1125\">\n    829 F.3d at 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
