Based on the likelihood of success of one of its claims, Planned Parenthood obtained a preliminary injunction, which this court eventually narrowed to an as-applied injunction and which restrained enforcement of the law for almost 12 years. Before a final adjudication of the merits of that claim, however, actions by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a non-party in this case, mooted the dispute. Planned Parenthood sought and was awarded attorneys' fees and costs for the work it did in litigating the preliminary injunction. Defendants Michael Dewine, the Attorney General of Ohio, and Joseph Deters, the Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney and representative of a defendant class of all prosecuting attorneys in Ohio, appeal the district court's fee award. They argue that Planned Parenthood does not properly qualify as a \"prevailing party\" because its relief was narrow, temporary, and preliminary; that the district court erred in refusing to apply a blanket fee reduction based on Planned Parenthood's degree of success; and that the district court erred in applying 2016 rates rather than 2006 rates in calculating the award. We conclude that the district court properly engaged in a contextual, case-specific review and appropriately determined that Planned Parenthood prevailed in this litigation because its relief, albeit preliminary, was based on the merits of its claim, provided a benefit to the plaintiffs, and was sufficiently lasting. Furthermore, the district court properly considered the law and the aims of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and adequately explained its rationale for refusing to apply a blanket fee reduction and for using 2016 rates to calculate the award. We therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In June 2004, the Ohio General Assembly enacted Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2919.123,\n   which regulates the use and prescription of mifepristone (also known as RU-486). Mifepristone is a drug commonly used in conjunction with another drug, misoprostol, to induce abortion in the first trimester without the need for the patient to undergo surgery. In 2000, the FDA approved the use of mifepristone to end a pregnancy based on a dosage protocol that used 600 milligrams of the drug and could be prescribed through 49 days following a woman's last menstrual period (LMP). However, following FDA approval, physicians prescribing mifepristone began relying on a newer, evidence-based protocol that allowed the drug's usage through 63 days post-LMP and prescribed only 200 milligrams of the drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Though physician reliance on evidenced-based, \"off-label\" protocols is standard medical practice and is often protected in certain areas of state law, including in Ohio,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 1751.66(A), with regard to mifepristone, the state saw fit to limit physicians' prescribing options. To that end, the Ohio legislature passed the mifepristone statute, which criminalizes uses of mifepristone not \"in accordance with all provisions of federal law that govern the use of RU-486 (mifepristone) for inducing abortions.\" Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2919.123(A). Further, the statute defines \"federal law\" as including \"any drug approval letter of the food and drug administration of the United States.\" Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2919.123(F)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 2, 2004, slightly over a month before the statute was scheduled to take effect, Planned Parenthood Cincinnati Region, two additional Planned Parenthood clinics, and one other reproductive healthcare provider not affiliated with Planned Parenthood\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   brought suit against the governor of Ohio, the attorney general of Ohio, and a defendant class of the state's prosecuting attorneys in their official capacities. Planned Parenthood challenged the statute pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   on behalf of themselves and their patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Planned Parenthood's complaint alleged four claims: the statute was unconstitutional due to vagueness; it violated individuals' bodily autonomy; it imposed an undue burden on patients' right to abortion; and it violated due process because it lacked an exception to protect the health or life of the woman. With regard to the health-or-life-exception claim, Planned Parenthood argued that certain medical conditions render induced abortion via medication (rather than surgery) safer and thus necessary for particular patients through 63 days post-LMP. Planned Parenthood sought declaratory relief as well as a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction preventing enforcement of the statute. The same day, Planned Parenthood filed a motion and a supporting memorandum of law seeking a preliminary injunction. The state opposed the motions and filed its own motion to dismiss Planned Parenthood's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following a two-day evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the state's motion to dismiss and granted Planned Parenthood's motion for a preliminary injunction on September 22, 2004, the day before the statute was to go into effect. The district court enjoined the statute in full, holding that, due to its lack of a health-or-life exception, the plaintiffs \"ha[d] a substantial likelihood of success on the merits that the [statute] violates the Due Process Clause and is unconstitutional.\"\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood Cincinnati Region v. Taft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182415\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/337/1040/#p1047\">\n    337 F. Supp. 2d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1047 (S.D. Ohio 2004). The district court also found that the equities\n   balanced in Planned Parenthood's favor, largely due to its substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its health-or-life-exception claim. The district court did not address Planned Parenthood's other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 24, 2006, we affirmed the district court's order in part, and on April 13, 2006, we issued an amended decision but still found \"no basis for overturning the district court's determination that [Planned Parenthood] had established a strong likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their claim that the [statute] is unconstitutional because it lacks a health or life exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood Cincinnati Region v. Taft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5321364\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/502/#p518\">\n    444 F.3d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 518 (6th Cir. 2006). However, we affirmed the injunction only \"insofar as it prohibits unconstitutional applications of the [statute]\" and vacated the injunction to the extent that its application was overbroad.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5321364\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/502/#p518\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5321364\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/502/#p518\">\n    at 517-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We then remanded the case for reconsideration of the scope of the injunction in light of legislative intent and Planned Parenthood's other claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5321364\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/502/#p518\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following that ruling, Planned Parenthood filed a consolidated motion in the district court seeking summary judgment on their vagueness claim or, in the alternative, a renewed preliminary injunction of the statute in its entirety based on the plaintiffs' remaining constitutional claims. On September 27, 2006, the district court granted Planned Parenthood's motion and permanently enjoined the statute in its entirety. The state appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 1, 2006, prior to resolution of the state's appeal, Planned Parenthood filed a motion seeking $475,886.77 in attorneys' fees for work done through November 30, 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This total included a ten-percent fee reduction to acknowledge and offset the possibility of duplicated efforts. On February 1, 2007, the state filed a motion to stay the fee-motion proceedings, and the district court granted the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following the district court's stay of Planned Parenthood's attorneys' fees application, litigation continued. In June 2008, we\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   certified two questions to the Supreme Court of Ohio regarding interpretation of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Cincinnati Region v.

We first asked the Court to determine whether the statute \"mandate[s] that physicians in Ohio who perform abortions using mifepristone do so in compliance with the forty-nine-day gestational limit described in the FDA approval letter[.]\" Second, we asked whether the statute \"mandate[s] that physicians in Ohio who perform abortions using mifepristone do so in compliance with the treatment protocols and dosage indications described in the drug's final printed labeling[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869805\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/406/#p412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Strickland I\n   </em>\n   expressly stated that the injunction restraining all enforcement of the statute would remain in place pending the Ohio Supreme Court's review and a further order from the Sixth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869805\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/406/#p412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869805\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/406/#p412\">\n    at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 1, 2009, the Supreme Court of Ohio issued its opinion addressing the certified questions, confirming that the statute requires physicians to adhere to the FDA's drug-approval letter and final printed label. Thus, it required physicians using mifepristone to induce abortion to prescribe a 600 milligram dose and to do so only through 49 days post-LMP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Cordray v.

According to the Ohio Supreme Court, therefore, the statute prohibited all \"off label\" use of mifepristone, including the evidenced-based method that had been allowed before its passage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=911%20N.E.2d%20871\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=911%20N.E.2d%20871\">\n    at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Provided this clarification, we then vacated the district court's September 2006 summary judgment order and permanent injunction-but explicitly stated that the prior\n   <em>\n    preliminary\n   </em>\n   injunction remained in force-and remanded the case once again to the district court for a determination regarding the injunction's scope.\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood Sw.

On February 4, 2011, the district court issued an order clarifying that the statute was enjoined only as it applied to instances where the health or life of the patient was at risk and denying Planned Parenthood's request for broader relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 23, 2011, the district court granted the state's motion for summary judgment on three of Planned Parenthood's claims but denied the state's summary judgment motion as to the health-or-life-exception claim. Almost two years later, Planned Parenthood filed a Second Amended Complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to the single remaining claim. The state moved to dismiss. The district court denied that motion on December 2, 2014, and litigation proceeded until October 2015, when the district court stayed the case pending the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n    136 S.

The updated labeling authorized the evidence-based protocol, allowing a 200 milligram dosage and prescription through 70 days post-LMP, rather than the original 600 milligram dosage and 49-day post-LMP gestational limitation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration, Questions and Answers on Mifeprex, https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/postmarketdrugsafetyinformationforpatientsandproviders/ucm492705.htm (last visited June 3, 2019); Mifepristone Supplemental Approval Letter, https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2016/020687Orig1s020ltr.pdf (last visited June 3, 2019). In light of these updates, the parties agreed to dismiss the case without prejudice. On May 11, 2016, the district court ordered dismissal pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(e) and 41(a). The statutory provision remains in force, requiring physicians to prescribe medication abortion according to the evidence-based protocol, as reflected in the FDA's updated approval letter and labeling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 7, 2016, Planned Parenthood filed a supplementary motion for attorneys' fees, this time encompassing only work done through February 24, 2006. Planned Parenthood asserted that it spent 1,038.97 hours litigating the preliminary injunction. As in their initial fee request, Planned Parenthood included a ten-percent reduction to account for potential duplication of effort. \"Given [the] delay in payment\" following the original 2006 motion, Planned Parenthood requested that these fees be paid at 2016 rates to offset lost interest. Using this rate, the requested fees for the preliminary injunction litigation totaled $372,164.63. In addition, Planned Parenthood requested $10,365.35 to cover costs for the subsequent merits litigation. Thus, Planned Parenthood's total\n   request for costs and fees amounted to $382,529.98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court granted Planned Parenthood's fee request. Despite the state's opposition, the district court found both Planned Parenthood's requested hours and rates reasonable and did not apply a blanket reduction to the fees.

It succeeded on one of these claims, the health-or-life-exception claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, and obtained the injunctive relief it requested. Nothing in our case law requires Planned Parenthood to show that patients relied upon the injunction. Moreover, relative to Planned Parenthood's claim and requested relief, its success was not so narrow as to be miniscule. That Planned Parenthood simultaneously sought to enjoin the statute in full does not undermine the fact that the as-applied injunction addressed the merits of that claim and established protection from state action.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McQueary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707871\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/591/#p604\">\n    614 F.3d at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he injunction bars [the state] from prosecuting [plaintiffs] ... and thus alters the legal relationship between [the parties].\").

But, as the district court ruled, this line of reasoning ignores the fact that for almost 12 years the state was limited by judicial decree-its officers could not enforce the statute against physicians who prescribed mifepristone\n   in accordance with the evidence-based protocol for patients whose health or life was threatened. The state argues that this is not enough because the preliminary injunction does not have any continued effect or benefit, but that is only because the need for the injunction has passed. Before Planned Parenthood's lawsuit, Ohio law prohibited physicians from providing medically-induced abortion in accordance with the most up-to-date research and highest standards of medical care. Now, Ohio law allows it. Importantly, as the state repeatedly notes in its briefing, this effect did not come about due to any voluntary change by the state.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buckhannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/#p605\">\n    532 U.S. at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/#p605\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, FDA policy shifted so that, although the letter of the statute remains the same, its effect has changed significantly. Thus, the preliminary injunction altered the relationship between Planned Parenthood and the state during the concrete period of time that the plaintiffs required the benefit of that alteration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Planned Parenthood \"does not invoke the 'catalyst' theory; [it] did not ultimately lose on the merits; the preliminary injunction ... materially changed the relationship between the parties; and the preliminary injunction turned at least in part on the district court's assessment of the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    McQueary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707871\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/591/#p604\">\n    614 F.3d at 598-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The state contends that Planned Parenthood's award should have been reduced relative to their success\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   this time period.

Moreover, to the extent\n   <em>\n    D.L.S.\n   </em>\n   is at all persuasive here, it merely offers further confirmation that this court should defer to the district court's assessment of the appropriate fee award. The district court in\n   <em>\n    D.L.S.\n   </em>\n   refused to grant the prevailing plaintiff's fee request in full because the plaintiff failed to distinguish between its work on claims it won and its work on failing claims. The district court then, in its discretion, determined the appropriate relief relative to the plaintiff's success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Here, Planned Parenthood limited the time period for which it requested fees, and in doing so accounted for and divided out work done on the claim on which it prevailed-the health-and-life-exception claim-and distinguished it from the hours counsel expended on the remaining unsuccessful claims. To the extent that the state's arguments can be understood to suggest that Planned Parenthood should have divided out and limited its hours further because, during this time, Planned Parenthood also expended work hours on its other claims, they are mistaken.

Their renewed motion reduced that request, however, eliminating hours worked from March 2006 through November 2006. Additionally, Planned Parenthood did not seek fees for the work it did in arguing the appropriate scope of the injunction on remand, or the hours expended in briefing related to the injunction in front of this court for arguments in\n   <em>\n    Strickland II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260101\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/331/387/#p387\">\n    331 F. App'x. at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court's award of $382,529.98, then, effectively applied a 20 percent reduction from Planned Parenthood's initial request-in addition to denying fees for all work done in maintaining the partial preliminary injunction for the next decade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We have found abuse of discretion when a court reduced a fee award but did not explain its reasoning for the selected proportion of the reduction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Binta B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552468\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/608/#p618\">\n    710 F.3d at 639-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding court's \"brief characterization\" of complex consent decree insufficient to explain 20% reduction rather than other potential reduction proportions). Here, the court not only engaged in an in-depth description of Planned Parenthood's success-in deciding\n   the prevailing-party question and again in its fees analysis-but also explained why that success warranted no further fee reduction. It considered the scope of Planned Parenthood's success, explaining that \"the Court cannot conclude that the relief granted was limited in comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole .... [Planned Parenthood] was successful in convincing the Court to enjoin enforcement of the Act to the extent that its application was unconstitutional.\" (internal quotation marks omitted). It further considered the fee reasonable in light of both that success and the 12\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   factors. Finally, the district court provided justification for its decision. There is no evidence that its reasoning suffered from a \"clear error of judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Paschal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11449617\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/297/431/#p434\">\n    297 F.3d at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The state contends that the district court abused its discretion in applying 2016 rates for work completed between 2004 and 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"[T]he district court has the discretion to choose either current or historical rates so long as it explains how the decision comports with the ultimate goals of awarding reasonable fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonter v.

It found that this caselaw supported an adjustment to current rates to account for the delay in payment. Moreover, the district court noted that caselaw acknowledges that this sort of adjustment comports with the underlying purposes of \u00a7 1988.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213071\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/274/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court accounted for the \"significant delay\" in payment between 2006 and 2016, compared to the two-year delay in\n   <em>\n    Gonter\n   </em>\n   . There, in considering work done between 2001 and 2003, we approved the district court's award of a fee adjustment to 2004 rates. The district court in this case considered the decision in\n   <em>\n    Gonter\n   </em>\n   and found that, for Planned Parenthood, \"an adjustment from 2006 rates to 2016 rates [is] eminently reasonable[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, the district court compared the requested rates with those suggested by the rubric laid out by a 1983 committee of attorneys convened by Judge Carl Rubin, which determined reasonable fee rates for Cincinnati attorneys. The district court found that the 2016 rates Planned Parenthood requested were \"consistent with, even slightly lower than\" the recommended rates.

Preliminary relief that provides a lasting benefit to a party based on the substantive merits of at least one of that party's claims suffices to meet the generous standard used to determine prevailing-party status. Planned Parenthood's more-than-decade-long preliminary injunction qualifies as such a lasting benefit. The district court appropriately explained its reasoning for its decision regarding the final fee award and did not abuse its discretion in granting that award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    For ease of reading, the opinion will refer to these plaintiffs collectively as Planned Parenthood, even though the non-affiliated provider is still involved in the litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Planned Parenthood's most recent fees application states that their original motion requested fees for work done through October 18, 2006, but a review of the original motion shows that it also encompassed work done to prepare the fee petition-through November 30, 2006.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The factors identified in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    include: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill required to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of other employment due to acceptance of the case by the attorney; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the \"undesirability\" of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship between the attorney and the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"213570\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/488/714/\">\n     488 F.2d at 717-19\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
