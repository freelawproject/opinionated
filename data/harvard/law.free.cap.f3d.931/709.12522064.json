Varying downwards, the court imposed a 140-month sentence. Floyd did not appeal the conviction or sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In February 2015, Floyd filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to vacate the sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to appeal the original judgment as Floyd directed. Floyd's trial counsel passed away before a scheduled evidentiary hearing on this claim. In February 2018, the district court concluded that an evidentiary hearing without counsel present \"would waste judicial resources,\" granted the \u00a7 2255 motion on the ground that trial counsel \"failed to file a notice of appeal as directed,\" and ordered that Floyd \"be resentenced so as to allow him the opportunity to file a timely notice of appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the May 2018 resentencing, the district court noted that, \"when a defendant has been unconstitutionally deprived of an appellate review due to defense counsel's failure to file an appeal, the prescribed remedy is for the court to vacate the defendant's sentence and then reimpose it, allowing him to appeal the new sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Prado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11474100\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/843/#p845\">\n    204 F.3d 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845 (8th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, the district court declined to consider new objections to the initial Presentence Investigation Report, denied Floyd's request for\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   resentencing, and reimposed the original 140-month sentence, concluding it was appropriate in light of the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) factors considered at the original sentencing hearing. Floyd appeals, arguing the district court abused its discretion by denying his request for\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   resentencing. We conclude that Floyd's appeal waivers control this issue and dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"As a general rule, a defendant is allowed to waive appellate rights,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Andis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9112710\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/886/#p889\">\n    333 F.3d 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 889 (8th Cir. 2003) (en banc), which includes the right to waive \" section 2255 collateral-attack rights.\"\n   <em>\n    DeRoo v.

When reviewing a claim of appeal waiver, \"we must confirm that the [issue raised on] appeal falls within the scope of the waiver and that both the waiver and plea agreement were entered into knowingly and voluntarily. Even\n   when these conditions are met, however, we will not enforce a waiver where to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Andis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9112710\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/886/#p889\">\n    333 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   889-90 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This limited ineffective assistance exception reflected our decision in\n   <em>\n    DeRoo\n   </em>\n   and other cases:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A decision to enter into a plea agreement cannot be knowing and voluntary when the plea agreement itself is the result of advice outside the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. ... A defendant's plea agreement waiver of the right to seek section 2255 post-conviction relief does not waive defendant's right to argue, pursuant to that section, that the decision to enter into the plea was not knowing and voluntary because it was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11242532\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/223/919/#p923\">\n    223 F.3d at 923-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and quotation omitted),\n   <em>\n    cited in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9112710\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/886/#p889\">\n    333 F.3d at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Absent a broader exception, the merits of other ineffective assistance arguments were within the scope of Floyd's \u00a7 2255 waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jemison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165107\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/911/\">\n    237 F.3d 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 916 &amp; n.8 (7th Cir. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the district court and on appeal, Floyd did not contend that his Plea Agreement or the Paragraph 7 appeal waivers were not knowing and voluntary. Thus, his claim that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a notice of appeal fell squarely within the terms of his knowing and voluntary \u00a7 2255 appeal waiver. There is no finding that \"counsel's deficient performance deprive[d Floyd] of an appeal he otherwise would have taken.\"\n   <em>\n    Garza v. Idaho\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623937\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/738/#p747\">\n    139 S. Ct. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 747,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623937\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/738/#p747\">\n    203 L.Ed.2d 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019) (quotation omitted). Any appeal from the district court's failure to conduct\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   resentencing is precluded by his \u00a7 2255 appeal waiver. And there can be no claim that enforcing this waiver against the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   resentencing claim will result in a miscarriage of justice: the direct appeal that counsel failed to file would have been squarely precluded by Floyd's direct appeal waiver, which reserved only the right to appeal from a sentence which exceeded the statutory maximum. For these reasons, the Paragraph 7 appeal waivers foreclose this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In responding to the government's appeal waiver argument on appeal, Floyd argued a different ineffective assistance theory -- \"his attorney failed to object to application of the [Guidelines] career-offender enhancement at sentencing.\" But the \u00a7 2255 appeal waiver forecloses this argument as well. This claim does not allege ineffective assistance that challenges \"the validity of the guilty plea or this waiver.\" And a claim of ineffective assistance alleging that counsel failed to challenge a guidelines enhancement is foreclosed by Paragraph 7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9112710\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/886/#p889\">\n    333 F.3d at 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (allegation that sentencing judge misapplied the Guidelines is subject to a valid appeal waiver if the resulting sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9112710\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/886/#p889\">\n    333 F.3d at 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The Honorable Susan O.
