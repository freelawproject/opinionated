After her husband video-recorded the incident, the state trooper entered the family's home, without consent and without a warrant, and seized several of the family's electronic devices. Hupp, her minor son, and her father-in-law filed suit against the state trooper, asserting various violations of the Fourth Amendment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Buddy has been the source of contention between Myers and his neighbor David Wayne, who lives across the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 9, 2015, the police were called out in response to a dispute earlier that day between the two men over the dog. West Virginia State Troopers Seth Cook and Sean Michael responded to the call. Trooper Cook was there to provide backup to Trooper Michael. Upon their arrival, the troopers spoke with Myers, who was in his front yard drinking a beer. The troopers then went across the street to speak with the Waynes. In speaking with the Waynes, Trooper Cook was told of the \"ongoing problem\" with Myers over Buddy, that Buddy was, in their mind, \"vicious and had killed several of their cats and had chased the children.\" J.A. 302. Trooper Cook was also told that Buddy had chased Wayne's grandmother back into the house and that Wayne's grandfather had to take a stick with him when he checked the mail \"to shoo the dog away.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the time, Myers had another dog, a black Labrador, on a chain in his front yard; Buddy was loose in the yard. According to Myers, Trooper Cook was aware that Buddy was not on a leash. Trooper Cook testified, however, that he did not see Buddy when he first went to speak with Myers. While the troopers spoke with the Waynes, Myers took the Labrador off the chain and placed the chain on Buddy. Myers later explained that it was mere happenstance that he switched the dogs; according to him, it was not because \"the black lab was the friendlier of the two dogs.\" J.A. 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After speaking with the Waynes, the troopers returned to Myers's house. Trooper Michael asked Myers for his identification. Myers asked his daughter, Lindsey, to retrieve it for him. As Lindsey headed back toward the house to retrieve the ID, Trooper Cook followed her into Myers's front yard. Trooper Cook testified that he followed Lindsey \"because of the people gathering in the door [of Myers's home] and just a general, again, situation awareness.\" J.A. 208. At that point, Myers had six of his family members at his house, and Trooper Cook wanted to \"have a little bit of personal contact with them to, again, determine their nature\" and determine if \"there were potential other people that [he] needed to be paying closer attention to.\" J.A. 56, 207-08. Trooper Cook also testified that, due to the slope of Myers's front yard, he wanted to \"get closer to where [he] could see better than from down at the road in the driveway looking up at a position of tactical advantage over [him].\" J.A. 208.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Video evidence captured much, but not all, of what happened next.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A dog barked as Trooper Cook walked into Myers's yard.

According to Trooper Cook, he did not at first notice that Buddy was on a chain. Hupp testified that she ran toward Trooper Cook both in response to Buddy's barks but also in response to the trooper's order to control the dog.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Also not clear from the video is what was said by Trooper Cook and Hupp in their brief encounter. Trooper Cook testified that he told Hupp at least twice to back away and that her response was that he could not tell her what to do on her property. Trooper Cook also maintained that Hupp was \"cursing\" and \"screaming profanities\" at him. J.A. 210, 509. Hupp testified, on the other hand, that she did not hear any of Trooper Cook's orders and simply told him, \"Whoa, whoa, don't do that, stop.\" J.A. 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hupp's husband, Ryan, recorded the incident with his cell phone from inside Myers's home. As Hupp was being arrested, she asked Ryan, \"Did you get that on video?\" J.A. 86. Ryan answered, \"Don't worry, babe. I've got that shit.\" J.A. 244. Trooper Cook later testified that he understood that statement to mean that Ryan \"was glad he had\" the video and \"wouldn't get rid of it for his-his possession of it.\" J.A. 247.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon learning that a video had been recorded, Trooper Cook \"stepped in\" to Myers's home without a warrant and without consent.

She was arraigned, and after the magistrate judge concluded that probable cause existed for her arrest, she was released on bond. Following a jury trial in the Wood County magistrate court, Hupp was acquitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appellants Hupp, Myers, and Hupp's minor son-who witnessed his mother's arrest-filed suit against Trooper Cook, West Virginia State Police Colonel C.R. \"Jay\" Smithers (the superintendent), and the West Virginia State Police. Appellants brought several claims for violation of their constitutional rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and parallel state law claims. Appellants later amended their complaint, bringing claims against the police officers in their individual and official capacities and against the West Virginia State Police. The district court granted in part a motion to dismiss, dismissing the claims against the West Virginia State Police and those brought against the police officers in their official capacities. As a result, claims remained against only Trooper Cook and Colonel Smithers in their individual capacities. The claims against Trooper Cook included section 1983 claims for false arrest, excessive force, malicious prosecution, unlawful search of Myers's house, unlawful seizure of the electronic devices, and unlawful seizure of Buddy; and state law claims for malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress (outrage), and battery. A claim for supervisory liability under section 1983 also remained against Colonel Smithers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Trooper Cook and Colonel Smithers moved for summary judgment on all of the remaining claims, and Appellants moved for partial summary judgment on the false arrest, excessive force, and unlawful search and seizure claims. The district court granted summary judgment to Trooper Cook and Colonel Smithers and denied summary judgment to Appellants. The district court found that Trooper Cook is entitled to qualified immunity on the false arrest, excessive force, and malicious prosecution claims brought under section 1983 as well as on the common law malicious prosecution claim. The district court granted summary judgment to Trooper Cook on the outrage and battery claims as well. Because the court found that Trooper Cook did not violate Hupp's constitutional rights, it granted summary judgment to Colonel Smithers on the one remaining claim of supervisory liability against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court also granted summary judgment to Trooper Cook on the unlawful search and seizure claims. The court concluded that exigent circumstances justified the search of Myers's home and the seizure of the electronic devices because an objectively reasonable officer would have believed that Myers's family members would destroy or conceal the video evidence before a warrant could be obtained. With respect to the claim of unlawful seizure of Buddy, the court found that Trooper Cook's actions did not \"meaningfully interfere[ ]\" with Appellants' \"possessory interest in Buddy.\" J.A. 636.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellants timely appealed the grant of summary judgment on the claims for false arrest, excessive force, malicious prosecution, unlawful entry, and unlawful seizure\n   of the electronic devices. Appellants also appealed the denial of summary judgment in their favor on the Fourth Amendment claims related to the entry of Myers's home and seizure of the electronic devices. Appellants did not appeal the grant of summary judgment on the supervisory liability claim, claim for unlawful seizure of Buddy, or the state law claims of outrage and battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1343(a)(3), and 1367, and we have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, \"applying the same legal standards as the district court, and viewing all facts and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Heyer v.

Trooper Cook maintains that Hupp's obstruction began when she approached him in \"an aggressive manner\" and continued as she failed to comply with his orders and \"met [Trooper Cook's order] with a verbal further noncompliance.\" J.A. 210. First, disputes of fact exist with respect to Hupp's verbal interaction with Trooper Cook. The video evidence shows Hupp running toward Trooper Cook, with her arms to her side and her hands empty, after he pulled a gun on her father-in-law's dog.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   She testified that she said only \"Whoa, whoa, don't do that, stop.\" J.A. 121-22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if Trooper Cook's testimony is to be believed-that Hupp told him that he could not tell her what to do on her property-such language is a challenge to the trooper's authority and does not constitute the type of menacing language found be to obstructionist in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   .

Trooper Cook testified that he gave at least two orders to Hupp to step back, with which she refused to comply. J.A. 570. Specifically, he testified that he told Hupp to \"step back\"; that Hupp responded, \"You can't tell me to f-ing do that\"; that he then told Hupp, \"Ma'am, I'm not asking you; I'm telling you. Step back\"; and that Hupp was \"coming back with her opinions and why she's not going to comply.\" J.A. 215. The defense's expert described\n   <em>\n    three\n   </em>\n   orders for Hupp to step back. J.A. 443.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hupp, on the other hand, testified that her only words to Trooper Cook were, \"Whoa, whoa, don't do that, stop\" and that she \"didn't get a chance to hear\" any of Trooper Cook's orders. J.A. 121-22. Trooper Cook even acknowledged that Hupp had only \"a split\n   second to comply\" with his order before he grabbed her arm. J.A. 604. Clearly, there is a dispute as to whether Hupp refused to comply with Trooper Cook's orders or was even given the opportunity to comply with them before she was arrested mere seconds later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that, rather than defying Trooper Cook's order to step back, Hupp was actually acting to comply with his earlier order to restrain Buddy. Hupp testified in deposition that she approached Trooper Cook and Buddy partly in response to Trooper Cook's undisputed command to \"get control of the dog\" or \"get a hold of your dog.\" J.A. 121, 201, 569-70. Although Trooper Cook testified that Hupp began to obstruct him when she approached him in an \"aggressive manner,\" J.A. 209-10, Trooper Michael testified that Hupp's \"coming down the hill\" toward Trooper Cook and Buddy after Trooper Cook's command to control Buddy \"could be viewed as complying with his request,\" J.A. 316.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On this disputed evidence, we cannot conclude that a reasonable officer in Trooper Cook's position would have believed that probable cause existed for Hupp's arrest. With the facts viewed in the light most favorable to Hupp, the record shows that she ran to Trooper Cook to comply with his order to have Buddy controlled. Her arms were down at her side and her hands visibly empty. She told Trooper Cook to stop but did not curse at him. Yet a mere second or two later, before she heard any order to move, Trooper Cook grabbed her arm and flung her to the ground. Such facts do not reasonably support a charge of obstruction under West Virginia law. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of summary judgment on the false arrest claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   2.

We first dispense with Hupp's argument that because she was unlawfully arrested, the use of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   force was necessarily unconstitutional. Certainly, we may consider any lack of probable cause for the arrest as we evaluate the reasonableness of the force used. But we consider the crime that is alleged to have been committed in connection with our overall analysis of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the circumstances surrounding the use of force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    490 U.S. at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9346450\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/520/#p527\">\n    325 F.3d at 528-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the lack of any crime committed by plaintiff weighed heavily in favor of plaintiff's excessive force claim but nonetheless evaluating remaining\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, we do not make any determination as to whether Hupp's arrest was actually unlawful. Our finding that Trooper Cook is not entitled to qualified immunity on the false arrest claim at this stage of litigation does not preclude a finding at a later stage that he lawfully arrested Hupp; a trier of fact could resolve the factual disputes that currently exist in Trooper Cook's favor. Therefore, we cannot agree with Hupp that our evaluation of the grant of qualified immunity on the excessive force claim turns entirely on any lack of probable cause for her arrest. Instead, we evaluate the totality of the circumstances surrounding the use of force against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In evaluating those circumstances, we note that the extent of Hupp's injuries is slight. The complaint alleges that Hupp suffered emotional trauma, including anxiety and an inability to sleep, as well as physical injuries. According to her medical records, Hupp suffered from middle and lower back pain and was diagnosed with a contusion and lumbosacral strain two days after the incident with Trooper Cook. J.A. 543-44.

Other factors call into question the reasonableness of the use of force against Hupp. First, the severity of the crime for which she was arrested is slight: obstruction is a misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2061-5-17\">\n    W.

The district court found that this factor weighed in favor of qualified immunity, as Hupp positioned herself between Trooper Cook and Buddy, \"which could reasonably be construed as hindering Cook's ability to protect himself.\" J.A. 620. A review of the record, however, suggests otherwise. Hupp is a slender, short, 113-pound female. Trooper Cook, on the other hand, weighs 200 pounds, is a trained police officer, and had undergone training in how to identify and handle aggressive dogs months before Hupp's arrest. Trooper Cook was armed, had his gun drawn, and the video shows that Hupp approached him with her arms down and hands visibly empty. Hupp stood perpendicular to Trooper Cook, did not place herself directly in front of him or his drawn gun, and it was only after Trooper Cook grabbed her arm that she moved in front of his weapon. In light of these facts, we cannot agree with the district court that, as a matter of law, Hupp posed a sufficient threat to tip the scale in Trooper Cook's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076070\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/95/#p100\">\n    781 F.3d at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that second\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor weighed in favor of section 1983 plaintiff where plaintiff was a \"smaller woman,\" officer was \"a pretty good size man\" as a \"200-something-pound man,\" and officer had no reason to believe that the plaintiff was armed);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rowland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7407916\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/41/167/#p174\">\n    41 F.3d at 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding \"no threat to the officer or anyone else\" where plaintiff was not armed, officer did not suspect plaintiff was armed, and there was no \"real evidence that this relatively passive, retarded man was a danger to the larger, trained police officer\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Third, there is disputed evidence of Hupp's resistance to arrest. The video depicts a brief struggle between Hupp and Trooper Cook lasting mere seconds after he grabbed her arm and before she fell to the ground. Trooper Cook grabbed Hupp's arm mere seconds after she approached him and, according to Hupp, before she had the opportunity to hear any order that he may have given for her to move. She testified that her reaction after having her arm seized was to try to put her arms up in surrender. J.A. 123. We have held that a reasonable officer could not believe that the \"initial act of pulling [one's] arm away\" when an officer grabs a person \"without warning or explanation\" justifies the officer's decision to throw the person to the ground.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076070\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/95/#p100\">\n    781 F.3d at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Trooper Cook, on the other hand, testified that Hupp took a \"fighting stance\" with him and that he \"stiff armed\" her in order to holster his weapon.

J.A. 624.

Thus, where a police officer takes certain steps, such as first conferring with a prosecutor about moving forward with a criminal prosecution, and a magistrate judge later affirms the officer's determination that probable cause exists for the prosecution, those steps weigh in favor of a finding of qualified immunity. They do not end the qualified immunity inquiry, however, as they \"need only appropriately be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of [the officer's] actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20582\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

Specifically, Hupp asserts that the criminal complaint falsely stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that she\n   refused to comply with Trooper Cook's orders to \"step aside,\" began cursing at him, \"raised her hands towards\" him before he grabbed her arm, and then grabbed at him and \"began cursing\" after he grabbed her arm. J.A. 509; Opening Br. 18, 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We agree with Hupp that the district court's finding of qualified immunity on this claim was in error. As we have explained, disputes of fact preclude a finding at this stage that a reasonable officer would have believed that probable cause existed for Hupp's arrest. Those disputes relate to many of the facts set forth in the criminal complaint on which the magistrate relied. For example, there is a dispute as to whether Hupp refused to comply with Trooper Cook's orders for her to move or whether she was instead attempting to obey his order to control Buddy. There is also a dispute as to whether Hupp was cursing at Trooper Cook. Moreover, contrary to Trooper Cook's statement in the criminal complaint, the video clearly depicts Hupp's hands down at her side during the entirety of the few seconds before Trooper Cook grabbed her arm. It was only after he grabbed her arm that she struggled, very briefly, with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   If we excise the contested statements from the criminal complaint, the additional facts available to the magistrate do not, as the district court found, provide \"ample evidence\" for a probable-cause determination. J.A. 624. The district court emphasized the fact that Hupp \"stepped in between the dog and the undersigned officer,\" which, according to the district court, showed that Hupp stepped in between Buddy and Trooper Cook as Trooper Cook was attempting to protect himself from the dog. J.A. 509, 624. However, in the criminal complaint, Trooper Cook also clearly stated that Buddy had \"reached the end of the tether\" and could not \"reach\" Trooper Cook. J.A. 509. Contrary to showing that Hupp interfered with Trooper Cook's ability to protect himself from Buddy, the complaint established that Trooper Cook knew Buddy was no longer a danger to him. No other basis for Hupp's alleged obstruction of Trooper Cook is identified in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Given the disputes of the underlying historical facts, the supported assertion that Trooper Cook's statements in the criminal complaint were not entirely truthful, and the lack of undisputed evidence that otherwise would support a probable-cause finding, we cannot find that Trooper Cook is entitled to qualified immunity on Hupp's malicious prosecution claim under section 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   4.

Trooper Cook counters that there is evidence that Ryan intended to destroy or at least conceal the video from the police before a warrant could issue. According to Trooper Cook, Ryan was \"glad to have\" the video only\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   he realized that Trooper Cook wanted it. Resp. Br. 39 n.150. Trooper Cook points to evidence that after he entered the house and asked about the video, Ryan told him, \"Don't worry. I deleted it. It was on this phone.\" J.A. 258. Additionally, another of Ryan's family members, Dalton, is heard on the video telling Ryan not to let the troopers know that Ryan was recording them. Thus, Trooper Cook asserts, it was reasonable for him to believe that if he did not enter and seize the devices at that time, the evidence would be destroyed or concealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The evidence highlighted by Trooper Cook, however, is irrelevant to the exigency analysis. This is because the \"existence of exigent circumstances must be determined as of the moment of the warrantless entry of the officers onto the premises.\"\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538299\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/935/641/#p643\">\n    935 F.2d at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ryan's comments to Trooper Cook about deleting the video footage were made only after Trooper Cook had entered Myers's home and seized three of the electronic devices. According to Trooper Cook's own testimony, he stepped across the threshold into the home, asked Myers's family members that were in the house about the location of the video, received no response, began to seize electronic devices within sight, and only then did Ryan \"step[ ] forward from back up the hallway\" and tell Trooper\n   Cook that he had deleted the video from his cell phone. J.A. 258-59. Similarly, Dalton's comments heard in the video were not made in Trooper Cook's presence; an officer would have heard those comments only after seizing the cell phone and watching the video. Thus, before Trooper Cook entered the home and began seizing the devices, his admitted understanding was that Ryan was happy to have the video footage and would not want to destroy it. Of course, we must determine whether a reasonable person in Trooper Cook's position would have believed that Ryan intended to destroy the video. On the facts presented to us, we see no reason to believe that an objective officer would have believed any differently than Trooper Cook did-that Ryan had recorded his wife's arrest, was happy about having recorded it, and would not want to delete that recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Trooper Cook's subjective understanding, however, is not the determinative factor. Rather, we must determine whether a reasonable officer in Trooper Cook's position would have believed that Ryan-or another of Hupp's family members present at the time-was likely to destroy or conceal the video.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10538299\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/935/641/#p643\">\n    935 F.2d at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the information available to an officer in Trooper Cook's position at the moment that he entered Myers's home, we cannot say as a matter of law that no reasonable officer would have believed that the video would be preserved while the troopers obtained a warrant. Having heard Ryan yell to his wife not to worry because he recorded her interaction with Trooper Cook, a reasonable officer could conclude, like Trooper Cook initially did, that Ryan was glad to have the video and would not destroy it. On the other hand, Hupp was believed to have committed a crime; the video documenting that crime was recorded by Hupp's husband; and a reasonable officer could have believed that, as Hupp's husband, Ryan would conceal or destroy the video evidence of her crime before handing it over to the police. We are thus hesitant to find that, as a matter of law, Trooper Cook unreasonably believed that the video was likely to be concealed before a warrant could issue. Instead, the question of whether such a belief was reasonable under the circumstances known to the officers at the time of Trooper Cook's entry into Myers's home must be submitted to a factfinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Turning to the other exigency factors, we note that there is no evidence regarding the time needed to secure a warrant. The record suggests, though, that there was little to no possibility of danger to the troopers if they stood guard while a warrant was secured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1240014\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/650/526/#p528\">\n    650 F.2d at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Trooper Cook testified that when he first approached Myers's house, he saw Hupp and Lindsey with a \"pistol crossbow\" but saw no arrows and believed that Hupp and Lindsey \"were playing with something with [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] the creek\" next to the house. J.A. 565-66. Trooper Cook did nothing to secure the crossbow and apparently did not consider it a threat; in fact, there is evidence that the crossbow was a broken plastic toy that belonged to Hupp's three-year-old son. J.A. 85, 128, 141. Buddy, the dog believed to be vicious, was tethered at the time of Hupp's arrest. And although the two troopers were outnumbered by Myers's family members, one of those family members was a toddler, another was pregnant, and there is no evidence that any of them were armed. Therefore, there does not appear to have been any danger to the troopers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yengel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803370\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/392/#p396\">\n    711 F.3d at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no exigency when officer was informed that there was a grenade in house but other information available to officer indicated \"stable nature of the threat\");\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That fact, coupled with the minor crime for which Hupp was arrested, suggest that the level of urgency to obtain the video was not high.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Welsh v.

Therefore, we decline Appellants' invitation to find that Trooper Cook's entry into Myers's home and his seizure of the electronic devices were unreasonable as a matter of law. Instead, we remand for a trial to determine whether Trooper Cook's actions were reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We also take a moment to address Trooper Cook's view of the exigency exception to the warrant requirement. In an era in which cell phones are increasingly used to capture much of what happens in daily life, it is important to emphasize the limitations that the Fourth Amendment continues to place on a state's seizure of video evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Trooper Cook testified that his regular practice is to seize any video recording that he believes to contain evidence of a crime he is investigating. J.A. 237-39. But the exigent-circumstances exception does not permit police officers to do what Trooper Cook routinely does: seize video evidence without a warrant even when there is no reason to believe that the evidence will likely be destroyed or concealed. Such a rule would allow officers to seize as a matter of course video-recording devices from not just those involved in an incident, but also from neighbors and other curious bystanders who happen to record the events as they transpire. Under this view, police officers would lawfully be permitted to enter the home of every person living nearby who stands in her doorway or window recording an arrest, to seize her recording device, and to do so without a warrant or her consent-simply because video evidence, by its nature, can be easily deleted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Such a view finds no support in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. While video evidence contained in a cell phone can be easily deleted or concealed, it is not merely the ease with which evidence may be destroyed or concealed that dictates exigency. An officer must also have reason to believe that the evidence will be destroyed or concealed. In short, adopting the broad definition of exigency urged by\n   Trooper Cook would remove the exigent-circumstances exception to the warrant requirement from the class of \"narrow and well-delineated\" exceptions permissible under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Yengel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803370\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/392/#p396\">\n    711 F.3d at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It would convert exigency from an exception to the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Trooper Cook on the false arrest, excessive force, malicious prosecution, and unlawful entry and seizure claims. We also hold that the district court properly denied Appellants summary judgment on the unlawful entry and seizure-of-devices claims. Accordingly, the district court's order denying Appellants' partial summary judgment motion on the search and seizure claims is affirmed and its order granting summary judgment to Trooper Cook is reversed. This matter is remanded to the district court for trial on each of Appellants' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Myers maintained that Buddy had never harmed a person and simply chased squirrels.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    To the extent the video depicts material facts of this case, we review those facts as they are depicted in the video.\n    <em>\n     Scott v.

Appellants argue that the expert testimony establishes the unreasonableness of Trooper Cook's actions in the way in which he approached Buddy and drew his gun. According to Appellants, the district court's failure to engage with any of their proffered expert testimony constitutes reversible error in itself. As we have explained, the district court's grant of qualified immunity on the false arrest claim is reversed for reasons other than the court's failure to engage with the expert evidence. That being said, we note that the district court did not address the expert testimony in its evaluation of the summary judgment motions. We expect that upon remand, the expert testimony presented by the parties will be appropriately addressed, including any objections to the admissibility of that testimony.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Hupp's alleged grabbing of Trooper Cook is not captured in the video because she allegedly did so when his back was turned to the camera and blocking the camera's view of Hupp.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Because we cannot say as a matter of law that an officer in Trooper Cook's position would reasonably have believed that the video evidence would be concealed or destroyed before a warrant for the video's seizure could be obtained, Trooper Cook is not entitled to qualified immunity on the search and seizure claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076070\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/95/#p100\">\n     781 F.3d at 100\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
