The court denied McIlwain's request pursuant to its \"policy\" of \"always treat[ing]\" the recommendations \"as confidential.\" 11/30/18 Sent'g Tr. 3 (App. 58). Rule 32(e)(3), however,\n   requires a district court to exercise discretion in deciding whether to withhold the recommendation. Because that discretion must be based on case-specific reasoning rather than on a uniform policy, we vacate McIlwain's sentence and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2017, the Federal Bureau of Prisons released Jerry McIlwain from detention in Cumberland, Maryland and directed him to report to Hope Village, a halfway house in Washington, D.C., to serve the remaining ten months of his sentence. McIlwain never reported to the halfway house, and the Bureau placed him on escape status. About a year later, a federal grand jury indicted McIlwain for escape, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20751\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). A magistrate judge issued a warrant for his arrest, and U.S. Marshals took him into custody soon thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   McIlwain pled guilty on October 3, 2018. In exchange for his plea, the government agreed to ask for a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range -- eight months -- and to allow McIlwain to argue for a sentence of time served. McIlwain filed a sentencing memorandum requesting time served -- about four months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 27, McIlwain filed an unopposed motion asking the district judge to order the probation officer to disclose the sentencing recommendation, pursuant to Rule 32(e)(3). The rule states that, \"[b]y local rule or by order in a case, the court may direct the probation officer not to disclose to anyone other than the court the officer's recommendation on the sentence.\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(e)(3). McIlwain noted that \"[t]here is no such local rule in this district, nor has the court directed that the sentence recommendation not be disclosed.\" Motion for Disclosure of Sent'g Rec. 1 (App. 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   McIlwain also pointed out that not merely was his motion unopposed, but both the U.S. Attorney's Office and the U.S. Probation Office supported (and still support) the disclosure of sentencing recommendations as a matter of course.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20751\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20751\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 35-36);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Letter from Federal Public Defender A.J.

After acknowledging that he had discretion in the matter, the judge explained his decision as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Sentencing has become too complicated and the guidelines have become too complicated[,] ... and I find ... [the] experienced probation officers['] ... recommendations ... very helpful .... I have been concerned and remain concerned that the candor of those recommendations would be affected by their disclosing them and having to answer for them to outside counsel. And because they're officers of the court, I have always treated them as confidential and have always exercised my discretion to maintain their confidentiality and do not disclose them ... , and so I have always maintained that policy myself and I have interpreted the rule to not require a judge to require ... disclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20751\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20751\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 58). The judge then concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I don't think, in any particular individual case, [disclosure] would necessarily have any great effect, but the cumulative effect of the different relationship that I would have in particular with the probation officers and the candor of their recommendations and their ability to assist the Court in the sentencing process, I have consistently thought, would be greatly affected, and so I will deny the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 3-4 (App. 58-59). Thereafter, the judge rejected McIlwain's request for time served and instead sentenced him to eight months, as the government had requested.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20751\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20751\">\n    at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   McIlwain now appeals, raising a single argument: \"The district court improperly refused to disclose the sentencing recommendation.\" McIlwain Br. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Rule 32(e)(3) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   By\n   <em>\n    local rule\n   </em>\n   or by\n   <em>\n    order in a case\n   </em>\n   , the court may direct the probation officer not to disclose to anyone other than the court the officer's recommendation on the sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(e)(3) (emphasis added). The notes of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules make clear that the rule's inverse is also true: If the court does not direct nondisclosure \"in an individual case or in accordance with a local rule,\" then \"the recommendation ... is subject to disclosure.\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 32, advisory committee note to 1994 amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the default position -- in the absence of a local rule or order in a case -- is disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Br. 8 (agreeing \"that the default position of Rule 32(e)(3) is that the recommendation must be disclosed\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   That has not always been so. The rule governing presentence investigations was originally adopted in 1944 and, by 1966, provided that \"[t]he court before imposing sentence may disclose to the defendant or his counsel all or part of the material contained in the report of the presentence investigation.\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(c)(2) (1966). The 1966 rule did not specifically mention the sentencing recommendation at all, and it left the decision whether to disclose the presentence report up to the district court. Both of those things remained true until the 1974 amendment, when the rule was changed to require that the district court \"\n   <em>\n    shall upon request\n   </em>\n   permit the defendant ... to read the report of the presentence investigation\n   <em>\n    exclusive of any recommendation\n   </em>\n   as to sentence.\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(c)(3) (1975) (emphasis added). In 1983, the requirement that the defendant request the report was removed, making disclosure of the report automatic. FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(c)(3)(A) (1983). Left in place, however, was the bar against disclosing the recommendation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20751\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, in 1994, the essence of the current rule was adopted: \"Not less than 35 days before the sentencing hearing ... the probation officer must furnish the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant's counsel, and the attorney for the Government. The court may, by local rule or in individual cases, direct that the probation officer not disclose the probation officer's recommendation, if any, on the sentence.\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(b)(6)(A) (1994). In 2002, the text of that provision was changed, solely for stylistic purposes, and the provision was renumbered as\n   Rule 32(e)(2) and (3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CRIM. P. 32, advisory committee note to 2002 amendment. The current text of the second sentence just quoted now reads: \"By local rule or by order in a case, the court may direct the probation officer not to disclose to anyone other than the court the officer's recommendation on the sentence.\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(e)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As this history shows, the defaults for both the report and the recommendation have evolved over time. Disclosure of the report was formerly optional, and disclosure of the recommendation was prohibited. Now, disclosure of the report is mandatory, as is disclosure of the recommendation -- absent a \"local rule\" or \"order in a case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The question before us, therefore, is whether a \"local rule\" or \"order in a case\" properly barred disclosure here. The answer to the \"local rule\" part of the question is easy. That term does not refer to a rule governing proceedings before a single judge (often referred to in this district as a \"standing order\"). Rather, it refers to a rule, adopted by a majority of the judges of the relevant district court, that governs proceedings before every judge of that court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CRIM. P. 57(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has not adopted any local rule regarding disclosure of a probation officer's sentencing recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell to Federal Public Defender A.J. Kramer (Sept. 20, 2017) (App. 38). Thus, as the government acknowledges, the district judge did not deny McIlwain's motion for disclosure (or direct nondisclosure) pursuant to the \"local rule\" provision. Gov't Br. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As both parties agree, however, the judge here did issue an \"order in a case\" -- namely, McIlwain's case -- that effectively directed the probation officer not to disclose the sentencing recommendation. Gov't Br. 12; Oral Arg. Tr. 5:17-21 (McIlwain's counsel);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   11/30/18 Sent'g Tr. 4 (App. 59); Minute Order (11/30/18). The order, which denied McIlwain's motion for disclosure, had that effect because everyone concerned understood the judge's position to be that the probation officer could not disclose the officer's recommendation without an affirmative order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11/30/18 Sent'g Tr. 2 (App. 57); McIlwain Br. 4-5, 12. We therefore turn to McIlwain's contention that the nondisclosure order was improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Once again, Rule 32(e)(3) provides that, \"[b]y order in a case, the court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   direct the probation officer not to disclose ... the officer's recommendation on the sentence.\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(e)(3) (emphasis added). \"The word 'may' clearly connotes discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597516\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1923/#p1931\">\n    136 S.

And the 1994 Advisory Committee notes confirm this reading: \"Under th[e] new provision ... , the court has the\n   <em>\n    discretion\n   </em>\n   (in an individual case or in accordance with a local rule) to direct the probation officer to withhold any final recommendation.\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 32, advisory committee note to 1994 amendment (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because the rule grants the district court discretion, it follows that we review the court's order for abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This conforms with how we treat other federal rules providing that a district court \"may\" do something: We have held that such rules authorize discretion and are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both parties to this appeal agree that this is the standard of review applicable to the district court's order here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McIlwain Reply Br. 2, 4; Gov't Br. vi, 7-8; Oral Arg. Tr. 17:18-20 (government counsel).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But before we can assess whether the district court abused its discretion, we must determine what discretion under Rule 32(e)(3) entails. That question -- the meaning of a federal rule itself -- is one we decide de novo.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gewin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560628,5251118\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/471/197/\">\n    471 F.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\"A district court's interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is a question of law, which we review de novo.\");\n   <em>\n    Handy v. Shaw, Bransford, Veilleux &amp; Roth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5871981,9345286\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/346/\">\n    325 F.3d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 349 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (\"Whether the lower court applied the proper legal standard in exercising [its] discretion ... is a question of law reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We turn first to the scope of a district court's discretion under the rule. We then address the manner in which McIlwain's sentencing court exercised that discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To determine the scope of the court's discretion, we begin with the text of the current rule, which (as relevant here) authorizes an individual judge to direct nondisclosure \"by order in a case.\" The best reading of that language is that the order must be based on something particular about the \"case\" at issue -- as distinct from an order governing all cases coming before an individual judge. Had the drafters intended Rule 32 to authorize that latter kind of order, they could easily have said so. They could have accomplished that end either by simply leaving \"in a case\" out of the provision or by providing for nondisclosure pursuant to a judge's standing order -- just as they expressly authorized each federal district to adopt a nondisclosure policy by \"local rule,\" applicable to every judge and every case in the district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This reading is confirmed by examining the text of the rule as it stood in 1994. As recounted in Part II above, that version of the rule stated: \"The court may, by local rule or\n   <em>\n    in individual cases\n   </em>\n   , direct that the probation officer not disclose the probation officer's recommendation ....\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(b)(6)(A) (1994) (emphasis added). The reference to \"in individual cases,\" even more strongly than the current text's reference to \"in a case,\" indicates that the drafters did not intend to authorize the use of a standing order applicable to all of a judge's cases. And the Advisory Committee notes make clear that the 2002 amendment that produced the current text was not intended to change the meaning of the 1994 rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This reading is further confirmed by the 1994 Advisory Committee notes, which expressly state that, \"[u]nder th[is] provision ... , the court has the\n   <em>\n    discretion\n   </em>\n   (in an\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   case or in accordance with a local rule) to direct the probation officer to withhold any final recommendation.\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 32, advisory committee note to 1994 amendment (emphasis added). To exercise \"discretion\" in an \"individual\" case, there must be something about that individual case that warrants the exercise of discretion. Accordingly, a policy of always barring disclosure -- regardless of an \"individual\" case's circumstances -- does not constitute the exercise of discretion authorized by Rule 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This reading likewise fits with how the Supreme Court defines discretion. \"[D]iscretion,\" the Court has explained, entails a duty \"to locate a just result in light of the circumstances peculiar to the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9485\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/405/#p421\">\n    422 U.S. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 421,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9485\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/405/#p421\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9485\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/405/#p421\">\n    45 L.Ed.2d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted). And it also fits with the Court's definition of what discretion is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   : \"The term 'discretion' denotes the absence of a hard and fast rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Langnes v. Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6932733\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/282/531/#p541\">\n    282 U.S. 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6932733\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/282/531/#p541\">\n    51 S.Ct. 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6932733\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/282/531/#p541\">\n    75 L.Ed. 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1931).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, our reading is compelled by this circuit's repeated holdings regarding an analogous provision of an earlier version of Rule 32 that governed permissive disclosure of presentence reports. As we also recounted in Part II, by 1966 the rule's language with respect to the presentence report closely resembled its current language regarding the probation officer's recommendation. It stated: \"The court before imposing sentence\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   disclose to the defendant or his counsel all or part of the material contained in the report of the presentence investigation ....\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(c)(2) (1966) (emphasis added). Thereafter, we consistently interpreted this conferral of discretion to require that district judges rely on case-specific reasons when denying disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Queen\n   </em>\n   , for example, the district court had \"refused disclosure of the presentence report pursuant to [its] general policy of non-disclosure, and without any reference to the need for disclosure or confidentiality in the circumstances of this particular case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2216674\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/435/66/\">\n    435 F.2d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1970). We held, to the contrary, that \"the discretion called for by Rule 32 is the exercise of discretion in individual cases, not the discretion of the trial judge to adopt a uniform policy of nondisclosure in all cases irrespective of circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2216674\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/435/66/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2216674\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/435/66/\">\n    at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It further agrees that nondisclosure requires \"case-specific reason[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:1-9. It insists, however, that the district court found such case-specific reasons here. As to this last point, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At sentencing, the district court made clear that it was denying disclosure based on its own, blanket nondisclosure policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [B]ecause they're officers of the court, I have\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   treated [the officers' recommendations] as confidential and have\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   exercised my discretion to maintain their confidentiality and do not disclose them ... , and so\n   <em>\n    I have always maintained that policy\n   </em>\n   myself and I have interpreted the rule to not require a judge to require ... disclosure.\n   <em>\n    So the motion for disclosure of their recommendation is denied\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   11/30/18 Sent'g Tr. 3 (App. 58) (emphasis added).

To bar disclosure \"always,\" \"consistently,\" and pursuant to a \"policy\" is to contravene\n   <em>\n    Queen\n   </em>\n   's holding -- applicable to the current version of Rule 32 as well -- that \"the discretion called for by Rule 32 is the exercise of discretion in individual cases, not the discretion of the trial judge to adopt a uniform policy of non-disclosure in all cases irrespective of circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2216674\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/435/66/\">\n    435 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   67 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"769568\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/442/775/#p776\">\n    442 F.2d at 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Notwithstanding the transcript quoted above, the government maintains that the district court did rely on a case-specific reason. This is the government's argument: \"The district court's conclusion that nondisclosure was necessary in McIlwain's particular case to avoid the 'cumulative effect' of repeat disclosures [on the probation officers' candor] constituted an adequate 'specific reason[ ] for its denial in this case.' \" Gov't Br. 16 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"769568\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/442/775/#p776\">\n    442 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   776 ). But the court made clear that, in its view, nondisclosure was required in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   case, regardless of any\n   case's particular facts, in order to prevent such a cumulative effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11/30/18 Sent'g Tr. 3 (App. 58) (\"I don't think ... any particular individual case ... would necessarily have any great effect, but the cumulative effect of the different relationship that I would have ... would be greatly affected ....\"). And the government acknowledges that the court's prevention-of-cumulative-effect rationale would in fact apply in every case: \"It's a case-specific reason,\" the government says, \"that would apply in all cases.\" Oral Arg. Tr. 19:9-10;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:9-11 (government counsel's acknowledgment that the judge \"didn't point to anything particular about McIlwain's case that made it different from other cases\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But a reason that applies in every case is not a case-specific reason. It is a uniform policy. And Rule 32 does not authorize an individual judge to issue a nondisclosure order on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   None of this is to say that the district court's policy is unreasonable. The court defended its decision on the ground that \"sentencing has become too complicated\" for \"law clerks ... to keep up with,\" and that the views of \"experienced probation officers\" are therefore \"very helpful to the Court.\" 11/30/18 Sent'g Tr. 3 (App. 58). The court feared that \"the candor of [the officers'] recommendations would be affected by their disclosing them and having to answer for them to outside counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The court's concerns are the same as those that animated the pre-1994 version of Rule 32, which required the district court to disclose the presentence report but barred disclosure of \"any recommendation as to sentence,\" FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(c)(3)(A) (1974).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

R. CRIM. P. 32, advisory committee note to 1974 amendment)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The opposing position is also reasonable. Both the probation office and the U.S. Attorney's Office support disclosure. The probation office believes that routine disclosure of the recommendation has the potential to \"strengthen[ ] the perception of the probation office's independent role in the sentencing process.\" 2017 Shaffer Letter (App. 40).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The U.S. Attorney's Office likewise \"agree[s] that it's good policy for judges to disclose the probation officer's recommended sentences,\" Oral Arg. Tr. 17:13-15, both because \"an individual who faces incarceration should be apprised of any sentencing recommendation which may be considered by the court,\" and because routine disclosure may benefit the government as well, 1995 Holder Letter (App. 50). And as for McIlwain, he adds the concern that an undisclosed recommendation could contain factual misinformation or legal mistakes that the defendant would be unable to rebut before sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McIlwain Reply Br. 6-7; Letter from Federal Public Defender A.J. Kramer to Chief Judge Richard W. Roberts (July 21, 2014) (App. 47) (citing instances in which sentencing recommendations contained incorrect information not included in the presentence reports).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This policy debate, however, is beside the point. As both parties agree, the 1994 amendment \"change[d]\" the former\n   rule, adopting instead a default rule of disclosure. Gov't Br. 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   McIlwain Br. 11-12. An individual district judge can override that default rule only by exercising case-specific discretion, not by following a blanket policy of nondisclosure -- regardless of the reasonableness of the concerns that underlie that policy. By resting its decision on a blanket policy, rather than the facts of McIlwain's individual case, the district court acted outside of the discretion conferred by Rule 32.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Although the district court erred in denying McIlwain's motion on the basis of a blanket policy, we must nonetheless affirm the court's judgment if that error was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED.

Discretion under [then-]Rule 32(c)(2) must be exercised on a case-by-case basis, not by a blanket policy of non-disclosure.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"261949\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/470/285/#p287\">\n     470 F.2d 285\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 287-88 (2d Cir. 1972) (citing\n    <em>\n     Bryant\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"769568\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/442/775/#p776\">\n     442 F.2d 775\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , as well as cases from the Seventh and Eighth Circuits).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The probation office also reported that it has found \"no evidence to support the position that probation officer safety is compromised from routine disclosure\" of the recommendation. 2017 Shaffer Letter (App. 39).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    In addition to arguing that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant his motion for disclosure, McIlwain argues that Rule 32 requires the probation officer to disclose the sentencing recommendation automatically, without a motion by the defendant.
