Rema sued National Counseling Group, Inc. (\"NCG\"), alleging two claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\") (codified primarily in Title 29 of the United States Code).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dawson-Murdock v.

Jan. 26, 2018), ECF No. 1 (the \"Complaint\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   More specifically, the Complaint alleges that NCG contravened ERISA by breaching its fiduciary duties in the administration of a group life insurance plan in which Rema's late husband had enrolled and for which NCG is the \"named fiduciary.\" The district court dismissed Rema's ERISA claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), concluding that NCG's relevant actions were not taken in a fiduciary capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dawson-Murdock v.

As part of the benefits package that it offers to employees, NCG provides its workers the opportunity to enroll in a group life insurance plan (the \"Plan\"). The insurer for the Plan is Unum Life Insurance Company of America (\"Unum\"). The documents that constitute the Plan are the Summary of Benefits and the Summary Plan Description (the \"SPD\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Summary of Benefits explains that an NCG employee who desires to enroll in the Plan must pay a premium to NCG, which in turn sends the premium payment to Unum. In addition to transmitting premiums, NCG is obliged to \"regular[ly]\" provide Unum with information about employees \"who are eligible to become insured; whose amounts of coverage change; and[ ] whose coverage ends.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The SPD specifies that, for the purposes of ERISA, NCG \"is the [p]lan [a]dministrator and\n   <em>\n    named fiduciary\n   </em>\n   of the Plan,\" and that benefits under the Plan are \"administered\" by Unum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 65 (emphasis added). The SPD also explains that \"ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the ... [P]lan,\" and that \"[t]he people who operate [the] Plan, called 'fiduciaries' of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of ... Plan participants and beneficiaries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71. And the SPD instructs Plan participants and beneficiaries to contact NCG if they have questions about the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While working full-time for NCG, Rema's late husband, Wayne Murdock (\"Wayne\"), elected $150,000 in life insurance coverage through the Plan. Wayne identified Rema as his primary beneficiary for any benefits resulting from the coverage. To secure that coverage, Wayne paid premiums to NCG, which forwarded those payments to Unum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 21, 2016, Wayne stopped working full-time for NCG and began working part-time for it. Although enrollment in the Plan is limited to full-time NCG employees, NCG either never informed or misinformed Wayne about whether he remained eligible to participate in the Plan. Additionally, although Wayne could have converted or ported his life insurance coverage after transitioning to part-time status, NCG never notified him of those options.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties have not disputed that Wayne continued to pay premiums to NCG after March 21, 2016, despite his apparent ineligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 30, 2016, Wayne died. Rema, as Wayne's widow and beneficiary, thereafter\n   submitted a life insurance benefits claim for $150,000 to Unum pursuant to Wayne's participation in the Plan. On October 24, 2016, before Rema heard anything from Unum regarding her claim, Christopher Baham - NCG's Vice President of Human Resources - emailed Rema to notify her that Unum had denied it. Baham assured Rema, however, that NCG would directly pay her the claim amount and work with Unum to recoup the payment. Baham also advised Rema that she would \"not have to deal with Unum insurance company going forward.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 16. Three days later, on October 27, 2016, she received a letter from Unum stating that it had denied her benefits claim because Wayne \"was not eligible for coverage due to his part-time status and [he] failed to convert or port his coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the next four months, Rema and Vice President Baham communicated regularly regarding her life insurance benefits claim. Those communications included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 On November 7, 2016, Rema emailed a copy of Unum's denial letter to Baham and asked him for advice regarding her next steps;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 The following day, Baham responded via email and told Rema that she did not need to do anything else, such as appeal the claim denial, and that NCG was \"working through the details,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 20, 39;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 On November 15, 2016, Baham emailed Rema and said that NCG was still working on her claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 About two weeks later, Baham again emailed Rema, stating that NCG was \"working through a separate insurance company to pay out Wayne's benefits,\" and that Unum would \"not be involved at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. He again reassured her that \"the claim\" would be paid,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 On December 8, 2016, Baham told Rema that he was \"making progress toward resolution of the payment,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Later that month, Baham wrote to Rema that \"NCG was still moving forward,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 On January 19, 2017, Baham emailed Rema to advise her that he had \"escalated [her claim] to another level so [he] hope[d] to soon have [a] resolution on [NCG's] side,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 During the first two weeks of February 2017, Baham told Rema that he was still working on the claim, that it appeared a resolution was \"close,\" and that there had been \"some slow progress\" on the claim,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 28; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Finally, on February 21, 2017, Baham emailed Rema and asked to speak with her by telephone. During the ensuing phone call, Baham informed her that NCG would not pay her any money on the claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based on the representations made to her by Vice President Baham from October 2016 through February 2017, Rema did not appeal Unum's denial of her benefits claim. By the time Baham informed Rema that NCG would not pay her claim, the ninety-day window for her to file an appeal with Unum had closed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In January 2018, Rema filed her Complaint against NCG in the Eastern District\n   of Virginia. Pertinent to this appeal, the Complaint alleges two causes of action under a provision of ERISA that authorizes a participant or beneficiary of an employee benefit plan subject to ERISA to pursue a civil action to obtain \"appropriate equitable relief\" for violations of certain ERISA provisions \"or the terms of the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the first ERISA claim, the Complaint alleges that NCG breached the fiduciary duty that it owed to Wayne, as a Plan participant, because it either failed to inform him or misinformed him about his continued eligibility under the Plan and neglected to notify him that he had the option to convert or port his life insurance coverage. In the second ERISA claim, the Complaint alleges that NCG breached the fiduciary duty that it owed to Rema, as a Plan beneficiary, when Vice President Baham advised her that she need not appeal Unum's denial of her benefits claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On March 30, 2018, NCG moved the district court for dismissal of the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). In support of its dismissal motion, NCG argued that neither it nor Vice President Baham was acting as a fiduciary when they took the actions underlying Rema's ERISA claims. That is, NCG maintained that it and Baham were acting only in an administrative capacity for the Plan, which did not satisfy ERISA's definition of a \"fiduciary,\" as codified in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (21)(A). Thus, according to NCG, they could not have breached any fiduciary duties owed to Wayne or Rema.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On August 7, 2018, the district court granted NCG's motion to dismiss and dismissed Rema's claims. In its accompanying Opinion, the court ruled that the Complaint failed to sufficiently allege that NCG satisfies ERISA's definition of a fiduciary. The Opinion explained that, in order to qualify as a fiduciary under ERISA, an employer must have some \"discretionary control over\" the employee benefit plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion 5. And the Opinion concluded that the Complaint did not adequately allege that NCG (and its high-ranking employee, Vice President Baham) exercised \"discretionary control regarding benefits decisions\" under the Plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the Opinion emphasized that Unum made the benefits decisions for the Plan. The Opinion also described NCG's and Baham's alleged actions as merely \"administrative\" and thus not of a fiduciary nature.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In conducting such a review, we accept the complaint's \"factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of\n   the plaintiff[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519585\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/674/#p680\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"A district court can properly grant a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal only if the complaint fails to contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519585\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/674/#p680\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On appeal, Rema contests the district court's dismissal of her two ERISA claims. She contends that NCG's alleged conduct necessarily constitutes fiduciary activity because NCG is both the plan administrator and the named fiduciary. Even if those roles are insufficient to establish that NCG's conduct in relation to the Plan is fiduciary in nature, Rema maintains that NCG and Vice President Baham functioned as fiduciaries in taking the actions alleged in the Complaint, and that the Opinion erred in ruling otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, she maintains that NCG acted in a fiduciary capacity by: (1) failing to inform or misinforming Wayne about his continued eligibility under the Plan and neglecting to notify Wayne that he had the option to convert or port his life insurance coverage; and (2) advising Rema not to appeal Unum's denial of her benefits claim. Before assessing the alleged fiduciary misconduct, we will identify and discuss some pertinent legal principles regarding ERISA fiduciaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   ERISA specifies several duties, \"derived from the common law of trusts,\" that are imposed on a fiduciary for an employee benefit plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tibble v.
