The Section 8 program subsidizes private landlords who rent to low-income tenants by authorizing housing authorities to pay the difference between the tenant's contribution and the full cost of rent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/10/#p12\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sheena Yarbrough, the plaintiff in this case, was a beneficiary of the Section 8 housing program. While she was living in Section 8 housing, during September of 2012, the police arrested Ms. Yarbrough on drug-related charges. The Decatur Housing Authority (the \"Authority\") learned about her arrest from a newspaper and notified Ms. Yarbrough it intended to terminate her Section 8 housing benefits. Ms. Yarbrough requested and received an informal hearing, and a hearing officer upheld the Authority's decision to terminate her benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Despite the decision in its favor, counsel advised the Authority to continue to subsidize Ms. Yarbrough's rent until her criminal charges were resolved. Roughly six months after her arrest, Ms. Yarbrough was indicted on two charges of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance, in violation of Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-12-211. These charges remained outstanding a little less than two years when the State agreed to dismiss them \"upon payment of court costs.\" But Ms. Yarbrough was not out of the woods yet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Around the same time as the State's agreement, the Authority received a tip accusing Ms. Yarbrough of new violations of the Section 8 housing program. And on October 8, 2015, the Authority sent Ms. Yarbrough a new notice advising her of its intent to terminate her Section 8 housing benefits. This time, the Authority sought to terminate Ms. Yarbrough's benefits based on her indictments as well as her alleged failures to notify the Authority of a change in family composition, to report her household income, and to make required payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Yarbrough again requested a hearing, and one was held on November 10, 2015. The Authority was represented by a caseworker named Kenyetta Gray, who introduced copies of Ms. Yarbrough's indictments into evidence. Ms. Gray also testified about the Authority's communications with Ms. Yarbrough. The Hearing Officer reviewed the testimony and the record, then affirmed the Authority's decision to terminate Ms. Yarbrough's benefits. The Hearing Officer rejected three of the four grounds offered by the Authority in support of termination. However, the Officer found that Ms. Yarbrough's indictments and arrest were enough to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she \"violated her agreement with the Authority and her lease by engaging in drug-related criminal activity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Less than a month later, Ms. Yarbrough filed the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   suit that resulted in this appeal. She asked the U.S. District Court to restore her benefits and enjoin the Authority from evicting her. She alleged that the Authority's decision to terminate her benefits violated both federal regulations as well as her due process rights because the decision was based on legally insufficient evidence and unreliable hearsay. The District Court allowed discovery, and once that was done, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Court granted the Authority's motion for summary judgment and denied Ms. Yarbrough's motion for the same. The District Court rejected Ms. Yarbrough's argument that the indictments were unreliable hearsay and found that they were \"legally sufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence ... that Yarbrough engaged in the alleged drug-related criminal activity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ms. Yarbrough timely appealed the District Court's decision to our Court. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Basco\n   </em>\n   , a panel of this Court agreed with Ms. Yarbrough and reversed the District Court's grant of summary judgment. The panel opinion held that as a matter of law, \"[t]hree probable-cause determinations [supporting one arrest and two indictments]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   do not add up to a finding that a person more likely than not committed a drug-related crime.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Yarbrough v.

Here we address the argument that the Housing Act and its implementing regulations create a privately enforceable right to a preponderance standard. In doing so, we begin with the principle that congressional intent is the keystone of federal rights creation.\n   <em>\n    Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p283\">\n    536 U.S. 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 283-84,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p283\">\n    122 S.

Under this principle, regulations can join with a statute to give rise to a private cause of action under \u00a7 1983 so long as the regulations \"define the content of a[ ] specific right conferred upon the plaintiffs by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

Thus, plaintiffs seeking to sue under \u00a7 1983 for violations of agency regulations must prove that the regulation in question \"merely ... fleshes out the content of\" or further defines a right created by statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1000916\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/127/993/#p1010\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1009-10 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

If the statute creates no federal rights or if the regulation is too far removed from a statute that does create federal rights, \u00a7 1983 does not provide a means of redress and the plaintiff's suit must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to Ms. Yarbrough's argument that the Housing Act and its implementing regulations create a privately enforceable right under \u00a7 1983 to a termination decision based on a preponderance of the evidence. No one disputes that the Housing Act is devoid of any references to a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard in termination proceedings. Ms. Yarbrough thus\n   argues that the regulation establishing the preponderance standard,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.555\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), merely fleshes out a federal right created by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(k)(6). We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 1437d(k) states that \"the Secretary [of Housing and Urban Development] shall by regulation require each public housing agency receiving assistance ... to establish and implement an administrative grievance procedure under which tenants will\" be entitled to a number of procedural protections. One of these procedural protections is the right \"to receive a written decision by the public housing agency on the proposed action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1437d(k)(6). Ms. Yarbrough seizes upon this language to argue that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.555\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(6), which provides that \"[f]actual determinations relating to the individual circumstances of the family shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing,\" merely \"clarifies what constitutes a proper written decision\" under the statute. But this argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Even if we were to accept that \u00a7 1437d(k)(6) creates a federal right to a written decision in Section 8 termination proceedings, there is nothing in the statute for the preponderance standard to define.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Authority rightly notes, the statute addresses the\n   <em>\n    means\n   </em>\n   by which a decision should be communicated. It says nothing about the\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   of the decision. Thus the regulation, which speaks to substance, cannot \"flesh out\" a statutory provision that addresses only the form of a decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The regulatory requirement that \"[f]actual determinations ... be based on a preponderance of the evidence,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.555\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(6), plainly imposes a \"distinct obligation[ ],\"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1000916\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/127/993/#p1010\">\n    127 F.3d at 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , from that of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(k)(6), which requires public housing agencies to issue a \"written decision\" regarding any proposed adverse action. The rule in our Court says a regulation that \"goes beyond explicating the specific content of the statutory provision\" and speaks to an altogether different requirement cannot create a federal right cognizable through \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1000916\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/127/993/#p1010\">\n    127 F.3d at 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ms. Yarbrough's case was not a challenge to the Authority's failure to provide a written decision. To the contrary, she sued because the hearing officer issued a written decision that she says failed to meet the preponderance standard. Thus, even accepting her allegation as true, the hearing officer violated the regulation but not the statute. Her case fails as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ms. Yarbrough nonetheless contends that because a written decision must necessarily be reasoned, the regulation clarifies the standard of proof for a \"reasoned\" decision. Her argument is consistent with several district court decisions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stevenson v.

Mass. 2007) (\"The HUD regulations clarify what constitutes a proper written decision by specifying that ... factual determinations shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing.\" (quotation marks and alterations omitted)). But this theory relies on defining words Congress did not use. Section 1437d(k) does not entitle tenants to a \"properly\" written decision or a \"well-reasoned\" decision or even a \"reasoned\" decision-it entitles them to a \"written decision.\" And the regulation's reference to a preponderance standard\n   neither defines nor elaborates on the meaning of a \"written\" decision.
