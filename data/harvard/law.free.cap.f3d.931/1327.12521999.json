Because he was able to regularly attend his mosque and to serve as a youth organizer for Ahmadis in his community, the Board found insufficient evidence of past persecution. Basing its decision largely on the same evidence, the Board likewise found insufficient evidence of a well-founded fear of future persecution. To be sure, it acknowledged some contrary evidence in the record, particularly as it related to Ali's group-persecution claim. It found, for example, that Pakistani Ahmadis may not refer to themselves as Muslims or to their places of worship as mosques and may not sell their religious literature. It also found that they are victims of both blasphemy accusations and violence. Nonetheless, the Board pointed to efforts by the Pakistani state to protect Ahmadis from both. So considering these efforts, alongside the fact that Pakistani law guarantees the free exercise of religion, as well as the fact that Ali practiced his religion, the Board rejected Ali's asylum claim. Because withholding of removal has a stricter evidentiary standard than asylum,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Board rejected that claim, too. And because Ali did not appeal his CAT claim, the Board deemed it waived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his brief to the Board, however, Ali flagged specific evidence, ignored by the IJ, that contradicted the IJ's decision to deny him asylum and withholding-of-removal relief. We discuss that evidence in broad strokes now but reserve the details for our analysis.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part III. For example, though Ali was able to attend his mosque for a while, that mosque was eventually shut down due to threats of violence against its attendants that went unaddressed by the police. Once the mosque was closed, \"he was no longer able to pray there and instead had to pray in secret outside of town.\" The IJ's decision was therefore problematic, Ali argued, because our cases recognize that \"being forced to practice one's faith in secret amounts to persecution.\" Similarly, though the Board echoed the IJ's finding that Pakistani Ahmadis were constitutionally protected, Ali argued that they were \"excluded from these alleged constitutional 'guarantees.' \" He then cited specific examples that supported\n   his position, including Ahmadis' inability to openly practice their religion, to propagate their religion, to convene for religious gatherings, to perform a pilgrimage, to vote, to build mosques, and to pray in certain manners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In summary, the IJ ignored specific evidence that Ali brought to its attention, and on appeal, the Board ignored that same evidence. Ali now petitions us to review the Board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To enable our review, the Board must \"give 'reasoned consideration' \" to an applicant's claims and \"make 'adequate findings.' \"\n   <em>\n    Tan v.

The first of these three circumstances, involving the \"contents of the record,\" clearly relates to the evidence amassed before the Board, but so do the other two circumstances. Indeed, the failure both to explain the rejection of logical conclusions and to provide reasonable justifications for decisions each flow from some irreconcilable tension between the opinion and the record evidence. All failures to give reasoned consideration thus share a common trait: The Board's opinion, read alongside the evidentiary record, forces us to doubt whether we and the Board are, in substance, looking at the same case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We emphasize today-just as we have in the past-that to write a reviewable decision, the Board does not need to discuss all record evidence. In some cases, however, it is practically impossible for the Board to write a reviewable decision without discussing \"highly relevant\" evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Min Yong Huang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341904\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/1342/#p1349\">\n    774 F.3d at 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Board reasoned that Ali attended mosque and served as a youth organizer, a role through which he taught young community members about the faith. But it wholly ignored Ali's own testimony-testimony the IJ found to be credible and testimony the Board did not discredit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ali testified that after converting, he kept his religion a secret for years and that it was difficult to practice his faith because Ahmadis were forced to pray \"in hiding\" in a \"secret place\" that was \"away from the public eye.\" Other Muslims would kill Ahmadis if they practiced in public, and due to threats against the community, Ahmadi women and children could not attend their mosques. For example, the mosque Ali regularly attended faced security threats, and in his youth-organizing capacity, he was responsible for creating a security plan to protect the group's members. In line with that plan, the members would divide into groups of ten to twelve and pray inside different houses, while several other members acted as lookouts. Alternatively, they would pray in hiding at a member's farm outside the city. Considering this testimony, the Board's conclusion that Ali does not have a religious-persecution claim is downright befuddling. After all, \"having to practice religion underground to avoid punishment is itself a form of persecution,\"\n   <em>\n    Kazemzadeh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042272\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/1341/#p1354\">\n    577 F.3d at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the \"logical conclusion[ ]\" is that Ali was forced to do just that,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jeune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061392\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/792/#p803\">\n    810 F.3d at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   All in all, the Board's opinion in this case is a classic example of a decision that is incapable of review due to a lack of reasoned consideration. Its failure to discuss \"highly relevant\" evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Min Yong Huang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341904\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/1342/#p1349\">\n    774 F.3d at 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , leads to illogical conclusions-ones that cast doubt on whether the Board considered that evidence in the first place. For this reason, we grant Ali's petition for review, vacate the Board's decision, and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This evidence does not compel a finding of persecution, though the Board is certainly free to conclude as much on remand. But the evidence must be wrestled with. The Board can explain why it accords certain highly relevant evidence less weight than other evidence-or why it discredits that evidence altogether. Or it can explain\n   why the evidence does not meet the legal standard of religious persecution. In conclusion, the Board wields wide discretion on how to proceed on remand, and we today express no opinion on the merits. We simply hold that the Board's decision, read alongside the record, considered alongside our religious-persecution cases, is so puzzling that we cannot be sure the Board afforded Ali the consideration of his claims that the law requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because the Board has not afforded this case reasoned consideration, and because we will not substitute our own reasoning for that of the Board, we\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Ali's petition for review,\n   <strong>\n    VACATE\n   </strong>\n   the Board's decision, and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   the case to the Board for further consideration of Ali's asylum and withholding-of-removal claims.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The principal difference between Ahmadiyya Islam and Sunnism, the Muslim majority sect, centers on the identity of the reformer that the Prophet Muhammad foretold would appear after him.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The Government asserts that Ali has waived his group-persecution claim by failing to brief the issue on appeal.
