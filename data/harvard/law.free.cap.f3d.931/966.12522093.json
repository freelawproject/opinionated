At stake are hundreds of millions of dollars. Congress, acting shortly after the economy began to stabilize from the financial crisis that began a decade earlier, passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Stat.%201376\">\n    124 Stat. 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), which amended the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to expand the Commodity Future Trading Commission's (CFTC) enforcement authority. This case is about the extent of those powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Monex Credit Company, one of the defendants and appellees, argues that the CFTC went too far when it filed this $290 million lawsuit for alleged fraud in precious metals sales. According to Monex, Dodd-Frank extended the CFTC's power only to fraud-based manipulation claims, so stand-alone fraud claims-without allegations of manipulation-fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Not only that, Monex argues, but Dodd-Frank also immunizes Monex from the CFTC's claims that it ran an unregistered, off-exchange trading platform. The CEA's registration provisions do not apply to retail commodities dealers who \"actual[ly] deliver[ ]\" the commodities to customers within twenty-eight days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(D)(ii)(III)(aa). Monex insists that it falls within this exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On both fronts, the district court agreed with Monex and dismissed the CFTC's complaint for failure to state a claim under Civil Rule 12(b)(6).

M-I, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277080\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/492/#p499\">\n    853 F.3d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499 (9th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Monex and the Atlas Program\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   California-based Monex has been a major player in the precious metal markets for decades. It sells gold, silver, platinum, and palladium to investors who have a variety of buying options, but here we focus on what Monex calls its \"Atlas Program.\" Through Atlas, investors can purchase commodities on \"margin.\" Also known as \"leverage,\" the concept is simple: A customer buys precious metals by paying only a portion of the full price. The remaining amount is financed through Monex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Once a customer opens an account, she may take open positions in precious metals. But the trading occurs \"off exchange\"-that is, it does not happen on a regulated exchange or board of trade. Instead,\n   Monex controls the platform, acts as the counterparty to every transaction, and sets the price for every trade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Since mid-2011, Monex has made more than 140,000 trades for more than 12,000 Atlas accounts, each of which requires margin of 22-25% of the account's total value. A customer who deposits $25,000 in Atlas as margin can open positions valued at $100,000; she owes the additional $75,000 to Monex. Over time, the account's value changes-it goes up and down-as markets do. The difference between the account's total value and the amount the customer still owes to Monex is the account's \"equity.\" And if that difference falls below a certain threshold, Monex can issue a \"margin call\"-it can require customers to immediately deposit more money into the accounts to increase the equity. Monex can do so at any time, and it can change margin requirements whenever it wants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Monex also retains sole discretion to liquidate trading positions without notice to the customer if equity drops too low, and it controls the price for every trade. Price spreads-the difference between the bid price and ask price-are 3% and generate much of the program's revenue. Commissions and fees make up the rest, and that money comes directly out of customer accounts' equity. Over the last eight years, Monex has made margin calls in more than 3,000 Atlas accounts and has force-liquidated at least 1,850.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Atlas investors can make either \"short\" or \"long\" trades. Short trades bet on metal prices going down, and long up. Monex allows investors to place \"stop\" or \"limit\" orders to manage their trading positions. About a quarter of trading positions in leveraged Atlas accounts open and close within two weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Customers must sign the Atlas account agreement, which gives Monex control over the metals. Monex does not hand over any metals, and customers never possess or control any physical commodity. Instead, Monex stores the metals in depositories with which Monex has contractual relationships. Monex retains exclusive authority to direct the depository on how to handle the metals; investors and the depositories have no contractual relationship with each other. Customers can get their hands on the metals only by making full payment, requesting specific delivery of metals, and having the metals shipped to themselves, a pick-up location, or an agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This structure applies to both long and short positions. For a long position, Monex retains the right to close out the position at any time in its sole discretion and at a price Monex chooses. Metal remains in the depository, but Monex claims to transfer ownership of the metals to the customer. The same is true for short positions, except that instead of transferring ownership, Monex loans the customer metals that the customer immediately sells back to Monex. According to the CFTC, Monex simply makes a \"book entry\" when customers make trades-nothing more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    The Commodity Exchange Act and Dodd-Frank\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The CFTC regulates commodity futures markets under the CEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .

As\n   <em>\n    Zelener\n   </em>\n   recognized, the CEA applied only to futures contracts, even though other types of sales-such as leveraged retail commodity sales-can have similar economic effects.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 866-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This changed in 2010 when Congress, acting in the wake of financial turmoil, passed Dodd-Frank-part of which amended the CEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, Pub.

CEA \u00a7 6(c)(1). This language mirrored \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, and, as did \u00a7 10(b), authorized the governing agency to promulgate rules implementing the statute and bring civil enforcement actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%209\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), 13a-1(a) ; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Monex's Alleged Scheme and This Lawsuit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The CFTC contends that Atlas is a scheme that has violated the CEA since at least July 2011. Monex tells its customers that leveraged precious metals trading is \"a safe, secure and profitable way for retail customers to invest\" when, in fact, the program requires that many customers lose money. What's more, the CFTC alleges, Atlas is designed so that when customers lose, Monex gains: Because Monex is the counterparty for each Atlas transaction, Monex benefits from large price spreads at the customer's expense. Sales representatives, too, have an incentive to push the program: Monex pays salespeople with \"commissions and bonuses tied directly to the number of Atlas accounts they open\" and the number of transactions completed; account performance is not a factor in compensation. So Monex engages in \"high-pressure sales tactics,\" cajoling potential customers into buying leveraged precious metals while it \"misrepresent[s] the likelihood of profit\" and \"systematically downplay[s] the risks\" to ensure customers invest in Atlas, inevitably leading to customer losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The complaint alleges deep and broad losses to about 90% of all leveraged Atlas accounts-totaling some $290 million. In some cases, individual losses were extreme: some customers lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many others suffered five-figure losses. New investors never learned about those losses because Monex never told them. Instead, Monex promised that precious metals are safe and \"will always have value,\" so a customer cannot lose her investment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The CFTC filed this lawsuit seeking an injunction and restitution against Monex Deposit Company, Monex Credit Company, Newport Services Corporation, Louis Carabini, and Michael Carabini (Monex). The CFTC contends that Atlas is an illegal and unregistered leveraged retail commodity transaction market. The CFTC filed four counts, alleging violations of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) CEA \u00a7 4(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), for engaging in off-exchange transactions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (2) CEA \u00a7 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), for fraud;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (3) CEA \u00a7 6(c)(1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%209\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20180.1\">\n    17 CFR \u00a7 180.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(3), for fraud; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (4) CEA \u00a7 4d, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6d(a)(1), for failing to register.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The CFTC filed this lawsuit in the Northern District of Illinois in September 2017. The same day, the CFTC moved for a preliminary injunction. A month later, Monex filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Civil Rule 12(b)(6). The Illinois district court transferred the case to the Central District of California three weeks later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    The District Court Dismisses the CFTC's Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The district court granted Monex's motion to dismiss, denied as moot the motion for preliminary injunction, and gave the CFTC thirty days to amend its complaint as to Count III, the CEA \u00a7 6(c)(1) fraud claim. The CFTC declined the invitation to amend and asked the court to enter judgment, which it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The district court determined that Counts I, II, and IV failed because Monex fit within the actual delivery exception.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(D)(ii)(III)(aa). The district court dismissed Count III because \u00a7 6 allows the CFTC to bring only fraud-based\n   <em>\n    manipulation\n   </em>\n   claims-not stand-alone fraud cases. In short, the district court held that \"any manipulative or deceptive device\" in \u00a7 6(c)(1) requires manipulative\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   fraudulent behavior. And because the CFTC alleged only fraud-and not manipulation-Count III failed as a matter of law. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In reviewing a Civil Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we give no deference to the district court.\n   <em>\n    Soltysik v.

The seller in\n   <em>\n    Hunter Wise\n   </em>\n   did not give the buyer possession of the commodities because it did not possess any in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064365\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/967/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Without inventory, the seller could not\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   deliver anything.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . But \"actual\" in the statute modifies\n   <em>\n    delivery\n   </em>\n   , not existence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Of course, as\n   <em>\n    Hunter Wise\n   </em>\n   recognizes, existence is a prerequisite to delivery-one cannot deliver that which does not exist. But the fact that the commodity's existence is\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   to comply with the exception does not mean existence is\n   <em>\n    sufficient\n   </em>\n   to fit the exception. If Congress wanted only to ensure enough inventory it could have said so. It did not; it required \"actual delivery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Thus, the plain language tells us that actual delivery requires at least some meaningful degree of possession or control by the customer. It is possible for this exception to be satisfied when the commodity sits in a third-party depository, but not when, as here, metals are in the broker's chosen depository, never exchange hands, and are subject to the broker's exclusive control, and customers have no substantial, non-contingent interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This interpretation is confirmed by the broader statutory context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abramski v.

Dodd-Frank expanded the CEA to close the so-called\n   <em>\n    Zelener\n   </em>\n   loophole, which allowed companies to offer commodity sales on margin without regulation, because these transactions mimic conventional futures trades long regulated by the CFTC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zelener\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9234861\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/861/\">\n    373 F.3d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, sales where customers obtain meaningful control or possession of commodities, i.e., when actual delivery occurs, do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   mimic futures trading and are therefore exempt from registration and related CEA requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Monex argues that in the context of a provision regulating leveraged commodity sales, it would make little sense for \"actual delivery\" to turn on possession or control, because such a reading would clash with \"margin,\" which means \"[c]ash or collateral required to be paid to a securities broker by an investor to protect the broker against losses from securities bought on credit.\" Black's Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009). Because the very meaning of the word \"margin\" requires that the buyer deposit\n   <em>\n    collateral\n   </em>\n   with the seller, actual delivery must mean something other than transferring possession or control to the buyer. Otherwise, Monex argues, margin would mean nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Yet, even if the commodity serves as collateral, there is no reason why the buyer cannot control it. In many financing contexts, some degree of buyer possession or control is commonplace. While permitting customers to obtain significant control over or possession of metals might be practically difficult here, that fact does not displace the statute's plain meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   If we had any lingering doubt about the statute's plain meaning, resort to conventional canons of interpretation would further support our conclusion. First, the CEA uses \"delivery\" in \u00a7 1a(27), which we have said \"cannot be satisfied by the simple device of a transfer of title.\"\n   <em>\n    CFTC v.

And because we assume that \"Congress means the same words in the same statute to mean the same thing,\"\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   delivery must require more than simple title transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Texas Dept. of Housing &amp; Cmty.

Second, our interpretation presents no ineffectiveness or surplusage problems because it does not, as the district court believed, mean that \"every financed transaction would violate Dodd-Frank,\" thus \"eliminat[ing] the Actual Delivery Exception from the CEA.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525266\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/1173/#p1181\">\n    311 F.

This amounts to sham delivery, not actual delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To recap, \"actual delivery\" unambiguously requires the transfer of some degree of possession or control. Other interpretive tools, including the CFTC's guidance, reinforce this conclusion. Monex challenges the CFTC's characterization of its delivery scheme, but, at the 12(b)(6) stage, we ignore such factual disputes and accept as true allegations in the complaint. Because this affirmative defense does not, on the face of the complaint, bar the CFTC from relief on Counts I, II, and IV, the district court erred in dismissing those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Nor does the fact that the applicable statutory headings mention only manipulation and not fraud.

The inclusion of \"deceptive\" in \u00a7 6(c)(1) must have meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Monex pulls two final arrows from its quiver. First, Monex argues that the CFTC's enforcement jurisdiction comes only from CEA \u00a7 2. Without an independent jurisdictional grant in \u00a7 2, Monex argues, the CFTC cannot bring a \u00a7 6(c)(1) fraud claim. In support, Monex cites\n   <em>\n    CFTC v. White Pine Tr. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676342\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/1219/\">\n    574 F.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2009), where we considered whether the CFTC had jurisdiction over certain foreign currency trades. There, we focused on CEA \u00a7 4c, which applies only to a \"transaction involving any commodity regulated under this chapter.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6c(b). The question in\n   <em>\n    White Pine\n   </em>\n   was whether foreign currency trades were \"regulated under this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676342\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/1219/\">\n    574 F.3d at 1223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 2 of the CEA generally excludes foreign currency from regulation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(c)(1), but some foreign currency are covered,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(c)(2). Reading \u00a7\u00a7 4c,\n   2(c)(1), and 2(c)(2) together, we held in\n   <em>\n    White Pine\n   </em>\n   that the specific trades in that case did not fall under the CFTC's jurisdiction because foreign currency trades were categorically\n   <em>\n    excluded\n   </em>\n   from the CEA under \u00a7 2(c)(1), unless they were trades specifically exempted from that exclusion under \u00a7 2(c)(2). The\n   <em>\n    White Pine\n   </em>\n   trades did not fall under \u00a7 2(c)(2), and thus were excluded under \u00a7 2(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676342\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/1219/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As the district court noted, retail commodity transactions are not addressed in \u00a7 2(c)(1) 's general exclusion. Thus, there is no need for a specific jurisdictional grant to overcome the general exclusion, as was required in\n   <em>\n    White Pine\n   </em>\n   . Instead, the retail commodity provision merely describes the types of transactions to which other CEA sections-\u00a7\u00a7 4(a), 4(b), and 4b-apply. In other words, \u00a7 2(c)(2)(D) -the retail commodity provision-clarifies the interplay between margined commodity sales and other sections that apply to future contracts. This is necessary because \u00a7\u00a7 4(a), 4(b), and 4b applied\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to futures trades, until \u00a7 2(c)(2)(D) confirmed that those sections\n   <em>\n    also apply\n   </em>\n   to leveraged commodity sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   No such clarification is needed with \u00a7 6(c)(1) because the section applies to \"any ... contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce.\" And in those sales, \u00a7 6(c)(1) outlaws the use of any manipulative or deceptive device. Later, the CEA clarifies that \"[w]henever it shall appear to the Commission that any registered entity or other person has\" violated \"any provision of this chapter ... the Commission may bring an action in the proper district court of the United States.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 13a-1(a). When someone violates \u00a7 6(c)(1), the CFTC can bring an enforcement action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that if \u00a7 6(c)(1) means what the CFTC says, then the statute applies not only to margined commodity sales, but to ordinary retail cash commodity sales, too. As Monex tells it, this would mean that even everyday grocery sales would be subject to the CFTC's enforcement power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellee Br. at 35. This, Monex argues, cannot be the case because such an \"explosive increase of an agency's ... authority\" requires a clear statement from Congress.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 53. And \"Congress ... does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provision-it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    531 U.S. 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    121 S.Ct. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505769\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/457/#p468\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In the first place, it is not clear that this amounts to an elephant in a mousehole. By its terms, \u00a7 6(c)(1) applies broadly to commodities in interstate commerce. More important, this case does not involve retail cash commodity sales. This case involves only margined commodity sales. And even Monex admits that \u00a7 6(c)(1) applies to at least\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   margined commodity sales-those that involve fraud-based manipulation. The question we address is only whether \u00a7 6(c)(1) also applies to stand-alone fraud claims in the sale of leveraged commodities. Whether the statute extends to non-leveraged sales is not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In bill drafting, as in life, little things often make big differences. Here, three words stand between dismissal and discovery. Although Monex contends that no fraud occurred, we must, at this point, accept as true the CFTC's well-pleaded complaint to the contrary. And because the CFTC's claims are plausible, this lawsuit should continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   --------\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Monex's unopposed motion for judicial notice (Dkt. 28) is\n    <strong>\n     GRANTED\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
