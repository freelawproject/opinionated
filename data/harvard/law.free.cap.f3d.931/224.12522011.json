Congress modified the calculation of the physical presence requirement when it amended the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1996: Under the \"stop-time rule,\" the physical presence period ends when the Department of Homeland Security serves the alien with a notice to appear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, aliens cannot continue to accrue physical presence time during the pendency of (often lengthy) removal proceedings and appeals. At issue is whether the stop-time rule applies to the time period during which an alien must exhibit good moral character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Petitioner Pablo Antonio Mejia-Castanon maintains that it does, such that events occurring after the service of a notice to appear cannot be used to evaluate his good moral character. This time distinction is critical to Petitioner's application for cancellation of removal because he admitted to helping family members illegally enter the United States during the pendency of his application, a transgression that indisputably undermines his ability to demonstrate good moral character. Under Petitioner's interpretation, the stop-time rule operates to exclude these events from the evaluation of his moral character. But if the stop-time rule does not truncate the good moral character window, he will not satisfy the good moral character requirement and will be statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Board of Immigration Appeals rejected Petitioner's reading of the statute, and two courts of appeals have deferred to the Board's interpretation under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   . For the reasons that follow, we agree with our sister circuits and hold that the\n   Board's interpretation is entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference. Under that interpretation, the stop-time rule does not apply to the good moral character requirement. Instead, the relevant time period on which to evaluate an alien's good moral character is the ten-year period prior to the final administrative decision on an alien's application for cancellation of removal.

Years later, the Department of Homeland Security sought to remove him and served him with a document labeled \"Notice to Appear\" on October 17, 2013. This document specified the allegations against Petitioner and identified the legal authority for the removal proceedings against him, but it provided for a hearing \"on a date to be set at a time to be set.\" App. 837. On November 13, 2013, Petitioner was served a notice of hearing, specifying the time and place of his removal proceedings. At a preliminary hearing before an Immigration Judge, Petitioner admitted to unlawfully entering the United States, conceded he was removable, and sought discretionary relief in the form of cancellation of removal, or alternatively, voluntary departure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(b), 1229c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On January 9, 2017, the Immigration Judge held a hearing on the merits of Petitioner's cancellation of removal application. During this hearing, Petitioner admitted to paying a total of $8,000 to an individual to help his brother and three daughters unlawfully enter the United States in 2015 and 2016 respectively--years after he was initially served with a notice to appear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because he admitted to helping his family enter the United States without permission, the Immigration Judge determined Petitioner had engaged in alien smuggling and was not a person of good moral character as defined in the INA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3), 1182(a)(6)(E).

He did not dispute engaging in prohibited conduct. He argued, instead, that events occurring after the service of a notice to appear could not be used to evaluate his good moral character because the stop-time rule, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1), applied to the good moral character requirement,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , it is evident that the incomplete October 13, 2013 notice did not trigger the stop-time rule. For purposes of Mejia's petition, we assume the subsequent November 13, 2013 notice of hearing triggered the stop-time rule because it provided the minimum information-hearing time and place-needed to facilitate Petitioner's appearance at his removal proceeding. Because we conclude the stop-time rule does not apply to the good moral character period, we have no occasion to decide whether this two-step notice process satisfies \u00a7 1229(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Petitioner's alien smuggling transgressions occurred in 2015 and 2016. Both incidents, therefore, followed the November 13, 2013 notice of hearing. If this notice triggers the stop-time rule, as we assume it does for purposes of evaluating Petitioner's contention, then under his theory the alien smuggling incidents would fall outside\n   the good moral character ten-year window.

Under Petitioner's interpretation, an alien could engage in a disqualifying act--like alien smuggling or testifying falsely at an immigration hearing-and yet remain eligible for cancellation of removal, so long as the act occurred after the service of a\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   -compliant notice to appear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ortega-Cabrera\n   </em>\n   , 23 I. &amp; N.

The Board concludes that the stop-time rule applies to the physical presence of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of the application for cancellation of removal but does not apply to the petitioner's requirement of being a person of good moral character during the same continuous 10-year period. That conclusion follows logic but it does not follow the statute. A decision that the stop-time rule for both physical presence and good moral character is 10 years before the application is a windfall for an applicant like Mejia-Castanon, for the acts in this case which would preclude him from being eligible for a cancellation of removal would allow him to \"beat the system.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   However, the plain language of the statute provides otherwise, and Congress has had an opportunity to amend the statute, as recited in the majority opinion. Thus, the current statute reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   The Attorney General may cancel removal of ... an alien who is inadmissible or deportable ... if the alien--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (A) has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of such application; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (B) has been a person of good moral character during such period ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A)-(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I realize, as the majority indicates, that two other circuits have ruled otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez-Avalos v.
