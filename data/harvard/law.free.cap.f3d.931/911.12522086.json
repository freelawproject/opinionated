(\"Gemtech\") is an Idaho-based manufacturer of gun silencers. In 2017, Smith &amp; Wesson Corp. and parent company American Outdoor Brands Corp. (collectively \"Smith &amp; Wesson\") offered to purchase Gemtech's assets. Gemtech accepted and entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Smith &amp; Wesson. The Agreement contained a forum-selection clause requiring \"any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement\" to be brought in Delaware. Gemtech subsequently sued Smith &amp; Wesson for breach of the Agreement in Idaho federal district court. The district court enforced the forum-selection clause and dismissed the action. On appeal, Gemtech argues that the forum-selection clause is unenforceable because it contravenes the strong public policy declared by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-110\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 29-110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).

We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January 2018, Gemtech filed a diversity action against Smith &amp; Wesson in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho alleging breach of contract. In the Asset Purchase Agreement, Smith &amp; Wesson promised to make two payments to Gemtech, a cash payment and an earn-out payment. According to Gemtech's complaint, Smith &amp; Wesson breached the Agreement in several material respects that \"violated, nullified, and significantly impaired the cash payments and the earn-out payments to Gemtech.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 21, 2018, Smith &amp; Wesson moved to dismiss the action because of the forum-selection clause in the Agreement. That clause provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Each party hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the state of Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Collateral Agreements, and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding must be brought and/or defended in such court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Smith &amp; Wesson argued that Gemtech's action should be dismissed on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine Construction Co., Inc. v.

The Supreme Court held that \"the appropriate way to enforce a forum-selection clause pointing to a state or foreign forum is through the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 60,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ordinarily, a district court considering a\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   motion \"must evaluate both the convenience of the parties and various public-interest considerations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 62,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the parties' contract contains a valid forum-selection clause, however, a district court must \"adjust\" its analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 63,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff then \"bears the burden\" of establishing that transfer is unwarranted, and the district court \"should not consider arguments about the parties' private interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 63-64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, \"a district court should transfer the case unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the convenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 52,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Gemtech argued that the district court should not enforce the forum-selection clause under\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   because the clause is invalid and unenforceable. Surprisingly, Gemtech did not rely on the fact that \"Circuit Court of the state of Delaware\" is a misnomer; there is no such court in Delaware. We thus do not address that argument on appeal. Instead, Gemtech has consistently argued that the forum-selection clause does not control because it contravenes the strong public policy declared by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-110\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 29-110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Every stipulation or condition in a contract, by which any party thereto is restricted from enforcing his rights under the contract in Idaho tribunals, or which limits the time within which he may thus enforce his rights,\n   <em>\n    is void as it is against the public policy of Idaho\n   </em>\n   .

The court reasoned that the Agreement's forum-selection clause is valid because it is not the product of \"fraud, duress, misrepresentation, or other misconduct\" under \"general contract law\" and enforceable because there are \"no exceptional circumstances\" precluding its enforcement. The district court did not give any weight to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-110\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 29-110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) or engage in a\n   <em>\n    Bremen\n   </em>\n   public policy analysis. The court justified its approach by explaining that \"Gemtech must point to something more than just the statute itself to warrant ignoring the forum selection clause, because if\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-110\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 29-110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) was determinative, striking down the forum selection clause would be\n   <em>\n    routine\n   </em>\n   rather than extraordinary, standing\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   on its head.\" The district court then dismissed the action in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   . Gemtech timely appealed.

Gemtech argues (a) that the district court abused its discretion when it declined to consider Gemtech's public policy argument and (b) that the forum-selection clause is unenforceable because it contravenes Idaho public policy.

The District Court Abused its Discretion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Roughly forty years before\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Bremen\n   </em>\n   that a forum-selection clause is \"prima facie valid\" and \"should control absent a strong showing that it should be set aside.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p15\">\n    407 U.S. at 10, 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p15\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the Court held that a district court should enforce a forum-selection clause unless the party challenging the clause can show \"that enforcement would be unreasonable and unjust, or that the clause was invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p15\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As evidence of Washington's public policy, the Suns relied on two Washington court cases as well as the antiwaiver provision in the WSSA, which provides that \"[a]ny condition, stipulation, or provision binding any person acquiring any security to waive compliance with any provision of this chapter or any rule or order hereunder is void.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1089-90 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2021.20.430\">\n    Wash.

Prior to\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   , we treated a strong showing under any one of the\n   <em>\n    Bremen\n   </em>\n   factors as sufficient grounds for not enforcing a forum-selection clause. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Doe 1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4013170\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/1077/#p1081\">\n    552 F.3d 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we held that a forum-selection clause was unenforceable against California residents bringing class action claims under California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\") because a California Court of Appeal had declared that such a clause contravenes \"California public policy against consumer class action waivers and waivers of consumer rights under the CLRA[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1084. In\n   <em>\n    Advanced China Healthcare\n   </em>\n   , we did not unequivocally decide whether\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   altered the weight to be given to the\n   <em>\n    Bremen\n   </em>\n   factors. We therefore take the opportunity to clarify that satisfaction of\n   <em>\n    Bremen\n   </em>\n   's public policy factor continues to suffice to render a forum-selection clause unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    Bremen\n   </em>\n   held that \"[a] contractual choice-of-forum clause should be held unenforceable\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   enforcement would contravene a strong public policy of the forum in which suit is brought, whether declared by statute or by judicial decision.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p15\">\n    407 U.S. at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136358\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/1/#p15\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). We have found nothing in\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   that compels a different rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, we hold that the forum-selection clause in the Agreement between Gemtech and Smith &amp; Wesson is unenforceable under\n   <em>\n    Advanced China Healthcare\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bremen\n   </em>\n   because enforcement would contravene a strong public policy of Idaho, as declared by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029-110\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7 29-110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Our holding does not, as the district court suggests, \"stand[ ]\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   on its head\" by making the invalidation of forum-selection clauses \"routine rather than extraordinary.\" As a preliminary matter, we are aware of only four other states-Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and North Carolina-that have statutes similar to Idaho's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-2-708\">\n    Mont.
