The plaintiff obtained an injunction against the defendant corporation and its officers, including the corporation's president, Dr. Krishnamurthy Govindaraj, who was not named as a defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After entry of default judgment against the corporation and years of damages-related discovery, the district court awarded more than $1.7 million in damages, as well as more than $555,000 in attorneys' fees, against both the defendant corporation and Govindaraj personally. In holding Govindaraj personally liable for the money judgment despite his status as a non-party, the district court emphasized Govindaraj's position as an officer of the defendant corporation and his continuing attempts to obstruct the litigation \"in defiance of orders of [the] court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Upon our review, we conclude that the district court erred in entering judgment against Govindaraj personally when he was not named as a party or otherwise brought into the case by service of process. We additionally hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in finding Govindaraj in contempt of court. We therefore affirm in part, and vacate in part, the district court's judgment. We remand the case for the court to determine whether any of the damages and fees award entered against Govindaraj is attributable to his contempt of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2010, plaintiff Life Technologies Corp., a Delaware corporation, filed a two-count complaint against the defendant, Life Technologies Corp., a Maryland corporation, alleging that the defendant corporation was infringing on the plaintiff's registered trademark, \"Life Technologies.\" Among other things, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant corporation, plaintiff's competitor in the field of scientific products and services, improperly was using the \"Life Technologies\" mark as part of various internet domain names to market the defendant's goods and services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as treble damages under the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). It is undisputed that the plaintiff did not name Govindaraj as a\n   defendant, and did not refer to him in any allegations of the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2012, the district court entered default judgment against the defendant corporation. The court additionally held that Govindaraj had acted in bad faith during the litigation, observing that his statements on behalf of the defendant corporation were \"laughably incorrect\" and \"absurd.\" The court entered an order enjoining the defendant corporation, and Govindaraj and his wife as corporate officers, from engaging in further activity infringing on the plaintiff's registered trademark. The court also held that based on the defendant's willful conduct, the case was \"exceptional,\" entitling the plaintiff to payment of its costs and attorneys' fees. The court directed that the plaintiff be awarded damages from the defendant corporation, including treble damages, in an amount to be determined following additional discovery in the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Around the same time, Govindaraj dissolved the defendant corporation without notice to the corporation's creditors. In the months that followed, Govindaraj violated the court's injunction and continually attempted to obstruct the discovery process related to determining a damages award. Among other things, in violation of the discovery proceedings, Govindaraj transferred some internet domain names to foreign entities, made repeated false claims regarding the company's finances, and refused to produce various documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November 2012, the district court issued an order directing Govindaraj to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court for violating the court's injunction. At a show cause hearing held the next month, Govindaraj, represented by counsel, made his first formal appearance in the case as an interested party. After Govindaraj testified at the hearing, the district court sua sponte raised the question whether damages could be awarded against Govindaraj personally. When Govindaraj's counsel inquired whether the court might pierce the corporate veil, the court responded that piercing the corporate veil \"may be what's necessary to effectuate the court's judgment.\" At that time, the court held Govindaraj in contempt for violating the injunction order, but \"with[e]ld the judgment as to the sanction to impose.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Govindaraj continued his obstructionist conduct during more than three additional years of discovery related to damages sustained by the plaintiff. In September 2014, the court again held Govindaraj in contempt for refusing to authorize the plaintiff access to certain email accounts as required by a prior court order. The court delayed imposition of sanctions until the court made a final determination regarding damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In late 2015, the plaintiff filed motions seeking damages for trademark infringement and for attorneys' fees, asking the court to hold Govindaraj and his wife jointly and severally liable for those damages and fees along with the defendant corporation. During a hearing on the motions, the plaintiff asserted that although Govindaraj and his wife had not been named as defendants\n   in the action, they were personally responsible as officers of the corporation for the defendant's acts of infringement and, thus, could be held personally liable for an award of damages and attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court found that Govindaraj was \"clearly ... the mastermind of th[e] corporate entity,\" had \"fully participated in and fully understood what was going on\" in the litigation, and had \"attempted to thwart [the litigation] over and over again.\" Based on Govindaraj's actions \"in defiance of orders of [the] court,\" the district court imposed an award of damages and attorneys' fees against Govindaraj personally. The plaintiff did not argue, and the court did not find, that piercing the corporate veil of the defendant corporation was warranted or that Govindaraj was an \"alter ego\" of that corporation. The court later entered an order holding Govindaraj and the defendant corporation jointly and severally liable for payment of treble damages in the total amount of $1,712,936.49.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also awarded over $555,000 in attorneys' fees and costs against both Govindaraj and the defendant corporation. Govindaraj now appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Govindaraj argues that the district court violated his due process rights in entering a judgment against him for damages and attorneys' fees when he was not named as a defendant in the action. He contends that because he was not a party in the case, he was unable to defend himself against individual liability as a corporate officer or as a putative alter ego of the defendant corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In response, the plaintiff argues that Govindaraj was subject to personal liability, because he was directly responsible for the acts of trademark infringement committed by the defendant corporation. Additionally, the plaintiff asserts that Govindaraj was the alter ego of the defendant corporation, was on notice of the plaintiff's allegations, and participated fully throughout the district court proceedings. Thus, the plaintiff submits that it was not required to name Govindaraj as a party given his well-known role in the activities of the defendant corporation. We disagree with the plaintiff's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We review de novo the question of law whether the district court erred in entering judgment against a non-party to the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sky Cable, LLC v.

Indeed, Govindaraj's name does not appear anywhere in the complaint, and the plaintiff never sought to amend the complaint to add him as a defendant in the case. And, contrary to the plaintiff's argument on appeal, the district court's sua sponte observation in December 2012 that veil piercing might be appropriate was merely a suggestion, and nothing more. The plaintiff did not take any action based on the court's comment, which, standing alone, did not notify Govindaraj that he needed \"to respond and be heard\" in a \"reliable and orderly course\" before judgment could be entered against him.\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508724\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/460/#p463\">\n    529 U.S. at 466-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508724\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/460/#p463\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We reject the plaintiff's attempt on appeal to cure its procedural missteps by belatedly raising an alter ego theory of liability to preserve a judgment obtained against a non-party. As a result of the plaintiff's failure to advance such an alter ego theory in the district court, the present record does not contain any factual findings resolving that issue, and the district court was not asked to pierce the corporate veil.

After Govindaraj refused for months to comply with the plaintiff's discovery requests, the magistrate judge ordered Govindaraj in October 2013 to \"compile a list of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   e-mail addresses he is currently using and/or previously used. [Govindaraj] must\n   <strong>\n    affirm\n   </strong>\n   the list of e-mail addresses is the full, correct and absolute list of all e-mail addresses he presently or previously used\" (emphasis in original). In response to the magistrate judge's order, Govindaraj provided only four email addresses. However, the plaintiff independently discovered about two dozen email addresses under Govindaraj's control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Three months later, in January 2014, after Govindaraj failed to provide the plaintiff with emails from all these accounts during discovery, the magistrate judge held a telephone conference with the plaintiff's representatives and Govindaraj. Following the conference, the magistrate judge issued the order Govindaraj now challenges (the challenged order):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [F]or the reasons stated during the telephone conference, [Govindaraj] is hereby ORDERED to sign and execute \"consent and release forms\" regarding various e-mail accounts within ten (10) days of Plaintiff's counsel providing the forms to [Govindaraj's] counsel[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Govindaraj filed objections to the magistrate judge's order, which objections the district court overruled. Govindaraj nevertheless continued to refuse to sign the consent forms produced by the plaintiff's counsel. Based on this refusal, and after reviewing the proposed consent forms, the district court held Govindaraj in contempt for failing to comply with the challenged order. The court did not immediately impose sanctions for the violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Upon consideration of the challenged order, we conclude that its terms were not vague, and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding Govindaraj in contempt of court. By the time that the magistrate judge entered the challenged order, Govindaraj was well aware that the court expected him to provide the plaintiff access to \"all\" the email accounts the court earlier had required him to identify. Although Govindaraj disagrees with the reasonableness of this requirement, that disagreement has no bearing on the question whether the terms of the challenged order adequately notified him of the obligations imposed by the court. And given Govindaraj's repeated disregard for the discovery process, his assertion on appeal that his \"actions bespeak good faith\" lacks any basis in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taggart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620115\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1795/#p1801\">\n    139 S. Ct. at 1802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a contemnor's bad faith can justify imposition of sanctions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We therefore affirm the district court's judgment holding Govindaraj in contempt for violating the challenged order. However, the court did not specify whether any of the combined damages and fees award was entered against Govindaraj personally as a sanction for his contempt. We thus are unable to determine whether any of the combined damages and fees award should be upheld as a reasonable sanction for contempt, or whether the entirety of the award against Govindaraj personally must be vacated. For these reasons, although we affirm the district court's decision to hold Govindaraj in contempt, we remand the separate issue of sanctions to the district court for a determination whether any monetary sanctions for contempt were awarded against Govindaraj personally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, we affirm the district court's contempt finding against Govindaraj, but we vacate the judgment for damages and attorneys' fees entered against him. We remand for further proceedings for the court to determine whether any portion of the damages and fees award against Govindaraj was imposed as a sanction for his contempt of court and, if so, the amount of that sanction. The court may re-enter judgment against Govindaraj personally only as to any such sanction for his contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Govindaraj does not appeal the district court's order entering an injunction against him as an officer of the defendant corporation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    In addition to the defendant corporation, the complaint also listed five \"Doe\" defendants.
