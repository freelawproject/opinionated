In his first \u00a7 2255 motion, Pollard claimed that he was actually innocent because he did not use or brandish a firearm while robbing the credit union, and that his counsel was ineffective for advising him to plead guilty to that crime despite his innocence. The district court dismissed that motion as untimely, and both the district court and this Court denied Pollard a certificate of appealability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pollard v.

In his second \u00a7 2255 motion, Pollard claimed that his conviction and sentence were unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sessions v.

He not only has to show that the decision he is relying on announced a new rule of constitutional law, that the rule has been made retroactive by\n   the Supreme Court, and that it was previously unavailable; he must also show that there is a \"reasonable likelihood\" that he will benefit from the rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hires\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325365\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/1297/#p1299\">\n    825 F.3d 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1299 (11th Cir. 2016) (\"When a petitioner seeks leave to pursue a successive \u00a7 2255 motion under \u00a7 2255(h)(2), we have held that a petitioner must demonstrate a 'reasonable likelihood' that they will benefit from a new, retroactive, and previously unavailable constitutional rule in order to make a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   showing that their application satisfies the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b) and 2255(h).\").

And that is because\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   addressed only \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) 's residual clause, but the companion crime for which Pollard was convicted (armed robbery of a credit union) qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) 's use-of-force clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

And we held that an applicant could not make that showing if (1) \"the sentencing court affirmatively made a finding that an applicant's ACCA predicate offenses qualified under either enumerated crimes clause or elements clause,\" or (2) \"binding precedent clearly classifies an offense that the applicant's sentencing court found to be an ACCA predicate as either an elements or enumerated crimes clause offense.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325693\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/1335/#p1339\">\n    825 F.3d 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1339 (11th Cir. 2016).
