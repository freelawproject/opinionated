In 2010, Rasta obtained Copyright Registration No. VA 1-707-439 for its full-body banana costume. Two years later, Rasta began working with a company called Yagoozon, Inc., which purchased and resold thousands of Rasta's banana costumes. Yagoozon's founder, Justin Ligeri, also founded Kangaroo and at all relevant times was aware of Rasta's copyright registration in the banana costume. After the business relationship between Rasta and Yagoozon ended, Rasta's CEO, Robert Berman, discovered Kangaroo selling a costume that resembled his company's without a license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rasta sued Kangaroo for copyright infringement, trade dress infringement, and unfair competition. After settlement discussions were unsuccessful, Rasta moved for a preliminary injunction and Kangaroo responded by moving to dismiss. The District Court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and explained its reasons for doing so in a thorough opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silvertop Assocs., Inc. v.

Kangaroo appealed, but because the District Court had not entered an order detailing the injunction's terms, we granted the parties' motion to remand for the limited purpose of entering a corrected order. The District Court amended its order, and the injunction is now ripe for review on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The District Court had jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1338(a).
