The reason was that the foreclosure notice inaccurately specified that the Thompsons could avoid foreclosure if, but only if, the Thompsons paid the balance due on or before the specified foreclosure date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The panel found this warning defective because under the terms of the mortgage the Thompsons were required to pay the amount due at least five days\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the foreclosure date in order to escape foreclosure. At no time did the Thompsons argue that they had been misled by the inaccuracy or had in any way been prejudiced by it; but under binding state precedent it is enough that some hypothetical mortgagor could have been misled by the inaccurate pre-foreclosure notice.\n   <em>\n    Pinti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Emigrant Mortg.

This is a debatable position: the form notice that follows in section 56.04 also includes language apprising homeowners that \"[e]nclosed with this notice, there may be additional important disclosures related to applicable laws and requirements that you should carefully review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7065540\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/829/53/#p58\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Chase received wide support from the banking community and predictions of disaster were numerous and detailed in various amicus briefs filed in tandem with Chase's rehearing petition. Chase took issue with the panel's reading of\n   <em>\n    Pinti\n   </em>\n   and other SJC precedents, and suggested as an\n   alternative to reconsideration on the merits that this court certify the matter to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. This court in a diversity action cannot properly overturn governing state precedent, but the SJC on certification is not thus limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Chase may fault the Thompsons for their counsel's failure to uncover this obscure regulation but Chase itself also failed to note its existence, even though it likely had greater familiarity with banking law and every incentive to raise the issue. But if the case involved only one bank and one mortgage, one might let this court's decision stand; a competent lawyer may miss an obscure point but the miss may be fatal in the case at hand, even though the issue may be revisited in a later case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Here, Chase urges serious harms that might prompt the SJC to reexamine its precedents. Certification is not lightly ventured by this court because it imposes delay and additional legal costs for the parties,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bruce Selya,\n   <em>\n    Certified Madness: Ask a Silly Question...\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20Suffolk%20U.%20L.%20Rev.%20677\">\n    29 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996), but if real harm is threatened, the SJC can address it; if not, a definitive statement by the SJC can dispel the concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Accordingly, the panel withdraws our earlier opinion in this case, vacates the judgment, and certifies to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Did the statement in the August 12, 2016, default and acceleration notice that \"you can still avoid foreclosure by paying the total past-due amount before a foreclosure sale takes place\" render the notice inaccurate or deceptive in a manner that renders the subsequent foreclosure sale void under Massachusetts law?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This court would welcome any additional observations about relevant Massachusetts law that the SJC may deem helpful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Clerk is directed to forward to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, under the official seal of this court, a copy of this Order along with copies of the briefs and appendices, as well as the petition for rehearing materials, filed by the parties and amici curiae. This court retains jurisdiction over this appeal pending resolution of this certified question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     It is so ordered\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
