Kennedy Airports in New York in order to reduce flight delays. In 2000, Congress mandated the repeal of the relevant regulations based on concerns about their anticompetitive effects. The phase-out process, however, caused flight delays to skyrocket at LaGuardia and JFK Airports. The FAA then issued interim orders again limiting the number of flights serving those airports. The FAA has since extended the interim orders many times as efforts to establish a permanent solution have failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Exhaustless, Inc., brings two petitions for review of the latest interim extension orders. Exhaustless would like LaGuardia and JFK Airports to implement the company's patent-pending product, Aviation 2.0 Operating System, to manage the allocation of takeoff and landing \"slots\" to airlines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We dismiss Exhaustless's petitions for lack of standing. The company fails to demonstrate that vacating the interim FAA orders would redress its injury-i.e., a lack of market opportunity for its product. Vacating the interim orders would leave takeoffs and landings at the airports unregulated, eliminating the need for the company's product at the federal level. To the extent Exhaustless argues that the local airport authority could employ Aviation 2.0 if there were no federal regulation, we find any such possibility too speculative to support the company's standing to bring these petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Federal Aviation Act calls for the FAA to \"assign by regulation or order the use of the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040103\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

The restrictions were codified in a series of regulations known as the High Density Rule. As of 2000, the rule placed numerical limits on the hourly takeoffs and landings at five highly congested airports: Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, JFK, O'Hare, and Ronald Reagan Washington National.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=14%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2093.123\">\n    14 C.F.R. \u00a7 93.123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By then, Congress had grown concerned with the High Density Rule's collateral effects on airport access for carriers and competition among carriers.

And because the interim rules are revocable at will, the orders challenged by Exhaustless in this proceeding do not stand in the way of the company's attempting to persuade the FAA to adopt its technology via a rulemaking. Indeed, Exhaustless has already filed such a petition for rulemaking. Petition for Rulemaking-FAA-2007-0001 (filed May 21, 2018), J.A. 499. The petition remains pending with the FAA, and, should the agency reject it, Exhaustless would have standing to seek judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At oral argument, Exhaustless submitted that vacatur of the FAA's interim rules would create a different market opportunity: vacatur in theory would result in transfer of control over flight schedules at LaGuardia and JFK Airports from federal to local authority, i.e., the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which could then elect to use Aviation 2.0. That argument for standing fares no better.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   While the loss of an opportunity to compete for business can constitute Article III injury, there must be a \"realistic possibility\" of winning the eventual competition.\n   <em>\n    Ranger Cellular v.

Here, the hurdles to the Port Authority's adoption of Aviation 2.0 to manage flights at the airports are too significant and too numerous for us to find it \"likely, as opposed to merely speculative,\" that vacatur of the interim orders would redress Exhaustless's injury.\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, the FAA operates under a duty \"to ensure ... the efficient use of airspace.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040103\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Since 1968, the Administration has fulfilled that responsibility by limiting the number of takeoffs and landings at LaGuardia and JFK because the airports cannot accommodate the number of flights airlines would like to operate there without causing undue congestion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20Fed.%20Reg.%2017%2C896\">\n    33 Fed. Reg. 17,896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dec. 3, 1968). The Chief Operating Officer of the FAA's Air Traffic Administration testified that, absent the interim orders, she would expect \"demand for additional flights ... to far exceed the runway capacity resulting in extensive localized and systemic delays and flight cancellations.\" Bristol Decl. \u00b6 4, FAA Add. A28. Recall that, in 2000, merely allowing exemptions from slot limitations caused LaGuardia to account for 25% of flight delays nationwide. 71 Fed. Reg. at 54,332. Exhaustless's suggestion that our vacating the interim orders would lead the FAA to delegate authority over flight schedules at LaGuardia and JFK Airports to the Port Authority defies history and blinks reality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, both LaGuardia and JFK Airports have accepted federal grants for airport development under the Airport Improvement Program. Federal Aviation Administration, FY 2019 Primary Entitlements (May 10, 2019), https://www.faa.gov/airports/aip/grantapportion_data/media/FY-2019-Primary-Entitlements.pdf. As a condition of accessing those funds, the airports must pledge that they will be\n   \"available for public use on reasonable conditions and without unjust discrimination.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2047107\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 47107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). That assurance prohibits airlines from assessing unreasonable fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Air Transp. Ass'n of Am. v. DOT\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704136,3552120\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/206/\">\n    613 F.3d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 210 (D.C.

And Congress has assigned the Secretary of Transportation primary responsibility for determining whether airport fees are reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2047129\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 47129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under current regulations, airports may charge landing fees so long as they do not exceed the historical costs captured by an airport's \"rate base.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055%2C330\">\n    78 Fed.

But Exhaustless's technology relies on charging carriers a market-clearing auction price rather than a cost-based landing fee, and in doing so runs into conflict with JFK's and LaGuardia's grant assurances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Third, there are substantial obstacles to charging passengers a \"dedicated Congestion-Prevention Premium,\" as Exhaustless contemplates. Exhaustless Inc., Aviation 2.0-Explained, FAA Add. A39. To the extent the company envisions that the local airport authority would assess the premium, it fails to account for the Anti-Head Tax Act, which provides that any \"political subdivision of a State ... may not levy or collect a tax, fee, head charge, or other charge on ... an individual traveling in air commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040116\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). To the extent the company contemplates collection of the fee by the airlines, the FAA's Director of the Office of Aviation Analysis explained that Exhaustless's \"proposal would require the carriers to substantially redesign their technology to integrate a dynamic third-party fee\" and that it was \"unlikely that carriers would do this voluntarily.\" Homan Decl. \u00b6 4, FAA Add. A56. And if the companies decline to collect the fee voluntarily, Exhaustless does not explain the airports' authority to compel airlines to assess the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Fourth, adopting Exhaustless's proposal could jeopardize the United States' compliance with international agreements on commercial air travel. For instance, an agreement between the United States and Canada guarantees Canadian airlines a minimum of 42 slots at LaGuardia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Air Transport Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada, T.I.A.S. No. 07-312, Ann. II \u00a7 1 (Mar. 12, 2007). Yet Exhaustless evidently seeks to auction off all the slots at LaGuardia without regard to a carrier's nationality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, even if Exhaustless were able to overcome each of those hurdles, Aviation 2.0 remains an unproven product. The product has yet to be adopted by any airport in the nation even though the vast majority of them are not subject to FAA slot regulation and thus could adopt it today. We find it doubtful that two of the busiest airports in the nation would volunteer to act as the test sites for Aviation 2.0, even assuming the agency would permit them to do so. In view of all of those legal and practical obstacles, the notion that vacating the interim orders would create a business opportunity for Exhaustless amounts to mere conjecture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Our conclusion in that regard does not mean that the challenged interim orders are entirely insulated from review. Standing principles under Article III exist to ensure that a litigant alleges \"such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Summers v. Earth Island Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679229\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/488/#p493\">\n    555 U.S. 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 493,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679229\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/488/#p493\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679229\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/488/#p493\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). An airline or airport authority likely would have standing to petition for review of the orders. But no\n   member of the regulated community has joined Exhaustless's challenge or (as far as we know) filed its own petition for review, suggesting a form of acceptance among the parties having the most direct stake. Article III denies us any license to disrupt that evident acceptance today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss Exhaustless's petitions for review for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
