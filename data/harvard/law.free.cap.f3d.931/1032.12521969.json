As to the \u00a7 924(c) firearm charge in Count 5, the plea agreement specified that Hammoud possessed a firearm during the solicitation crime charged in Count 3. The district court dismissed the remaining nine counts and sentenced Hammoud to a total imprisonment term of 240 months, consisting of (1) concurrent 180-month sentences as to Counts 1 (retaliation) and 3 (solicitation); (2) a concurrent 120-month sentence as to Count 13 (felon in possession); and (3) a consecutive 60-month sentence as to Count 5 (the \u00a7 924(c) offense).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2006, Hammoud filed a direct appeal challenging his guilty pleas as to Counts 1 and 13 and his total sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his present application, Hammoud contends that his \u00a7 924(c) conviction in Count 5 is no longer constitutionally valid. Specifically, Hammoud asserts that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) 's residual clause is unconstitutional, in light of the new rule of constitutional law set forth in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and that his companion solicitation conviction in Count 3 could have qualified as a \"crime of violence\" only under \u00a7 924(c) 's now-defunct residual clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To determine whether Hammoud's proposed\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   claim meets the statutory criteria, we must first address three preliminary issues: (1) whether\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   announced\n   a new rule of constitutional law; (2) if so, whether\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   has been made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court; and (3) whether Hammoud's\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   claim is barred under our precedent in\n   <em>\n    In re Baptiste\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4336260\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/1337/\">\n    828 F.3d 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2016).

In doing so, the Supreme Court resolved a circuit split, rejecting the position (advocated for by the government in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   and adopted by this Court and two other federal circuit courts) that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) 's residual clause could be saved from unconstitutionality if read to encompass a conduct-specific, rather than a categorical, approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620706\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2319/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620706\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2319/\">\n    139 S.

As we have already explained, by striking down \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) 's residual clause,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   altered the range of conduct and the class of persons that the \u00a7 924(c) statute can punish in the same manner that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   affected the ACCA. In other words,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   announced a new substantive rule, and\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   tells us that a new rule such as the one announced in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   applies retroactively to criminal cases that became final before the new substantive rule was announced. Consequently, for purposes of \u00a7 2255(h)(2), we conclude that, taken together, the Supreme Court's holdings in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   \"necessarily dictate\" that\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   has been \"made\" retroactively applicable to criminal cases that became final before\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   was announced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313540\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/656/#p662\">\n    533 U.S. at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313540\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/656/#p662\">\n    121 S.

Having concluded that\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   announced a new substantive rule that applies retroactively to successive \u00a7 2255 movants like Hammoud, the third and final preliminary question we must confront, before addressing whether Hammoud has made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing of a\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   claim, is whether his\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   claim is barred under our precedent in\n   <em>\n    In re Baptiste\n   </em>\n   .

To be convicted under \u00a7 373, a defendant must solicit another person with the intent that the other person \"engage in conduct constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against property or against the person of another ... and under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, induces, or otherwise endeavors to persuade such other person to engage in such conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20373\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). While the murder conduct Hammoud solicited met the elements clause in \u00a7 373 to establish the \u00a7 373 conviction in Count 3, Hammoud was charged with a separate \u00a7 924(c) firearm offense in Count 5 where the \"solicitation\" of that murder conduct must also qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c) 's residual or elements clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has addressed whether \"solicitation\" of another to commit murder, in violation of \u00a7 373, qualifies as a crime of violence under only the residual clause or the elements clause or both clauses of \u00a7 924(c)(3). So Hammoud has made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that his \u00a7 924(c) conviction in Count 5 may-not that it does, but it may-implicate \u00a7 924(c) 's residual clause and\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(C), 2255(h)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078466\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/485/1351/#p1357\">\n    485 F.3d at 1357-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It is also important to note that our determination that Hammoud has made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that his \u00a7 924(c) conviction in Count 5 may implicate \u00a7 924(c) 's residual clause and\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   does not conclusively resolve the merits of that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5926652\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1268/#p1271\">\n    830 F.3d 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1271 (11th Cir. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078466\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/485/1351/#p1357\">\n    485 F.3d at 1357-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, in the district court, Hammoud will bear the burden of showing that he is actually entitled to relief on his\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   claim, meaning he will have to show that his \u00a7 924(c) conviction resulted from application of solely the residual clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Moore\n   </em>\n   , 830 F.3d at 1271-73 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beeman v.
