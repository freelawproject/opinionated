This, the General Assembly asserts, forces Tennessee to disturb its budget and violate its own constitution. The General Assembly raised this concern in the context of its complaint that Tennessee \"is not consulted or informed of the number of refugees that will be resettled within its borders ....\" The argument about consultation (or the General Assembly's clarification about balanced budget problems) was not raised substantially in its briefs.
