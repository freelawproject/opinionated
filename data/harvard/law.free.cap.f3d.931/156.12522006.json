We do not interpret the Settlement Agreement to preclude the award of post-settlement attorneys' fees. Furthermore, we disagree with Defendants-Appellants' argument that\n   <em>\n    Buckhannon\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    sub silentio\n   </em>\n   overruled\n   <em>\n    Delaware Valley\n   </em>\n   and barred any award of fees here. We agree with Defendants-Appellants, however, that as to several categories of work for which the district court awarded fees, the court misapplied the\n   <em>\n    Delaware Valley\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Therefore, we AFFIRM in part and VACATE in part the September 30, 2017 order of the district court awarding Plaintiffs-Appellees $470,727.57 in attorneys' fees and costs.

They were later joined by several organizations \"created by parents, disabled citizens and professionals to enforce the rights of persons with disabilities.\" Joint Appendix (\"J.A.\") 100 (Third Amended Complaint). The students alleged that they had attempted to obtain placement in \"regular classrooms in their neighborhood schools,\" but had been rejected by the local boards of education due to bias and prejudice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209707\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/546/#p561\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They brought suit under,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the IDEA requirement that children with disabilities, to the greatest extent possible, be educated in regular classes with children who are not disabled,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that they be placed in the \"least restrictive environment\" suitable to meet their needs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.114\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In December 1993, a class was certified of \"[a]ll mentally retarded school-age children in Connecticut who have been identified as needing special education and who, on or after February 20, 1991 are not educated in regular classrooms.\" J.A. 24-25. The matter was tried before District Judge Chatigny in early 2000. Before the court rendered a verdict, however, the parties entered into settlement negotiations with the help of Magistrate Judge Martinez. \"The negotiation process was bifurcated: the initial phase addressed the merits of the case and the second phase was to focus on attorneys' fees.\" S.A. 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In November 2000, the parties successfully reached a draft agreement on the substantive provisions of their settlement. That agreement contained five primary goals, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Connecticut State Department of Education would \"increase ... the percent\" of students with intellectual disabilities who participate in classes and extracurricular activities with non-disabled students. The draft agreement provided for the establishment of an \"Expert Advisory Panel\" (\"EAP\") consisting of four individuals, two selected by each of the parties. The EAP would, among other things, advise Connecticut in its implementation of the agreement, provide feedback on annual reports to be prepared by the State, and make recommendations on how best to implement the agreement's goals. The agreement also provided that Plaintiffs-Appellees were entitled to collect data on the class, and the State was generally obligated to cooperate in providing them with these data. The district court was to retain jurisdiction over the agreement for, at most, eight years; however, the parties agreed that after the first five years following the empaneling of the EAP, the court would have jurisdiction to consider only Plaintiffs-Appellees' motions for substantial noncompliance, if any were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Having settled on the substance of their agreement, the parties turned to negotiating attorneys' fees. Magistrate Judge Martinez asked Plaintiffs-Appellees' counsel to provide the court with all fee requests for work done up to November 28, 2000, the point when the parties began negotiating fees. Counsel for Plaintiffs-Appellees initially demanded payment of $972,115.91, but the parties ultimately agreed on $675,000. As of May 18, 2001, however, when the parties met with the Magistrate Judge to discuss some unrelated language in the draft agreement, the draft itself contained no language concerning attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under state law, the settlement agreement had to be approved by the Connecticut legislature. On June 6, 2001, Plaintiffs-Appellees learned that the draft agreement had been submitted to and accepted by the Connecticut General Assembly. But the agreement accepted by the legislature included a new provision absent from the draft agreement: Section X, entitled \"Payment.\" That section provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Defendants shall make to the Plaintiffs in P.J., et al v. State of Connecticut Board of Education, et al, a one-time payment of $675,000.00 in attorneys' fees and costs, payable to Attorney David Shaw, attorney for the Plaintiffs, within ninety (90) days of the effective date of the approval of this agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   J.A. 159 (Settlement Agreement). Plaintiffs-Appellees, who had not agreed to this additional section, protested to the Magistrate Judge, arguing that the inclusion of such a section, along with its \"one-time payment\" language, suggested that $675,000 would be the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   payment counsel was entitled to receive, even though the parties had not in fact agreed on a waiver of future fees. When the parties were unable\n   to agree on additional language to clarify the meaning of this new section, Plaintiffs-Appellees moved to enforce the draft settlement agreement without Section X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Magistrate Judge Martinez held yet another settlement conference with the parties in February 2002 in an effort to save the settlement. At this conference, the parties agreed on certain language to be included in a side letter regarding Section X, subject to discussions with Connecticut's legislative leadership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This additional language is contained in a letter dated March 1, 2002 (the \"Side Letter\"), from Defendants-Appellants' counsel to Plaintiffs-Appellees' counsel, and provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [T]he defendants do not interpret Section X of the draft agreement to preclude the Court from awarding reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to the plaintiffs upon a finding by the Court that the defendants had failed to substantially comply with the consent decree. The parties agree to be bound by controlling law on the issue of attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   S.A. 6. Upon reaching agreement on the Side Letter, the parties executed the Settlement Agreement on March 28, 2002. The court approved the settlement on May 22, 2002, following a fairness hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the Settlement Agreement went into force, the parties empaneled the EAP on August 12, 2002, which met with state and local education officials and made recommendations on how Defendants-Appellants could best comply with the Agreement. \"The defendants issued annual reports and provided extensive data to the plaintiffs and the EAP regarding their efforts and progress.\" S.A. 38. After five years, Defendants-Appellants disbanded the EAP. Plaintiffs-Appellees filed a motion for substantial noncompliance in April 2009, which led to an evidentiary hearing before the district court in June 2010. The district court ultimately denied that motion, concluding that Defendants-Appellants had made substantial progress toward meeting the Agreement's goals, and that neither the early disbanding of the EAP, nor any alleged issues with reclassification of class members-which Plaintiffs-Appellees claimed Defendants-Appellants did to obscure their actual progress toward Agreement goals-was sufficient to merit a finding of \"substantial noncompliance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.114\">\n    at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App'x 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 23 (2d Cir. 2013) (summary order). Throughout the life of the Agreement, Plaintiffs-Appellees also made many motions related to discovery, Defendants-Appellants' compliance, and attorneys' fees. None of these efforts resulted in any court-ordered relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 27, 2010, Plaintiffs-Appellees filed the motion for attorneys' fees and costs that is the subject of this appeal. They requested $906,010.85 in attorneys' fees and $197,181.15 in costs, including fees for work done from November 29, 2000, through March 20, 2002 (that is, after Plaintiffs-Appellees originally provided the court with their fee request during negotiations, but before execution of the Agreement), and from March 2002 through the 2010 filing of the instant motion. Most of the requested fees are for what the magistrate judge characterized as \"post-judgment monitoring and enforcement.\" S.A. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The district court first considered whether Plaintiffs-Appellees were entitled to seek fees beyond the $675,000 referenced in the Settlement Agreement, the terms of which Defendants-Appellants argued precluded any\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   fee awards. Second, the court considered whether additional fees were barred by the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Buckhannon\n   </em>\n   . Although the \"prevailing party\" is entitled to obtain attorneys' fees in cases like this one,\n   <em>\n    Buckhannon\n   </em>\n   defined a \"prevailing party,\" as that term is used in federal fee-shifting statutes, as one who has obtained a \"judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    532 U.S. at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants-Appellants contended that Plaintiffs-Appellees had obtained no judicially sanctioned change in the parties' legal relationship since the settlement, and thus were not a \"prevailing party,\" barring post-settlement fee awards under\n   <em>\n    Buckhannon\n   </em>\n   . The district court disagreed with Defendants-Appellants on both counts, adopting Magistrate Judge Martinez's recommended ruling that Plaintiffs-Appellees were not precluded from seeking an award of attorneys' fees and costs beyond the $675,000 obtained under the Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After determining that Plaintiffs-Appellees could seek further fees, the district court considered the numerous categories of fees for which Plaintiffs-Appellees were seeking payment. Magistrate Judge Martinez, in her recommended ruling regarding the fee motion, characterized the work for which fees were requested as falling within six distinct categories: (1) negotiating the pre-settlement claim; (2) notifying class members of the settlement; (3) empaneling the EAP; (4) monitoring implementation of the Settlement Agreement; (5) litigating attorneys' fees; and (6) litigating and pursuing a writ of mandamus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.A. 46-47. The fourth category, monitoring, contained the lion's share of the hours requested and was split into subcategories by the Magistrate Judge as she assessed what was compensable. Applying the Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Delaware Valley\n   </em>\n   , Magistrate Judge Martinez recommended that Plaintiffs-Appellees be awarded $321,165 in fees and $3,987.57 in costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88. The district court made several alterations to this recommendation, ultimately awarding $466,740 in fees and $3,987.57 in costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 90-92. Defendants-Appellants appealed the award, arguing not only that the district court had abused its discretion in awarding certain categories of fees to Plaintiffs-Appellees under the\n   <em>\n    Delaware Valley\n   </em>\n   standard, but also that Plaintiffs-Appellees should not have been allowed to receive any additional fees in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We resolve this case using the same framework as the district court. First, we consider whether Plaintiffs-Appellees may seek any additional fees (1) pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and (2) consistent with Supreme Court precedent. After answering those questions in the affirmative, we then turn to the particular categories of work for which the district court awarded fees to assess what is compensable under\n   <em>\n    Delaware Valley\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Consent decrees, such as the Settlement Agreement here, are construed as contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Broadcast Music, Inc. v.

J.A. 160 (Settlement Agreement). Section XI provides that the Agreement itself \"contains the complete and sole agreement of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894143\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/32/#p43\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These provisions together, Defendants-Appellants argue, unambiguously preclude Plaintiffs-Appellees from receiving any additional fees and costs, at least \"absent supplementary court-ordered relief.\" Def.-App. Br. at 40. For the following reasons, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In determining that the Settlement Agreement did not waive Plaintiffs-Appellees' right to seek future fees and costs, the Magistrate Judge correctly concluded that \"[t]he plain and unambiguous language of the settlement agreement does not manifest an intent to waive plaintiffs' statutory right to seek attorneys' fees.\" S.A. 14-15. Though Defendants-Appellants cite to several cases in an attempt to show that the Agreement's language\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   manifest such an intent, the cases cited are not analogous. In\n   <em>\n    Lide v.

Defendants-Appellants argue that because there was a provision in the Agreement requiring the EAP to review the annual reports and\n   submit comments, but no such provision requiring Plaintiffs-Appellees to do so, the district court's award for that work \"effectively rewrite[s]\" the Settlement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.-App. Br. at 67. But while it is true that the Settlement Agreement did not specifically\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs-Appellees to review or provide comments on the reports, the Agreement clearly anticipated that Plaintiffs-Appellees would receive these reports and the EAP's evaluation of them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 158 (Settlement Agreement) (providing that Defendants-Appellants would furnish Plaintiffs-Appellees with the annual report and that the EAP would give them its comments). In\n   <em>\n    Delaware Valley\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court approved a fee award without regard to whether the compensated work was contemplated in the consent decree; instead, the Court assessed only whether the work \"[p]rotect[ed] ... the full scope of relief afforded by the consent decree.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209707\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/546/#p561\">\n    478 U.S. at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209707\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/546/#p561\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209707\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/546/#p561\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (approving request for work related to commenting on regulations that was \"as necessary to the attainment of adequate relief for their client as was all of their earlier work\"). Here, therefore, we conclude-as the\n   <em>\n    Delaware Valley\n   </em>\n   Court did-that the district court committed no clear error in determining that Plaintiffs-Appellees' responses to the annual reports meaningfully contributed to enforcing the remedy that Plaintiffs-Appellees obtained through the Settlement Agreement by \"identif[ying] plaintiffs' concerns with defendants' performance so that issues could be discussed and resolved through the EAP.\" S.A. 61. Our conclusion is bolstered by an affidavit from an EAP member that described Plaintiffs-Appellees' work on the report responses as \"contribut[ing] significantly to the remedial process.\" J.A. 1557 (Sailor Affidavit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    Category 3.\n   </strong>\n   Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in awarding 200.8 hours for Plaintiffs-Appellees' attorneys' time spent preparing for and attending the EAP meetings. The magistrate awarded 229.4 hours for time spent on this work, which was a 20% reduction from the amount requested for preparing and attending the meetings as well as a 50% reduction to all time described as travel time. The magistrate's recommended award for preparation and attendance was further reduced by the district judge by 28.6 hours. Defendants-Appellants again argue that the district court impermissibly expanded upon the parties' bargain, as there was no role for attorneys at the EAP meetings and the Settlement Agreement did not contemplate them being there. We again disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As with the time spent responding to reports, just because the Settlement Agreement did not expressly provide for attorneys' attendance at the meetings, that does not mean their work was not of the sort \"ordinarily necessary\" to secure the Agreement's result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delaware Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209707\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/546/#p561\">\n    478 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209707\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/546/#p561\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). According to the Agreement, the EAP meetings were about \"[f]acilitat[ing] the defendant's compliance with [the] Agreement, identifying difficulties in compliance, facilitating resolution of compliance issues without court intervention, and referring to the court issues that cannot be resolved by discussion and negotiation.\" J.A. 158 (Settlement Agreement). It is perfectly logical that attorneys' attendance at these meetings would be useful in securing full enforcement of the Settlement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1557-58 (Sailor Affidavit) (\"Plaintiffs' counsels' participation was also instrumental in resolving issues that otherwise would have had to be submitted to the Court for resolution.\"). To the extent Defendants-Appellants take issue with the district court's\n   decision to award fees for\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   attorneys' work in this category, that decision was well within the court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

The court reasoned that such information \"was helpful to plaintiffs' efforts to monitor compliance with the Settlement Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66. We agree with the district court's conclusion in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   One item in contention in the parties' negotiations over the list was the provision of personally identifiable information on students in the class, which Plaintiffs-Appellees wanted. While Defendants-Appellants did not believe they were required by the Agreement to provide such information, they offered to send opt-out notifications to class members under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g, so that the information could then be released from consenting families, in compliance with the law. Instead of agreeing to Defendants-Appellants' offer, Plaintiffs-Appellees filed a motion in January 2005 to enforce the Settlement Agreement, arguing that Defendants-Appellants had failed \"to provide and update a list of class members\" as required by the Agreement. S.A. 66 (internal quotation marks omitted). But before the motion could be ruled on, the parties agreed to Defendants-Appellants' original plan to send FERPA notifications and create a list based on those responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Settlement Agreement plainly contemplates Plaintiffs-Appellees' access to class data to allow them to monitor Defendants-Appellants' progress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 149 (Settlement Agreement) (requiring that Defendants-Appellants provide Plaintiffs-Appellees with an updated class list and giving Plaintiffs-Appellees the right to challenge that list as inadequate). In the absence of a data set that allowed Plaintiffs-Appellees to track students across the years, it would be practically impossible for them to track Defendants-Appellants' progress on the Agreement's goals or to understand any potential reclassification issues. Thus, we agree with the district court that negotiations with Defendants-Appellants over the class list fell well within what was \"useful\" or \"of the type ordinarily necessary\" to secure enforcement of the Settlement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delaware Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209707\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/546/#p561\">\n    478 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209707\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/546/#p561\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   However, the court went beyond the scope of\n   <em>\n    Delaware Valley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Quaratino\n   </em>\n   when it awarded time for Plaintiffs-Appellees'\n   <em>\n    unsuccessful\n   </em>\n   motion to enforce. The hours Plaintiffs-Appellees spent on the motion to enforce could have been avoided if they had accepted Defendants-Appellants' initial offer. We therefore vacate the award of 57.2 hours insofar as it includes hours related to the motion to enforce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quaratino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397357\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/422/#p425\">\n    166 F.3d at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he district court should exclude ... unnecessary hours ....\"). On remand, we direct the district court to disallow all fees relating to Plaintiffs-Appellees' January 2005 motion to enforce. Nonetheless, the district court in its discretion may award fees for pre-motion class list negotiations, as well as activities it considers to have been helpful in\n   <em>\n    implementing\n   </em>\n   the FERPA-compliant notification system as originally proposed by Defendants-Appellants and ultimately agreed to by the parties in March 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    Category 6.\n   </strong>\n   Lastly, while the Magistrate Judge declined to award any fees for work on the unsuccessful motions for substantial noncompliance and the associated evidentiary hearing, concluding such work did not fall within the\n   <em>\n    Delaware Valley\n   </em>\n   standard, the district court awarded 240 hours (approximately 28% of what Plaintiffs-Appellees requested for this category of work), determining that the request for an evidentiary hearing was \"reasonably necessary to protect the rights of the class members.\" S.A. 91. As noted above, unsuccessful work normally does not merit a fee award; however, unsuccessful work that is \"inextricably intertwined\" with successful work may be compensable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Quaratino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397357\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/422/#p425\">\n    166 F.3d at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs-Appellees argue that the evidentiary hearing was useful because it resulted in the creation of another report describing Defendants-Appellants' progress on the Agreement's goals based on an analysis of the longitudinal database. However, by the time Plaintiffs-Appellees received this new report, the court had already been divested of jurisdiction over the Settlement Agreement, except with regard to motions for substantial noncompliance. Thus, to the extent that receipt of this new data and report was \"useful and of the type ordinarily necessary\" to enforce the Settlement Agreement, that could be true only in the context of a successful motion for substantial noncompliance. As Plaintiffs-Appellees\n   <em>\n    lost\n   </em>\n   their motion, we see no reason to consider the production of the data \"useful or necessary.\" We decline to reward data collection for the sake of data collection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For that reason, we conclude that awarding any fees for work related to this motion was an abuse of discretion.
