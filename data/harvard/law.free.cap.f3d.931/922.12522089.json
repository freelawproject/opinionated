Here, the district court granted Plaintiff-Appellee Ilyas Khrapunov's application for discovery under \u00a7 1782. However, the factual circumstances surrounding Khrapunov's application have changed dramatically during the pendency of this appeal. We therefore vacate the decision below and remand to the district court to consider, in the first instance, whether the statutory requirements for discovery under \u00a7 1782 remain satisfied and whether, as a matter of the district court's discretion, discovery remains appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Khrapunov filed a \u00a7 1782 application in federal district court, seeking issuance of a subpoena to Google, Inc., compelling the disclosure of certain subscriber information in the company's possession. That information, Khrapunov claimed, would aid his attempt to discharge two court orders issued against him in ongoing litigation in England.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The proceedings in England stem from Khrapunov's alleged role in the misappropriation of billions of dollars from JSC BTA Bank, a major bank in Kazakhstan. The bank alleges that, with Khrapunov's assistance, the bank's prior chairman, Mukhtar Ablyazov, defrauded it of nearly $6 billion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The bank obtained two court orders in the English litigation relevant to this appeal: an order imposing a worldwide freeze of Khrapunov's assets, and an order permitting the bank's attorneys to cross-examine Khrapunov concerning his assets. Khrapunov filed separate applications in the English litigation to discharge the worldwide freeze order and the cross-examination order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In August 2017, Khrapunov filed his \u00a7 1782 application in the Northern District of California, requesting that a subpoena issue to Google. The application was assigned to a magistrate judge who granted the application, and the subpoena issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellants-Objectors Pavel Prosyankin and John Doe\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   moved to quash the subpoena. The magistrate judge declined to quash the subpoena in its entirety but did narrow its scope somewhat. Objectors then sought review by the district court. The district court denied relief, and Objectors appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While these matters were pending in district court and on appeal, the proceedings in England continued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to a supplemental declaration provided by Objectors on appeal, in February and May 2018, Khrapunov's attempts to discharge the two court orders against him-the asset freeze order and the cross-examination order-were denied by English courts. Khrapunov was not given permission to appeal those denials, and at least one judge found Khrapunov's arguments to be \"totally without merit.\" According to Objectors, this means Khrapunov's discharge applications have \"been finally determined against him, and Mr. Khrapunov cannot appeal or pursue them any further.\" Khrapunov does not dispute that the discharge applications have been finally decided and that his request to appeal has been denied. Instead, he argues that he retains the ability to reopen those proceedings if he discovers new evidence-like the subscriber information he seeks from Google.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Objectors argue that the English courts' final, nonappealable denials of Khrapunov's applications render this case moot. Alternatively, Objectors argue that the district court applied the incorrect standard in reviewing the magistrate judge's decision and that the district court abused its discretion by failing to properly weigh the relevant factors when considering whether to grant the application under \u00a7 1782.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    In re Premises Located at 840 140th Ave. NE, Bellevue, Wash.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4095549\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/557/#p567\">\n    634 F.3d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 567 (9th Cir. 2011).

In this case, in light of the developments in the English litigation, we conclude that some additional fact-finding about the nature of the English \"proceeding\" is necessary-about the discovery sought and its relationship to the\n   possibility of reopening the English proceedings; about the standard Khrapunov must satisfy to reopen those proceedings; about the relative likelihood of satisfying that standard; and about whether the discovery sought will actually assist Khrapunov in satisfying that standard.

No one-including appellants, Pavel Prosyankin and John Doe (collectively, Objectors), and the majority-disputes that Khrapunov satisfied that requirement. Khrapunov is a party to an ongoing lawsuit in England.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Naturally, during the past two years while the parties have been litigating whether the requested discovery should be allowed, the litigation in England has carried on. Citing further developments in the foreign proceeding, the majority imposes on Khrapunov an ongoing burden of proving the statutory elements for eligibility for discovery at all stages of the case. Not only is there no support in the statute or our case law for imposing such a continuing burden, it's also bad policy. The majority's holding arms would-be discovery targets with a tool for evading discovery under \u00a7 1782. By simply forcing re-litigation of discovery eligibility based on the precise procedural posture of the foreign proceeding each time some new development occurs in the foreign case, a would-be discovery target can stall until the foreign proceeding ends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In addition to undermining the statutory aim of efficiency, the majority's holding foists upon district courts the task of adjudicating the significance of each procedural development in the foreign case. This is contrary to our edict that federal courts resolving \u00a7 1782 applications should not \"involve themselves in technical questions of foreign law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Request For Judicial Assistance From the Seoul Dist.

If, upon remand, the magistrate judge again concludes that the statutory elements are still satisfied-which is what I would conclude-the parties would essentially be back to square one without resolution of the questions squarely before us now. I would address the issues raised by the parties, including the question of first impression regarding the Federal Magistrates Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In my view, Objectors have not met their heavy burden of showing mootness, and we thus have jurisdiction and should decide this case on the merits. In addressing the merits of the case, I would hold that a ruling resolving objections to a subpoena issued under \u00a7 1782 is dispositive, and thus, absent consent by the parties to a magistrate judge having general jurisdiction, such a matter must be determined de novo by a district court judge. The district court here reviewed the magistrate judge's ruling for clear error. Accordingly, although the magistrate judge's analysis of the relevant factors under \u00a7 1782 was reasonable, I would vacate and remand for a district judge to determine the matter de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Objectors assert three grounds for vacating or reversing the district court's decision: (1) the court lacks jurisdiction because the case is moot; (2) the magistrate judge lacked the authority to issue the order denying in part the motion to quash; and (3) relevant considerations weigh against allowing discovery under \u00a7 1782.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Objectors argue that recent developments in the English court proceedings have rendered the \u00a7 1782 application moot. They argue that the orders issued by the English courts after the magistrate judge's order here have effectively foreclosed Khrapunov's ability to challenge the worldwide asset freeze and cross-examination orders and such a challenge was the only basis offered by Khrapunov for seeking discovery under \u00a7 1782.

The English trial courts denied Khrapunov's discharge applications, and the English Court of Appeal has now denied Khrapunov permission to appeal the two interlocutory orders.

Objectors overstate the matter when suggesting that Khrapunov has \"no ability\" to introduce evidence in the English court proceedings. In his declaration, Objectors' English law expert, Anthony Beswetherick, describes his experience in and knowledge of the English court system, identifies the recent court decisions in the English court proceedings, and explains the significance of those decisions. Beswetherick opines that, as a matter of English civil procedure, \"Mr. Khrapunov's Discharge Applications have been finally determined against him, and Mr. Khrapunov cannot appeal or pursue them any further.\" However, Beswetherick also discusses a procedure by which Khrapunov could seek to \"reopen\" his request for permission to appeal the denial of his discharge applications. Although Beswetherick characterizes the requirements meriting a reopening of the request as \"highly restrictive\" and \"strictly applied,\" he acknowledges that the possibility nonetheless remains. A case \"becomes moot only when it is\n   <em>\n    impossible\n   </em>\n   for a [federal] court to grant any effectual relief.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407170\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/298/#p307\">\n    567 U.S. at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407170\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/298/#p307\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Here, the records before us reflect that the litigation in England is ongoing.

First, he argues that, under our functional approach, Objectors' motion to quash is ancillary and does not dispose of underlying claims or defenses. But the motion to quash is \"ancillary\" only to the foreign proceedings. As we held in\n   <em>\n    Flam\n   </em>\n   , the issue is whether the decision grants or denies the ultimate relief sought\n   <em>\n    in the federal court proceeding\n   </em>\n   , not whether the decision will dispose of claims or defenses in the underlying proceedings to be litigated elsewhere.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231054\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/1043/#p1046\">\n    788 F.3d at 1046-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that remand orders are dispositive even though such orders do not resolve any underlying claim or defense).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Second, Khrapunov argues that the denial of a motion to quash in a \u00a7 1782 proceeding is non-dispositive because the prospect of additional litigation remains if, for example, the subpoenaed party fails to comply with the court's order. But that possibility exists in virtually all cases, even after the entry of a final judgment. For example, a plaintiff whose lawsuit results in a money judgment may face further litigation if the defendant does not willingly pay the judgment; yet there is no doubt the ultimate decision in a civil lawsuit (e.g., a money judgment) is dispositive within the meaning of \u00a7 636(b)(1) and Rule 72. The possibility that a party may defy the court's order granting or denying the ultimate relief sought is not a basis for concluding that such an order is non-dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Third, Khrapunov relies on our decision in\n   <em>\n    Four Pillars Enters. Co. v.

But in that case, we did not decide, let alone consider, the issue presented here-whether rulings on \u00a7 1782 applications are dispositive. We had no occasion to consider the issue because the appellant did not raise it. Instead, the appellant argued only that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in denying the discovery, implicitly conceding that the magistrate judge was authorized to decide its discovery request under \u00a7 1782.
