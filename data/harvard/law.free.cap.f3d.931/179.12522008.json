The sole question presented is whether, under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k, a nonvoting board observer affiliated with an issuer's placement agent is a \"person who, with his consent, is named in the registration statement as being or about to become a director[ ] [or] person performing similar functions ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 77k(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   We think not. As required by the text of \u00a7 77k(a)(3), our inquiry begins and ends with the registration statement's description of the Defendants. We hold as a matter of law that the Defendants' functions are not \"similar\" to those that board directors perform, so we will reverse the District Court's order and direct the entry of summary judgment for the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Tibet Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a holding company. Through an array of parent-subsidiary relationships and contractual rights, Tibet \"effectively control[led]\" Yunnan Shangri-La Tibetan Pharmaceutical Group Limited (Yunnan), an operating company that manufactured and sold traditional Tibetan medicines.\n   <em>\n    Dartell v. Tibet Pharm., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201944106\">\n    2017 WL 1944106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D.N.J. May 10, 2017). This case involves Tibet's attempt to raise capital for those operations through an initial public offering (IPO).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hayden Zou was an early investor in Tibet and the sole director of China Tibetan Pharmaceuticals Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tibet. Tibet's ability to control Yunnan flowed through China Tibetan. In late 2009, Zou told L. McCarthy Downs, III, a managing director at the investment bank Anderson &amp; Strudwick, Inc. (A&amp;S), about Tibet. The two discussed the prospect of a Tibet IPO, and A&amp;S later agreed to serve as Tibet's placement agent. Zou and Downs then worked together to bring Tibet public. Tibet's IPO registration statement became effective in late 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Zou and Downs were neither signatories to the registration statement nor named in it as directors of Tibet. Instead, they were listed as nonvoting board observers chosen by A&amp;S. Though Zou and Downs would have no formal powers or duties, the registration statement explained \"they may\n   nevertheless significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.\" App. 178.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As it turned out, the registration statement\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   omitted material negative information about Yunnan's finances. Yunnan had defaulted on a loan from the Chinese government a few months before Tibet's registration statement became effective and that default led to a judgment that required repayment within 60 days. Though the registration statement described a \"long term loan,\" it said nothing about the default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Just before Tibet filed its amended final prospectus, the Chinese government froze all of Yunnan's assets. Tibet did not disclose that either. The IPO closed soon thereafter, and Tibet and its underwriters offered 3 million shares to the public at $ 5.50 per share. But Yunnan still hadn't paid what it owed, so the Agricultural Bank of China auctioned off the company's assets. This prompted the NASDAQ to halt trading in Tibet's stock, and its price plummeted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs sued Zou, Downs, Tibet, A&amp;S, the IPO's auditor, and several other Defendants on behalf of a class of stock purchasers. As relevant to this certified interlocutory appeal, Plaintiffs alleged Zou and Downs violated Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 11 imposes near-strict liability for untruths and omissions made in a registration statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Suprema Specialties, Inc.

At the outset, the Court held that only the Defendants' description in the registration statement itself is relevant to the inquiry. Turning to the merits, the Court observed Zou and Downs were named in the registration statement as about to become \"board observers\" appointed by Tibet's placement agent. In a section titled \"Relationship with our Placement Agent,\" the registration statement describes their role:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    We will have an ongoing relationship with our Placement Agent that may impact our shareholders' ability to impact decisions related to our operations.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In connection with this offering, we have agreed to allow our Placement Agent to designate two non-voting observers to our Board of Directors until the earlier of the date that: (i) the investors that purchase shares in this offering beneficially own less than five percent (5%) of our outstanding shares; or (ii) the trading price per share is at least [$ 24 per share] for any consecutive 15 trading day period.

In the Court's view, because Zou and Downs had the power to \"influence,\" this meant they \"arguably had more influence than any individual board member, who could only cast a single vote.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201944106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The Court's only hesitation\" in denying summary judgment was that the registration statement used the word \"may\" rather than \"shall\" or \"will.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11. That meant it \"was not necessarily mandatory that the Board Observers exercise their 'significant influence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Still, the Court determined that whether Zou and Downs were covered by \u00a7 11 was a jury question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Zou and Downs moved for certification of that order under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The District Court granted the motion, finding the underlying legal question-whether Zou and Downs could be liable under \u00a7 11-met the requirements of \u00a7 1292(b). First, the District Court found the question was a controlling question of law, because its conclusion would create reversible error if we disagreed on appeal. Second, the District Court found there was substantial ground for difference of opinion, despite the question being one of first impression in the courts of appeals, because \"Section 11 is narrowly construed\" and reasonable jurists could therefore disagree with its conclusion.\n   <em>\n    Dartell v. Tibet Pharm., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20994896\">\n    2018 WL 994896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (D.N.J. Feb. 21, 2018). Finally, the Court thought an interlocutory appeal would materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, because it had already granted summary judgment for Zou and Downs on all counts save the one alleging \u00a7 11 liability. If we disagreed with the District Court, the litigation would thus be at an end. So the District Court certified the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Can Defendants be potentially liable under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, each as a \"person performing similar functions\" to a director, in light of Defendants' role as board observers who could (but did not necessarily have to) significantly influence the outcome of\n   matters submitted to the board of directors for approval?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Order at 2, No. 2-14-cv-03620 (D.N.J.

It follows from that holding that whether one is a proper defendant under \u00a7 77k(a)(3) is a question of law for the court, not a question of fact for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   What evidence is relevant to our inquiry? Section 77k(a)(3) asks whether a defendant is \"with his consent, [ ]\n   <em>\n    named in the registration statement as\n   </em>\n   being or about to become ... [a] person performing similar functions\" to a director. (Emphasis added). The phrase \"named in the registration statement as\" compels reference to the description provided there. And \u00a7 77k(a)(3)'s text, structure, surrounding provisions, and requirement of consent to be named all tell us that the inquiry stops there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For starters, it would be odd as a matter of logic to consider defendants' real-world\n   actions to determine whether they were \"named\" in a specified document as \"about\" to perform certain functions. To \"name\" a person as \"about\" to do something is to make a prediction. And \u00a7 77k(a)(3) asks only whether the issuer made that prediction in its registration statement. Whether the prediction was well-supported when it was made and whether it came true are irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Section 77k(a)(3)'s syntax leads to the same conclusion. To hold extrinsic evidence relevant would substitute an \"and\" for the \"as\"-so that once a court finds a person \"named\" in the registration statement, it then determines whether in fact the person's role is, or will be, director-like. But the statute doesn't say \"named in the registration statement\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   ... about to become ... [a] person performing similar functions.\" Read slightly differently, Plaintiffs' preferred interpretation would excise the phrase \"named in the registration statement as\" altogether and rewrite \u00a7 77k(a)(3) to say \"every person who, with his consent, is or is about to become a director [or] person performing similar functions.\" That language too would ask whether Zou and Downs were in fact about to become quasi-directors. And it would make sense then to consider extrinsic evidence. But \u00a7 77k(a)(3) doesn't say that either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Our reading is also supported by \u00a7 77k(a)'s provision for expert liability, which uses language much like \u00a7 77k(a)(3) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Every accountant, engineer, or appraiser, or any person whose profession gives authority to a statement made by him,\n   <em>\n    who has with his consent been named as having prepared or certified\n   </em>\n   any part of the registration statement, or as having prepared or certified any report or valuation which is used in connection with the registration statement,\n   <em>\n    with respect to the statement in such registration statement, report, or valuation, which purports to have been prepared or certified by him\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a)(4) (emphases added). By making the \"statement\" the subject of the phrase \"purports to have been prepared or certified,\" \u00a7 77k(a)(4) limits the inquiry into whether an expert is \"named as having prepared or certified\" the statement to the face of the document in which it's made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herman &amp; MacLean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196891\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/375/\">\n    459 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   386 n.22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196891\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/375/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining \"accountants with respect to parts of a registration statement which they are not named as having prepared or certified\" cannot be held liable under \u00a7 77k(a)(4) \"even if [they] engaged in fraudulent conduct while participating in the registration statement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Of course, there was no reason to include the \"purports to have been prepared or certified\" language in \u00a7 77k(a)(3). That's because liability under \u00a7 77k(a)(3) is not limited to particular statements within the registration statement. But \u00a7 77k(a)(4) confirms the commonsense construction that the phrase \"named ... as\" asks only about the words of the document doing the naming.

Registration statements in public securities offerings are addressed to the whole investing public and are likely to describe putative defendants' functions in familiar but technical terms of art. It is important for issuers, investors, and putative defendants to know the scope of quasi-director liability. We hold that whether a defendant is \"named in the registration statement as being or about to become a director[ ] [or] person performing similar functions,\" \u00a7 77k(a)(3), is a question of law for the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As we have explained, the function of a board of directors is to direct and manage the company's affairs. Individual directors do this by formal voting. And because each director bears part of the ultimate responsibility for the company's fate, each owes duties of care and loyalty and may be voted out for mismanagement (or for no reason at all). Zou and Downs's roles, as described in the registration statement, are not \"of a like nature or kind,\"\n   <em>\n    Similar\n   </em>\n   , Oxford English Dictionary 59 (1st ed. 1933).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Three features differentiate Zou and Downs from directors. First, and most fundamentally, Zou and Downs cannot vote for board action. Second, they are aligned with the placement agent, A&amp;S, not Tibet. And third, their tenures are set to end automatically, with no opportunity to vote them out. Without the ability to manage the company's affairs, Zou and Downs lack directors' most basic power. As agents of Tibet's placement agent, their loyalties aren't with Tibet's shareholders-and loyalty to shareholders is as vital to directorship as the power to manage. And unlike Tibet's directors, their tenure is not subject to shareholder vote. Add to that the registration statement's express provision for directors' fiduciary duties, with no similar provision for Zou and Downs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Consider a hypothetical investment analyst for a research firm. Like Zou and Downs, he owes no duties to the issuer and is affiliated with a different entity. He might also enjoy special access to the issuer's board and management.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Regulation FD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20243.100\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 243.100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (seeking to curtail special access to non-public information). Or he might not. But either way, access to managers and directors alone does not make a person a quasi-director. Consider the analyst's power to influence the issuer's board. It might be substantial, depending on the analyst's reputation and influence in the industry. Or it might not. In either case, he has the same \"power\" Zou and Downs do-the \"possibility\" of \"significantly influenc[ing] the outcome of matters submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.\" App. 178. The analyst's influence-his power to persuade-might even \"impact [the issuer's] shareholders' ability to impact decisions related to [its] operations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20243.100\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Or it might not. But no one would argue that our hypothetical analyst is in any meaningful way \"similar\" to a board member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Our conclusion is also supported by Securities Act \u00a7 6(a) and the consent requirement of \u00a7 77k(a)(3). And it fits both the scant caselaw interpreting \u00a7 77k(a)(3) and the only case in which our Court has interpreted parallel language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, Securities Act \u00a7 6(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77f(a), which lists who must sign\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the registration statement, suggests \"similarity\" requires a close identity with the core functions we've described. The registration statement must be signed by \"the majority of [the] board of directors or persons performing similar functions (or, if there is no board of directors or persons performing similar functions, by the majority of the persons or board\n   <em>\n    having the power of management of the issuer\n   </em>\n   ) ....\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77f(a) (emphasis added). This suggests that having \"the power of management of the issuer\" (a power the board delegates to management) is not even enough to qualify as \"similar.\" But management has far more formal power than Zou and Downs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, \u00a7 77k(a)(3) imposes liability only on a person named in the registration statement as a director or similar \"with his consent.\" Consent can't be inferred merely by the appearance of one's name in the registration statement. By regulation, the registration statement must include express, written consent, filed as an exhibit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20230.438\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The two district courts to consider the phrase suggested it requires something like formal powers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mersay v.

Far from it. That Zou and Downs, as nonvoting observers, \"may\" influence board decisions is not a grant of power at all.

That limitation is based on language in \u00a7 77k(a)(3) (\"named in the registration statement as\") that does not appear in \u00a7 16.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 16(a)(1), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78p(a)(1) (\"Every person\n    <em>\n     who is\n    </em>\n    directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any class of any equity security ... or who is a director or an officer of the issuer of such security, shall file the statements required by this subsection with the Commission.\" (emphasis added)). Section 16, unlike \u00a7 77k(a)(3), invites an inquiry into the actual circumstances of a purported director.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Once we accept that distinction, our holding accords with the release provisions Plaintiffs cite.

We should thereby specifically consider whether the defendant is named in the registration statement as being or about to become a person performing similar functions to a director with respect to the drafting, publication, or accuracy of the registration statement itself.

In fact, the majority looks elsewhere in its opinion to \"the Exchange Act definition of director\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 184 (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(7) )), and Defendants likewise rely on the SEC's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Accordingly, a person may be named as performing similar functions to a director even if he or she does not possess the directors' \"formal power to direct and manage a corporation, and the responsibilities and duties that accompany those powers\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 185 (footnote omitted)). On the contrary, he or she is a person named in the registration statement as being or about to become a person performing similar functions if, pursuant to this statement, he or she possesses powers or abilities that are of a like nature or kind as the power to direct or manage the affairs of the corporation. As the District Court aptly explained, \"a defendant may be held liable if he had the ability to exercise similar control and management as a director when the registration statement at issue was filed or was named as about to assume such a role in the registration statement, even if the corporation at issue also had a board of directors or persons about to be named directors.\"\n   <em>\n    Dartell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201944106\">\n    2017 WL 1944106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.

See \"Management - Board of Directors Observer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (JA178.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   According to the majority, there are three features differentiating Defendants from directors: (1) \"First, and most fundamentally, Zou and Downs cannot vote for board action\" while individual directors direct and manage company affairs by means of formal voting (Majority Opinion at 189); (2) they are aligned with the placement agent as opposed to Tibet and its shareholders; and (3) their tenures are set to end automatically without any opportunity for the shareholders to vote them out. There are some obvious differences between observers as described by the registration statement and directors (after all, even the registration statement acknowledged Defendants' inability to vote), and I agree with the District Court that \"simply being named a board observer did not open Downs or Zou up to Section 11 liability because the title does not indicate that such a position necessarily performs similar functions to a director,\"\n   <em>\n    Dartell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201944106\">\n    2017 WL 1944106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10. However, the registration statement went beyond merely identifying two non-voting board observers. It also indicated that: (1) most importantly, Defendants may nevertheless significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted to the Board of Directors for approval; (2) Defendants are aligned with the placement agent in exercising this significant influence over Board action-serving as the placement agent's own \"eyes and ears at Board meetings\" as Defendants put it (Appellants' Reply Brief at 12 (footnote omitted))-and could not be voted out by the shareholders; (3) in order to observe and exercise their significant influence, Defendants implicitly have the right to inside information, to attend meetings of the Board of Directors, and to speak or otherwise share their opinions; and (4) Defendants are entitled to the same pay as \"our independent directors receive\" (JA178, JA230) and (like the members of the Board of Directors) are also eligible for reimbursement for attending Board meetings (although their reimbursement is capped).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Given the plain language of the registration statement, Defendants are clearly named as possessing powers or abilities that are of a like nature or kind as the directors' power to direct or manage the affairs of the corporation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   The prospectus does not define any of the words used to describe the Board Observers' role. As a result, the Court turns to dictionary definitions. First, the statement indicates that Board Observers would have the ability to influence the Tibet Board. \"Influence\" is defined as \"the power or capacity of causing an effect in indirect or intangible ways.\"\n   <em>\n    Influence\n   </em>\n   , [Merriam-Webster Dictionary] (2016). Next, the description provides that this influence would be significant. \"Significant\" means \"of a noticeably or measurably large amount.\"\n   <em>\n    Significant\n   </em>\n   , [Merriam-Webster Dictionary] (2016). Thus, the language \"significantly influence\" indicates that the two Board Observers could play a critical role in board decisions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. In fact, the registration statement \"does not place a limit on whom or what they may influence,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and Defendants' thereby may \"significantly\" influence the outcome of all matters submitted to the Board-which, according to the statement, \"makes all relevant [Tibet] decisions\" (JA229). In turn, \"our Placement Agent's observers\" were appointed \"[i]n connection with this offering\" (JA178, JA230), indicating that Defendants' capacity for significant influence is linked to the public offering itself.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Herman &amp; MacLean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196891\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/375/\">\n    459 U.S. at 381-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196891\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/375/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that Section 11 was \"designed to assure compliance with the disclosure provisions of the Act by imposing a stringent standard of liability on the parties who play a direct role in a registered offering\" (footnotes omitted)). Furthermore, similar compensation points to similarity in functions. After all, compensation (at least theoretically) reflects the sort of work the individual has performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   According to the majority, \"[t]hat Zou and Downs, as nonvoting observers, 'may' influence board decisions is not a grant of power at all.\" (Majority Opinion at 191.) It compares Defendants to a hypothetical investment analyst for a research firm, who might (or might not) have special access to the issuer's board of directors and management, power to influence the board based on the analyst's reputation and influence in the industry, and whose \"influence-his power to persuade-might even 'impact [the issuer's] shareholders' ability to impact decisions related to [its] operations' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 189 (quoting JA178)). However, we do not-and should not-decide whether this imaginary analyst is named as being or about to become a director or a person performing similar functions. In any event, there is no indication that the analyst resembles \"our Placement Agent observers\" (JA230) and is entitled to similar compensation as the directors. The majority continues to insist that Section 11(a)(3) \"includes only persons who, on the face of the registration statement, exercise formal power similar to directors\" (Majority Opinion at 186 n.6)-even though someone need not have any \"formal powers\" to perform similar functions under Section 11(a)(3). In fact, influence is itself a form of power, defined as \"\n   <em>\n    the power or capacity\n   </em>\n   of causing an effect in indirect or intangible ways.\"\n   <em>\n    Influence\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2016) (emphasis added). Under the plain language of the registration statement, such \"significant\" power over the outcome of matters submitted to the Board of Directors for approval is of a like nature or kind to the formal powers that directors possess to direct and manage the company's affairs. In fact, Defendants may have more real power than the nominal members of the Board of Directors. The majority recognizes that directors act as a board and that it is the board of directors that manages the corporation's affairs. In short, an individual director or group of directors may vote and lose on matters submitted to the Board for approval and thereby fail to influence the outcome of such matters while Defendants \"may nevertheless significantly influence the outcome of [the] matter[ ]\" (JA178). In such circumstances, the statutory language and purpose plainly mandate holding such individuals liable under Section 11(a)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the District Court's denial of summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    I agree with the majority that, in considering a claim under Section 11(a)(3), we must look to what is actually stated in the registration statement (as opposed to the defendant's real-world actions). I, however, do not agree that \"whether one is a proper defendant under \u00a7 77k(a)(3) is a question of law for the court, not a question of fact for the jury.\" (Majority Opinion at 186.) While judges often do construe written instruments, there are some clear exceptions. For example, if a contract is susceptible to multiple reasonable interpretations, the contract is ambiguous, and the jury is tasked with resolving that ambiguity.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Baldwin v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4102989\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/636/69/#p76\">\n     636 F.3d 69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 76 (3d Cir. 2011) ;\n    <em>\n     Ram Const. Co. v. Am. States Ins. Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6561200,633164\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/749/1049/\">\n     749 F.2d 1049\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1052 (3d Cir. 1984). The whole concept of similarity also appears to trigger the sort of open-ended factual assessment that a jury would usually be expected to undertake, i.e., deciding whether something is more or less \"similar\" to something else and whether this similarity is enough to satisfy the statutory scheme. In this case, Zou \"was an early investor in Tibet and the sole director of [China Tibetan], a wholly owned subsidiary of Tibet.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 181.) \"Tibet's ability to control Yunnan flowed through China Tibetan.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) It was Zou who told the placement agent and Downs about Tibet, and the two Defendants \"then worked together to bring Tibet public.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Zou opened China Tibetan's HSBC Hong Kong bank account, and his name remained on the account. Defendants insist that Zou's name was supposed to be removed, he did not make any withdrawals or transfers into or out of the China Tibetan account, Tibet's CEO and its cashier had complete control over the account, and Tibet had full control over the IPO proceeds, which were deposited into another account held by Tibet. However, more than $ 4 million was deposited into China Tibetan's account just two days after the proceeds were transferred to Tibet's HSBC Hong Kong account, and approximately $ 3.5 million in cash was then withdrawn from the China Tibetan account less than a month later. In any event, I believe that Plaintiffs prevail even if the present inquiry is characterized as a question of law for the courts to decide.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    I also am not persuaded by the other arguments raised by the majority opinion, including the case law it cites.

Instead, it \"applied a phrase in a National Association of Securities Dealers arbitration provision\" (Majority Opinion at 190) and, in any event, \"held a purportedly independent contractor 'perform[ed] similar functions' to those of a 'branch manager' of a broker-dealer\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     First Liberty\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1344558\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/145/647/\">\n     145 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    651-52 )). Applying a state blue sky statute, the Sixth Circuit explained that \"Clayton offered no facts on summary judgment from which we could infer that Durham did anything beyond what would be expected of a securities attorney providing run-of-the-mine legal services.\"\n    <em>\n     Bennett v.

The district court decisions, in turn, read the statutory language too narrowly, taking it to mean persons performing the same functions as directors while shunning the directorial title.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Mersay v.
