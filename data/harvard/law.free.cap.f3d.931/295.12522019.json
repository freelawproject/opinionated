Hahn was arrested after law enforcement discovered and seized marijuana plants\n   and firearms during that search. On December 7, 2000, at the conclusion of a jury trial in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, a jury convicted Hahn of the following four counts: (1) intentionally manufacturing 100 or more marijuana plants;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) opening and maintaining a place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, and using marijuana;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) possessing firearms in furtherance of the intentional manufacturing of 100 or more marijuana plants;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) possessing a firearm in furtherance of the opening and maintaining a place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, and using marijuana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counts III and IV are based on the same gun collection, which includes 21 firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2001, the district court sentenced Hahn to 480 months' imprisonment for these gun and drug offenses. He received 60 months' imprisonment for Count I, a concurrent 27 months for Count II, a consecutive 120 months for Count III, and a consecutive 300 months for Count IV.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2002, on direct appeal to the Tenth Circuit, Hahn challenged the legality of his sentence for his second firearm conviction. He contended that the district court impermissibly treated his second firearm conviction as \"second or subsequent\" to his first firearm conviction for purposes of the statute's sentencing enhancement.\n   <em>\n    Hahn I\n   </em>\n   , 38 F. App'x at 554. Hahn argued that the court's approach was in error because the underlying drug crimes were part of a \"continuing incident\" and were \"coterminous in space and time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Tenth Circuit rejected this argument, relying principally on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sturmoski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515503\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/452/#p461\">\n    971 F.2d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461 (10th Cir. 1992) (\"[C]onsecutive sentences may be imposed for multiple 924(c) counts if the offenses underlying each 924(c) count do not constitute a single offense for double jeopardy purposes.\"). Similar to Hahn, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Sturmoski\n   </em>\n   appealed convictions for: (1) attempting to manufacture a controlled substance; (2) maintaining a place for manufacturing a controlled substance; and (3) two\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) convictions for facilitating the aforementioned drug counts.\n   <em>\n    Hahn I\n   </em>\n   , 38 F. App'x at 555. The\n   <em>\n    Sturmoski\n   </em>\n   court held that \"Congress intended multiple convictions under 924(c), even though the counts involved 'the same criminal episode,' because Congress intended the underlying offenses to be separate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After reviewing\n   <em>\n    Sturmoski\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit in Hahn's case found that \"[t]he only difference between the situations in\n   <em>\n    Sturmoski\n   </em>\n   and in this case is that one of Hahn's 924(c) convictions was for possession in furtherance of manufacture, rather than possession in furtherance of attempt to manufacture.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Given the factual and legal similarities between\n   <em>\n    Sturmoski\n   </em>\n   and Hahn's case, the court found that \"\n   <em>\n    Sturmoski\n   </em>\n   clearly controls the outcome of this case. Hahn's conviction for maintaining a place for manufacture is distinct from his manufacture conviction, and his two 924(c) convictions are also distinct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court further ruled that \"even if possession of a firearm occurs in connection with a single criminal episode, a second 924(c) conviction arising out of that episode can constitute a 'second or subsequent\n   conviction' for sentencing purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Tenth Circuit therefore affirmed Hahn's convictions and sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2004, Hahn filed a motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence in the United States District Court of New Mexico. He argued that \"double jeopardy bars multiple \u00a7 924(c)(1) firearm convictions based on multiple predicate offenses which are factually inseparable in terms of time, space and underlying conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Hahn also argued that \" \u00a7 924(c)(1) contains a number of ambiguities, requiring application of the rule of lenity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8463518\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/191/758/#p760\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hahn explained that he did not previously raise these arguments because he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court dismissed the motion in 2004, concluding that Hahn's arguments were procedurally barred and without merit.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hahn filed a motion for reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). He disputed that his double jeopardy claim had been resolved on direct appeal and moved to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion to add more evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8463518\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/191/758/#p760\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court treated these motions as successive \u00a7 2255 motions and transferred them to the Tenth Circuit. Hahn appealed this determination, and the Tenth Circuit issued a certificate of appealability to consider Hahn's \u00a7 924(c)(1) arguments. The Tenth Circuit subsequently affirmed the dismissal and held that: (1) Hahn forfeited his double jeopardy claim and it was procedurally barred because he did not raise it on direct appeal; (2) even if his double jeopardy claim was not procedurally barred, counsel's failure to raise it would not have constituted ineffective assistance of counsel because\n   <em>\n    Sturmoski\n   </em>\n   controls and renders Hahn's double jeopardy claim meritless; and (3) as to the ambiguity argument, a motion to vacate could not be used, absent an intervening change in circuit law, to raise an argument that was resolved on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    Hahn II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8463518\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/191/758/#p760\">\n    191 F. App'x at 760-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2015, Hahn filed a motion under Rule 60(b)(4), alleging that he was entitled to relief because of an en banc Tenth Circuit decision issued after the dismissal of his petition.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rentz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986779\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/1105/\">\n    777 F.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2015). Hahn argued that\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   altered the substantive law in the Tenth Circuit by establishing a new statutory framework interpreting \u00a7 924(c). Specifically, Hahn contended that\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   added a unit-of-prosecution requirement for a \u00a7 924(c) conviction and therefore entitled him to relief denied under\n   <em>\n    Sturmoski\n   </em>\n   . Unit-of-prosecution questions ask whether the conduct at issue \"constitutes one, or several, violations of a single statutory provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Callanan v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173277\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/364/587/#p597\">\n    364 U.S. 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 597,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173277\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/364/587/#p597\">\n    81 S.Ct. 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173277\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/364/587/#p597\">\n    5 L.Ed.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1961). In\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit addressed the issue of whether, as a matter of statutory construction, \u00a7 924(c) \"authorizes multiple charges when everyone admits there's only a single use, carry, or possession.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986779\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/1105/\">\n    777 F.3d at 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After recognizing that this question was separate from the double jeopardy inquiry, the court ruled that each \u00a7 924(c) charge \"requires an independent use, carry, or possession.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986779\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/1105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986779\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/1105/\">\n    at 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Before\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   , when\n   <em>\n    Sturmoski\n   </em>\n   was controlling law, multiple charges under \u00a7 924(c) were permissible as long as they did not run afoul of the Double Jeopardy Clause. After\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit, based on the language of the statute itself, held that multiple charges under \u00a7 924(c) based on the same conduct were not proper even if they complied with the Double Jeopardy Clause. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   found that it was improper to allow multiple charges to arise from a single possession under the language of the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986779\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/1105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court determined that Hahn's motion should be treated as a second or subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion-i.e., a motion that could not be filed without precertification by the Court of Appeals-and transferred it to the Tenth Circuit. Hahn then filed a motion to remand before the Tenth Circuit to allow the district court to consider the merits of his Rule 60(b) motion or, in the alternative, for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. The Tenth Circuit denied both the motion to remand and Hahn's request to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion based on a procedural impediment.\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   was a Tenth Circuit decision, and thus did not meet the requirements for a second or subsequent motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At some point after 2015, correctional officials transferred Hahn to a facility in South Carolina, where he is currently detained. Hahn filed the instant petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina.

Hahn's appeal is properly before us because he is detained in South Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hahn contended that he was actually statutorily innocent of his second \u00a7 924(c) conviction after\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   because the charge was procedurally improper. The magistrate judge issued a report that recommended denying Hahn's petition because Hahn could not meet the three-pronged test outlined in\n   <em>\n    In re Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11231473\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/328/#p333\">\n    226 F.3d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333-34 (4th Cir. 2000). That case holds that \" \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective to test the legality of a conviction\" where:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) at the time of the conviction, settled law of this circuit or the Supreme Court established the legality of the conviction; (2) subsequent to the prisoner's direct appeal and first \u00a7 2255 motion, the substantive law changed such that the conduct of which the prisoner was convicted is deemed not to be criminal; and (3) the prisoner cannot satisfy the gatekeeping provisions of \u00a7 2255 because the new rule is not one of constitutional law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Hahn objected to the magistrate's report and recommendation, but the district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation and denied his petition. Hahn filed a Rule 59 motion to alter or amend the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).

We agree. Under\n   <em>\n    Sturmoski\n   </em>\n   , whether or not conduct could lead to multiple charges under \u00a7 924(c) in the Tenth Circuit depended solely on whether the charge violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Now under\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   , it is not enough that the multiple charges pass muster under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Rather, multiple charges must also comply with a unit-of-prosecution statutory analysis that examines how many distinct instances of conduct exist. When the charges or counts exceed the number of acts, those extra charges or counts cannot form the basis of additional criminal liability. In sum,\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   constitutes a substantive change in the law that renders Hahn's firearm possession no longer sufficient to support two \u00a7 924(c) convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Government advances several arguments to the contrary, none of which we find persuasive. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Schlup v. Delo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    513 U.S. 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    130 L.Ed.2d 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), the Government attempts to import a procedural gateway actual innocence analysis into the adjudication of Hahn's petition. The Government argues that Hahn must demonstrate actual innocence: that he did not commit the underlying conduct, i.e., possession of the firearms, in order to warrant relief under the savings clause. The Government asks us to utilize an analysis that requires a petitioner \"to support his allegations of constitutional error with new reliable evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    513 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333576\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/298/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This argument fails because the Fourth Circuit does not require an actual innocence analysis under the savings clause and adopting the Government's position\n   would be contrary to the settled and established law of this Circuit.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11231473\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/328/#p333\">\n    226 F.3d at 333-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The test in\n   <em>\n    In re Jones\n   </em>\n   functions as a gateway to relief without interrogating the factual issues of whether the underlying criminal activity occurred.\n   <em>\n    In Re Jones\n   </em>\n   assumes that the factual record is settled but requires this Court to compare prior and current precedent to evaluate whether a substantive change in the law has occurred. A petitioner satisfies this standard if the substantive change in the law makes previously illegal conduct no longer a source of criminal liability. In other words, our analysis is tethered to a change in the law, not a change in the factual underpinnings or evidence of a criminal record. If this substantive change in the law occurs after the prisoner's direct appeal and first \u00a7 2255 motion, he satisfies the second requirement of the\n   <em>\n    In re Jones\n   </em>\n   standard. This is the standard that we use to ascertain a prisoner's entitlement to relief under the savings clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Moreover, the Government argues that\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   does not control because there are factual differences between\n   <em>\n    Sturmoski\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   that make them distinguishable. However,\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   outlines a new statutory scheme of interpretation that is not a fact-dependent inquiry. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   now defines and requires a unit-of-prosecution analysis in criminal matters implicating \u00a7 924(c). The newly required analysis applies to any \u00a7 924(c) charge regardless of the particular facts of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Government further argues that Hahn's case involves multiple possessions and that the petition should therefore still be denied. We also find this argument unavailing. Hahn was charged with two counts based on a single gun collection that the police discovered at his home on a single day. The same firearm collection was listed in the indictment as support for both of the firearm counts. The Government argues that Hahn should still be found to have separate possessions under\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   because the guns were found at different locations throughout his house.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hutching\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/1453/#p1460\">\n    75 F.3d 1453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1460 (10th Cir. 1996). And yet we discern no cognizable relationship among the number of guns, the locations of the guns, and the number of \u00a7 924(c) counts in Hahn's the indictment. For instance, the indictment did not charge that ten of the guns were for the furtherance of the manufacturing charge based on one location and that eleven of the guns were for the furtherance of the place-of-manufacture charge based on another location. The same set of 21 guns was simply listed twice in the indictment, indicating that the two counts were based on drug activity and a singular possession.\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   renders this approach impermissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In conclusion,\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   substantively changed the law of the Tenth Circuit. Because of this change, Hahn's petition satisfies the second prong of\n   <em>\n    In re Jones\n   </em>\n   . Only one firearm possession exists, and therefore-under\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   -only one \u00a7 924(c) charge is proper here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, our decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Jones\n   </em>\n   provides that Hahn can pursue \u00a7 2241 relief only if he \"cannot satisfy the gatekeeping provisions of \u00a7 2255 because the new rule is not one of constitutional law.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11231473\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/328/#p333\">\n    226 F.3d at 333-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hahn could not successfully\n   pursue collateral review under \u00a7 2255 because\n   <em>\n    Rentz\n   </em>\n   did not rely on any rule of constitutional law and no new evidence was proffered. Hahn thus meets the third and final requirement of the savings clause and is entitled to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Hahn's conviction on Count IV-the second of his \u00a7 924(c) convictions-cannot stand because it is not supported by an independent firearm possession under recent Tenth Circuit precedent.

Indeed, the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   , who was originally convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack and powder cocaine, was not \"actually innocent\" of the offense-he in fact possessed the crack and powder-he just was subject to a incorrectly high mandatory minimum as a result of an error by this Court in construing the statute under which he was originally sentenced.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11231473\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/328/#p333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11231473\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/226/328/#p333\">\n    at 419-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying the actual innocence standard to challenges to a conviction when we apply the fundamental defect standard in the sentencing context would create the odd result that a lower standard would apply in the context of sentencing challenges than conviction challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, it makes no theoretical sense to extend the\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bousley\n   </em>\n   actual innocence test to the savings clause context, at least in cases like the instant case in which the petitioner pressed his legal argument in his original proceedings.

The only reason that argument failed was because it was foreclosed by circuit precedent. Accordingly, at least when, as here, a petitioner does not procedurally default a claim, it is improper to subject that petitioner to a standard more onerous than the cause-and-prejudice standard applied in procedural default cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, it is patently unfair to subject a petitioner to the onerous actual innocence standard when an appellate court's errant statutory construction foreclosed the petitioner from making a potentially meritorious argument to a jury or in a motion for acquittal. As the majority opinion explains, Petitioner repeatedly argued before his trial court and on direct appeal that the single indicted possession could not support two Section 824(c)(1) convictions. Under its actual innocence approach, the government theorizes that the jury could have found that firearms stored in different parts of the house constituted distinct possessions. But because circuit precedent foreclosed Petitioner's unit-of-prosecution argument-and, therefore, the government never needed to advance an independent possession argument to the jury-Petitioner was never given the opportunity to argue to the jury that all the firearms amounted to a single possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   I further note that even if\n   <em>\n    Schlup\n   </em>\n   's actual innocence standard applied-and, as explained above, this Court rightly holds that it does not-Petitioner would be entitled to relief because, as the majority opinion explains, his indictment alleges that a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   possession supported\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   of his 924(c)(1)(A) convictions.
