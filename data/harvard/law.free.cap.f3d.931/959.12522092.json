On January 23, 2015, Tauscher filed a lawsuit against the Phoenix Association of Realtors (PAR), alleging that PAR did not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 12213, and the Arizonans with Disabilities Act (AzDA), A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 41-1492 to 41-1492.12.

Nor can Tauscher effectively communicate with others by means of spoken words. Tauscher's primary and best form of communication is American Sign Language (ASL). Despite these limitations, Tauscher has obtained a bachelor's degree in biomedical photographic communication and a master's degree in business administration. He works full time for Sprint as a branch manager for product development and is also a licensed real estate salesperson in Arizona.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Phoenix Association of Realtors is a trade association for real estate professionals who sell real property in the Phoenix metropolitan area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   PAR has twelve employees. Its membership has ranged from 7,600 to over 13,000 dues-paying members between 2008 and 2013. PAR offers a variety of programs and services for its members, including seminars that fulfill continuing education requirements set by the Arizona Department of Real Estate. Historically, PAR has charged only a nominal amount for these seminars, and the record indicates that the revenue from PAR's seminars is generally less than the seminars' costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Tauscher registered for a continuing education course that PAR scheduled for February 13 and 14, 2013. Tauscher's registration fee for the course was $20. In September 2012, Tauscher contacted Diane Scherer, PAR's Chief Executive Officer, to ask PAR to provide an ASL interpreter for the course. Scherer declined to provide an ASL interpreter and instead offered Tauscher the use of an FM Loop system that amplifies sound. Tauscher rejected this aid; he explained that such a system would not provide effective communication for him because of the extent of his hearing impairment. Scherer and Tauscher discussed the possibility of closed or open captioning, but the conversation ended without any agreement being reached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In early February 2013, PAR responded to Tauscher's request for an auxiliary aid or service in a letter prepared by PAR's counsel. PAR rejected Tauscher's request for an ASL interpreter on the ground that PAR did not have the resources to provide an ASL interpreter and it would be an undue burden on the organization. Instead, the letter proposed three other measures. First, the letter stated that if Tauscher wanted \"to attend the class and utilize lip reading, PAR [could] make the instructor available for questions at breaks and lunch.\" Second, the letter stated that \"if [Tauscher knew] another real estate agent who [was] willing to sign for [him], PAR [would] provide the instruction and credits free to that person.\" Finally, PAR suggested that Tauscher could fulfill the continuing\n   education requirements by taking online courses. Tauscher and PAR exchanged further correspondence in March but did not reach a resolution. PAR refunded Tauscher's registration fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In October 2014, Tauscher registered for another PAR course and asked PAR to provide an ASL interpreter. PAR again refused, proposing instead to \"make the instructor available to you for questions at break and lunch.\" PAR subsequently cancelled Tauscher's registration for the course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Tauscher brought a claim in district court alleging that PAR had violated the ADA and the Arizonans with Disabilities Act. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court granted PAR's motion. The district court held that PAR's obligations under the ADA were satisfied when it engaged in a dialogue with Tauscher about his request for an ASL interpreter, and PAR was relieved from any further obligations under the ADA because Tauscher had refused to discuss any measures other than an ASL interpreter. The court subsequently denied Tauscher's motion for reconsideration, and Tauscher timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Furnace v.

The regulations do not require PAR to provide the specific aid or service requested by Tauscher; the regulations make clear that \"the ultimate decision as to what measures to take rests with the public accommodation,\" so long as the measures provide effective communication.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2036.303\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(ii). However, we agree with Tauscher that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether PAR offered Tauscher a means of communication that was effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   PAR offered Tauscher several different measures over the course of its communication with him. Some of the measures offered by PAR clearly were not effective means of communication. PAR does not now dispute that the FM Loop system was not an effective means of communication for Tauscher. And several of the alternatives suggested by PAR do not constitute an effective means of communication as a matter of law. Because the regulations expressly provide that a public accommodation may not require disabled individuals to provide their own interpreter,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2036.303\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), PAR's suggestion that Tauscher bring a friend to the class to interpret for him does not meet PAR's obligations to provide effective communication. PAR also suggested that Tauscher take online classes, instead of participating in the live classroom setting. Because the regulations provide that disabled individuals should not be \"segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2036.303\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36.303(a), this suggestion did not satisfy PAR's obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   PAR also offered to \"make the instructor available for questions at breaks and lunch\" if Tauscher wished to attend the session and rely on lipreading. Because\n   Tauscher provided evidence that he was a poor lip reader, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether PAR's offer would have resulted in effective communication for Tauscher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether PAR offered to provide a captioning system. PAR argues on appeal that captioning would be an effective means of communication, but there is evidence in the record that PAR did not offer Tauscher the use of any captioning system. In her deposition, Scherer testified that PAR did not offer Tauscher any sort of closed-captioning option or court-reporter alternative, but rather had concluded that a computer-based captioning system would have been too costly, and therefore was not a feasible alternative. Tauscher also asserts that captioning would not be an effective means of communication because he is not proficient in English. Accordingly, we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether PAR took the steps that were necessary to ensure effective communication with Tauscher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We next consider PAR's argument that it satisfied its obligations under the ADA because Tauscher refused to engage in a discussion about alternative auxiliary aids other than an ASL interpreter. The district court relied on this ground in granting PAR's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This argument is based on the ADA's requirements in the employment context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Title I of the ADA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012111\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 12117.

Title III and its implementing regulations make no mention of an \"interactive process\" that mirrors the process required in the employment context.

Nor is there any basis for holding that a public accommodation is relieved of its obligation to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services if the individual requesting such measures fails to engage in a good faith exploration of what measures would provide effective communication.

The Eighth Circuit therefore affirmed the district court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"452777\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/844/#p846\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this case, PAR argues that it charges only a $20 registration fee for its courses, but the cost of an ASL interpreter for the February 2013 course would have been between $1,680 and $3,360. PAR asserts it already loses money in providing these continuing education courses, and the loss of an additional $1,560 would be a \"significant difficulty or expense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2036.104\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, PAR states that it suffered a net loss of $8,109.88 in February 2013, and does not have a parent corporation that can contribute to PAR's overall financial resources. Therefore, PAR argues that under\n   <em>\n    KinderCare\n   </em>\n   , we should conclude as a matter of law that providing an ASL interpreter would be an undue burden. In response, Tauscher argues that the cost of an ASL interpreter would not be an undue burden on PAR because PAR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   had sufficient funds to cover that cost. Specifically, Tauscher points to evidence in the record that the value of PAR's assets in cash or cash equivalents was $839,606 at the end of fiscal year 2014 and $1,099,152 at the end of fiscal year 2013, although the record does not include information about PAR's liabilities during those years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The question whether providing an ASL interpreter would result in an undue burden raises complex issues that the district court is better able to address in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz. Libertarian Party, Inc. v. Bayless\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9054431\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/351/1277/#p1283\">\n    351 F.3d 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1283 (9th Cir. 2003). The district court did not consider whether Tauscher's evidence regarding PAR's overall financial resources raised a genuine issue of material fact on this issue. Accordingly, we think it is prudent to allow the district court to consider this issue in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, PAR is not entitled to summary judgment because engaging in dialogue with Tauscher did not satisfy its obligations under the ADA. Moreover, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether PAR offered an auxiliary aid or service that would provide effective communication to Tauscher.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We vacate the district court's grant of summary judgment to PAR and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    VACATED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    On this appeal from a grant of summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable to Mark Tauscher, the non-moving party.\n    <em>\n     White v.
