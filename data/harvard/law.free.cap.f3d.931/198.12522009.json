The Appellee, Russell Hess, III, invites us to give supremacy to form. While form is not irrelevant in the scripted analytical steps called for when determining if someone is disabled, Hess's invitation would lead to the hidebound circumstance in which an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") would have to \"chant every magic word correctly\" or an otherwise thorough and well-reasoned opinion \"would have to be remanded[.]\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The inquiry, as is usually true in determining the substantiality of evidence, is case-by-case.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The ALJ who ruled on Hess's application for social security disability benefits concluded that Hess had \"moderate difficulties\" in \"concentration, persistence or pace,\" but the ALJ offered a detailed explanation for why she believed those difficulties were not serious and why Hess was nevertheless capable of performing simple tasks. (App. at 32.) Based on that analysis, she found that Hess was \"limited to jobs requiring understanding, remembering, and carrying out only simple instructions and making only simple work-related decisions[.]\" (App. at 33-34.) In a series of hypothetical questions meant to include Hess's limitations, she asked a vocational expert whether there were jobs in the national economy available to someone with those limitations. The expert said there were. The ALJ thus decided that Hess was not disabled and rejected his claim for benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hess then filed this lawsuit challenging the ALJ's decision. The District Court determined that the ALJ had erred because, in the limitations she described in her hypothetical questions to the vocational expert, she failed to include or account for\n   her finding that Hess had \"moderate\" difficulties in \"concentration, persistence, or pace.\" Accordingly, the Court ordered the case remanded to the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The government now appeals. It argues that an ALJ's statement of a limitation confining a person to \"simple tasks\" - like the limitation statement at issue here - is permissible after a finding of \"moderate\" difficulties in \"concentration, persistence, or pace,\" if the ALJ offers a \"valid explanation\" for it. According to the government, the explanation given by the ALJ in this case was \"valid,\" and the District Court failed to give it due consideration. We agree and, for the reasons that follow, will remand the case to the District Court with instructions to enter judgment for the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In her words:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Hess's] self-reported activities of daily living, such as doing laundry, taking care of his personal needs, shopping, working, and paying bills (when he has money), ... are consistent with an individual who is able to perform simple, routine tasks. Furthermore, progress notes from treating and examining sources generally indicate no serious problems in this area of functioning, reporting that [Hess] could perform simple calculations, was fully oriented, and had intact remote/recent memory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (App. at 32 (citations omitted).) The \"self-reported activities of daily living,\" as referenced by the ALJ, were described more fully as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [Hess] reported he could care for his own personal needs and grooming, do laundry (although he needs help carrying the basket), clean, use public transportation, attend appointments, work part time, and go shopping in stores. [Hess] also pays bills (when he has money), counts change, and uses money orders. [Hess] testified that he works three days a week for five to six hours as a dishwasher, and he keeps track of the pantry items, checking for empty boxes and out of date food items.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (App. at 32 (citations omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At step four, the ALJ performed an RFC assessment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She decided that Hess was \"limited to jobs requiring understanding, remembering, and carrying out only simple instructions and making only simple work-related decisions[.]\" (App. at 33-34.) In selecting that limitation, the ALJ engaged in a detailed examination of the record, from which she concluded that Hess's mental difficulties were such that he was capable of performing simple tasks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The ALJ first noted that Hess's self-reported symptoms could \"reasonably be expected\" to flow from his \"medically determinable impairments[.]\" (App. at 34.) Those symptoms included \"trouble with concentration and completing tasks[,] .... trouble with written and verbal instructions[,] ... [inability to] handle stress very well[,] .... racing thoughts, a lot of scrambled thoughts, and trouble sleeping.\" (App. at 34 (citations omitted).) The ALJ found, however, that his \"statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms [were] not entirely consistent with the medical evidence and other evidence in the record[.]\" (App. at 34-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   To support that finding, and to evaluate Hess's capabilities more generally, the ALJ analyzed each source of relevant evidence. Specifically, she looked to mental status examinations and reports, opinion evidence, Hess's Global Assessment of Functioning (\"GAF\") scores, his mental health treatment history, his activities of daily living, and a report by one of Hess's longtime friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Regarding the evidence from mental status examinations and reports, the ALJ recognized that Hess had \"numerous mental health diagnoses\" and was \"intermittently engaged in formal mental health treatment, including therapy and psychotropic medications.\" (App. at 35 (citations omitted).) Nevertheless, she decided that the evidence showed that Hess was not seriously limited and he was capable of functioning effectively. For example, an October 2013 mental status examination revealed that Hess \"was not currently taking any psychotropic medications\"; \"had fair hygiene and grooming, good eye contact, a pleasant and friendly attitude, a cooperative attitude, goal directed thought processes, no delusions or paranoia, appropriate affect, neutral mood, full orientation, adequate recent/remote memory, and adequate impulse control\"; and \"could perform simple mathematical calculations.\" (App. at 36 (citation omitted).) Likewise, a February 2014 mental status examination showed that Hess had \"appropriate dress and grooming, cooperative attitude, good eye contact, normal speech, goal directed thought processing, full orientation, and no suicidal and homicidal ideations.\" (App. at 36 (citation omitted).) Furthermore, an August 2015 mental status examination demonstrated \"neat and clean hygiene and grooming, a cooperative attitude, normal speech, full orientation, and normal memory.\" (App. at 36 (citations omitted).) Additionally, the ALJ noted that records from a period of close observation that Hess had in 2014 did \"not contain any references to psychologically based problems[.]\" (App. at 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The ALJ acknowledged that a March 2015 mental status examination \"allude[d] to an inability to work,\" as well as \"a depressed mood and poor insight/judgment[.]\" (App. at 36, 38.) But she assigned \"[a]ny report of an inability to work ... little weight\" because it was inconsistent with the record, the examination itself contained \"no function by function opinion on th[at] issue,\" and Hess's inability to work was self-reported. (App. at 38.) Moreover, the examination was not all negative. It revealed \"fair hygiene, fair eye contact, a cooperative attitude, normal speech, a calm affect, full orientation, and goal directed thought processing.\" (App. at 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Moving on to the opinion evidence, the ALJ similarly found that it showed Hess's mental difficulties left him capable of engaging in simple work. For example, she explained that Dr. Schwartz, a psychologist, opined that Hess \"had 'mild' limitations in his ability to understand and remember simple instructions[,]\" had \" 'moderate' limitations in his ability to carry out simple instructions[,]\" \"could perform simple, unskilled work with additional restrictions in social and adaptive functioning[,]\" and had \" 'marked' limitations in his ability to respond appropriately to usual work pressures or changes in a routine work setting.\" (App. at 36-37 (citation omitted).) The ALJ assigned most of that opinion \"great weight[,]\" but she gave \"little weight\" to the conclusion that Hess had \"marked\" limitations because it was inconsistent with the record generally and with a mental status examination Dr. Schwartz himself had performed, and because it was \"based predominantly upon [Hess's] subjective complaints[.]\" (App. at 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The ALJ also examined the opinion of a \"treating mental health provider[,]\" who said that Hess \"could perform simple unskilled work but had 'marked' limitations in ... his ability consistently to concentrate, persist, and keep pace in a routine work setting.\" (App. at 37 (citation omitted).) The ALJ again rejected the \"marked\" rating as inconsistent with the record. In doing so, she noted that Hess \"was able to work part-time as a dishwasher\n   and tolerate [a period of structured supervision] without any reports of behavioral issues or problems completing tasks.\" (App. at 37.) She further highlighted the mental status examinations - which \"regularly and routinely described [Hess] as cooperative and calm, having normal speech, full orientation, and logical thought processes\" - and observed that the record did \"not contain frequent references to fatigue, anhedonia, or staying in bed all day.\" (App. at 37.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As to Hess's GAF scores, the ALJ also deemed them not to be indicative of significant mental health difficulties. She acknowledged that Hess received \"scores ranging from serious symptoms to moderate symptoms.\" (App. at 36 (citations omitted).) But, she gave the GAF scores reflecting more serious symptoms \"little weight\" because they were \"not consistent with the underlying mental status examinations[,]\" Hess's \"own reported daily activities[,]\" and \"the record as [a] whole that did not reveal frequent or regular serious symptoms.\" (App. at 37-38 (citations omitted).) Additionally, the ALJ explained that Hess's \"most recent scores ... indicat[ed] that [Hess] was experiencing moderate work-related mental health symptoms.\" (App. at 36 (citations omitted).) She assigned the GAF scores reflecting less serious symptoms \"great weight\" because they were \"more consistent with the record\" and more accurately captured Hess's \"overall functioning.\" (App. at 38 (citations omitted).) In doing so, the ALJ again cited the mental status examinations, which \"revealed few serious symptoms,\" the fact that Hess was \"able to work part time as a dishwasher,\" and records from close observation that \"did not reveal any serious behavioral issues[.]\" (App. at 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Regarding Hess's mental health treatment history, the ALJ reasoned that it neither supported the claimed severity level of Hess's symptoms nor suggested that he was unable to perform simple tasks. She said that Hess was \"not always compliant with treatment ... and ha[d] been discharged from treatment due to non-compliance\"; \"experienced short hospitalizations\" in 2013 and 2015 \"due in part to narcotics misuse and heroin addiction\"; and \"was not fully engaged in substance abuse treatment until\" 2015. (App. at 36.) She noted, though, that Hess was then in a treatment program that began in August 2015, had been compliant with that treatment, and his symptoms had improved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Turning to Hess's daily activities, the ALJ likewise found that those activities were not suggestive of symptoms as serious as Hess claimed, and that they instead demonstrated an ability to engage in simple work. As part of the RFC analysis, the ALJ reiterated what she had earlier said at step three concerning Hess's daily activities; namely, that Hess \"takes care of his own personal needs and grooming, does laundry[,] ... cleans, uses public transportation, attends appointments, works part time, ... goes shopping in stores[,] .... pays bills (when he has money), counts change, ... uses money orders[,] .... [w]orks three days a week for five to six hours as a dishwasher, and ... keeps track of the pantry items checking for empty boxes and out of date food items.\" (App. at 36-37 (citations omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, the ALJ reviewed a report by a longtime friend of Hess's stating that Hess \"could cook daily, play computer games, pay bills, follow instructions good, pay attention for a long time, go shopping in stores, use public transportation, and take care of his own personal needs and grooming.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (App. at 38 (citation omitted).) The ALJ assigned that report \"partial weight insofar as it [was] consistent with the record as a whole[.]\" (App. at 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The ALJ ultimately concluded that she had discerned \"appropriate limitations\" to account for Hess's \"mental impairments\" and that those \"impairments and the restrictions caused by them would not prevent him from performing sedentary, unskilled work as defined ... in the [RFC].\" (App. at 38-39.) She said that her RFC determination was based on her findings as to Hess's functional limitations (e.g., as to \"concentration, persistence, or pace\") and \"all the evidence with consideration of the limitations and restrictions imposed by the combined effects of all [of Hess's] medically determinable impairments[.]\" (App. at 34.) She particularly cited the mental status examinations, \"the objective medical evidence ... [Hess's] non-compliance [with treatment], the opinion evidence, and [Hess's] activities of daily living.\" (App. at 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At step five,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the ALJ found that there were \"jobs ... in significant numbers in the national economy that [Hess could] perform\" and, thus, she concluded that Hess was not disabled. (App. at 39.) She based that conclusion on answers to hypothetical questions she posed to a vocational expert about whether there were jobs \"in the national economy for an individual with [Hess's] age, education, work experience, and [RFC].\" (App. at 40.)\n   <strong>\n    [App. at 40, 43-45.]\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Hess's Lawsuit and the District Court's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   After the ALJ denied his claim for disability benefits, Hess appealed to the Social Security Administration Appeals Council, which denied his request for review. Accordingly, the ALJ's decision became the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security.\n   <em>\n    Chandler v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715715\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/356/#p359\">\n    667 F.3d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 359 (3d Cir. 2011). Hess then filed suit to challenge that decision, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The case was referred to a Magistrate Judge, who wrote a Report and Recommendation (\"R&amp;R\") in Hess's favor. According to the Magistrate Judge, the ALJ's decision was inadequate because she failed to \"include in her RFC assessment, or in any hypothetical relied upon, her finding that [Hess] has [a] moderate limitation in maintaining concentration, persistence or pace\" and \"did not otherwise account for this finding in her RFC assessment or in any hypothetical question.\" (App. at 19.) That, the Magistrate Judge said, ran afoul of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Ramirez v. Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9233704\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/546/\">\n    372 F.3d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2004), which the Judge understood to hold \"that, when an ALJ finds that a claimant has [a moderate] degree of limitation in maintaining concentration, persistence or pace, she\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   include this limitation in any hypothetical question posed to a [vocational expert] that the ALJ wishes to rely upon\" and \"that this degree of limitation must be reflected in the RFC assessment.\" (App. at 19.) The Magistrate\n   Judge otherwise rejected all of Hess's challenges to the ALJ's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The District Court approved and adopted the R&amp;R. In doing so, it made some additional comments about the case. The Court explained that\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   \"reiterated that a hypothetical must account for all of an applicant's impairments\" and \"disapproved of a hypothetical restricting an applicant's potential work to 'simple tasks' when an ALJ also finds that the applicant 'often' has deficiencies in concentration, persistence, or pace.\" (App. at 7 n.1 (citation omitted).) It observed that, here, \"the ALJ did not incorporate her finding of a 'moderate' limitation in concentration, persistence, or pace in a hypothetical she posed to the vocational expert\" but rather \"asked the vocational expert if a person 'limited to jobs requiring understanding, remembering, and carrying out only simple instructions making only simple, work related decisions ...' could perform a job in the national economy.\" (App. at 7 n.1.) The District Court concluded, in line with the Magistrate Judge's R&amp;R, that the ALJ had violated\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   and the case must be remanded for further administrative proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The government timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The somewhat complicated question on appeal is whether the ALJ's limitation of Hess \"to jobs requiring understanding, remembering, and carrying out only simple instructions and making only simple work-related decisions[,]\" as noted in the RFC determination at step four of the disability analysis and in the resulting hypothetical questions to the vocational expert at step five, was permissible in light of her finding, at step three, of \"moderate difficulties\" in \"concentration, persistence or pace[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (App. at 32-34.) The government argues that that limitation was acceptable because the ALJ offered a \"valid explanation\" for it. Hess responds that such a limitation is forbidden by\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   , after a finding of \"moderate\" difficulties in \"concentration, persistence, or pace.\" The government's position is correct, and the District Court should not have disturbed the ALJ's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Functional Limitation Findings Do Not Require Particular Language to Appear in the Statement of the Limitation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The parties argue over whether an ALJ must use specific words in stating a limitation that will be employed at steps four and five of the disability analysis, based on the functional limitation findings at steps two and three, such as a finding of \"moderate\" difficulties in \"concentration, persistence,\n   or pace.\" The government says that an ALJ need not do so. Hess responds that \"the hypothetical posed to the vocational [expert] and the ALJ's RFC assessment must incorporate all of the claimant's limitations supported by the medical record.\" (Answering Br. at 6.) But the parties are talking past each other, and both are correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   It is true, as the government contends, that no incantations are required at steps four and five simply because a particular finding has been made at steps two and three. Those portions of the disability analysis serve distinct purposes and may be expressed in different ways. When mental health is at issue, the functional limitation categories are \"used to rate the severity of mental impairment (s)[.]\" SSR 96-8P,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20374184\">\n    1996 WL 374184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (July 2, 1996). While obviously related to the limitation findings, the RFC is a determination of \"the most [a claimant] can still do despite [his] limitations\" \"based on all the relevant evidence in [the] case record.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1545\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 416.945(a)(1) ; SSR 96-8P, at *2. It \"requires a more detailed assessment [of the areas of functional limitation] by itemizing various functions contained in the broad [functional limitation] categories[.]\" SSR 96-8P, at *4. And, unlike the findings at steps two and three, the RFC \"must be expressed in terms of work-related functions[,]\" such as by describing the claimant's \"abilities to: understand, carry out, and remember instructions; use judgment in making work-related decisions; respond appropriately to supervision, co-workers and work situations; and deal with changes in a routine work setting.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1545\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1545\">\n    at *6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, the findings at steps two and three will not necessarily translate to the language used at steps four and five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, social security regulations permit, and indeed require, an ALJ to offer \"a narrative discussion describing how the evidence supports each\" limitation at step four of the disability analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1545\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1545\">\n    at *7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That suggests a wide range of limitation language is permissible, regardless of what the ALJ found at earlier steps of the analysis, so long as the chosen limitation language is explained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Nevertheless, as Hess maintains, the statement of a limitation does need to reflect the claimant's particular impairments, including those embodied in the functional limitation findings. \"In assessing RFC, the adjudicator must consider limitations and restrictions imposed by all of an individual's impairments, even those that are not 'severe.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1545\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1545\">\n    at *5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1545\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), 416.945(c) (explaining that a mental RFC assessment must begin with an examination of \"the nature and extent of [the claimant's] mental limitations and restrictions\").

A \"Simple Tasks\" Limitation Is Appropriate After a Finding of \"Moderate\" Difficulties in \"Concentration, Persistence, or Pace,\" if a \"Valid Explanation\" Is Given\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The next issue is whether a \"simple tasks\" limitation, like the one stated by the ALJ here, can be said to fairly reflect a claimant's impairments when that claimant has been found to face \"moderate\" difficulties in \"concentration, persistence, or pace.\" The government argues that such a statement of the limitation is acceptable, if an ALJ provides a \"valid explanation.\" Hess responds that, under\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   , \"a limitation to simple instructions and simple work-related decisions does not reflect a claimant's moderate restrictions in concentration, persistence, or pace.\" (Answering Br. at 7-8.)

The ALJ Chose a \"Simple Tasks\" Limitation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Before reaching the merits of this issue, we must address one preliminary matter. Both parties treat the limitation here - \"to jobs requiring understanding, remembering, and carrying out only simple instructions and making only simple work-related decisions[,]\" (App. at 33-34) - as equivalent to a limitation to \"simple tasks.\" That is important because the case law they rely upon generally involves so-called \"simple tasks\" limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We agree with their interpretation of the ALJ's framing of the limitation.

Regardless of the rating scale, \"simple tasks\" limitations have a relationship to abilities in \"concentration, persistence, or pace\" that makes a valid explanation necessary after a finding in that functional area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The relationship between \"simple tasks\" limitations and \"concentration, persistence, or pace\" is a close one. Indeed, such limitations directly encompass and anticipate a minimal level of ability in that functional area. Under the Social Security Administration's Program Operations Manual System (\"POMS\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[u]nderstanding, carrying out, and remembering simple instructions\" includes \"[t]he ability to maintain concentration and attention for extended periods (the approximately 2-hour\n   segments between arrival and first break, lunch, second break, and departure)[;] [t]he ability to perform activities within a schedule ... [;] [t]he ability to sustain an ordinary routine without special supervision[;] ... [and] [t]he ability to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms and to perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods.\" POMS DI 25020.010 (B)(2)(a). In short, \"concentration, persistence, or pace\" is tightly linked to the capacity to complete \"simple tasks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Nevertheless, a \"simple tasks\" limitation alone does not account for the\n   <em>\n    extent\n   </em>\n   of a claimant's difficulties in \"concentration, persistence, or pace.\" Without explanation, such a limitation does not warrant a conclusion about whether a claimant's difficulties in \"concentration, persistence, or pace\" are so serious that he cannot satisfy the functional requirements of \"simple tasks.\" An explanation is thus important, regardless of the particular scale used for rating \"concentration, persistence, or pace.\" It must be given whether difficulties in that area are said to arise \"often\" or are called \"moderate\" in severity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Based on their understanding of the import of\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   , the Magistrate Judge and the District Court concluded that the ALJ erred because she did not \"explicitly include\" her functional limitation finding as to \"concentration, persistence or pace\" in the RFC assessment or hypothetical questions, and that a \"simple tasks\" limitation was inadequate to address Hess's circumstances. (App. at 19.) In light of that conclusion, neither the R&amp;R nor the District Court's opinion discussed the sufficiency of the analysis that led to the ALJ's \"simple tasks\" limitation. That is problematic, for, as we have noted here, it is essential to assess whether a valid explanation has been given for an ALJ's statement of a claimant's limitation to \"simple tasks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The ALJ Offered a \"Valid Explanation\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The final question, then, is whether the ALJ in this case offered a valid explanation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government argues that the ALJ did so by analyzing Hess's difficulties in \"concentration, persistence, or pace\" and concluding that they were not so serious that Hess could not perform simple tasks. Hess's only response is that \"the ALJ failed to set forth a supported rationale for [her] RFC findings.\" (Answering Br. at 5.) He does not assert that the ALJ mischaracterized the record, only that her analysis is flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Having evaluated that analysis, we are persuaded that the ALJ did offer a valid explanation for her \"simple tasks\" limitation. As indicated by our detailed description of her opinion, the ALJ explained at length and with sound reasoning why Hess's \"moderate\" difficulties in \"concentration, persistence, or pace\" were not so significant that Hess was incapable of performing \"simple tasks.\" For example,\n   coupled with her finding that Hess had \"moderate difficulties\" in \"concentration, persistence or pace,\" the ALJ explained that Hess's \"self-reported activities of daily living, such as doing laundry, taking care of his personal needs, shopping, working, and paying bills (when he has money), ... are consistent with an individual who is able to perform simple, routine tasks.\" (App. at 32.) In the same discussion, the ALJ also observed that \"progress notes from treating and examining sources generally indicate no serious problems in this area of functioning, reporting that [Hess] could perform simple calculations, was fully oriented, and had intact remote/recent memory.\" (App. at 32 (citations omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Likewise, in her meticulous analysis of the record at step four of the disability analysis, the ALJ highlighted, among other things, the following: mental status examinations and reports that revealed that Hess could function effectively; opinion evidence showing that Hess could do simple work; and Hess's activities of daily living, which demonstrated that he is capable of engaging in a diverse array of \"simple tasks,\" such as \"work[ing] three days a week for five to six hours as a dishwasher[.]\" (App. at 37.) She additionally noted that there were no \"reports of behavioral issues or problems completing tasks\" during a significant period of close observation, and that the record \"did not reveal frequent or regular serious symptoms.\" (App. at 37-38 (citations omitted).) The ALJ's review of the record, moreover, led her to give little weight to assertions that Hess had serious mental difficulties and to credit evidence that Hess could perform simple work. After all of that, the ALJ explained that \"appropriate limitations\" were imposed to reflect Hess's mental impairments and that Hess's \"impairments and the restrictions caused by them would not prevent him from performing sedentary, unskilled work as defined ... in the [RFC].\" (App. at 38-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   We think the ALJ's detailed explanation was sufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the record evidence the ALJ cited in reasoning that a \"simple tasks\" limitation was appropriate is comparable to, or even stronger than, evidence that certain of our sister circuits have found to support similar limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In sum, the ALJ's limitation \"to jobs requiring understanding, remembering, and carrying out only simple instructions and making only simple work-related decisions[,]\" (App. at 33-34,) was supported by a \"valid explanation\" and so was appropriate. The administrative decision should therefore have been upheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
