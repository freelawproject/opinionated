K.W.P. alleged that Officer Craddock unreasonably seized him and used excessive force by handcuffing him and failing to remove the handcuffs. He alleged that Principal Wallace approved Officer Craddock's seizure by failing to instruct Officer Craddock to remove the handcuffs despite K.W.P. posing no imminent threat to anyone and complying with instructions. K.W.P. sued KCPS for municipal liability and failure to train and supervise Officer Craddock on the use of handcuffs on elementary-age children. Officer Craddock and Principal Wallace moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity on the claim of unreasonable seizure and excessive force, and KCPS moved for summary judgment on the municipal liability claim. The district court determined that disputed material facts precluded dismissal of K.W.P.'s claims against Officer Craddock and Principal Wallace. The court also denied summary judgment to KCPS. KCPS, Officer Craddock, and Principal Wallace appeal the denial of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Construing the facts in the light most favorable to K.W.P., we conclude that neither Officer Craddock nor Principal Wallace violated K.W.P.'s constitutional rights; thus, they are entitled to qualified immunity on K.W.P.'s claim of unreasonable seizure and excessive force. As a result, we necessarily hold that K.W.P.'s municipal liability claim also fails. Therefore, we reverse the district court's denial of summary judgment to Officer Craddock, Principal Wallace, and KCPS and remand for entry of summary judgment in their favor on K.W.P.'s claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Underlying Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"We recite the facts in the light most favorable to [K.W.P.], as the nonmoving part[y].\"\n   <em>\n    O'Brien v.

We agree but reach a different conclusion as to the result. We hold that, applying either the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   standard, and construing the facts in the light most favorable to K.W.P., neither Officer Craddock nor Principal Wallace violated K.W.P.'s right to be free from unreasonable seizure and excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, as to the initial handcuffing, unlike the calm, compliant children in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    E.W.\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    C.B.\n   </em>\n   who did not engage in further disruptive behavior and posed no risks to anyone's safety, K.W.P.'s own admissions indicate that he attempted to flee from Officer Craddock upon his removal from the classroom and that his escape efforts posed a safety risk to himself. K.W.P. does not challenge as unlawful Officer Craddock's initial removal of him from the classroom for being disruptive. Once removed from the classroom, K.W.P. resisted Officer Craddock's directive for K.W.P. to accompany Officer Craddock to the office. K.W.P. admitted, among other things, that he \"didn't want to go with the officer,\" was \"attempting to not go with the police officer,\" was \"trying to get away,\" \"wanted to stand up for [himself], told Officer Craddock that he \"didn't want\n   to go with [him],\" was \"resisting going with [Officer Craddock],\" \"didn't want to cooperate with the officer,\" \"tried to calm down ... but [he] couldn't,\" was \"crying real loud\" and \"screaming\" when Officer Craddock grabbed his left wrist, was \"jerking [his] body away,\" \"tr[ied] even more to get away from\" Officer Craddock when he grabbed K.W.P.'s wrist, tried to push past Officer Craddock, continued to aggressively pull away from Officer Craddock's grasp, and grabbed a handrail. Suggestions in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J., Ex. 2, K.W.P. Dep., at 17-18. K.W.P. further admitted that his actions could have resulted in him getting hurt. In applying the objective reasonableness standard to the undisputed facts, a reasonable officer could have concluded that K.W.P.'s admitted conduct constituted \"an act of violent resistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338576\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/591/669/#p674\">\n    591 F. App'x at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, K.W.P. challenges as unlawful the 15 minutes that he was seated in the front office and handcuffed. Once again, applying either the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   standard, neither Officer Craddock nor Principal Wallace violated K.W.P.'s right to be free from unreasonable seizure and excessive force in the extended handcuffing. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to K.W.P., K.W.P. had stopped resisting by the time that he reached the front office, sat in a chair pursuant to Officer Craddock's commands, and did not attempt to leave. Nevertheless, the case remains distinguishable from other cases in which courts have found extended handcuffing violative of the Fourth Amendment. Here, K.W.P. remained handcuffed in the front office for only 15 minutes; by comparison, the student in\n   <em>\n    C.B.\n   </em>\n   remained handcuffed for 25 to 30 minutes,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266546,4266588\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/1005/\">\n    769 F.3d at 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the student in\n   <em>\n    Hoskins\n   </em>\n   remained handcuffed for 45 minutes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207238621\">\n    2014 WL 7238621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. Our conclusion that no constitutional violation occurred also rests on K.W.P.'s behavior justifying the initial handcuffing. Unlike the students in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    E.W.\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    C.B.\n   </em>\n   who were complaint with the school resource officer from the outset of their encounter, K.W.P. had actively resisted Officer Craddock just prior to arriving to the front office. A reasonable officer could conclude that, based on K.W.P.'s recent resistance, keeping him in handcuffs for 15 minutes until a parent arrived was a reasonable course of action and was necessary to prevent K.W.P. from trying to leave and posing harm to himself.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoskins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207238621\">\n    2014 WL 7238621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (\"[T]he scope of the seizure-that is, the handcuffing of the child for forty-five minutes,\n   <em>\n    even after his parents arrived at the school and were present in the room with him\n   </em>\n   -was unreasonable.\" (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Furthermore, Principal Wallace's failure to intervene and have Officer Craddock remove the handcuffs was reasonable in light of her previous experience with K.W.P. The undisputed facts show that just two months prior to the incident at issue, K.W.P. tried to leave the playground after getting mad at Principal Wallace for instructing him not to hit others. When Principal Wallace grabbed K.W.P.'s wrist to take him to the office to call his mother, K.W.P. actively resisted by trying to pull away from Principal Wallace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly, we hold that, applying either the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    T.L.O.\n   </em>\n   standard and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to K.W.P., neither Officer Craddock nor Principal Wallace violated K.W.P.'s right to be free from unreasonable seizure and excessive force and are therefore entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Clearly Established\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Alternatively, \" 'even if the reasonableness of [Officer Craddock's and Principal Wallace's] actions was questionable,'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   [K.W.P.] cannot 'show that a reasonable [official] would have been on notice that [their] conduct violated a clearly established right.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cravener v.
