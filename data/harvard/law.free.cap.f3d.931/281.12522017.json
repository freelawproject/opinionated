He appeals the district court's exclusion of proposed expert testimony at trial, as well as denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal. Rodriguez-Soriano challenges the district court's determination that proposed expert testimony related to false confessions, excluded pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 702, was not reliable or relevant, and that the risk of prejudice outweighed its probative value, and thus it was also properly excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. We conclude that, for the reasons stated below, we need not determine whether the expert testimony was properly excluded because the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to independently corroborate Rodriguez-Soriano's confession. We therefore reverse the district court's judgment of conviction and remand for the entry of a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 25, 2015, Rodriguez-Soriano purchased two firearms, a Ruger P95 9mm pistol and a Beemiller Hi-Point C9 9mm pistol, from a Northern Virginia location of Gander Mountain Company, a licensed firearms dealer. At the time of purchase, Rodriguez-Soriano completed Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\"ATF\") Form 4473, \"Report of Multiple Sale or Other Disposition of Pistols and Revolvers,\" which listed him as the purchaser of both firearms. He marked the box indicating that he was the actual buyer of the firearms listed on the form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gander Mountain completed another ATF-required document, a \"Multiple Sale Summary,\" documenting that Rodriguez-Soriano purchased both firearms in a single transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2016, a Washington, D.C. homicide detective sought the assistance of the ATF after receiving information that one of the firearms Rodriguez-Soriano\n   purchased was used in a homicide. Based on this information, ATF Special Agent David Burkholder and ATF Task Force Officer Kevin McConnell interviewed Rodriguez-Soriano on two occasions about his gun purchases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rodriguez-Soriano initially told the agents that the two firearms he purchased were stolen sometime in late 2015 and described the circumstances surrounding their theft. According to Rodriguez-Soriano, he didn't know exactly when they were stolen, and didn't notice they were missing until mid-November. At some point during that time period he found the closet where he kept the guns in disarray, but its condition did not alert him to the theft. He then revealed to the agents he suspected that a friend had broken the lock on his basement door to enter and steal the guns, but he didn't immediately notice the lock was broken and could not say which of his friends knew he had firearms. He later identified one, who he referred to as \"D.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When asked why he purchased two guns, Rodriguez-Soriano responded that the Hi-Point pistol \"kept jamming\" at the shooting range, so he returned to purchase the other firearm. The agents immediately knew this statement was false because the ATF forms documenting the purchase indicated that the two firearms had been purchased in a single transaction. The agents then \"pivoted,\" expressing doubt as to the veracity of his story. J.A. 420. The agents informed Rodriguez-Soriano that straw purchasers often say that guns they have purchased were stolen and informed him it was a crime punishable by up to five years in prison to lie to federal agents. They revealed that they knew he had purchased the guns for someone else because the person had told them so, the situation was very serious because one of the guns had been used in a homicide, and they were giving him the opportunity to \"come clean.\" J.A. 420-21. They characterized the purchase of the gun as \"minimal\" compared to what had been done with it, but warned him about continuing to \"go down the path\" of lying about the guns being stolen. J.A. 421.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rodriguez-Soriano then confessed to the agents that he purchased the two 9mm handguns at the request of an acquaintance named \"Ron.\" He revealed that Ron approached him in late May 2015 about buying two handguns for him. Rodriguez-Soriano did not immediately accept Ron's offer, but when their paths crossed again, Rodriguez-Soriano told him, \"I can do that favor for you.\" Ron gave Rodriguez-Soriano $650 to buy two guns. After the purchase, Rodriguez-Soriano met Ron and his friend, \"D,\" in the parking lot of a convenience store where Rodriguez-Soriano entered their car, showed them the guns, and left the guns on the back seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Rodriguez-Soriano confessed, the agents reviewed Form 4473 with him. He admitted it was his name, information, and mark in the box indicating that he was the actual buyer of the firearms. At a follow-up interview conducted eighteen days later, Rodriguez-Soriano confirmed the statements he made in his prior interview. Rodriguez-Soriano was indicted on one count of knowingly making a false statement to a licensed firearms dealer in the acquisition of a firearm, stating that he was the actual purchaser of the firearms when he was acquiring them for another\n   individual, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Agent Burkholder, an ATF records management employee, and Gander Mountain's former general manager, as the representative of the licensed firearms dealer, testified for the government at trial. But the homicide detective and the men who, according to Rodriguez-Soriano's confession, gave him the cash for and took possession of the guns he purchased did not. The gun used in the homicide was not introduced into evidence. Rodriguez-Soriano did not present any evidence in response to the government's case. He instead moved for a judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the only evidence of criminal activity was Rodriguez-Soriano's own uncorroborated statement to the ATF agents. The district court denied the motion, finding that \"given the other evidence surrounding his confession,\" further corroboration was not \"legally necessary\" because the government produced sufficient evidence as to each of the elements of the offense. J.A. 233-34; 239. The jury found Rodriguez-Soriano guilty of the offense charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This Court reviews\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the district court's denial of the motion for acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

There is no corroboration demonstrating that the transaction was a straw purchase, and accordingly no substantial independent evidence that, together with the confession itself, proves Rodriguez-Soriano's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Neither party refutes that Rodriguez-Soriano was eligible to acquire firearms at the time he purchased them. And the ATF forms and the testimony of the representative of the licensed firearms dealer, at best, prove only that he made a facially legal purchase of two firearms. It was the government's burden to prove that Rodriguez-Soriano knowingly committed a crime by falsely stating that he was buying the guns for himself. The government contends that additional independent evidence presented at trial sufficiently corroborated his confession, and this corroborating evidence, together with the confession itself, was sufficient to sustain his conviction. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, we find the facts in\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865912\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/669/#p672\">\n    482 F.3d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , particularly instructive. There, an officer on patrol heard four to five gunshots coming from a nearby street. He turned in the direction of the shots and within thirty seconds observed a man, later identified as Stephens, crossing the street. Stephens ran when he saw the officer, and was later apprehended inside a nearby house. The officer retraced the path of pursuit and found a revolver containing five spent shell casings lying in\n   the grass near where he first saw Stephens.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 671.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Upon being taken into custody, Stephens was interviewed by two ATF agents. He told them that approximately two to three months earlier, a local drug dealer known as \"Red\" fronted him a quantity of cocaine for which he was to pay $1,500. Stephens was unable to repay Red because his wife had consumed the cocaine. Stephens heard on the street that Red intended to kill him because he failed to pay, and later that evening, when he drove past Red and his associates, someone in the group fired a shot at him. Stephens retrieved his gun and fired the shots the officer heard at Red's vehicle, a white Mazda, when he saw it on the street. Two months after his initial statement to the agents, Stephens repeated his statement in a proffer to the government.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But when Stephens took the stand in his own defense at trial, he testified that he had lied to the ATF agents after his arrest and in his proffer. He stated that on the night in question, he was sitting on his grandmother's porch when an individual approached and offered to sell him a handgun for $75. Stephens paid $60 for the firearm, and then walked to a friend's house where he fired the gun into the air. He explained that he lied about his association with Red in hopes he would be released on bond, or released so he could provide information about Red's drug dealing activities. Stephens denied having any connection to Red, that he was involved in drug sales, or that he owed anyone for drugs.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Stephens' motion for a judgment of acquittal was denied,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 672, and a jury found him guilty of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and of using, carrying, and discharging a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A)(iii).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 670. But on appeal, this Court reversed, finding that the evidence was insufficient to corroborate his confession to the ATF agents and thereby establish his guilt of the offenses. This Court noted that further law enforcement investigation \"might have served to fortif[y]\" the truth of Stephens' confession. But the ATF agent, who was familiar with the city's drug trade and knew of a drug dealer named Red who drove a white Mazda, could not establish any connection between Stephens and Red, and his corroboration of those details from Stephens' statement did not establish the necessary link between Stephens and Red to prove the two were engaged in a conspiracy to sell cocaine.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 673.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   If\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   sets the outer bounds of the corroboration rule, the evidence here is well within it. Here, the government contends that four pieces of evidence corroborate Rodriguez-Soriano's confession that he made a straw purchase: (1) the guns he purchased were no longer in his possession; (2) he lied to the agents about buying the firearms in two separate transactions; (3) he made inconsistent and contradictory statements about the alleged theft of the guns; and (4) he reaffirmed his confession in a subsequent interview. The government would have us conclude that under the applicable standard of review, despite the absence of testimony from the homicide detective and the other parties involved in the alleged straw purchase, and the government's failure to introduce the gun into evidence, it still produced substantial independent evidence that, together with the evidence as a whole, was sufficient for the jury to find Rodriguez-Soriano guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. But the government's argument fails because all of the evidence the government claims corroborates Rodriguez-Soriano's confession\n   arises from his own statements to law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At the time Rodriguez-Soriano told the agents he no longer had the guns, Agent Burkholder had already received information, independent of Rodriguez-Soriano's statement, that the gun had been used by a third party in a homicide. But given that Agent Burkholder's testimony regarding the use of the gun to commit a murder was not offered at trial for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather was admitted solely to explain what prompted the investigation of the gun purchases, the sole evidence at trial that Rodriguez-Soriano was no longer in possession of the guns arose from Rodriguez-Soriano's statement, and therefore was not an independent corroboration of the straw purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Given the limited purpose for which the jury could consider Agent Burkholder's testimony, the remaining evidence the government advances as corroborative is simply inadequate, as it does not prove that Rodriguez-Soriano knowingly made a false statement. That Rodriguez-Soriano no longer possessed the firearms at the time of the interview did not itself indicate that he knowingly misrepresented he was the actual buyer. And while his later, inconsistent explanations as to why he purchased the firearms or how they were stolen may suggest that he lied to the ATF agents, they do not establish that he knowingly made a false statement at the time of purchase, as required under \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The government would also have us construe Rodriguez-Soriano's statements made in his subsequent interview as a separate confession, and determine that each confession corroborates the other. But the government cannot rely on a second uncorroborated confession as independent evidence corroborating an initial one, particularly where the second does nothing to \"fortif[y] the truth of the confession\" by offering further corroboration that a crime was committed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865912\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/669/#p672\">\n    482 F.3d at 672-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, it appears that the prosecutor knew the identities of potential corroborating witnesses, yet we can only speculate as to why evidence corroborating Rodriguez-Soriano's alleged offense was not presented at his trial.

Juries today continue to do so. For this reason, under longstanding Supreme Court precedent, a prosecutor seeking to admit a defendant's out-of-court confession must provide evidence showing that the confession is trustworthy. But that evidence need not independently prove the \"corpus delicti\"-that is, the \"body of the crime\"-as American common law once required. Nor must it corroborate every element of the crime at issue. Rather, the prosecutor need only offer independent evidence that tends to show that the confession is trustworthy. My colleagues in the Majority rewrite this rule, reviving and expanding the old corpus delicti doctrine by demanding evidentiary proof, independent of his many admissions, that Rodriguez-Soriano violated each element of the crime. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the seventeenth century, the English courts established a common law rule requiring the prosecutor in a homicide case to prove the corpus delicti through evidence other than a defendant's out-of-court confession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Known as the corpus delicti doctrine, the rule sought to ensure that a defendant would not be punished for allegedly killing someone who was actually alive but missing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To avoid this result, prosecutors seeking to prove homicide needed corroboration, and the quintessential example has always been the body of the victim. But requiring a body in every homicide case would have led to untenable and unjust results.

In\n   <em>\n    Opper\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was convicted of bribery for paying a government employee to select his stock of goggles for purchase by the Air Force. The defendant admitted to the FBI that he had handed the employee cash, but insisted it was merely a friendly loan. And the prosecution's independent evidence only proved that the defendant cashed a check for himself (corresponding to an amount he had admitted he had given to the employee), that there was contact between the defendant and the employee, and that the initial rejection of the defendant's goggles was overturned at the employee's urging. This independent evidence tended to support only circumstantially the defendant's single admission that he paid the money. The Supreme Court nonetheless held that there was \"substantial independent evidence to establish directly the truthfulness of [the] petitioner's admission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93-94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930785\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/84/#p89\">\n    75 S.Ct. 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the jury was therefore justified in relying on this extrajudicial admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The connection in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   was even more attenuated. There, the defendant was accused of criminal tax evasion during a five-year period. The government's case substantially relied on one statement by the defendant describing his specific net worth at the beginning of this period-which, if proven, would show that his reported income was too low to explain his high net worth at the end of this period. The Supreme Court held that the government had sufficiently corroborated this lone admission in two independent ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   First, the government had bolstered the admission through his prior tax filings, which showed only minimal income. 348 U.S. at 157,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930978\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/147/#p153\">\n    75 S.Ct. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court determined that those tax filings corroborated another extrajudicial statement by the defendant about his limited work history, which together adequately corroborated that the defendant had a low net worth at the beginning of the relevant period. And the general suggestion that he had a low net worth was enough to corroborate the specific net worth statement to which the defendant had admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, and independently, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   held that the government adequately corroborated his opening net worth by presenting evidence that \"tend[ed] to establish the crime of tax evasion without resort to the net worth computations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930978\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/147/#p153\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930978\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/147/#p153\">\n    at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930978\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/147/#p153\">\n    75 S.Ct. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government had presented evidence that, during the five-year period, the defendant and his wife started a business that kept no financial records, opened many bank accounts, added a lot of money to those bank accounts, and made other substantial expenditures. The Court noted that these acts \"might not, of themselves, suffice to support a conviction of tax evasion without evidence of a starting point indicating a lack of funds from which these payments might have come.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930978\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/147/#p153\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930978\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/147/#p153\">\n    at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930978\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/147/#p153\">\n    75 S.Ct. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though these facts were only loosely related to the net-worth statement that the prosecution sought to corroborate, the Court still held that this evidence was sufficient.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930978\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/147/#p153\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Here Rodriguez-Soriano was charged with making a false statement about being the actual purchaser during a firearm purchase in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). The elements of this crime require the defendant to (1) knowingly make a false statement or representation (2) to a federal firearms licensee (3) about the information that the law requires such licensees to keep. Rodriguez-Soriano confessed to all of his conduct in committing this crime: he admitted that he had agreed to buy two guns for an acquaintance named Ron, that he bought Ruger and Hi-Point 9mm handguns in July 2015 at Gander Mountain, that he filled out and signed ATF Form 4473 when buying the handguns (stating that the guns were for himself), and that he gave the two guns to Ron right after making the purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Evidence independent of his confession confirmed the\n   <em>\n    essential\n   </em>\n   facts to which Rodriguez-Soriano admitted.

The independent evidence need only reinforce the credibility of the defendant's statement, not independently establish each element of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Majority dismisses all of this, concluding that \"[t]here is no corroboration demonstrating that the transaction was a straw purchase ....\" Majority Op. at 288.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, the Majority requires corroboration of Rodriguez-Soriano's mental state (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that he intended to buy the guns for another person). This misconstrues the correct standard, instead describing a new rule that requires formal proof of a crime's every element. But only the essential facts of the confession must be corroborated, not every element of the offense. It is thus of no consequence that he engaged in \"a facially legal purchase.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   And even if corroboration of Rodriguez-Soriano's mental state is required, we in fact have independent corroborative facts that tend, though only weakly, to show that he did not buy the guns for himself. First, consider the simple fact that a 23-year-old simultaneously bought two inexpensive, interchangeable handguns for over $500. Next, Rodriguez-Soriano did not produce the guns when the agents arrived to ask about them-tending to show that he no longer had them, and accordingly, that he never intended to keep them in the first place. The Majority contends that the prosecution needed Rodriguez-Soriano's admission to prove this fact. Not so. It is an objective fact that agents visited Rodriguez-Soriano and that he did not produce the guns. His admission was unnecessary to prove that point.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , 348 U.S. at 159,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930978\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/147/#p153\">\n    75 S.Ct. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding a defendant's lack of business records to be corroborative evidence of the crime of tax evasion). Finally, ATF Form 4473 indirectly corroborates his confession by tending to show the story he first gave the agents-that a friend broke into his house and stole the guns-was false. That is because the form shows that he bought both guns together, something he initially\n   lied about but later admitted.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930978\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/147/#p153\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930978\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/147/#p153\">\n    at 157-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930978\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/348/147/#p153\">\n    75 S.Ct. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (using a corroborated admission to corroborate another admission).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Despite all this, the Majority suggests that\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stephens\n   </em>\n   compels us to overturn the jury's guilty verdict.\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   involved a man who confessed to buying drugs and shooting at a certain drug dealer's car after being arrested near where several gunshots were heard.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865912\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/669/#p672\">\n    482 F.3d at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But at trial, the man testified that he had lied to law enforcement about shooting at the drug dealer, and instead that he had merely fired a gun into the air to test it. He was convicted both of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and of using a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime. This Court reversed his convictions, reasoning that there was inadequate corroborative evidence linking him to the drug trade (or linking him to the drug dealer specifically): there was only evidence connecting him to the firearm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865912\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/669/#p672\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865912\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/669/#p672\">\n    at 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded that the evidence that the man fired a gun outside did not sufficiently support the essential facts of the drug crimes for which he was convicted. And as such, we found his confession to be uncorroborated. But while the prosecution in\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   provided practically no evidence to help establish the trustworthiness of the man's initial confession, and no evidence at all that he was involved in the drug trade, the prosecution here provided independent evidence that corroborated all of Rodriguez-Soriano's conduct in committing the crime: the only thing the prosecution purportedly failed to corroborate was his mental state when he filled out ATF Form 4473. This corroborating evidence was more than enough to help establish his candor, and accordingly, his confessions properly supported his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   A defendant may not be convicted based solely on an uncorroborated confession. But the law does not require a prosecutor to convict a defendant before a jury may hear his confession. Instead, the law takes a middle ground between these two extremes, merely requiring evidence that tends to establish the trustworthiness of the confession. This rule helps to ensure that defendants are not convicted based on false confessions, while also not hampering the search for truth with an unreasonable evidentiary burden. As the evidence offered here adequately corroborated Rodriguez-Soriano's confessions, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Roman law similarly provided that a judgment could not rest just on a naked extrajudicial confession, which was considered to be\n    <em>\n     semiplena probatio\n    </em>\n    (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , \"half proof\") unless \"voluntarily made, in the presence of the injured party, or, if reiterated at different times in his absence, and persisted in.\" 1 Simon Greenleaf &amp; Simon Greenleaf Croswell , A Treatise on the Law of Evidence \u00a7 217, at 278 (14th ed. 1883);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Robert E.
