He, therefore, issued a turn over order requiring Shaw to at once surrender the car to the trustee or pay the trustee the $2400 'he had received from its sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-23\">On Shaw\u2019s petition for review, the district judge approved the findings that the transfer was colorable. He further found, however, that 'Shaw had made repairs on the car of the value of $600, for which he should be allowed a credit. He, therefore, issued a turn over order requiring him to pay to the trustee $1800 instead of the $2400 ordered by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-24\">Shaw is here contesting both the summary jurisdiction of the court and its findings and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>An examination of the record leaves us in no doubt that these contentions are without merit. The correctness of the Court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction, as well as of the turn over order, depends upon the correctness of the fact findings on which the order was based. The record abundantly supports these findings. The case smacks so much of, the 'circumstances present so many badges and indicia of, fraud that despite the direct testimony to the contrary, the court was authorized to, and did, reject it as untrue. Indeed the finding of fraud seems almost to have been demanded. The exercise of summary jurisdiction was proper. The order entered was right. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
