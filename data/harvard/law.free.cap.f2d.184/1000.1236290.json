MILLER, and PRETTYMAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1056-14\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b1056-15\">On March 15, 1950, we allowed appellant, who had filed the necessary affidavit of poverty, etc., to prosecute her appeal in forma pauperis. We also directed \u201cthat the stenographic transcript of record be furnished, at the expense of the United States, for inclusion in the record on appeal, which shall be filed 'herein within 30 days of the date of this order.\u201d Appellant moves to amend the order by adding the words \u201cIt appearing to the Court that the appeal is not frivolous but presents a substantial question.\u201d The motion will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-16\">28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(b), 62 Stat. 955, provides that \u201cIn any civil or criminal case\u201d the court may, upon the filing of an affidavit of poverty, etc., \u201cdirect that the expense of furnishing a stenographic transcript and printing the record on appeal, if such printing is required by the appellate court, be paid by the United States, and the same shall be paid when authorized by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.\u201d No statement or certificate, in addition to the court\u2019s order, is required. The Director of the Administrative Office should therefore authorize payment in accordance with our order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-17\">It is immaterial that the act creating the court reporter system provides that fees for transcripts furnished in appeals in forma pauperis shall be paid by the United States if a \u201cjudge certifies that the appeal is not frivolous but presents a substantial question\u201d. 62 Stat. 922, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 753 (f). That section and section 1915(b), upon which our order rests, are not cumulative but alternative. Neither section refers to the other or contemplates compliance with the other. Compliance with-\u00a7 753(f), which applies only where persons have been \u201cpermitted to appeal in forma pauperis\u201d, requires only a factual certificate of a single judge and does not require a court order. Compliance with \u00a7 1915(b), which applies \u201cin any civil or criminal case\u201d in which an affidavit of poverty, etc., has been filed, requires only a court order and does not require any factual certificate. Since \u00a7 1915 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>(b) applies whether or not a person has been permitted to appeal in forma pauperis, there are, where such permission has been granted, two alternative methods by which payment of fees by the United States may be obtained. It would be strange to require, in forma pauperis appeals, a certificate that is not required in other cases in which an affidavit of poverty is filed. Congress expressed no such intention, The motion is therefore denied. The time within which the transcript may be filed is extended to 30 days from the present date.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
