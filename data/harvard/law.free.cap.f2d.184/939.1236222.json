There was no appeal \"from the judgment of conviction and* what appellants seek in this \u00a7 2255 proceeding is -a retrial of their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">.\u00a1[1-4] A proceeding under \u00a7 -2255 is intended as, a -substitute for habeas, corpus-. The contentions;-here urged would,not be considered in a.habeas corpus proceeding. We. agree with the opinion o'f . the Fourth Circuit in Taylor v. United States, 4 Cir., 177 F.2d 194, . which states, at, page 195, \u201cPrisoners adjudged guilty of crime should understand that 28 U.S.-C.A. \u00a7 2255 does not give them the right to try over again the cases in which they have been adjudged guilty. Questions as \"to the sufficiency of \u2022\u25a0the evidence of involving errors either of law or of fact must be raised toy timely appeal -from the sentence if the petitioner desires to raise them. Only where the sentence is void or otherwise subject to collateral -attack may the attack be made by motion under 28 U.S.-C.A. \u00a7 2255, which was enacted to - take the place of habeas carpus in such- cases and was intended to -confer no broader right of attack than might have been made in its absence by habeas -corpus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
