On July <em>7, </em>1949, the court had passed the usual \u201cbar order\u201d in the proceeding, requiring all claimants on or before September 1, 1949, to file their claims, with the exception of claims founded on \u201cbonds, debentures or shares of stock\u201d; but the appellants \u2014 the Simpsons and their corporations \u2014 did not file the claims now in question. Later the trustee made claims against the appellants, for a preliminary examination as to which he made application to the court on May 4, 1950. In compliance with an order made on May 24, 1950, the appellants filed the claims involved in this appeal \u2014 that is claims for commissions, services rendered, and for breach of contract. The trustee moved to disallow these claims on the ground that the order of July <em>7, </em>1949, had barred them and that the order of May 24, 1950, had not lifted the \u201cbar\u201d; and Judge Hincks so held on July 6, 1950. Tn re Nor-walk Tire &amp; Rubber Co., D.C., 93 E.Supp. 870. That order is one of the two now on appeal; the other is an order of July 12, 1950, in so far as it provided for the disbursement of the debtor\u2019s assets without making a reserve for the claims in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The order of May 24, 1950, was founded upon a petition of May 4, 1950, which alleged that the Simpsons held \u201cconvertible debentures\u201d in the debtor; that the trustee had a claim against L. Drexsage &amp; Company, Inc. (one of the Simpson corporations) for over $100,000, which was a good counterclaim or set-off against the \u201cdebentures\u201d; and that it was \u201cessential\u201d that the interests of the Simpsons as \u201calleged debenture holders and stockholders be fixed,\u201d so. that the claims of the debtor against them could be determined. The prayer was that the \u201cbondholders and stockholders\u201d should file claims \u201csetting forth the amount of 'bonds and stock owned by them,\u201d and that objections and counterclaims might 'be filed to the claims. The order entered went further than the petition, for it \u201crequired\u201d the Simpsons to assert \u201cany and all claims of whatever character against the debtor, whether contract or tort, secured or unsecured, liquidated or unliquidated, fixed or contingent, direct or indirect, and any and all interests\u201d in any property of the debtor; and it was by virtue of this that they filed their claims other than on debentures; and, as we -have said, the order of July 6, 1950, held that the order of May 24, 1950, did not relieve these claims \u2014 that is, those other than the debentures \u2014 from the \u201cbar\u201d of the order of July 7, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">It will be observed that the order of May 24, 1950, included more claims than the petition, on which it was founded, had described; this is accounted for by the fact that it was only upon the return day of the order to sihow cause, issued on the petition, that the Simpsons suggested that they had other claims than those based upon the debentures. It was the purpose of the court to include these newly assert\u25a0ed claims so as to make sure that all possible controversies should 'be adjudicated in a single proceeding. Judge Hincks, when the question came 'before him whether the language of the order of May 24, 1950, lifted the \u201cbar\u201d oif the order of July 7, 1949, held that it had not done so; and there was nothing in the language of the order which compelled him to 'give it that effect. All it did was to require the Simpsons \u201cto assert * * * any and all claims of whatever character against the debtor,\u201d reserving to \u201cany party in interest\u201d the \u201cright * * * to file objections, defenses, off-sets, counterclaims, or other pleadings or petitions with respect thereto.\u201d It appears to us an .altogether gratuitous interpolation to assume that the apparent purpose: <em>i. </em>&lt;?., to decide the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>controversy, was accompanied by a purpose to decide one part of it: <em>i. e., </em>whether the new claims were \u201cbarred\u201d; indeed that would deprive the trustee of one. of those \u201cdefenses,\u201d all of which the order reserved. Judge Hincks.so construed the order 'and he, was certainly right in doing so. The appeal comes to us presenting only the correctness of the interpretation of the order .of May 24,. 1950; and that is all we decide. Finally, we see no reason for suspending distribution of. any funds under the order of July 12, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
