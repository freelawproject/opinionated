This court has had recent occasion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to point to the strictness with which indemnity provisions are construed in favor of the indemnitor. The application of this rule of construction to the claim in question here compels the conclusion that there is no foundation for the third party claim for a judgment over, and that the district judge was right in dismissing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Putting to one side the difficulty in the way of recovery arising out of the failure of the invoked clause to expressly provide indemnity against the negligence of lessor, a reading of it compels the conclusion that it was not intended to, it does not, provide indemnity against the claim asserted by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In the first place it is so general in terms as to be wholly without the requisite definiteness as to what and how it covers. Read on its face, it is a general covenant of indemnity at all places and at all times without definition of any kind, or specification and limitation of time or place. If this difficulty could be cured, as appellants suggest it should be, by writing into the clause a limitation to things occurring on the premises leased to American, this would not help appellants. For it is plain that all that the clause does is to provide that the lessee releases lessor from claims for damages accruing to lessee and that it will hold the lessor harmless \u201cfrom all such damages\u201d occurring during the term of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">Appellants\u2019 claim that the \u201chold harmless\u201d portion of the paragraph adds to the \u201crelease\u201d portion will not stand up. By limiting the hold harmless clause to \u201call such damages\u201d as are dealt with in the release clause, it is made completely clear that though not precisely but inartificially drawn, the clause was intended to effect, and did effect, a covenant between lessee and lessor that lessee agreed to release lessor from claims for damages suffered by lessee, and it accordingly agreed to hold it harmless from all such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">As pointed out in Halliburton\u2019s case, there is a greatly material difference between a covenant such as this lease carries, releasing lessor from and agreeing not to sue him on claims accruing to lessee and covenants such as appellants contend the leased covenant is, agreeing to indemnify lessor and hold him harmless from claims of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">The judgment is right. It is</p>\n<p id=\"A4O\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-24\">. \u201c(2) Lessee hereby releases Lessor from any and all damages to both person and property and will hold the Lessor harmless from all such damages during the term of this lease.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">. \u201cThe Court concludes that the indemnity clause here involved does not indemnify the third party plaintiff against his own negligence, there being no unequivocal expression of such intention. Employers Casualty Co. v. Howard P. Foley Co., Inc., 5 Cir., 158 F.2d 363; Southern Bell Telephone Co. v. Mayor, etc., City of Meridian, 5 Cir., 74 F.2d 983; North American By. Construction Co. v. Cincinnati Traction Co., 7 Cir., 172 F. 214, 97 C.C.A. 32. This case is easily distinguishable from the Georgia case of Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Atlantic Co., 66 Ga.App. 791, 19 S.E.2d 384. There the indemnity clause was so worded as to clearly indicate an intention to indemnify against the indemnitee\u2019s own negligence, and the Court so found.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AE6\">. In Employers Cas. Co. v. Howard P. Foley Co., Inc., 5 Cir., 158 F.2d 363, 364, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR_\">\u201c * * * It is certainly the general rule that, where the indemnity is not contracted for from an insurance company whose business it is to furnish indemnity for a premium and where indemnity is the principal purpose of the contract; but from one not in the indemnity business and as an incident of a contract whose main purpose is something else, such as a sub-construction contract, the indemnity provision is construed strictly in favor of the indemnitor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXK\">While in Halliburton Co. v. Paulk, 5 Cir., 180 F.2d 79, 84, a case quite in point, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOf\">\u201cindemnity agreements are strictly construed against him who claims to be an indemnitee. * * * This is particularly true where the result would be to indemnify against one\u2019s own negligence, and it will not be so construed unless such obligation is expressed in unequivocal terms.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
