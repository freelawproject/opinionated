The order was made August 7, 1950. We see no abuse of discretion on the-part of the trial judge in making the order which he made at the time he made it. Whether developments since the date of the order have now so changed conditions as to entitle the applicant to the return of the documents it wants we have no way of knowing.. We are, therefore, affirming the order appealed from but with full, leave on the part of the applicant to renew its application for return of documents or papers or take such other steps before the -Court of the Western District of Pennsylvania as in its judgment seems proper.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
