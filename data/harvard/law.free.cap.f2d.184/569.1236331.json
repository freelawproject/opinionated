This is so because his motion 'for relief under Sec. 2255 was denied, it was no-t made to appear that the remedy afforded by such .proceeding was \u2018inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d, and his application 'for habeas corpus should not, therefore, have been entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-19\">It is so., too\u2019, because if the application should have been considered, the hearing on it was full and fair, and the record made fully supported the judgment of denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-20\">The order appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b625-21\">Affirmed'.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
