The relator came to this country from Malta in 1920 \u2014 an infant four months \u25a0old \u2014 and in 1943 was found to be \u201cpractising prostitution,\u201d for which reason the Board ordered her deported. The judge \u25a0dismissed the writ; but, as he thought her sanity an issue relevant to the validity of the deportation, he directed that her mental condition should be examined before the warrant was executed. The order of dismissal was entered on November 9, 1949; but while the appeals were pending, a special act was passed \u2014 August 25, 1950 \u2014 directing the Attorney General to discontinue any deportation proceedings against the alien and to cancel any order and warrant of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\"> Obviously, we should not dismiss the appeal on the ground that the controversy has become moot; that would leave outstanding the order of the district court dismissing the writ and would in effect affirm the Board of Immigration\u2019s order of deportation as well as the direction that the relator\u2019s insanity should be inquired into. While it is true that the dismissal was right as the law stood when the court\u2019s order was entered, it has now become wrong by the passage of the act. Nearly 150 years ago it was held \u2014 and it has been the law ever since \u2014 that: \u201cif, subsequent to Fne judgment, and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its obligation denied.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Order reversed; relator discharged.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-9\">.
