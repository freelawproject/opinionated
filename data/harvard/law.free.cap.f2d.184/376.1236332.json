The Tax Court held that the payments in question were not deductible for income tax purposes. After examining the record we find ourselves in full accord with the reasoning and conclusions contained in the opinion of the Tax Court filed by Judge Black, 13 T.C 329. We need add nothing to what is there said.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-17\">The decision of the Tax Court will accordingly be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
