John D. Park &amp; Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373, 31 S.Ct. 376, 55 L.Ed. 502, and United States v. Frankfort Distilleries, 324 U.S. 293, 65 S.Ct. 661, 89 L.Ed. 951, they urge upon us that appellees in thus focusing here on the particular sales made by appellants, have not only abandoned the theory on which the suit was brought and tried but have completely missed the point of decision in the Miles case, supra, 220 U. S. at page 400, 31 S.Ct. at page 381:</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">\u201cThat these agreements restrain trade is obvious. That, having been made, as the bill alleges, with \u2018most of the jobbers and wholesale druggists and a majority of the retail druggists of the country\u2019, and having for their purpose the control of the entire trade, they relate directly to interstate as well as intrastate trade, and operate to restrain trade or commerce among the several states, is also clear. Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co. v. U. S., 175 U.S. 211, 20 S.Ct. 96, 44 L.Ed. 136; Bement &amp; Sons v. National Harrow Co., 186 U.S. 70, page 92, 22 S.Ct. 747, 46 L.Ed. [1058], 1069; Montague &amp; Co. v. Lowry, 193 U.S. 38, 24 S.Ct. 307, 48 L.Ed. 608; Swift &amp; Co. v. U. S., 196 U.S. 375, 25 S.Ct. 276, 49 L.Ed. 518.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">We agree with appellants that though the sales made by appellants were made intrastate, the transactions, the subject of this suit, so affect interstate commerce and the exertion of the power of congress over it as to bring plaintiffs\u2019 activities within .the reach of the Sherman Act, unless the Miller-Tydings Amendment to that act excludes them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">This brush fighting, of appellees\u2019 making, attended to and out of the way, there remains in the way of our reaching the real battleground of the case, the scope of the Miller-Tydings Amendment, only the equally thin skirmish line which appellants have thrown out in support of their contention that the so-called \u201cFair Trade Contracts\u201d relied on to support the action are not contracts within the meaning of the Louisiana Fair Trade Law and the Miller-Tydings Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">In our opinion, this position is as little tenable, is as easily turned and taken, as was the line behind which appellees fought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>their delaying action. In the first place, if we could agree with appellants\u2019 characterization<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of these contracts, we could not agree with their conclusion that they would be insufficient to support the statutory action here brought. For it is perfectly plain that whatever the legal and binding effect upon the parties of \u201cthese fair trade contracts\u201d, it is with \u201cthese fair trade contracts\u201d the statutes in question deal, it is to give effect to \u201cthese fair trade contracts\u201d that these statutes were drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">But, if we could agree that, in using the word \u201ccontract\u201d, the statutes meant to, and do, deal only with contracts which are enforceable between the parties, we think the points appellants make against the contracts in question here are strained and without substance, and that they will not stand up in the light of the modern decisional tendency in Louisiana and elsewhere. This tendency is against too readily lending the aid of courts to defeat contracts on grounds of want of mutuality<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or the presence of a potestative condition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When, therefore, escape from an obligation is sought on these grounds, it is now settled law that courts will, where reasonably possible to do so, find a contract definite and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">Coming at last to the main battle ground, whether the Miller-Tydings Amendment is effective to relieve from the prohibitions of the Sherman Act, the price maintenance contracts relied on in this case, we find both appellants and appellees, instead of coming and sticking to this point, each setting up and completely outfitting a straw man of his own, the legislative history of the act as he claims it to be, and each furiously laying about to knock the other\u2019s straw man down.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">It is not for one who asserts rights under a state statute to prove as a condition precedent to its enforcement that the legislature had the right to enact it. He may stand upon the presumption of validity until such presumption is overthrown. This is especially so in this case since it is admitted, as indeed it must be,- that unless it it prohibited by federal law, the Louisiana Fair Trade Law has been already determined to be a valid law of the state of Louisiana<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> binding on consenters and nonconsenters alike as a declaration of state fair trade policy which the state is competent to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">It is admitted, too, that it has been held in Old Dearborn Distributing Co. v. Seagrams-Distillers Corp., 299 U.S. 183, 57 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Ct. 139, 143, 81 L.Ed. 109, 106 A.L.R. 1476, that state statutes of this character do not violate any provision of the Constitution of the United States, though a fair trade agreement \u201cconstitutes an unlawful restraint of trade at common law and, in respect of interstate commerce, a violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In this state of the law, proponents of, and protagonists for, the fullest scope for state fair trade statutes needed only the passage of a federal act relieving price maintenance contracts from the prohibitions of the Sherman Act. They did not need to seek from Congress permission or authority to enact fair trade statutes. It would have been a complete misconception of the source of state power, indeed in complete derogation of it, to do so. For the power to enact state fair trade laws derives not from the Congress, but from the inherent powers of the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Insisting, therefore, that the Miller-Tydings Amendment is ineffective to remove the prohibitions of the Sherman Act, as to non-signers, because it in terms refers to, and deals merely with, <em>price maintenance contracts which are valid by state law, </em>and does not in terms grant to the states power to make those laws effective against non-signers of such contracts, appellants wholly misconceive the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Likewise, appellees, when they devote a great part of their brief to the history of the act to demonstrate that it was the intent of Congress to cover laws binding non-signers equally misconceive the issues and take on a burden which they do not have to bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Agreeing then with appellants that the act is free from ambiguity and that there is no occasion to resort or propriety in resorting to its legislative history to find its meaning we yet agree with appellees that in comprehensively and completely removing from the prohibitions of the Sherman Act <em>price maintenance contracts which are valid according to the law of a state, </em>the amendment removed every prohibition from or impediment in the way of, the enactment by the states of fair trade laws, binding alike upon signers and non-signers.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">This being so, it is wholly immaterial whether the Congress as a whole, or particular members of it,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in enacting the Miller-Tydings Amendment, did or did not have in mind that there were state acts applying to non-signers as well as signers and, therefore, did, or did not, have in mind the specific intent that the amendment should be effective as well against non-signers as against signers.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">Read on its face and interpreted in accordance with that reading, what the amendment did was to remove all Sherman Act restrictions on agreements restraining trade in states where, by the state law, these agreements had been validated as to intrastate commerce. Thus a non-signer finding himself pursued under a fair trade act and without remedy as to intrastate transactions, is bound by the terms and wording of the amendment to find himself equally without remedy as to interstate transactions. For when he invokes the Sherman Act to prevent the enforcement against him of the state law, he is referred to the Miller-Tydings Amendment of it with the inquiry, \u201cWhat are you complaining of, the agreements which establish a fair price ?\u201d and the answer, \u201cThe Sherman Act as amended now validates them.\u201d If the non-signer answers, \u201cNo, I am not complaining of the agreements. I am complaining of the act of the state, which, though I did not sign them, requires me to respect those agreements, whereas the amendment of the Sherman Act, to which you refer, did not refer to, or authorize, state action against non-signers.\u201d \u201cSorry\u201d, replies the Sherman Act, \u201cbut the amendment neither authorizes nor prohibits state legislation. The control it exercises is not over, the effect it has is not upon, legislation by the states. It is concerned with, and only with, the Sherman Act, legislation by Congress affecting interstate commerce. The amendment, removing from the prohibition of that act \u2018contracts or agreements prescribing minimum prices for the resale of a commodity\u2019 * * * \u2018when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>contracts or agreement of that description are lawful as applied to intrastate transactions under\u2019 any state law, was enacted to, it did remove the Sherman Act as an obstacle in the way of completely effective state action, and there is nothing, therefore, that the Sherman Act can do for you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Whatever then may be our views as to the unwisdom of the policy lying back of fair trade acts and the \u25a0 Miller-Tydings amendment, we are in no doubt that the judgment was right, and must be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-14\">. \u201cSection 2.

That is that the transactions were so much in interstate commerce as, to be subject to the exercise of Congressional power in the regulation thereof and, also, that the provisions of the Miller-Tydings Amendment, relaxing the regulations in protection of interstate commerce evidenced by the Sherman Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are so clear as to render improper resort to the legislative history of that Amendment in applying its'terms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sole point of difference between us therefore is the, effect which should be given this, amendment when read in the light of its unambiguous language.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">It seems clear to me that the .majority opinion enlarges and extends the provisions of the statute to a scope not justified by the. legislative language. : I can not agree that the amendment, merely by excepting from the prohibition of the otherwise illegal , \u201ccontracts and, , agreements\u201d forbidden by the Sherman Act, \u201ccontracts and agreements prescribing minimum prices * *. * when <em>contracts </em>or <em>agreements </em>(italics supplied) of ;that description are lawful as applied to intrastate transactions\u201d under the State law, likewise embraces within its exemption the provi-, sions of any State <em>statute, </em>and this notwithstanding the only reference to such statute is that which might validate the \u201ccontracts and agreements.\u201d It may be further observed at this point, that the Miller-Tydings Amendment in no way sought to remove the prohibition against a \u201ccombination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of \u25a0 trade or commerce among the several States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-17\">The nature and purpose of the statute amended, \u2014 the Sherman Act, \u2014 requires that any amendment thereto which, in anywise relaxes the statutory declaration of public policy should be strictly construed. As has been said, \u201cthe legislative purpose set forth in the general enactment expresses the legislative policy, and only those subjects expressly exempted by the proviso should be freed from the operation of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, upon any basis, (except possibly from applying the - statute, not as enacted, but upon conjecture which might arise from some features of its legislative history), it is difficult to perceive any basis for enlarging the plain meaning of its language. But we are all agreed that there is no occasion here for consideration of the legislative history of the Amendment, and therefore whatever may have been the intention of its sponsors, we are controlled by the amendment as actually enacted. The amendment deals only with \u201ccontracts and agreements\u201d and in the absence of any enlarging provision, furnishes no basis for incorporating as an exemption from the Sherman Act any provision of a State Statute which restrains interstate commerce by provisions applicable to those who have not made the \u201ccontracts and agreements.\u201d My position is illustrated by the observation that the Miller-Tydings Amendment goes no further than to remove the taint of illegality attendant upon such contracts as to interstate transactions (Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park and Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373, 31 S.Ct. 376, 55 L.Ed. 502) as is removed by section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>1 of the Louisiana Act now in questipn as to intrastate transactions. Section 1 of the Louisiana Act relates, as likewise does the Federal Act, only to establishing the legality of the <em>contracts </em>in question. That far, the two statutes are in <em>pari materia. </em>Section 2 of the Louisiana statute, upon which the present cause is predicated, is a substantive law of Louisiana, not a contract or agreement. I believe it may not be successfully contended that without section 2, the provisions of section 1 could be in any wise applied to retailers who had not seen fit to execute price maintenance contracts legalized by section 1. The terms of the Federal Amendment no more embrace section 2 of the Louisiana Act than does section 1 of that Act. Thus Congress has legalized the <em>contract </em>validated by the State law, but not every provision of the statute. If, over and beyond the establishment of the legality of the contractual obligation to maintain minimum prices, the State statute otherwise authorizes conduct or procedure which runs afoul of a Congressional protection of interstate commerce from unlawful restraint, such as the appellant defendant here asserts to be true as to him, such provision of the State statutes must yield to paramount Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">It is not material whether the defense be declared predicated upon the lack of State power, or upon the ground that the enforcement of a State statute will result in a Federal Court of Equity basing the exercise of its injunctive power upon grounds which are illegal because of the Sherman Act. The result properly to be reached is the same, for the Federal Court must not require action which countenances conduct contrary to Federal law. In the present case, the Court could enforce section 1 of the Louisiana Act, but could not enforce that part of section 2 relating to non-contractors if, under the circumstances, such enforcement would be contrary to the Sherman Act. It is recognized that in this time when the weight of interstate commerce affects multitudinous transactions, the construction here given the \u25a0 Miller-Tydings Amendment greatly circumscribes the relaxation of Federal control in the enforcement of State Fair Trade Acts. However, we should apply the statute as writ ten. This construction removes the legal difficulty to the enforcement of permissive contracts, themselves declared illegal in Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park and Sons Co., supra, and likewise makes it clear that the provision of the Amendment that the making of such contracts shall not be an unfair method of competition, removes further infirmity theretofore found inherent in such contracts. Federal Trade Commission v. Beech-Nut Packing Co., 257 U.S. 441, 42 S.Ct. 150, 66 L.Ed. 307, 19 A. L.R. 882. If the Congress determines it wise to further relax the prohibitions of the Sherman Act, it can very easily do so by merely excepting from its operation all provisions of State Fair Trade Acts, including their planned restrictive operations against sales by those in no wise obligated by any contractual relation restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">It is also clear that as to those who have not executed contracts or agreements validated by the Amendment, there may be combinations or conspiracies in illegal restraint of trade which have a basis over and beyond that afforded by the execution of contracts and agreements as such. If so, such contracts being legally permitted, of course would not themselves evidence any illegality of agreement, but neither would they raise a sanctuary for those who, though parties to legal contracts, might illegally combine or agree to restrain interstate commerce so far as non-contractors are concerned. This was recognized by the parties and the trial Court. That Court, being of the opinion that the Miller-Tydings Amendment, construed in the light of its legislative history, in effect adopted the State Fair Trade Statute (as do my colleagues, but without resort to legislative history), expressly found as a conclusion of law, \u201cdefendants have attempted to show that plaintiff\u2019s actions in fixing retail prices constitute a restraint of trade between the states. No finding on this feature of the case is required, however, in view of the Miller-Tydings Amendment to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.\u201d For the reasons I have stated, I do not accept this view. The proper disposition of this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>would require us to adjudge that the Court was in error in holding that the Amendment removed the protection of the Sherman Act from non-contractors. He should have considered and adjudged the defendants\u2019 contention that, as to them, non-contractors, the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct constituted an illegal restraint of commerce between the states, at the same time giving to the plaintiffs the benefit of the Amendment so far as applicable to parties entering into the permitted price maintenance contracts. We should not evaluate the facts, which must be done in order to apply the law, in the first instance. I would reverse the judgment of the trial Court with direction that the case be thus heard and concluded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-9\">. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1-7, 15 note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AFO\">.
