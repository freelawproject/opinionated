The trial court sustained a motion to dismiss the information upon the grounds that the Oklahoma statutes were not sufficient to make <em>effective </em>the aforesaid Act. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-25\">The identical question was today decided by this court in the case of United States v. Bill Rome Williams and Ben Elmer Shaw, 10 Cir., 184 F.2d 663. For the reasons stated in the opinion filed in that case, judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
