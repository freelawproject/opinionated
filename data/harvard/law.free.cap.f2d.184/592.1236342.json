The matter has been here twice before. International Standard Electric Corp. v. Ooms, 1946, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 215, 157 F.2d 73; International Standard Electric Corp. v. Kingsland, 1948, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 355, 169 F.2d 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-22\">R.S. \u00a7 4888, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 33, requires an applicant for a patent to file in the Patent Office a description of his invention \u201cand of the manner and process of making, constructing, coinpounding, and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it appertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make, construct, compound, and use the same * * At first, the Patent Office and the District Court acted on the theory that the pertinent art was the calculating-machine art, and held appellant\u2019s disclosures inadequate because they would not enable a person skilled in that art to make and use the inventions. On the first appeal we decided, in effect, that the pertinent art was the automatic-telephone art.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-24\">The District Court has now found that \u201cNone of the applications here involved contains a sufficient disclosure to enable an expert in the art of automatic telephony and telegraphy to make or use an operative device.\u201d It evidently follows, and the court found in effect, that the ordinary skilled worker in the art could not make and use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the device. This latter finding, at least, is plainly correct. In my opinion it is enough to support the judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The statutory words \u201cany person skilled in the art\u201d have long been taken to mean what they say. As the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals puts it, \u201cThe generally accepted definition which has been applied as a working rule by the Patent Office as well as the courts over a long period of years * * * is to the effect that * * * \u2018any person skilled in the art\u2019 does not mean persons who excel their fellows in particular arts or sciences in which they are skilled, but merely men * who have ordinary or fair information and skill in that particular line. Ex parte Kerr, 1884 C.D. 27; Pupin v. Hutin, 1902 C.D. 269.\u201d Application of Beach, 1946, 152 F.2d 981, 983, 33 C.C.Pa.Patents 815. As the Supreme Court has pointed out, one of the purposes of the patent law is to make sure \u201cthat the subject of the patent will be dedicated ultimately to the public.\u201d General Electric Co. v. Wabash Appliance Corp., 304 U.S. 364, 369, 58 S.Ct. 899, 902, 82 L.Ed. 1402. In return for the monopoly that the government grants to the inventor for a teim of years, he is to disclose enough about his device to bring it within reach of the public when his patent expires. A disclosure that would enable a man of exceptional training and experience in the art, but not a person of ordinary skill in it, to make the device might not serve this important public purpose. Persons wishing to produce the device when the patent expires might not be able to find such a man; in fact, there might be no such man. The statute therefore requires the applicant for a patent to describe his invention, and how to make and use it, so that \u201cany person skilled in the art\u201d can make and use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The cases of A. B. Dick Co. v. Barnett, 2 Cir., 288 F. 799, and American Stainless Steel Co. v. Ludlum Steel Co., 2 Cir., 290 F. 103, decided in 1923, are not to the contrary. In the Dick case the court said in 288 F. at page 801, \u201cwe are satisfied that there was not the least difficulty on the part of one with an elementary knowledge of chemistry and a fair practical workman, in making Fuller\u2019s stencil sheet after reading Fuller\u2019s patent.\u201d In the Stainless Steel case the court said in 290 F. at pages 107, 108, the \u201cdisclosure speaks directly to those whose business it is to make the steel, and not to the cutler who is to fashion it\u201d and should not, therefore, be tested \u201cby the light of a cutler\u2019s (rather underestimated) workaday knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">It is not clear that appellant\u2019s disclosures would enable even a man of exceptional training and experience in the art to make the device. Appellant\u2019s witness Williams, an engineer of over 40 years experience in the telephone field, expressed the opinion that not only he but the average automatic-telephone engineer could build the device from the disclosures. But, as we held on the first appeal, \u201cthe court was under no obligation to accept * * * untested opinion as conclusive.\u201d International Standard Electric Co. v. Ooms, 81 U.S.App.D.C. at page 216, 157 F.2d at page 74. Even wholly uncontradicted Testimony on matters of fact, as distinguished from opinion, is not always conclusive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And Evans, an examiner in the Patent Office with 12 years experience in automatic telephony, testified that he could not build the device. It was for the judge who saw the witnesses and heard thc testimony to determine its weight. More over, appellant\u2019s witness contradicted himself. In response to the question \u201cCould you build it?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he answered, \u201cI think Yes, sir\u201d; similarly, in response to the question \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you build one?\u201d he said, \u201cYour Honor, I didn\u2019t have time.\u201d To the contrary, he testified a few minutes later: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say 1 would be able to actually construct a machine.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Judge BAZELON agrees that, for the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph, we cannot say the court was clearly wrong in finding that the applicant\u2019s disclosures would not enable an expert in the art of automatic telephony to make or use an operative device. The judgment of the District Court is therefore affirmed. Judge BAZELON disagrees with' me and agrees with Judge MILLER as to the meaning of \u201cany person skilled in the art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\">.

MILLER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AoX\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Although my colleagues do not agree in all respects, they have joined in affirming the judgment appealed from by holding the District Court was not clearly wrong in finding as a fact \u201cthat the applicant\u2019s disclosures would not enable an expert in the art of automatic telephony to make or use ah operative device.\u201d As I view the case, the appellant\u2019s proof clearly and undisputedly showed the disclosures of the application to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement of the statute; that being true, the District Court was clearly wrong in holding otherwise and its judgment should be reversed. Being strongly of this opinion, I feel it my duty to state somewhat at length my reasons for entertaining it.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">These appeals involve identical issues and were briefed and argued as one. ' They bring before us for review judgments of the United States District Court dismissing the complaints of International Standard Electric Corporation in civil actions brought under the provisions of R.S. \u00a7 4915 to authorize and direct the Commissioner of Patents to issue three patents to International Standard, assignee of William Hatton. The applications therefor had been rejected by the Patent Office because it thought the disclosures insufficient.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">The inventions described and claimed in the Hatton applications are for electrical circuits. to operate conventional automatic telephone switching devices so as to perform calculating operations, instead of their customary function of establishing telephone' connections. As the District Court said, \u201cEach - of the applications here involved relates to a calculating machine of a very complex type, including numerous combinations of mechanical parts and of electrical relays and control circuits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">Twice before this appellant has appealed to us from orders of the District Court which refused relief concerning the Hatton applications, and twice we have reversed the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-15\">\u25a0 I shall summarize. the history of these patent applications and the litigation concerning them, in order that the problem presented by the present appeal may be understood. When the applications were first filed in the Patent- Office, they were referred to and examined by Division 23, which had to do with mechanical calculating machines. They were rejected by an examiner who, though \u201cexpert in the calculating-machine art but not in the automatic-telephone art, could not make head or , tail' of the descriptions. . He thought they were therefore insufficient. The Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>of Appeals of the Patent Office agreed with him. It left undecided, as immaterial, the question whether the descriptions would enable an automatic-telephone man to make and use the inventions.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Suits then instituted by the appellant under R.S. \u00a7 4915 were dismissed by the District Court, which found that the inventions \u201cappertain\u201d to the calculating-machine art and are not \u201cmost nearly connected\u201d with the automatic telephone art; that the disclosures would not enable persons skilled in the calculating machine art to make and use the inventions; and that it had \u201cnot been established\u201d that they would enable persons skilled in the automatic telephone art to make and use the inventions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Upon appeal from these orders of dismissal (the first appeal), we held that Hat-ton\u2019s devices appertain to or are most nearly connected with the art of automatic telephony and not that of the mechanical calculating machine; that, therefore, the Patent Office should have referred the applications, not to its mechanical calculating machine division, but to its division having to do with patents in the field of the automatic telephone, since the question was whether any person skilled in the latter art could construct an operative device from Hatton\u2019s disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Our opinion recognized that, although the disclosures had been held insufficient by a division of the Patent Office which could not have been expected to understand them, nevertheless the District Court could have, and should have, authorized the issuance of patents if the proof in the <em>de novo </em>proceeding before it had shown that an expert in the art of automatic telephony could understand and apply the disclosures. We held, however, that the applicant\u2019s proof had failed in that respect, and said, 81 U. S.App.D.C. at page 216, 157 F.2d at page 74:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">\u201c * * * There was no evidence that any person skilled in the automatic-telephone art and not also in the calculating-machine art had ever shown, or said, that he could make the devices from the disclosures. Though a witness stated positively that such a person could do so, the court was under no obligation to accept this untested opinion as conclusive. The witness was an automatic-telephone expert who had substantial experience in the calculating-machine art; he was associated with the development of appellant\u2019s device long before the applications were prepared; and1 he was employed by a corporation affiliated with appellant. Accordingly the record supports the court\u2019s finding that the ability of automatic-telephone men to use the disclosures was not established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">Because the District Court had not had the benefit of the opinion of the Patent Office\u2019s automatic telephone division as to' whether one skilled in that art could from' the disclosures build an operative device, we-thought \u201cthe ends of justice will be best served by remanding the case to the District Court with instructions to hold it until the Patent Office decides whether in its-opinion that is the case.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ami\">Accorciingly, the cases were remanded to the District Court and were held there while the Patent Office referred the applications to its telephone division (16) to determine whether one skilled in the art of automatic telephony could build appellant\u2019s devices from the disclosures. The examiner held the disclosures were not sufficient to enable one skilled in that art to construct or operate the machine. The appellant was given no opportunity to be heard before the telephone division, and in his report the examiner specified no de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>feet in the descriptions or drawings and did not specifically find any facts. On appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals the examiner\u2019s action was approved and a request for reconsideration was- denied. The Commissioner of Patents then moved the District Court to dismiss the complaint, and in support of his motion made the following statement which I regard as rather remarkable :</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">\u201cIt is the position of the defendant that proceedings herein are now closed and that all that now remains to be done is to issue a formal order to that effect. The Court of Appeals did not indicate that the cases should be reopened for further prosecution in this Court. It remanded them for one purpose -only namely to be held until the Patent Office decided them.. This has now been done and there seems to be no reason for holding them any longer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The Commissioner obviously misconstrued our opinion on the first appeal, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 215, 157 F:2d 73. He seems to have thought the cases had been remanded to his office for final and conclusive determination as to the sufficiency of disclosure, which of course would have foreclosed and nullified .the \u00a7 4915 proceedings pending in the District Court. But those cases were still pending for decision by the District Court, not by the Commissioner. If after remand to the District Court, the .proper division of the Patent Office had found the disclosures sufficient, that would have been the end of it; but if the proper division should agree (as it did) with the improper division that- the disclosures were;, insufficient, the District Court was to retry the \u00a7 .4915 cases with that information before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">When the Commissioner moved to dismiss, appellant countered by moving the court -to reopen the cases to consider the decisions of the examiner of Division 16 and of the Board of Appeals, as well as to hear the evidence of \u00e1n independent expert so as to \u201cplace the District Court in a position to find the facts which the Court of Appeals was seeking * * The appellant\u2019s motion was denied, that of the Commissioner of Patents was granted, and the complaints were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Then followed the second appeal to this court. The judgments of the District Court were again reversed, because the Patent Office tribunals, after the remand of the cases, had failed to comply with R.S. \u00a7 4903, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 51, and Rules 65 and 66 of the Patent Office Rules of Practice, 35 U.S.C.A.Appendix, in that the reasons for the rejection were not stated. The examiner merely said, \u201cIt is the opinion of the Examiner that the disclosure in this application is insufficient to enable a skilled worker in the automatic telephone art to construct an operative machine therefrom.\u201d In refusing to reconsider its affirmance of the. examiner, the Board of Appeals of the Patent Office expressed its disagreement with this court\u2019s holding in the first appeal. Our opinion in the second appeal closed with this paragraph, International Standard Electric Co. v. Kingsland, 1948, 83 U.S. App.D.C. 355, 357, 169 F.2d 890, 892:</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">\u201cSince, however, it appears it would be merely a matter of repetitive futility to again remand the cases to the Patent Office for compliance both with the law and its rules, since apparently it is unable to advance any reasons upon which its rejection was predicated, and since in any event we think the District Court was in error in refusing to hear applicant\u2019s proffered testimony of an <em>independent </em>expert in the field, and in denying its motion made for that purpose, and for the further reason that proceedings under R.S. \u00a7 4915 are <em>de novo, </em>the judgments are reversed and the c\u00e1ses remanded for further action in accordance with this opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">So, because both the Patent Office and the District Court had refused to hear an independent expert 'tendered as a witness by the appellant, we sent the cases back to the District Court for a third hearing, with instructions to receive the evidence of appellant\u2019s independent expert on the question whether \u201cany person skilled in the art\u201d could construct an operative machine from the disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">This time -the appellant presented the testimony of Samuel B. Williams, who undoubtedly is an expert in the art of auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>malic telephony<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but who knows nothing of the mechanical calculating machine art. He testified that he had examined the applicant\u2019s 78 pages of description and 27 drawings, obviously of a highly complex and technical nature, and said he could build an operative machine therefrom. He also said there are many average automatic telephone engineers, perhaps less expert than himself, who could construct the devices from the disclosures. He admitted his unusually broad background of experience might enable him to understand and apply the disclosures more quickly than could a less experienced automatic telephone engineer, but said his greater experience gave him no other advantage. Under searching cross-examination he demonstrated beyond peradventure that he understood the disclosures. On direct examination he described Hatton\u2019s invention in considerable detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The appellee introduced in opposition its examiner, Norman H. Evans, who had spent twelve years in examining applications for patents in the automatic telephone art and who \u201cwas closely associated with an automatic telephone exchange\u201d during four years in the military service. Evans has had no experience as an engineer in the manufacture or construction of automatic switching circuits, and does not understand how shop or manufacturing drawings for the guidance of skilled workers in actual production are prepared by experts from patent drawings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He understood the more than two hundred individual circuits described in the applications but did not understand \u201chow the circuits joined together operate\u201d. Evans stated as his opinion that a man of ordinary skill in the automatic telephone art would not be able to understand the disclosures here involved. He did not say an expert automatic telephone engineer would not be able to understand them, and went no further than to state:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">\u201c * * * I am not skilled enough in the art and I do not believe anybody else is skilled enough that they <em>(sic) </em>can look at the picture and tell exactly what has happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">After considering the evidence of Williams and Evans, the District Court again dismissed the complaints and the cases are before us on appeal for the third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">I have carefully studied the testimony of the two witnesses and, for the purpose of comparison, here briefly recapitulate it: Williams, the only expert who testified, said that he and hundreds of other ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>perienced automatic telephone engineers could understand the disclosures and build an operative device therefrom. Evans, who is not an automatic telephone engineer, said he is not skilled enough in the art to understand the disclosures and that he does not \u201cbelieve\u201d any person is that skilled; his affirmative statement was that a man of ordinary skill in the automatic telephone art would not be able to understand the Hatton disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">So the evidence in the record shows without real dispute that an expert automatic telephone engineer could construct an operative machine from the disclosures, but that an ordinary skilled worker in the automatic telephone art could not do so. It follows that whether the applicant has met the requirement of R.S. \u00a7 '4888 by describing the invention so as to enable any person skilled in the art of automatic telephony \u201cto make, construct, compound, and use the same\u201d depends upon the meaning of the statutory expression \u201cany person skilled in the art\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">So, the sufficiency of the applicant\u2019s disclosures depends upon the answer to the \u2022question, who is a person skilled in the automatic telephone art, for the purposes of these cases? Is he one. who is skilled enough to understand and apply Hatton\u2019s description of his extremely complex invention, such as Williams and the other engineers of whom he spoke? Or is he the ordinary skilled worker in the automatic telephone art, of whom Evans spoke?</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">On this vital and decisive legal issue, the parties take divergent positions. On the one hand, the appellant insists that the requirement of the statute as to disclosures is met when it is proved that an expert can understand the disclosures and, from them, construct and use the machine. On the other hand, the appell\u00e9e-Commissioner contends that the statutory expression \u201cany person skilled in the art\u201d refers to an ordinary skilled worker, and not to an expert; this is clear from the following statement in his.brief:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">\u201cThese cases, therefore, present a single, simple issue, namely whether the worker of <em>ordinary </em>skill in the automatic telephone art could build an operative machine on the basis of the disclosure of any one of the applications here involved. If he could;,, the appellant is entitled to a judgment,-; otherwise, the decision below should be affirmed.\u201d (Emphasis was given to the word \u201cordinary\u201d by the Commissioner.) \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">The question may be stated in another way: how much or how little skill in automatic telephony must be possessed by the statutory man whose ability or inability to construct Hatton\u2019s devices from his disclosures determine whether patents will or will not be issued? The appellant says that because of the complexity of these inventions the statutory person must be and is an expert in the art. The appellee says the devices are unpatentable if the average worker cannot fathom them.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">The truth is that \u201cany person skilled in the art\u201d is a relative expression. The degree of skill requisite in such person varies directly with the complexity of the invention; the more technical and complicated the device being described, the greater the degree of skill requisite to understanding the disclosure and constructing the machine therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-16\">This was convincingly stated and clearly held in A. B. Dick Company v. Barnett, D. C.S.D.N.Y., 1922, 287 F. 573, 577-578, an infringement suit, where it was said:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-17\">\u201c * * * The phrase is always relative. Some patents are addressed to mechanical problems of a minor order. It may well be that the man skilled in the art in such instances may be even a journeyman. But this stencil art really concerns itself with large production, running into thousands and hundreds of thousands of sheets, and in such an art, where chemical ingredients <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>or units are employed, it would be quite deterrent of inventive enterprise if it were held that the chemist was too high in the scale, and that if one below that equipment were to fail, then the patent which the chemist found operative must be held to be inoperative, because the court has reached down far enough to find that one not a chemist is the \u2018man skilled in the art.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In the same case on appeal, 1923, 288 F. 799, the Second Circuit took occasion to discuss at some length the sufficiency of a disclosure \u201cunder the well-known language of R.S. \u00a7 4888.\u201d The court said in 288 F. at page 800:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">\u201cThe lack of fullness, clarity, and exactitude in the disclosure is sought to be demonstrated by defendant by the production of a number of witnesses, who declare themselves quite able to make good stencil paper, but unable to produce, by following the instructions of the specification, either the plaintiff\u2019s commercial product, the defendant\u2019s infringing article, or, indeed, anything else worth having. The inference from this is that, since the witnesses were men \u2018skilled in the art\u2019 and 'said they could not \u2018do the trick,\u2019 nobody could, and- therefore the patent is bad. Abstractly put, and put as a \u2018question of law,\u2019 it is urged that the patent must be bad if the disclosure does not instruct men of very ordinary capacity, or at most workmen of a journeyman\u2019s skill, how to embody the concept of the patent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The following paragraphs of the opinion appear in 288 F. at page 801:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">\u201cTherefore all the remarks of chancellors as to the meaning of the phrase \u2018man skilled in the art\u2019 'are illustrations and incidents, not precedents. They frequently illustrate the personality of their utterer rather more than anything else. We are of opinion that it is advisable to remember first how very easy it is not to do a thing, and how small is the step from not wanting to do a thing to declaring that it cannot bt done. This has been dwelt on innumerable times, but never more concisely than by Coxe, J., in Rynear v. Evans, C.C., 83 F. 696.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">\u201cWe further think that, in judging the sufficiency of a patent disclosure, it is necessary to consider, not only the art to which the invention may be assigned, but its relation to other and especially older arts, and the nature of the alleged new thought. It is upon the difficulty, obscurity, or even ilovelty of the art concerned that depends the kind and degree of skill or knowledge which must be possessed by those who assume to apply it.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">The Second Circuit reiterated its Dick Company holding in American Stainless Steel Co. v. Ludlum Steel Co., 2 Cir., 1923, 290 F. 103, 107, by saying:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">\u201cWe have recently considered the meaning of the phrase \u2018man skilled in the art,\u2019 and concluded that it is always a relative term, and that no absolute definition of its meaning can be laid down as matter of law, because the query as to who is the man skilled in any particular art is itself a question of fact and one having regard to the patent under consideration. A. B. Dick Co. v. Barnett, <em>2 </em>Cir., 288 F. 799.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">The holding of the A. B. Dick Company case was referred to, with approval, by this court in Radtke Patents Corp. v. Coe, 1941, 74 App.D.C. 251, 260, 122 F.2d 937, 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">In accord is Toledo Rex Spray Co. v. California Spray Co., 6 Cir., 1920, 268 F. 201, 204-205, where the following will be found in the opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\"><em>\u201cAs to the Second Objection: </em>We are convinced from the testimony that the disclosure is sufficient to enable one skilled in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the art to practice - the invention. It is true that conditions of temperature, quality of the ingredients, used, and perhaps other elements, require care .and- to some extent experimentation to produce the best results. But the disclosure is addressed to those skilled in chemistry (Minerals Separation, Ltd., v. Hyde, supra, 242 U.S. [261] at pages 270, 271, 37,S.Ct. 82, 61 L.Ed. 286), and we are impressed by what seems to us the greater weight of the evidence that the disclosure is ample for those so skilled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">I think we should approve the A. B. Dick treatment of the term \u201cany person skilled in the art\u201d and agree with the other cases to which I have referred, because I am unwilling to suppose Congress intended to deny patentability to an invention on the ground that it is too complicated and technical for a worker of average skill to understand. That would indeed be a deterrent to inventive enterprise, and would make mediocrity of ability in the reader the test of the sufficiency of the inventor\u2019s disclosure. Shop drawings and instructions, prepared from the patent drawings and disclosures by experts who understand them, guide the factory personnel \u2014 the ordinary skilled workers \u2014 in constructing unusually complex devices. The basic error, therefore, in the Commissioner\u2019s argument is the assumption' that \u201cany person skilled in the art\u201d -in all cases must be an <em>ordinary </em>skilled worker. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">\u25a0 Which interpretation' of the term \u201cany person skilled in the art\u201d did the district judge use in this case? Did he follow the Commissioner\u2019s erroneous concept that a patent should be denied to the inventor of a complicated device if his -descriptions cannot be understood and applied by one of merely \u25a0 ordinary skill in the art to which it appertains? Or did the judge test the evidence under the correct rule of the A. B. Dick case that the statutory term is relative, and that the disclosure is sufficient if it be shown that-experts in the art can understand it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In my view there can be only one answer to those questions: the trial court adopted and employed the Commissioner\u2019s notion that \u201cany person skilled in the art\u201d must not be more expert than, an ordinary skilled worker. This is readily apparent from the court\u2019s memorandum opinion, which opens with this significant sentence:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">\u201cPlaintiff has clearly failed to sustain the burden of proving that a worker of ordinary skill in the automatic telephone art could build an operative machine on the basis of the disclosures of the applications here involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Moreover, in the third sentence of his brief opinion, the trial judge said:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">\u201c * * * Such evidence falls far short of convincing the court that a worker of ordinary skill in the automatic telephone art could build an operative machine on the basis of the disclosures; * *</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">And among the findings of fact prepared for the court by the solicitor for the Patent Office is No. 9, which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">\u201cNone of the applications here involved contains a sufficient disclosure to enable a worker of ordinary skill in the art of automatic telephony and telegraphy to make or use an operative device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">I suggest that the opening or keynote sentence in the memorandum opinion and the portion of the third sentence quoted above sufficiently demonstrate the trial court\u2019s reliance upon the theory that the person \u201cskilled in the art\u201d is, for the purposes of these cases, a worker of ordinary skill, even without considering finding No. 9. If the District Court had adopted the A. B. Dick criterion, there would have been no occasion for the opinion\u2019s references to the clear failure of proof that a worker of ordinary skill could understand the disclosures; for under the rule of the A. B. Dick case that question is immaterial and is not onq of the issues-of fact. If the judge had considered the case in the light of what I think is the correct criterion set forth in the A. B. Dick opinion, he would have so stated and then would have confined his opinion to a statement of his conclusion concerning the true factual issue as to whether the evidence showed that experts can understand Hatton\u2019s descriptions. My opinion that the District Court applied the ordinary skilled worker test was shared by counsel for the Commissioner, else he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>would not llave written finding No. 9 to which I have referred.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">So, in my belief, the real basis of the District Court\u2019s decision was the lack of proof that an ordinary skilled worker would understand and apply the disclosures. Of course there was no such proof. The appellant did not contend and did not seek to show that a worker of average skill in the automatic telephone art could build and use these machines from the descriptions in the applications. Its evidence was directed solely to proving that the disclosures were sufficient for an expert engineer in that field. In contrast, and in line with the Commissioner\u2019s contention, the appellee\u2019s proof went no further than to show that a <em>worker </em>of ordinary skill could not understand the applicant\u2019s descriptions. Consequently, if the ordinary skilled worker theory had been correct, the court\u2019s decision would be correct, as there was no evidence whatever to the effect that from the disclosures such a person could construct and use the machines. But since that was not the correct test, the court\u2019s judgment ought \u25a0not to be affirmed unless the evidence permits and supports the conclusion that the disclosures are insufficient for an expert in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">I do not overlook finding of fact No. 8, which is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">\u201cNone of the applications here involved contains a sufficient disclosure to enable an expert in the art of automatic telephony and telegraphy to make or use an operative device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">This finding has no rational basis in the evidence, for the only expert witness testified to the contrary, and no expert contradicted him. The fact that Evans, who is not an automatic telephone engineer and who admitted he is not skilled enough to understand the disclosures, did not \u201cbelieve\u201d anyone else could do so, does not furnish a rational basis for rejecting the testimony of Williams, the expert engineer, who stated unequivocally not only that he could build an operative device from the disclosures, but that many other engineers skilled in the art could do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">I think, therefore, that the statement of the memorandum opinion that \u201cthe expert evidence offered by plaintiff is insufficient to show that an expert in the automatic telephone art could build an operative machine on the basis of the disclosures\u201d is not supported by, but is contrary to, the only evidence on the subject, and is clearly wrong. For that reason, the judgments of the District Court should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">I gravely doubt, however, whether the district judge intended to make the holding which I have just quoted, and the fact that finding No. 8 flatly makes the same statement does not convince me the judge himself intended to do so. There is no evidence whatever in the record to support any such finding. I know from experience, as does every lawyer, that many district judges do not critically examine findings of fact prepared by counsel for the successful party; but that, after indicating their views orally or by memorandum opinion, they leave to the lawyers the preparation of the findings of fact. In order to learn what the trial judge actually had in his mind, it is much safer to consider his own language in his memorandum opinion than to rely on the findings of fact; particularly is this true when, as here, the crucial finding of fact does not have an unequivocal basis in the court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">For the purpose of analyzing the memorandum opinion of Judge Letts, it is here reproduced in its entirety, with the sentences numbered and paragraphed for convenient reference:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">1. \u201cPlaintiff has clearly failed to sustain the burden of proving that a worker of ordinary skill in the automatic telephone art could build an operative machine on the basis of the disclosures of the applications here involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">2. \u201cThe court holds that the expert evidence offered by plaintiff is insufficient to show that an expert in the automatic telephone art could build an operative machine on the basis of the disclosures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">3. \u201cSuch evidence falls far short of convincing the court that a worker of ordinary skill in the automatic telephone art could build an operative machine on the basis of the disclosures; expert opinion to the contrary is without support in the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>4. \u201cThe Solicitor for the United States Patent Office will submit for settlement findings of fact, conclusions of law and a judgment form dismissing the several complaints which have been consolidated for the purpose of trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">I venture the suggestion that the word \u201cinsufficient\u201d in the second sentence of the opinion is there because of a typographical error' and that the word the court intended to use is the word \u201csufficient\u201d. A genuine basis for this suggestion is found, I think, in the first three sentences of the opinion. First, the court said flatly that the applicant had \u201cclearly failed, to sustain the burden of proving that a worker of ordinary skill\u201d could build and operate a machine from the disclosures. The use of the word \u201cburden\u201d indicates to me the judge thought such proof essential to'the applicant\u2019s case. Thus he adopted the Commissioner\u2019s theory, and therefore held the. applicant had the burden of proving that <em>am, ordinary skilled worker </em>could understand the disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Having employed that test, there was no occasion to add, as the second sentence apparently does; that applicant\u2019s evidence did not show that an expert in the art could understand and use the disclosures. And, if the court had intended to make such a statement in the second sentence, it is hard to see why he would have written in the next sentence, \u201cSuch evidence falls far short of convincing the court that a worker of ordinary skill in the automatic telephone art could build an operative machine on the b.asis of the disclosures; * * Certainly it was not necessary to say that evidence which is insufficient to show that an expert could understand the disclosures \u201cfalls far short of convincing the court that a worker of ordinary skill\u201d could do so. If the proof does not show that an expert can understand the descriptions, why add that such insufficiency of proof fails to show that a non-expert can understand them?</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Moreover, the opinion immediately and correctly points out there is no evidence whatever to the effect that a worker of ordinary skill- could build the devices. On the other hand, under my hypothesis that the word \u201cinsufficient\u201d was inadvertently typed when fhe word \u201csufficient\u201d was intended, the first three sentences of the opinion (which really constitute the entire opinion) form a consistent whole, and rational meaning is given to the third sentence and to its opening words, \u201cSuch evidence\u201d; for then the court is seen to say substantially this:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">\u201cThe plaintiff had the burden of proving that a worker of ordinary skill could understand and use the descriptions, and he clearly failed to sustain it. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence does show that an expert in the art could construct the machine from the disclosures, but that is not the test, and such evidence falls far short of convincing the court that a worker of ordinary skill in the automatic telephone art could build an operative machine on the basis of the disclosures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Of course, I have no way of knowing what Judge Letts really intended to say in the second sentence of his opinion. He is a jurist of great ability and long experience for whom I have profound respect, and I do - not believe he would write the second sentence as it now appears and then add the queer conclusion that \u201cSuch evidence\u201d (evidence that the disclosures are insufficient to instruct an expert) falls far short of convincing him that the disclosures were sufficient to instruct one who is not an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">But, as I have indicated, if I am wrong in assuming a typographical error was made, and if the trial judge did intend to hold not only that the disclosures were insufficient to enable an ordinary skilled worker to construct and use the machine, but also that an expert could not understand them, I am of the view that the latter of the two conclusions is without support in the evidence, is contrary to it, is clearly wrong, and should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">If I believed, as my colleagues do, that the holding apparently expressed in the second sentence of the memorandum opinion is not contrary to the evidence, is not clearly wrong and therefore cannot be reversed, I would advocate that an opinion be written pointing out the possibility that the second sentence does not correctly state Judge Letts\u2019 view of the -evidence for the reasons which I have stated, and that there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>fore finding No. 8 may not be expressive of the court\u2019s actual finding; and that the \u2022cause be remanded so Judge Letts may say what the fact is and whether finding No. 8 was intentionally made.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">There is not present here the strong presumption of correctness, spoken of in such cases as Abbott v. Coe, 1939, 71 App.D.C. 193, 109 F.2d 449, which arises when a Patent Office decision is concurred in by the District Court after a <em>de novo </em>hearing under \u00a7 4915; for the evidence of Williams was not heard by the examiner but was presented for the first time in the District Court, so the Patent Office made no finding with respect to it. Moreover, since the District Court\u2019s decision is clearly wrong, it is not saved from reversal by the presumption of correctness which attaches to a trial court\u2019s determination of factual \u25a0questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Reference should be made to certain other arguments of the Commissioner. For example, the appellee insists Williams was not an <em>independent </em>expert because he had testified theretofore in other cases at the instance of counsel now representing appellant, and expected to do so in the future; that, therefore, under our ruling on the first appeal, his evidence furnished no basis for decision. But Williams was not, as was the expert introduced at the first trial, an employee of a corporation affiliated with .appellant; nor had he been associated with the development of appellant\u2019s device, whereas the first witness had been so associated long before the applications were prepared. It should not be said that a consulting engineer is not independent if he had ever before testified as an expert at the instance of the attorney who then retains him, and if he expected to testify as such in the future in other litigation. If that were true, a patent attorney would be forced to get a new and different expert witness for every case in which he appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The Commissioner also complains that, unlike Williams, Evans did not have a preview of a Hatton machine. Nor did Williams, as I shall show; but Evans had the right under Patent Office rules to call for a model of the machine if he considered it necessary in order fully and readily to understand the precise operation of the machine. He did not ask for a model. Williams did testify that he had seen the machine, but he had done nothing more than casually look at the finished product. Pi\u00e9 did not examine its interior and did not see the hundreds of numerous and complicated circuits which enter into the invention. It was just as though he had looked at an automobile with the hood down, in which event it could hardly be said he had examined the engine.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Judge Bazelon shares my view that \u201cany person skilled in the art\u201d is a relative term and that, in cases such as these, the disclosures are sufficient if they show an expert how to construct and use the devices. He thinks, however, the judgments should be affirmed for the reasons given by Judge Edgerton in the last two paragraphs of his opinion. I turn, therefore, to a discussion of those paragraphs, conceding for the discussion only that there was no typographical error in the second sentence of the memorandum opinion and that Judge Letts intended to reject as unconvincing the evidence of Williams, the only expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">We did say in the first opinion, 81 U.S. App.D.C. at page 216, 157 F.2d at page 74, \u201cthe court was under no obligation to accept this untested opinion as conclusive.\u201d Of course the reference was not to the opinion of Williams, who then had not testified, but to the opinion of another witness who \u201cwas an automatic-telephone expert who had substantial experience in the calculating-machine art; he was associated with the development of appellant\u2019s device long before the applications were prepared; and he was employed by a corporation affiliated with appellant.\u201d The opinion of that witness was therefore \u201cuntested\u201d. Having helped to develop the invention, it was impossible for him to say that, from the disclosures alone, an expert could learn how to build the machine; nor could he be said to be disinterested. Williams was a stranger to Hatton and his devices and, as I have shown, was a completely independent expert. If the suggestion be that an expert\u2019s opinion is \u201cuntested\u201d and furnishes no basis for decision, even though it stands alone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>and uncontradicted, merely because the expert has not actually built the machine before testifying, I disagree. If that were true, there would seldom be expert testimony in patent cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">I have said that Williams was the only expert witness, thus indicating that Evans, the other witness, is not an expert in the field. Judge Edgerton says that \u201cEvans, an examiner in the Patent Office with 12 years experience in automatic telephony, testified that he could not build the device\u201d, thus implying that Evans is an expert and that his inability to understand the disclosures tended to show that an expert could not do so. I have heretofore pointed out that Evans\u2019 12 years experience has been as an examiner and not in actual practice in the art. The following excerpt from his cross-examination sufficiently shows, I think, that he is not actually an expert whose opinion ought to be given weight:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\u201cQ. Mr. Evans, you spoke of your experience in the Patent Office and some work in the Army with a \u25a0 telephone exchange. Have you had any experience in the manufacture or construction of automatic switching circuits as an engineer? A. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\u201cQ. Do you know how the various companies and manufacturers operate in making up manufacturing drawings and instructions in this art, and when I refer to this art, I always speak of the automatic switching art? A. I am not acquainted with how they make them up, but I am acquainted with the, final result.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t know how they go about getting it? A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">\u201cQ. If I understood your testimony aright, there is nothing that you have found or now find specifically wrong with any of the 200-odd circuits that the Hatton application discloses. Your criticism is based solely on the fact that although correctly describing operative circuits, you just can\u2019t understand it; is that a fair statement? A. I do not understand the <em>complete </em>system, although I do understand the individual circuits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALX\">In addition to the foregoing, I again suggest that Evans admitted he was not skilled enough in the art to understand this invention. So I say there is no contrariety of expert opinion as to the sufficiency of the disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Judge Edgerton\u2019s opinion says Williams contradicted himself. I quote from it:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">\u201c* * * In response to the question \u2018Could you build it?\u2019 he answered, T think so. Yes, sir\u2019; similarly, in response to the question \u2018Why didn\u2019t you build one?\u2019 he said, \u2018Your Honor, I didn\u2019t have time.' To the contrary, he testified a few minutes later: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t say I would be able to actually construct a machine.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">' The second question and answer, which are said to constitute the contradiction, should be examined in their context. The witness had just said, \u201cI have forgotten exactly how long it took me to go through this the first time, probably, oh, not over a day, maybe a half day\u201d, when he was asked the following question, \u201cAnd at the end of that time [after half a day] you thought that you would be able to construct and operate a machine based on that disclosure; it that right?\u201d It was then he answered, \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t say I would be able to actually construct a machine.\u201d \u2022 He was plainly saying that his first reading of the disclosures, which took only a few hours, did hot give him the understanding which he had after completing his study which took three days. He said, \u201cI can\u2019t say I got everything from the first reading.\u201d He explained by adding,</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">\u201cTo proceed with the, manufacture from then on would be merely a matter of converting the drawings from the patent type of drawing to the manufacturing type of drawing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">With respect to the contradiction charged to Williams in footnote 3 to Judge Edger-ton\u2019s opinion, I think it sufficient to quote the following questions and answers from the cross-examination of Williams:</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">\u201cQ. Do you feel that you now have sufficient knowledge to construct and operate a machine on the basis of this Hatton disclosure? A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cQ. Did you get that knowledge from your first reading of the application? A. No, I can\u2019t say that I got everything from the first reading, but I did understand the general organization of the system, and generally how it worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">\u201cQ. How much time did you have to put on it before you felt that you would be able to make the device of the kind described? A. If it were not for the fact that it is a United States application 'for patent, and it may be assumed that such an application, the circuits are operative, or they wouldn\u2019t have been presented to the Patent Office, \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t make a study for operative \u2014 for detailed operativeness. I would go ahead and start and proceed to manufacture.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">\u201cThe conversion of the information from the patent form to the manufacturing form is a more or less manual mechanical detail which could be handled. It really involves converting the information from one form to another. I am assuming that the device is operative as shown. To make a study to determine its operativeness would require perhaps several days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Surely it should not be said that the foregoing statements constitute such a contradiction as to discredit Williams and warrant the court in rejecting everything he said. It should be noted, too, that Williams had seen the machine operate (although he had not \u201clifted the hood\u201d and examined the mechanism) and so had the right to assume operativeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The decision of the majority here seems to me to be erroneous. I would reverse and direct the District Court to enter judgments authorizing the issuance of the patents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-11\">.

N.Y.1897, 83 F. 696, 697, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjW\">\u201c * * * The complainant has endeavored to demonstrate- that this testimony is untrustworthy, and its expert has introduced a series of experiments to show that the method described by the defendant is incapable of producing a seamless cap. That the complainant\u2019s expert should prove the defendant\u2019s method inoperative is not surprising. An experience of 14 years in patent litigation has convinced the court that when an expert undertakes to prove that his adversary\u2019s process' or, machine is a failure he always scores a success. It is much easier to make a machine that will not work than one that will.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
