McIntosh, from the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, at Springfield, Missouri. The son of the appellant is the Charles Lee McIntosh referred to in the opinion of this Court, McIntosh v. Steele, Warden, 184 F.2d 721, affirming an order denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The facts relative to his detention are stated in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-21\">The appellant\u2019s contention is that the statutes upon which the sentences under which his son is confined in the United States Medical Center at Springfield were based, namely, \u00a7 408, Title 18 U.S.C., and \u00a7 753h, Title 18 U.S.C.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were invalid under what he calls the \u201cChristoffel doctrine.\u201d See Christoffel v. United States, 338 U.S. 84, 69 S.Ct. 1447.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-22\"> Assuming, without deciding, that a father may apply for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of an adult son who is able to speak for himself and persistently does so, the appellant is clearly mistaken in believing that the ruling of the Supreme Court in Christoffel v. United States, 338 U.S. 84, 69 S.Ct. 1447, either requires or would justify the invalidation of the statutes for the violation of which Charles Lee McIntosh was sentenced to imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-23\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-30\">. 1948 Revised Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2311-2313 and \u00a7 751.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
