As to what we will denominate the Fort Pierce transaction, in December, 1937, the taxpayer purchased a group of Fort Pierce municipal bonds and detached interest coupons, all of which were in default. The bonds bore interest at six percent. We omit any statement of par value and cost for no question of the amount of gain is involved, the issue here being whether the taxpayer realized, under the statute and regulations, any taxable gain in the transaction. Under the City\u2019s plan of composition, and as approved by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, upon the surrender of the defaulted bonds and interest coupons, they were redeemable par for par, subject to a two percent exchange fee. Cash and refunding credits and interest accruals were likewise received, but these items are not, now involved. The refunding bonds, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ceived by the taxpayer bore a different date of issuance and a different maturity date, but could be called upon any interest payment date prior to maturity. The rate of interest differed from the original bonds, the refunding bonds promising a lesser rate of interest beginning at one and one-half percent per annum, but progressively increasing during specified yearly periods to five percent per annum. The City\u2019s plan of composition provided for the creation of a sinking fund to care for the principal and interest payments on the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">As to the Vero Beach transaction: On the same day the taxpayer purchased the Fort Pierce bonds, it acquired a large block of Vero Beach six percent and seven percent municipal bonds and interest coupons detached therefrom, all of which were in default. By its plan the City of Vero Beach proposed to refund its defaulted bonds par for par but the holders of accrued interest coupons were required to waive thirty percent of the face value of such obligations. The payment of a four percent exchange fee was required, and provision made for the creation of a sinking fund to cover principal and interest payments. In accordance with the plan, the taxpayer exchanged the defaulted bonds for refunding bonds, and also deposited with an escrow agent interest coupons for which it received a certificate of deposit representing seventy percent of the face value of the coupons deposited. As a result of the plan of composition, and as approved by the Court, the taxpayer received upon the surrender of its evidences of indebtedness, par for par, City of Vero Beach refunding bonds, plus cash. These bonds, which were subject to call on any interest date prior to maturity, bore interest at a lesser amount than the original bonds, beginning at two percent per annum, but progressively increasing during specified yearly periods to five percent per annum. Thereafter the taxpayer also surrendered other detached coupons, waiving the fhirty percent of face value in accordance with the plan of composition, and received refunding bonds, plus cash. Both the Fort Pierce and Vero Beach bonds were declared by their terms to be \u201cissued in exchange for, and as a continuation, extension, merger, and renewal of valid subsisting bonded indebtedness of said City incurred prior to November 6, 1934.\u201d This evidenced recognition of the subjection of all property, including homestead property, within the city limits to the levy of taxes, and indeed by their terms the full faith, credit and tax power of the City were pledged to the payment of the refunding bonds to the same extent and with like force and effect as the same were pledged for the payment of the indebtedness refunded.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In both the Fort Pierce and Vero Beach transactions the fair market value of the defaulted bonds and refunding bonds secured in lieu thereof was identical except for the difference arising from the payment of the respective exchange fees provided by the plans of composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The Tax Court, finding the facts in detail, of which the above is a summary of those now material, while not expressly overruling the contention of the taxpayer that since under the laws of Florida the refunding transactions created no new indebtedness, but merely continued the old with changes consisting of deductions in the interest rates, extensions of time for payment, and waiver of portions of the principal of certain detached interest coupons, no exchange occurred, thought the Florida law immaferial in determination of what was an exchange of property \u201cas this term is used in the Federal taxing acts,\u201d relying upon the cited case of Burk-Waggoner Oil Assn. v. Hopkins, 269 U.S. 110, 46 S.Ct. 48, 70 L.Ed. 183, and Berry Bros. Trust, 9 T.C. 71. The Court stated: \u201cThe test uniformly applied in determining whether a transaction does constitute an exchange within the purview of section 112, supra, is whether the material conditions of the refunding bonds differed substantially from the conditions of the old securities exchanged therefor,\u201d and applying this test, held that the terms of the refunding bonds extending the times of payment, reducing the rate of interest, together with the waiver of a part of the face value of interest coupons were \u201cvery material\u201d differences. The Court likewise deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>that \u201c\u00f1on-interest bearing-coupons were exchanged for n\u00e9w interest-bearing refunding bonds.\u201d Accordingly, the Court upheld the \u00a1determination oif the Commissioner that the receipt of the refunding bonds was an exchange within the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">.Here,, in support of. the Tax Court\u2019s determination, the Commissioner contends that the differences found by that Court to exist between. the old bonds and the refunding bonds constitute an exchange. The taxpayer here still, contends: that in reality the refunding bonds were only a continuation of the original contract obligation of the municipality and did- not represent new or different rights or obligations; that this must of necessity be true because this is the unquestioned law of Florida, and indeed the oniy basis' upon which by that law'refunding bonds'of any validity whatever can be issued except upon a favorable vote of the qualified electorate of the municipality involved. To this the Commissioner r\u00e9pl\u00edes that the State law is not applicable-\u2018to the incidence of \u00a1Federal Taxation under Federal statutes:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Consideration of this case in all of its aspects, factual and'legal, convinces us that the views urged by the petitioning taxpayer are correct, and therefore must be sustained. Consequently we find the determination of the Tax Court erroneous. According full recognition to the well established rule necessary\u2019 in the protection of uniformity of Federal taxation, that the nature and effect of transactions resulting from the application\u2019 of\u2019 State' <em>latf </em>is not at all' controlling in the imposition and collection of Federal taxes, we nevertheless find\" in the situation here the exception to the rule which obtains when the Federal authority h'a's expressly, or by necessary implication, provided that the applicability of.the Federal law may be determined by resort to State law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This exception finds ample room for application in this case. When the foundation for the imposition of the' Federal tax is the \u201cexchange\u201d induced by Federal law, application of the terms of such inducing statute in determining whether the \u201cexchange\u201d is taxable does no violence to the rule by which Federal tax consequences are determined by Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">On the one hand we have the Federal statute with reference to sales or exchanges; on the other, we have the Federal statute providing for the composition of municipal indebtedness, and in the present case it is this latter statute which furnished the basis for the claimed exchange. The latter statute, an exercise of the bankruptcy power of the Federal Government, expressly imposes upon the Federal Court the duty of determining that \u201cpetitioner is authorized by law to take all action necessary to be taken by it to carry out the plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe phrase \u2018authorized by law\u2019 manifestly refers to the law of the state.\u201d United States v. Bekins, 304 U.S. 27, 49, 58 S.Ct. 811, 814, 82 L.Ed. 1137. Thus the validity of the refunding bonds is to be adjudged by the Federal Court in accordance with the State law, and the confirmation of the plans now in question, as a result of which the refunding bonds were received 'by the taxpayer, represents a determination that such bonds were authorized by Florida law. However, in order for them to have this validity, they must be given the classification and 'their terms must be applied, as done by the Florida Courts in many instances, according to the principle that the power to issue refunding bonds without any vote of the electorate is \"that power which is limited to a mere authorized extension of the old obligation of contract to the new bonds, when the latter purport to be issued \u2018exclusively\u2019 as refunding bonds to be used for the purpose of refunding the old bonds or the interest thereon.\u201d State v. Citrus County, 116 Fla. 676, 157 So. 47, 97 A.L.R. 431. Also that \u201crefund<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>ing bonds are in legal effect authorized projections into the future of the original contractual obligations represented by the bonds which are lawfully refunded.\u201d State ex rel. Pinellas County v. Sholtz, 115 Fla. 561, 155 So. 736, 738. Also, as stated in Boatright v. City of Jacksonville, 117 Fla. 477, 158 So. 42, at page 51, 62, \u201cThis court in previous cases treating the subject of refunding bonds, their attributes and characteristics, has held that refunding bonds create no new debt, but merely evidence an extension or renewal, in a new form, of the original existing indebtedness, which original indebtedness is not extinguished by, but is merged into, the refunding bonds, with like force and effect as to obligation as if the original bonds had remained unrefunded by the issuance of such refunding bonds.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">It is apparent therefore that in any Court\u2019s application of the provisions of the Revenue Act to a transaction consummated as a result of the Federal provisi\u00f3n for composition of municipal indebtedness, the two statutes must be considered together, and when thus considered in the present case it is clear that there was no such exchange of property as produced a realizable gain, because if the taxpayer received anything, its validity must be governed by the law of Florida, and this was determined in obedience to the Federal statute. To give effect to the municipal composition statute, the obligations received by the taxpayer must be given the effect accorded them by the State law. Thus considered, the refunding bonds received do not, and can not legally, differ \u201cmaterially either in kind or in extent\u201d from the old bonds held prior to the composition. The transaction is legally equivalent to the transfer of property for property of like kind, and of equal fair market value. Equal market value is found here. We do not hold that a difference in market value, computed at the time, would not represent income. We do hold that the incidents of changed maturity dates, lessoned interest rates, and provision for a sinking fund, do not under the circumstances here evidence that the refunding bonds were \u201ca thing really different\u201d from the old bonds. We may further observe that if the refunding bonds in question are not valid under Florida law, their value would be so doubtful as, to remove any question of a gain taxable under the Internal Revenue laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Under the circumstances here, we do not Consider controlling the cases relied upon by the respondent. Emery v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 166 F.2d 27, 1 A.L.R.2d 409; Girard Trust Co. v. U. S., 3 Cir., 166 F.2d 773. Whatever might be the rule as to voluntary exchanges, we think that under the circumstances here, which we have related, the realities of the situation and the law impel a holding that the transactions here under consideration did not constitute the exchange of property for other property differing materially either in kind or extent.'</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">The decision of the Tax Court is reversed and the cause remanded, with direction that it disallow the Commissioner\u2019s determination of deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-19\">. 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b220-6\">.
