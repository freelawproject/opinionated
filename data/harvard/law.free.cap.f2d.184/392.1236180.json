Accordingly, on May 27, 1949, the Board issued a cease and desist order designed to terminate the unfair labor practice, including the enforcement and effectiveness of the union-shop clause in the existing contract with said companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">At the hearing before us, petitioners submitted the case upon their brief without appearance or argument by counsel. Among their contentions it is urged that Section 8(b) (2) is limited to discrimination against a <em>specified </em>employee or group; that an election under Section 9 (e) (1) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was unnecessary as the mine em-</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">ployees had otherwise approved the union-shop agreement; that the Board\u2019s finding of resort to strike action in support of demand for the union-shop provision was not supported by the evidence; and that the Board\u2019s order violated constitutional rights guaranteed by the First, Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">These and other contentions were resolved against the petitioners by the Board. We agree with its conclusions. Reference is made to the Board\u2019s decision and order reported in Volume 83 at page 916 of the Decisions and Orders of the National Labor Relations Board.
