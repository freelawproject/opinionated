The checks were made payable to various existing persons, principally\u25a0 to employees of plaintiff,' to whom they were never intended to be delivered, and to whom they were not delivered. Instead Mrs Culbertson, plaintiff\u2019s chief executive officer, endorsed the names of the ostensible payees on the backs of the checks and either cashed them or caused them to be cashed at the defendant bank or at some convenient mercantile establishment. The \u2019funds so received on -said checks, as it is claimed by plaintiff, were privately retained by Mrs. Culbertson, its President and General Manager, or otherwise disposed of by hef.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-16\">The District Judge held that there was no material issue of fact Which required submission to the jury, and granted defendant\u2019s motion for a summary judgment in its favor. Plaintiff has duly appealed to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-17\">We think the judgment below is clearly right and must be affirmed. The opinion below discusses the case so tho,roughly and so completely that we see no reason for adding anything to that opinion, which is, accordingly, adopted as the opinion of our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
