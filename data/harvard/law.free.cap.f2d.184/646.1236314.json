Todd, a \u201cClass A Stockholder,\u201d appealed from that order, but it was affirmed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the simplification of the holdings of the International Hydro-Electric System and of a number of its subsidiaries proceeded until 1949, when the trustee filed a second \u201cplan for liquidation and dissolution.\u201d A few days after the trustee filed this plan, Todd filed an application with the Commission for a modification of the order of July 21, 1942, based upon the power granted the Commission by the last sentence of \u00a7 11(b) (2) of the Act to modify its orders if \u201cit finds that the conditions upon which\u201d they were \u201cpredicated do not exist.\u201d The Commission denied this petition upon the ground that the conditions had not changed; and Todd did not petition to review the denial; but the Protective Committee of the Class A Stockholders (Davis, McGrath and Barnett) and Kroese, an individual stockholder, did so, and it is their petition which now comes before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The petitioners\u2019 argument is that the original order of July 21, 1942, had proceeded on the theory that there was no \u201ceconomic justification for existence as a holding company\u201d of International Hydro-Electric System, and that \u201cthe economic function and purpose of a company in its holding company (sic) are proper subjects of inquiry.\u201d The petitioners argue that these are not proper standards under the Act; the Securities and Exchange Commission on the other hand argues that its power to \u201censure that the corporate structure or continued existence of any company in the holding-company system does not unduly or unnecessarily complicate the structure,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> makes exactly such considerations relevant, and that in the case at bar the conditions had not so changed as to require any modification of its order of July 21, 1942. We hold that the Commission is right in concluding that the elimination of undue and unnecessary complication in a corporate structure involves an inquiry into the \u201ceconomic justification,\u201d if any, for the \u201ccontinued existence\u201d of a holding company; and that in the case at bar the Commission was right in finding that there was no such \u201cjustification\u201d for the \u201ccontinued existence\u201d of the International Hydro-Electric System.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">One provision of the trustee\u2019s second plan has been put through, resulting in a reduction of a series of debenture bonds, and no objection has been raised to that part of it. Another provision is for the International Hydro-Electric System to sell some of its shares in a Canadian operating company and to use the proceeds together with those of a $10,000,000 bank loan to pay off the remainder of its debentures. Lastly, the plan provides that the International Hydro-Electric System shall distribute its remaining assets among its preferred and \u201cClass A\u201d shareholders in a proportion not here involved. The remaining assets at their \u201cbook value\u201d after the cancellation of the debentures will be as follows: about $4,000,000 of the Canadian shares; $57,-000,000 \u2014 now much reduced in value \u2014 of shares of a holding company called the New England Electric System; about $10,-000,000 of shares of the Eastern New York Power Corporation, an operating company; and all the shares in two other small operating companies. Although the New England Electric System is a holding company, yet, because the International HydroElectric System holds only eight per cent of its shares, it does not count in determining whether the International Hydro-Electric System is itself a holding company,</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">The first question, as we have said, is of the power to dissolve a holding company because it has ceased to have any \u201ceconomic justification.\u201d Section 11(a) of the Act directs the Commission \u201cto examine the corporate structure of every registered holding company\u201d for three purposes : (1) \u201cto determine the extent to which the corporate structure * * * may be simplified\u201d ; (2) to determine the extent to which \u201cvoting power\u201d may be \u201cfairly and equitably distributed\u201d; and (3) to determine the extent to which \u201cthe properties and business\u201d may be \u201cconfined to those necessary or appropriate to the operations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>an integrated \u2022 public-utility system.\u201d An \u201cintegrated\u201d system is made up of one or more operating \u201cunits,\u201d so \u201cphysically interconnected or capable\u201d of being, that they can be \u201ceconomically operated as a single interconnected and coordinated system confined in its operation to a single area or region\u201d \u2014 \u00a7'2(a) (29) (A), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 79b (\u00e1) (29) (A). Section 1\u00cd (b) gives powers to the Commission which Congress deemed necessary to realize the three purposes just mentioned. Subdivision (1) relates to the .third purpose; it directs .each holding company and its subsidiaries to do whatever the Cqmmission \u201cshail find necessary to limit\u201d its \u201coperations\u201d to those of a \u201csingle integrated public-utility system\u201d. (There ar\u00e9 several provisos under which the Commission may allow control over one or more such \u201csystems,\u201d but they need not' concern us.) Nothing in this subdivision provides for the'dissolution of the holding company 1 Section 11 (to) (2) relates to the two' other purposes of \u00a7 11(a), (1) \u201csimplifying\u201d the capitalization of holding companies; and (2) securing a fair distribution of \u201cvoting power.\u201d It is this subdivision alone which provides for the dissolution of a holding Company, not only expressly in the second sentence; but also in the first sentence by the words \u201censure that the * * * continued existence. of any company in the holding-company system does not unduly or unnecessarily, complicate the structure\u201d. The two subdivisions are not mutually exclusive; there is no reason why the \u201ccapital structure\u201d of a \u201csystem\u201d may not be \u201cunnecessarily complicated,\u201d even though the holding company has \u201climited\u201d its \u201coperations\u201d to those of \u201ca single integrated public-utility system.\u201d The two .purposes are indeed separate; but, if it be true that a holding company contributes no benefit to the \u201coperations\u201d of an \u201cintegrated * * *\u25a0 system,\u201d surely its \u201cexistence\u201d may \u201cunduly or unnecessarily complicate' the structure\u201d of the two taken as a whole; and the Commission cannot \u201censure\u201d that the holding company\u2019s \u201cexistence\u201d shall not continue to do so without dissolving it. In short, we cannot understand how the determination of these issues is different from a determination of the \u201ceconomic justification\u201d for the \u201ccontinued existence\u201d of the \u25a0holding company.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Nor do\u00e9s the second sentence of \u00a7 11(b) (2) throw doubt upon this conclusion. It requires the Commission to compel a holding company to cease to be such as to any of its subsidiaries that are themselves holding companies; but there is no reason why this command should deprive the Commission of power in a proper case to reduce the complication of a holding company\u2019s capitalization in spite of the fact that its subsidiaries are operating companies. Indeed, were that not true, the Commission, when dealing at the outset with a colony of intricately subinfeudated companies would be obliged to stop unravelling them as soon as it reached any holding company which owned only the shares of an \u201cintegrated public-utility system,\u201d however otiose the \u201ccontinued existence\u201d of the holding company might then become. Certainly that is not in accord with the preamble of the statute : \u201cto compel the simplification of public-utility holding-company systems * * * and to provid\u00e9\u201d for their elimination \u2014 \u00a7 1 (c), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 79a (c).</p>\n<p id=\"AXOZ\"> The remaining question is -whether, if the Commission\u2019s powers go so far, it has abused them in this instance. The petitioners put forward only two reasons to show th\u00e1t the \u201ccontinued existence\u201d of the International Hydro-Electric Company has not become \u201cunnecessary.\u201d One is that the company 'has suffered a large loss in its holdings of New England Electric System shares, which can be made available to the company\u2019s shareholders as tax deductions only if the shares be not distributed, or sold; the second is that the business of the Eastern New York Power Corporation is growing rapidly and will need financing, which will be made possible by selling the remaining shares of Canadian stock .and the eight per cent holdings of New England Electric System shares. It seems to us at best open to debate whether a saving of taxes to the shareholders of a holding company is any ground, or at least a compelling ground, for continuing its existence, when otherwise it' should be dissolved. However, we need not decide that question, and we do not, because in the case at bar the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>sion has found \u2014 upon evidence that it was free to accept \u2014 that only the larger shareholders of the International Hydro-Electric System could save upon their taxes if the shares of the New England Electric System were not distributed or sold. Even though we were to assume that a tax saving by shareholders is ever a proper ground for finding that the simplification of a holding company\u2019s \u201ccapital structure\u201d is \u201cunnecessary,\u201d certainly we should not he justified in saying that a saving in taxes by only a part of the shareholders compels such a finding. Finally, the probable future needs of the Eastern New York Power Corporation, and its ability to finance them by direct issues were incontestably matters as to which the Commission\u2019s judgment was conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-25\">. \u00a7 79k, Title 15 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b703-10\">.
