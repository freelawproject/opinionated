The suit was brought by his father, Yee Don Found, as next friend, under the provisions of \u00a7 503 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903, providing in part: \u201cIf any person who claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States is denied such right or privilege by any Department or agency, or executive official thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the United States, such person, regardless of whether he is within the United States or abroad, may institute an action against the head of such Department or agency in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia or in the district court of the United States for the district in which such person claims a permanent residence for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the United States. * * *\u00ab</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Another provision of the 1940 Act should have preliminary notice, namely, \u00a7 201(g), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 601(g). This statute so far as here material provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">\u201cThe following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth: * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">\u201c(g) A person born outside the United States * * * of parents one of whom is a citizen of the United States who, prior to the birth of such person, has had ten years\u2019 residence in the United States * * *, at least five of which were after attaining the age of sixteen years, the other being an alien: * *</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">There is no dispute as to the facts of the case. Appellee was born in China March 16, 1941, the son of Yee Don Found, who, although born in China, is an American citizen by virtue of the fact that his father was a citizen. Yee Don Found arrived in the United States on August 6, 1929 at the age of 17 years, being admitted as a citizen. He lived for a time in Boston, where he attended school, and later engaged in the restaurant business at Santa Barbara. He has since 1939 resided in Seattle and carried on his business or occupation there. During the period here important he made two visits to China, the first departure being in 1936 when he went to that country and was married to a woman of Chinese nationality, returning to the United States after a stay lasting a few days less than two years. The second visit was in 1940-41 during which time appellee was conceived and born. Prior to the institution of this suit Yee Don Found brought to the United States his wife and two children born to. the couple prior to 1940.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">Leaving out of account the periods covered by the father\u2019s absence in China, he was physically present in this country but eight years and four months prior to appellee\u2019s birth. Because of this fact the American consul general at Canton declined to recognize appellee\u2019s American nationality and refused to permit him to be brought to the United States. Subsequently, pursuant to the statutory provision permitting that procedure, the Secretary allowed him to come here for the purpose only of prosecuting his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">Both below and here the Secretary has urged but two propositions, (1) that the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain the suit, and (2) that the father had not resided in the United States for the required ten years prior to appellee\u2019s birth. We agree with the trial court that the Secretary is wrong on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">1. The first point has to do really with venue rather than jurisdiction. The contention is that in the circumstances of the case the only court in which action might be brought was the district court for the District of Columbia, where the Secretary resides. However, \u00a7 503 of the Act provides that the action may be brought either there or in the district in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>person asserting nationality \u201cclaims a per-. manent residence\u201d. The complaint alleged, that appellee claims his permanent residence as Seattle, Washington, where his. father resides. The allegation sufficed, to invoke the jurisdiction of the court below<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and the court found as a fact that the claim of Seattle residence was made in good faith, and upon substantial basis. It is to be noted that the statute permits the bringing, of the suit regardless of whether the plaintiff is within the United States or abroad. In the circumstances in evidence the minor\u2019s claim to permanent residence where his father lived was nei- , ther irrational nor unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">2. The proposition more seriously urged is that Yee Don Found had not, prior to appellee\u2019s birth, had 10 years\u2019 residence in the United States within the contemplation of \u00a7 201(g), supra. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The term \u201cresidence,\u201d as there used, is entitled to a broad and liberal construction. Significantly, it is not qualified by the words \u201cactual\u201d or \u201ccontinuous.\u201d It implies no requirement of physical presence. Moreover, \u00a7 104 of the Act provides that for the purpose of certain designated sections, including 201, \u201cthe place of general abode shall be deemed the place of residence.\u201d The court found on persuasive evidence that the father\u2019s two visits to China were for the purpose of visiting his relatives and for no other reason; that he had no intention of abandoning his residence in the United States, and that in fact he had resided here since his arrival in August 1929, hence had been a resident of this country for nearly 12 years prior to the date of appellee\u2019s tirth.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In United States v. Rockteschell, 9 Cir., 208 F. 530, 531, this court considered a cognate provision of\u2019 the naturalization law requiring that the applicant shall have resided in the United States \u201ccontinuously for the period of five years.\u201d Speaking through Judge Dietrich, the court said, 208 F. at page 533: \u201cTo establish a residence there must doubtless be a concurrence of act and intent; but, when once established, temporary absences from time to time, unaccompanied by an intent to abandon or change the residence, do not operate to interrupt the continuity thereof. * * * Within reasonable limits, therefore, it is a question of fact, to be determined in the light of all the attendant circumstances of each particular case, whether the continuity of residence has been broken by temporary absences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">The Immigration and Naturalization Service appears consistently to have taken a like view of the residence requirements of \u00a7 201(g). A number of its decisions have been cited, including the cases of Lynn Patricia Burnard, file 56172/878; Sydney Joel Kadwell, file 1415-830; Wong Wah Chill, file 56232/575; In re Eideen Wai Hoi Fok, A-7047289, Dec. 6, 1948; In re Chu Sze Chiang, 1300-99443, July 28, 1950. We have had access to but three of the files, these being the last three cited. The position taken in them is in harmony with the views we have expressed. On oral argument counsel for the Secretary disclaimed any knowledge of these administrative determinations, and he has not since undertaken to dispute appellee\u2019s contention that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the statute is at variance with the position of the Immigration Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-13\">.
