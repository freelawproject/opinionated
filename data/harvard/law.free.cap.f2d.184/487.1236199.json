The appeal is bottomed upon the claim that the articles described were exempt, and hence no title passed to the trustee, and that therefore appellant may enforce collection from the bankrupt, under the principle of Lockwood v. Exchange Bank, 190 U.S. 294, 23 S.Ct., 751, 47 L.Ed. 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">We think that upon the record before us appellant is not in a position to complain. The record fails to show that this specific property, or any of it, was in fact exempt. While the bankrupt claimed \u201chousehold goods\u201d and \u201cwearing apparel\u201d as exempt, the trustee never saw any of such property, much less took possession of it, for the purpose of setting .aside proper exemptions, or determining whether the $500 in exempt property allowed by Washington law- could possibly include these articles. Such duty was not performed. Collier on Bankruptcy, 14th Ed., \u00a7 70.08. For aught that.;we can tell the trustee should have had not merely the seller\u2019s interest, but the articles themselves, in their entirety. We find no occasion to express any opinion as to the .propriety of the referee\u2019s separating the seller\u2019s and the buyer\u2019s interests, as he did, since upon the record we find that appellant has shown no ground for complaint. The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
