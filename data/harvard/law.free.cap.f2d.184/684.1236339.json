Claiming infringement and unfair competition, it brought suit to enjoin Samuel H. Friend and others from using the trade-mark \u201cFeature Lock\u201d in the advertising and sale at retail of similar wedding and engagement ring ensembles purchased from Feature Ring Co., Inc. The latter, which is in the business of manufacturing and selling at wholesale interlocking ring mountings under the Feature Lock trade-mark, intervened as a defendant and filed a counterclaim alleging harrassment by Granat Bros, of Feature\u2019s customers and potential customers by unwarranted claims of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"AUd\">Upon the trial the court found that the Wed-Lok trade-mark is not primarily descriptive, as asserted by Feature, but is used in a suggestive or figurative sense, and is a valid mark. It found, on the other hand, that the words Feature Lock are sufficiently distinct from Granat Bros.\u2019 mark as to preclude likelihood that the Feature Ring Co.\u2019s product will be passed off as those of Granat, and further, that the evidence failed to show confusion in the minds of customers; hence that neither infringement nor unfair competition had been established. In respect of the counterclaim interposed by Feature Ring Co., it found that the notices of infringement sent out by Granat to the customers of the former were sent in good faith, and that since suit was seasonably brought by Granat, no sufficient grounds existed for Feature\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Both sides have appealed. We see no reversible error in the findings or decision below, and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
