One Floyd W. Silcott (not a party to this suit) entered into a contract with the City of Harper, Kansas, for construction, work on the municipal airport. The contract was entitled \u201cSpecifications and Contract Documents.\u201d The project was supported by federal funds and-\u201cSpecifications and Contract Documents\u201d were more or less standard for this type of wo'rk. Silcott was required to furnish a payment bond. The appellant insurance company executed the bond. Silcott failed to pay the rental for- the use of the equipment and the owner of the equipment instituted this action on the bond for the recovery of the amount due him from the contractor. The company has appealed from the judgment against it for the amount of these items..</p>\n<p id=\"b992-15\">. The claim merged in the judgment consisted of three separate items \u2014 rentals, repairs, and the cost of transporting the equipment back to appellee\u2019s place of business in compliance with the rental agreement. The correctness of these items is not in question. The only question is whether they fall within the coverage of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-16\">Three assignments of error are urged for reversal. , They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b992-17\">1. The court erred in concluding and holding that the contract in question is governed by the laws applicable to the Federal Airport Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 et seq. and not by the laws of the State of Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-18\">2. , The- court erred in concluding and holding that the items of rental, repairs and transportation sued on in the plaintiff's petition are lienable under the -Kansas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-19\">\u20183. The court-erred in rendering judgment for \u25a0 the \u2018 plaintiff and against this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-20\">We find nothing in the record indicating that the trial court predicated its judgment on the grounds set but in assignments one and two. No findings of fact or conclusions of law were made and no opinion is on file in this case. - Neither does the court\u2019s judgment indicate the theory upon which judgment was rendered against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-21\">It has been held repeatedly that a correct judgment will not be disturbed on appeal merely because it is based upon an erroneous theory of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So, if the judgment is correct as a matter of law, it will not be disturbed because the ground upon which it is predicated does not appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-22\">For the purpose of this opinion, we will assume that the legal liability under the bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>is to be measured by Kansas law. It may also be assumed, without so deciding, that under the Kansas Lien Statute, G.S.Kan. 1935, 60-1401, rental items such as these are non-lienable items. In this posture of the case, we nonetheless conclude that the judgment must he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">In Shannon v. Abrams, 98 Kan. 26, 157 P. 449, the Kansas Supreme Court held that where the surety bond obligated the surety to pay for all labor and material and all other obligations or liabilities incurred in the doing of the work that it was liable for non-lienable, as well as lienable. items. The. effect of this decision is that a surety may obligate itself for claims other than those that are lienable items and may assume obligations greater than those required by the statutory lien bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The problem then is to construe the surety contract in order to determine the extent of the obligation thereunder. It is to be noted that the surety bond refers to the construction contract and by reference makes it a part of the bond. The specifications in turn are a part of the contract. So in order to determine the intent of the bond with respect to coverage, we must construe the bond, the contract and specifications together.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The specifications necessary to consider are Specifications 10-25, 30-05, and 10-43. So construed, we conclude appellant is obligated for the items in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Although it is not free from doubt, Specification 10-25 standing alone might be construed as defining a surety bond coextensive only with the Kansas Surety Lien Law, G. S.Kan.1935, 60-1413, requirements. But it does not stand alone. As stated, these specifications are more or less standard and are, perhaps generally used in construction projects in which federal funds are involved. This is conceded by appellant in its brief. Specification 10-25 defines a payment bond as: \u201cThe approved form of security furnished by the Contractor and his surety as a guarantee that he will pay in full all bills and accounts for materials and labor used in the construction \u25a0 of the work,, as provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">, <em>No </em>doubt this Specification was intended to define a .statutory payment bond, or in other words the minimum requirements. of a payment bond. But that it was not intended to measure'the liability of the surety under this bond is indicated by Specifications numbered 30-05 and 10-43. \u25a0 Specification 30-05 particularizes the requirements of the payment bond in question and .specifically, provides that it must guarantee \u201cthe payment of all labor, materials, rentals, etc,\u201d This construction also finds support in Specification 10-43 which defines a surety as the party who engages \u201cto be responsible for the entire and satisfactory fulfillment of the contract and for the payment of all lawful debts incurred in fulfilling the' contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">We think the bond in question falls squarely within the Abrams case, supra, and that appellant was thereby required to pay all the claims, whether lienable or other 1 wise, incurred by the contractor under his; construction contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-11\">.
