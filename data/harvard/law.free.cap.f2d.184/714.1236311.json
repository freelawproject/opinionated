The district court held the Housing Expediter to be an indispensable party to the action; that he could not be sued in Ohio; amd that there ihad been no service of process sufficient to confer jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">Janney, Area Rent Control Director, filed the motion to dismiss sustained by the district court, and filed therewith an affidavit of Woods asseverating that at all times since his appointment as Housing Expediter his official residence has been in Washington, D. C., and that he is not an inhabitant of, and does not have his home in, the State of Ohio. The affiant further stated that he has not been personally served-with a petition and summons in this action, and has at no time authorized or appointed anyone agent to accept service in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">We are in accord with the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Berlinsky v. Woods, Federal Housing Expediter, 178 F.2d 265, certiorari denied 339 U.S. 949, 70 S.Ct. 805, wherein it was held that the United States District Court in Maryland had no jurisdiction over the Housing Expediter because his residence is in Washington, D. C.; and that the attempted service of process upon \u2018him in the District of Columbia was- ineffective to confer jurisdiction upon the Maryland federal court. The long recognized principle of Butterworth v. Hill, 114 U.S. 128, 5 S.Ct. 796, 29 L.Ed. 119, was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">The applicable statute here is 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1391(b), which provides: \u201cA civil action wherein jurisdiction is not 'founded solely on diversity of citizenship may be brought only in the judicial district where all defendants reside, except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d The present case is even stronger against jurisdiction than was the Berlinsky case, supra, for the reason that no summons was ever served upon the Housing Expediter, nor was any process delivered to or left at his usual place of abode. Compare Federal Landlords \u25a0Committee, Inc. <em>v. </em>Woods, 9 F.R.D. 622, decided by a three-judge court with Chief Judge Learned Hand presiding.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-16\">We regard, as did the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the Housing Expediter as an indispensable party in pursuance of the Housing and Rent Act of 1947, as amended, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 1881 et seq. Nowhere in the Act is any jurisdiction expressed or implied to be vested in any district court, except that for the District of Columbia, where the Housing Expediter is made defendant. The Act empowers him to sue in all districts of the United States, but the converse is not true. This differentiation \u25a0was within the power of Congress to make, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>and the courts of the United States must accept it, as our concern is not with' the policy oif national laws, but our duty is to construe. and apply them when constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">We have taken into full consideration our own opinions wherein we have held certain department heads not to be indispensable parties to an action brought in some other district than the District o,f Columbia, \u00a1but we regard all these oases, in which our views are fully set forth, as distinguishable \u2022from the situation encountered here. Jarvis v. Shackelton Inhaler <em>Co., </em>6 Cir., 136 F.2d 116; Varney v. Warehime, 6 Cir., 147 F.2d 238; and Greer v. Cline, 6 Cir., 148 F.2d 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">We find -no merit whatever in the argument of appellant resting upon alleged analogy between service on foreign corporations and service on federal officials. In our view, there is no analogy.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The order of dismissal .is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
