Int. Rev.Code, \u00a7 23(a) (1) (A), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23(a) (1) (A). The individual appellant is an officer and chief salesman of the corporate defendant, a beer distributor. The Tax Court allowed some of the amounts claimed, but not, according to the taxpayers, as much as they were entitled to. The questions presented are questions of fact. We are entitled to reverse the Tax Court on questions of fact if its findings are clearly erroneous, but not because of our disagreement with it on a particular factual issue. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 1141(a), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1141(a); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">It may well be that a question of what is \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d in a business man\u2019s expenditures is not a subject \u25a0appropriate for litigation. But it is there and some court must pass on it. The Tax Court having done so, there is nothing for an appellate court to review when the conclusion has evidence to support it, as it has here.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">The decisions of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
