Such an order is not a final decision within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291 and is not appealable. See, Blanco v. United States of America, 9 Cir., 184 F. 2d 117.

If this is not clear to petitioner he should seek advise from someone who can understand it.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-18\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
