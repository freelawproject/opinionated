The excavation was 6 feet wide and about 5 feet deep. It was at a low point in the road approximately 150 feet west of the \u201cOld Covered Wagon Inn\u201d. To the right of the road, on a fence west of the Inn and just east of the \u25a0 excavation, was a sign, 3 feet by 4 feet, which read \u201cKeep to the Right\u201d. The sign was illuminated by a pot flare or torch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>There were no lights or pot flares burning nor were there any barricades in place on the lane in which the plaintiff was driving <em>east </em>of the excavation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> About 50 to <em>75 </em>feet <em>west </em>of the excavation there were some pot flares burning in that lane. No overhead street lamps lighted the scene of the accident and no watchman was present. Sheppard, the defendant\u2019s assistant superintendent, who had, among others, been assigned to the job of seeing to it \u201cthat the safety of the public would be protected\u201d by checking on warning lights, etc., had left the scene at 5 P. M. The weather was a little foggy at the site of the excavation and it had been raining shortly before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">After passing the Inn and while nearing the excavation plaintiff saw an automobile on the outside eastbound lane approaching from the opposite direction \u201cblinking\u201d its headlights. The \u201cblinking\u201d was intended to warn the plaintiff of the presence of the excavation. The plaintiff\u2019s own headlights were on at the time and illuminated the road for a distance from 100 to 200 feet ahead. Plaintiff could have brought his car to a stop within 15 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">At the time of the occurrence Lancaster Avenue was being reconstructed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Highway Department (\u201cDepartment\u201d) which had let a portion of the reconstruction contract to the defendant. The latter in turn, with the permission of Department, had sublet the work to the C. &amp; T. Construction Company. Department\u2019s consent was given \u201cwith the condition that you (defendant) maintain on the work at all times a competent superintendent in the direct employ of your company, through whom representatives of this Department may deal\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The contract between Department and the defendant required that two lanes of traffic (one in each direction) should at all times be kept open for the use of the traveling public. It specifically provided that suitable and sufficient barricades, warning signs, torches and/or approved reflectors be placed and maintained to protect adequately the work under construction and the traveling public. Barricades, danger and warning signs, and the traffic lanes were required to be illuminated at night in such manner as to be plainly visible and all lights were to be kept burning from sunset until sunrise. A sufficient number of watchmen was to be provided for the protection of the public and the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Certain well-established Pennsylvania legal principles are applicable in the determination of the issue as to whether plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">\u201cFor a court to be justified in declaring a person contributorily negligent as a matter of law, evidence of such negligence must be so clear and unmistakable that no reasonable basis remains for an inference to the contrary. * * *\u201d Mogren v. Gadonas, 1948, 358 Pa. 507, 510, 58 A.2d 150, 151. The Pennsylvania rule that the operator of an automobile must have such control of it so as to be able to stop it within the range of his headlights, or the assured clear distance ahead, is not an inflexible mandate under the decisions of the State\u2019s appellate courts. It is not applied when there is evidence from which the jury may find extraordinary or disconcerting circumstances affecting the driver\u2019s judgment and actions at the time of the accident. Yocum v. Reading City, 1912, 235 Pa. 552, 84 A. 510; Farley v. Ventresco, 1932, 307 Pa. 441, 161 A. 534; Kazan v. Wilkes-Barre Railway Corporation, 1942, 151 Pa.Super. 38, 29 A.2d 221, affirmed per curiam by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, 1943; 347 Pa. 232, 32 A.2d 32; Boor v. Schreiber, 1943, 152 Pa.Super. 458, 33 A.2d 648. It is the duty of the operator of a motor vehicle \u201c* * * to regard the traffic around him as well as the roadway ahead of him. * * *\u201d Boliver v. Philadelphia, 1939, 137 Pa.Super. 437, 442, 9 A.2d 193, 195. One, \u201c* * * should not be held negligent in doing an act which he believed was proper and that he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>encouraged to believe proper by the one who injured him.\u201d Klingensmith v. West Penn Railways Co., 1931, 303 Pa. 487, 491, 154 A. 811, <em>812; </em>nor is there a duty to anticipate defendant\u2019s negligence. Dickun v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., 1932, 308 Pa. 20, 161 A. 739. \u201cOn a motion for judgment n. o. v., the testimony should not only be read in the light most advantageous to plaintiff, all conflicts therein being resolved in his favor, but he must be given the benefit of every fact and inference of fact pertaining to the issues involved which may reasonably be deduced from the evidence.\u201d Galliano v. East Penn Electric Co., 1931, 303 Pa. 498, 508,154 A. 805, 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Applying the principles stated to the instant case, we are of the opinion that the question of contributory negligence was clearly one for the exercise of reasonable judgment by the trial court and jury and we cannot say as a matter of law that they erred in the conclusion which they reached. Farley v, Ventresco, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The presence of'the \u201cKeep to the Right\u201d sign just east of the excavation on which the plaintiff said he relied was alone sufficient to make the question of contributory negligence one for the jury. Additionally, there were the factors of the burning pot flares in the lane <em>west </em>of the excavation and the temporary distraction of the plaintiff from the roadway immediately ahead of him by reason of the blinking lights of the approaching automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In Havens v. Strayer, 1937, 326 Pa. 563, 193 A. 13, 16, the defendant, a contractor, was replacing a bridge. The center of the bridge was found to have moved 30 inches. The defendant nevertheless wished to keep the bridge open to traffic, pursuant to his. contract obligation. Defendant\u2019s watchman at one end of the bridge was instructed to tell motorists that the bridge was safe for the use of one car at a time and to inform them that the bridge \u201chad moved at the center pier, and that they were. traveling at their own risk if they crossed the bridge.\u201d The ' Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that plaintiff\u2019s decedent was not guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Said the Court 326 Pa. at page 570, 193 A. at page 16:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">\u201cIt cannot be said as a matter of law that a man is negligent who starts to cross a bridge after being told <em>in effect </em>by the watchman stationed there that \u2018one car at a time can go over.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in text.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">In Clamper v. Philadelphia, 1924, 279 Pa. 385, 124 A. 132, a red light to the side of a street marked a hole. Twenty-five feet ahead of the light, the City had stretched an unmarked rope completely across the street, which plaintiff hit. Holding that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, the Court said, 279 Pa. at page 387, 124 A. at page 133:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">\u201cOne driving along the street in question would be <em>justified </em>in concluding the danger point was confined to the immediate location of the red light near the curb and that the remainder of the street was passable.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">In Mumbower v. Weaver, 1925, 282 Pa. 605, 128 A. 535, 536, the defendant contractor repairing a street put up \u201csome red lights * * * --a red flag, and signs warning that the street was under repair and closed.\u201d However, the road was not entirely blocked off, one side was open for travel and \u201cthe' warnings so indicated\u201d. Farther along the road an unmarked rope stretched across the entire street and plaintiff drove his car into this rope. In affirming judgment for the plaintiff the Court said, 282 Pa. at page 608,128 A. at page 536:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">\u201cUnder this state of facts, we cannot say plaintiff\u2019s decedent was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law in proceeding along that part of the highway which was <em>apparently </em>open to public travel.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>\u201cThe evidence, permissible for the court\u2019s consideration in connection with the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v., fails to show negligence on the part of the plaintiff so clearly that no other inference can properly be drawn from it\u201d and under such circumstances the case was for the jury, as we held in Cranston v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., 3 Cir., 1940, 109 F.2d 630, 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Finally, as to defendant\u2019s contention that it is insulated from liability on the ground that the admitted negligence <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was that of the independent contractor :</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In support of that contention defendant urges that it had the consent of the- Department to sublet to the C. &amp; T. Construction Company, an experienced and competent subcontractor; that the latter was charged with the duty to barricade properly the excavation and place warning lights and signals; that the method of doing the work was entirely under the control and management of the subcontractor; that the defendant had no control of the subcontractor and nothing to do with the work except to see that the result required in the contract was obtained; that it maintained a superintendent on the job through whom the representatives of the Department could deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Extended discussion of the defendant\u2019s contention is unnecessary because the testimony disclosed that it in fact, through Sheppard, its assistant superintendent, exercised at least a supervisory control over the guarding of the excavation. Sheppard testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u201cI was there primarily, Your Honor, to see that the excavation actually had been barricaded and lit by the subcontractor. I was merely checking on him as well as on the condition itself.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Again, in response to the question \u201cwere you there at the instance of Union Paving Company for the purpose of seeing to it that the safety of the public would be protected\u201d, Sheppard answered:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">\u201cYes, to a great extent, I was one &lt;f,f several people that were there, but that was part of my duty.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">This exercise of supervisory control by the defendant makes unavailable to it the \u201cindependent contractor\u201d defense. As was stated in Silveus v. Grossman, 1932, 307 Pa. 272, 278, 161 A. 362, 364:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">\u201cNor does the principle (of independent contractor) extend to cases where the employer of the contractor has not relinquished his control over the work to be done, and still continues liable for his duty to others in respect to it. * * * The very phrase \u2018independent contractor\u2019 implies that the contractor is independent in the manner of doing the work contracted for. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-18\">Finally, independent of the fact of retention of supervisory control by the defendant over the subcontractor\u2019s lighting and barricading of the work, the defendant is liable under the Pennsylvania decisions for the subcontractor\u2019s admitted negligence. The Pennsylvania rule was stated as follows in Baier v. Glen Alden Coal Co., 1938, 131 Pa.Super. 309,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at page 319, 200 A. 190, at page 195:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-19\">\u201cWhen one employs an independent contractor to do work in a public place, which unless carefully done involves a risk of making the physical condition of the place dangerous to the public and can only be lawfully done under a license given by a public authority, and such grant or license of privilege imposes an obligation on the part of the licensee as a consideration for the grant to do certain things for the protection of the public, the individual in receipt of the benefit cannot be relieved of liability assumed by committing the performance of these duties to another. <em>In fact, in such cases liability cannot be avoided by showing that the injury resulted from the fault or negligence of the third person employed to perform these public duties.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-20\">\"In Lancaster Ave. Imp. Co. v. Rhoads, 116 Pa. 377, 9 A. 852, 2 Am.St.Rep. 608, the improvement company was reducing the grade of its turnpike road and entrust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u2022ed to others work in connection with the lowering of the grade. \u25a0 While the road was in use and as. the result of the negligence of the independent contractor plaintiff was injured. <em>The Supreme Court held that the improvement company could not hide behind its independent contractor, as it had assumed when it received its grcmt to maintaip, the road in a passable condition </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Here, as was noted at the outset of this opinion, the contract between the Department and the defendant required that two lanes of traffic should at all times be kept open for the public use and specifically provided for the maintenance of adequate barricades, warning signals, torches, etc., as well as watchmen \u201cfor the protection of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">For the reasons stated the judgment in the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-11\">. The Pennsylvania rule establishes the duty of the operator of a motor vehicle to maintain such control over it' as to enable him to bring it to .a stop within the range of his headlights.
