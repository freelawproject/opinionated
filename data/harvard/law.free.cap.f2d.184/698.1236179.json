Each corporation was authorized to improve and deal in real estate and specifically, among other things, to buy, sell and lease. Each corporation bought vacant land and improved it by building multiple dwellings, In order to get necessary priorities for building materials, and permanent financing through the Federal Housing Administration, each agreed with the Federal Housing Administration and with the War Production Board that the dwellings would be designed for renting, retained for the duration of the emergency, and rented at rates fixed by the War Production Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-24\">These restrictions were removed on October 15, 1945. The Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 284, 38 U.S. C.A. ch. 11C, popularly known as the G. I. Bill of Rights, was amended December 28, 1945, 59 Stat. 626, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 694a, so as to facilitate purchase and financing of homes by veterans. On April 24, 1946 and June 3, 1946, respectively, the Boards of Directors of petitioners authorized the officers to sell the houses for the best prices obtainable. All the houses of petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Colonial, except one that was occupied by the manager of the project and was sold in 1947 when another place for him to live was found, were sold between June 5 and August 20, 1946. All the houses of petitioner Riggs were sold between July 9 and October 21, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The Board of Tax Appeals found that these houses, at and before the times of the sales, were held by petitioners \u201cprimarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course\u201d of petitioners\u2019 \u201ctrade or business.\u201d These findings are in the language of D.C. Code (1940) \u00a7 47 \u2014 1506(a), which excludes property so held from the definition of \u201ccapital assets\u201d. Gains from sales of \u201ccapital assets\u201d are exempted from taxation as income. Accordingly the Board concluded that the sales of the houses were not sales of capital assets and that the gains were taxable as income under \u00a7 47 \u2014 1506(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">We agree that the houses, when sold, were held for sale as the Board found. Moreover, the Board\u2019s findings of fact \u201care to be undisturbed unless clearly wrong\u201d. District of Columbia v.
