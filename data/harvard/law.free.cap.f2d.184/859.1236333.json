The trial judge set aside a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor for $1,150,000.00', and entered judgment dismissing the suit on the merits. The reported opinion of the judge, D.C., 85 F.Supp. 174, sufficiently summarizes the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and the evidence. The judge\u2019s decision rested on two grounds: (1) There was no proof that plaintiff had performed the services for which he claimed compensation; (2) the agreement was against public policy. Since we agree with the judge as to the first ground, we do not consider the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Plaintiff admits that, in order to recover he had to prove that, as a result of his efforts, the United States, as a condition of the loan it made to the British government, required that government to assume the budget requirements of the King of Saudi Arabia. The record contains no admissible evidence from which it can reasonably be inferred that the United States imposed such a requirement. We think the trial judge correctly summed up the evidence as follows: \u201cIt seems to me that plaintiff\u2019s evidence proved, nothing more than that the President and also the Secretary of State were aware of the needs of the King of Saudi Arabia and were sympathetic;, that the various methods to aid the \u25a0 King suggested by the defendant and also by the President were not possible, such as help through Lend-Lease or a direct loan, an advance on oil royalties, a sale of oil to the Navy and a purchase of oil in the ground from the King. These methods of helping the King being unavailable, all we have left is a <em>hope </em>by the President that the British \u2018can take care of the King\u2019; a <em>suggestion </em>by Jesse Jones to the British representative \u2018that Britain <em>consider </em>providing King Ibn Saud with such funds as 'in its opinion were necessary to meet 'his requirements\u2019; or the showing of the President\u2019s note by Jesse Jones to the- British representatives, prior to closing the loan, with the <em>request </em>that the British Government furnish the King of Arabia with whatever funds it felt were desirable and necessary. Whether it be a hope, a request or a suggestion, it in no way approximates the claim of the plaintiff as \u25a0 set forth in Luis complaint and as urged oa the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">There is one item of evidence-which, had it been admissible, might sonceivably have been sufficient: Plaintiff testified as follows concerning a conversation he had with Jesse Jones in September,. 1941: \u201cI talked to him about that letter and asked him if he would not give me-another letter; that I understood that it' was more or less a stipulation on the part of the President that the Eritish were to-do this, and he told me that the collateral' loan had been concluded and that he had spoken to the British about it, and it was. understood that they were to take care of' the King, but he said he did not want to-give me a letter without further talking to-the President * * * \u201d. But defendant\u2019s counsel moved to strike out the statement that \u2018\u2018it was understood that they were to take care of the King,\u201d stating-\u201cthat is no proof that there ever was such an understanding.\u201d The judge agreed, admitting this testimony, but for a limited\u2019 purpose. The objection was well taken.. The testimony was hearsay so far as it-purported to report anything done or said! by the British representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
