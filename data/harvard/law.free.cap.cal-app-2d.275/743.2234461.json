J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXjp\">This is a breach of contract action against the state growing out of disputes over performance of a highway construction project. Plaintiff sues both as a subcontractor and as assignee of the general contractor. The trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint and granted the state\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiff appeals from the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">The complaint seeks damages for alleged breach of an implied warranty of correctness of the plans and specifications, for misrepresentation of project conditions and for unjustified change orders. The complaint alleges that plaintiff gave notice of his claim as required by the state \u201cand said claim was denied by defendant [state] in its entirety. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">The state\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings was aimed primarily at the last, quoted allegation. In support of its motion the state relied upon section 9(f) of the Standard Specifications of the State Division of Highways, a part, of the contract. Section 9(f) provides for the administrative settlement of disputed contract items by the state highway engineer, whose determination shall be \u201cconclusive and binding . . . except in the case of gross error. \u2019 \u2019 The state pointed out that the complaint failed to allege facts constituting gross error.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Plaintiff then countered with notice of a motion for leave to amend his complaint by adding the following allegation: \u201cThe denial of said claim by defendant\u2019s State Highway Engineer was the result of gross error insofar as said claim related to plaintiff\u2019s performance of the contract, the amount of work done thereunder, and plaintiff\u2019s just compensation therefor, in that said denial was arbitrary and contrary to the weight of the evidence. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">The trial court entered a written order granting the state\u2019s motion and denying plaintiff\u2019s, for the reason that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>plaint and the proposed amendment failed to plead \u201cgross error\u201d in the sense of fraud, constructive fraud or bad faith. Plaintiff had conceded that it could not prove fraud or bad faith on the part of the State Highway Engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Although plaintiff had not pleaded section 9(f) of the state\u2019s general specifications, it is deemed a judicially noticed part of the pleadings. (E. <em>H. Morrill Co. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 787, 794-795 [56 Cal.Rptr. 479, 423 P.2d 551] ; <em>A. Teichert &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 736, 742 [48 Cal.Rptr. 225].)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">This court considered this precise provision of the state\u2019s highway contracts in <em>A. Teichert &amp; Son, Inc. v. State of California, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We held that section 9(f) establishes a nonjudicial remedy for the settlement of disputed contract claims; that this remedy must be pursued to completion before recourse to the courts; that the provision has an impact on the scope of judicial inquiry. (238 Cal.App.2d at pp. 744-747, 753.) Although eschewing any attempt at a comprehensive delineation of the gross error concept, we called attention to decisions equating it with fraud, constructive fraud, bad faith or failure to exercise honest judgment, as well as decisions rejecting the administrative determination when it was arbitrary. (238 Cal.App.2d at pp. 754-757.)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">A similar provision in nonhighway construction contracts of the state was construed in <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>State </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 391 [58 Cal.Rptr. 393]. There the court referred to Teichert and other cases equating gross error with fraud or bad faith, then stated (250 Cal.App.2d at p. 397) : \u201cFraud in this connection has a broader connotation than is ordinarily implied. In addition to its ordinary significance, in construction contracts it includes arbitrary action and gross mistake (13 Am.Jur.2d, Building and Construction Contracts, \u00a734; Restatement of the Law, Contracts, \u00a7 303, subd. (f).) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The boundaries of the phrase \u201cgross error\u201d fix the degree of finality accorded the enginer\u2019s administrative decision and correlatively establish the scope of judicial review. To require dishonesty or bad faith as indispensable elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>stamps the decision with more finality and constricts judicial review more narrowly than the phrase permits. Both <em>Teichert </em>and <em>Macomber </em>include arbitrariness within the connotation of gross error.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The engineer\u2019s decision may entail interpretation of the contract language or specifications; application of a rule of law, or of a contract interpretation, to agreed facts; or a resolution of disputed facts. Whatever his honesty, any of these decisions may be so groundless that no impartial, <em>reasoning </em>arbiter would agree with it. An action is arbitrary when it is based on no more than the -will or desire of the decision-maker and not supported by a fair or substantial reason <em>(Bedford Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>Folb </em>(1947) 79 Cal.App.2d 363, 366 [180 P.2d 361] ; <em>State </em>ex rel. <em>Cosmopolis Consol. School Dist. </em>v. <em>Bruno </em>(1963) 61 Wn.2d 461 [378 P.2d 691, 696] ; see Jaffe, <em>Judicial Review: Question of Fact, </em>69 Harv.L.Rev. 1020, 1021 (1956)). In the context of fact-finding, arbitrariness characterizes the decision when it lacks substantial support in the evidence. <em>(McDonough </em>v. <em>Goodcell </em>(1939) 13 Cal.2d 741, 749 [91 P.2d 1035, 123 A.L.R. 1205] ; <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Chambers </em>(1919) 181 Cal. 589, 595 [185 P. 855, 8 A.L.R. 418] ; <em>Hollon </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1967) 257 Cal.App.2d 468, 478 [64 Cal.Rptr. 808].) Fraud or bad faith, as morally reprehensible qualities, are not necessary attributes of arbitrariness, hence are not indispensable ingredients of gross error.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Wunderlich </em>(1951) 342 U.S. 98, 99 [96 L.Ed. 113, 115, 72 S.Ct. 154], involved a federal public works contract which gave finality to the engineer\u2019s decision without any express exceptions for fraud or gross error. The court read into the contract an exception for fraud in the sense of an intention to cheat, but refused to reexamine the engineer\u2019s decision for arbitrariness. A few years later Congress supplanted the Supreme Court\u2019s decision bv adoption of the Wunderlich Act (68 Stat. 81 (1954) 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321), giving finality to the administrative decision \u2018 \u2018 unless the same is fraudulent [sic] or capricious or arbitrary or so grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith, or is not supported by substantial evidence. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The California courts have not had occasion to consider the Wunderlich Act\u2019s criteria of finality as judicially declared doctrine. Although the act applies only to federal contracts, Professor Arthur Corbin has suggested: \u201c. . . the rule that it lays down should be applied in all contract cases alike as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>rule of the common law, including equity. The court should not overlook their powers as successors of the Court of Chancery.\u201d (3A Corbin on Contracts (1960) \u00a7 652, p. 129.) The federal statutory criteria, are consistent with the <em>Teichert </em>and <em>Macomber </em>decisions, which recognize arbitrariness as a variety of gross error, and with other California decisions, <em>supra, </em>recognizing lack of substantial evidentiary support as one kind of arbitrariness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The substantial evidence rule, moreover, has been highly developed and refined as a standard .of appellate review of trial court findings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and of judicial review of the findings of administrative agencies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus absorbing it as one kind of gross error which permits review of the administrative settlement of public contract disputes is eminently practical.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Although the trial court erred in requiring allegations of fraud or bad faith, there is still a question as to the adequacy of plaintiff\u2019s proposed amendments.  Where a condition precedent to contractual recovery is an event, as distinguished from an act to be performed by the plaintiff, the complaint must specifically allege the event. <em>(Byrne </em>v. <em>Harvey </em>(1962) 211 Cal.App.2d 92, 113 [27 Cal.Rptr. 110], quoting Witkin, Cal. Procedure (1954) Pleading, \u00a7 261, p. 1237.)  Where a fact is pleaded in general or conclusionary terms, followed by an inconsistent specific allegation, the latter controls. <em>(Stowe </em>v. <em>Fritzie Hotels, Inc. </em>(1955) 44 Cal. 2d 416, 422 [282 P.2d 890]).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s proposed amendment declared that the State Highway Engineer\u2019s denial of the claims \u201cwas the result of gross error .... in that said denial was arbitrary and contrary to the weight of the evidence.\u201d Gross error and arbitrariness fall into the class of allegations which combine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>factual connotations and legal implications. They are relatively large and vague terms, quite inadequate to inform the opposite party of the actual deficiency which may be urged at the trial.  Thus, for pleading purposes, gross error and arbitrariness should be classed as legal conclusions, inadequate to support the pleadings unless accompanied by more specific averments. (1 Chadboum, Grossman, &amp; Van Alstyne, California Pleading, \u00a7\u00a7 866, 867.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s conclusionary allegations of gross error and arbitrariness were not supported, indeed were contradicted, by his specific averment of an engineer\u2019s decision contrary to the weight of the evidence. Judicial review which extends to reweighing the evidence denotes the reviewing tribunal\u2019s power to try the entire controversy de novo, to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence. <em>(Nardoni </em>v. <em>McConnell </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 500, 503 [310 P.2d 644] ; <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 301, 308, 316 [196 P.2d 20].) The parties had contracted to lay their disputes before an arbiter whose very position evidenced professional skill, as well as long experience and practical familiarity with highway construction problems. Although employed by one of the contracting parties, he was bound to exercise impartial judgment. <em>(Macomber </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d at p. <em>398 ; A. Teichert &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>238 Cal.App.2d at p. 757.) The parties chose a settlement at his hands in preference to adjudication by a court, reserving the latter\u2019s availability for the relatively narrow contingency of gross error. Independent, de novo consideration by the court would deprive the administrative settlement of the degree of finality accorded it by the contracting parties. <em>(Cope </em>v. <em>Beaumont </em>(3d Cir. 1910), 181 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>756, 758-759 [104 C.C.A. 292] ; <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(3d Cir. 1906) 144 F. 942, 947 [75 C.C.A. 582, 6 L.R.A. N.S. 774] ; <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>East Side Logging Co. </em>(1929) 130 Ore. 341 [278 P. 957, 961] ; <em>City of San Antonio </em>v. <em>McKenzie Constr. Co. </em>(1941) 136 Tex. 315 [150 S.W.2d 989, 996] ; see also, <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Goodcell, supra, </em>13 Cal.2d at p. 749.) Since plaintiff\u2019s specific assertion of a decision contrary to the weight of the evidence was inconsistent with his conclusionary allegations of gross error and arbitrariness, the proposed amendment failed to cure the deficiency in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">An appeal from a judgment on the pleadings is reviewed as though it were a judgment of dismissal after a general demurrer had been sustained. <em>(Gill </em>v. <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 273, 275 [239 P.2d 630].) The order granting a defense judgment on the pleadings was the equivalent of one sustaining a general demurrer without leave to amend. <em>(Budrow </em>v. <em>Wheatcraft </em>(1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 517, 522 [252 P.2d 637].) If there was any reasonable possibility that plaintiff might state a good cause of action, he should have been given an opportunity to amend. <em>(Youngman </em>v. <em>Nevada Irr. Dist. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245 [74 Cal.Rptr. 398, 449 P.2d 462] <em>; Hardy </em>v. <em>Admiral Oil Co. </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 836, 841-842 [16 Cal.Rptr. 894, 366 P.2d 310].) The deficiency in plaintiff\u2019s proposed amendment was traceable to an erroneously selected theory of law and did not foreclose the conceivable availability of adequate facts. Accordingly, the court erred in entering judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Judgment reversed with directions to permit plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Regan, J., and Janes, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">In <em>E. H. Morrill Co. </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at page 792, the Supreme Court disapproved \u201cany implications\u201d in the <em>Teichert </em>decision which narrowed the effect of language in the state\u2019s contract disclaiming responsibility for physical data compiled for the information of bidders. We find no such \u201cimplications\u201d in <em>Teichert. </em>Nevertheless, the Supreme Court\u2019s disapproval had no connection with those phases of the <em>Teichert </em>opinion which are pertinent here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The variety of verbal signals used to open the gate to judicial review and the comparative unreliability of these signals is illustrated by <em>Terminal Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Bergen County etc. Authority </em>(1955) 18 N.J. 294 [113 A.2d 787, 799].) There the court reached a result parallel to ours, but by viewing the engineer\u2019s arbitrary action and gross mistake as varieties of fraud.

Most of the decisions assume that the award of damages by the jury necessarily enmeshes the jury in the business of finding that the administrator\u2019s decision is arbitrary or, what is the same thing, lacks substantial evidence. <em>(Macomber </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>250 Cal.App.2d at pp. 398-399 ; <em>Terminal Constr.
