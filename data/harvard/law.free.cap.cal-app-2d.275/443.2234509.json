We hold that, because the property settlement agreement was integrated in character as previously adjudicated in this action, the former husband\u2019s earnings are exempt from execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The pertinent facts and the procedural sequence below, as set forth in an agreed statement on appeal and exhibits thereto (rule 6, Cal. Rules of Court) are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The parties were married in 1943. They separated in August 1957, at which time they had two minor children. On October 2, 1957, they executed a \u201cProperty Settlement and Separation Agreement.\u201d The agreement\u2019s preamble recited among other things that they desired to. live separate and apart, and that \u2018 \u2018 They desire to provide herein for the settlement of their rights with respect' to property, and <em>as an integral part of said property settlement, </em>to provide for the support of the wife [appellant] and for the support of . . . [the] . . . children.\u201d The agreement provided for an elaborate division of the parties\u2019 property between them, with assumption of various debts by each, and that appellant would have custody of the children. Respondent agreed to pay specified monthly sums to appellant for the support of the children, and a further sum each month for her own \u201csupport and maintenance.\u201d The latter sum was subject to formulary computation from a \u201cbase support payment\u201d of $160 per month. The agreement provided that the \u201csupport payments\u201d to appellant \u201cshall terminate upon the death of the husband or upon the death or remarriage of the wife. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Appellant thereafter commenced this action. An interlocutory decree of divorce, entered in 1958, incorporated the 1957 agreement by reference and ordered its performance by the parties. A final decree of divorce was entered in 1960, incorporating the provisions of the interlocutory decree by reference. In 1963, respondent moved the trial court for an order modifying both decrees by terminating the monthly payments to appellant and reducing the payments for child support. On April 22, 1963, after a hearing, the trial court entered an order in which it found among other things \u201c. . . [t]hat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Property Settlement and Separation Agreement executed by the parties on October 2. 1957, and incorporated in the Interlocutory Judgment of Divorce ... is an integrated agreement and as such not modifiable by the Court, except as to child support for the two minor children of the parties. &gt; J</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Neither party appealed from the order of April 22, 1963. In late 1965, respondent moved the trial court \u201cfor an order entering satisfaction of the judgment 1 . . or in the alternative, fixing and determining the amount\u201d due from him to appellant \u201cunder the integrated Property Settlement Agreement incorporated in the divorce decree.\u201d According to a memorandum of his contentions filed in support of this motion, he claimed certain credits against the payments ostensibly due appellant under the agreement. At this point, it was shown that appellant had remarried in 1965. At a hearing on his motion, the parties stipulated that the effect of the: remarriage was to terminate all appellant\u2019s rights to support under the property settlement agreement; the subject in dispute, therefore, was the extent of respondent\u2019s arrearages as accrued prior to the remarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 differences in this regard at several hearings, the trial court entered an order on February 20, 1967, fixing respondent\u2019s accrued obligation to appellant on the basis of precise figures calculated by the court after crediting each party with various offsets. This order referred throughout to respondent\u2019s obligation to pay \u201calimony.\u201d Respondent made a \u201cmotion for new trial\u201d (assertedly pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 657) in which he challenged the court\u2019s \u201calimony\u201d nomenclature upon the ground that the order of April 22, 1963, had finally and conclusively determined that the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement was \u201cintegrated\u201d and nonmodifiable as to the monthly payments due appellant. His motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">No appeal was taken from the order of February 20, 1967. Seeking to collect the arrearages due her as fixed by the trial court therein, appellant .caused a writ of execution to issue. She had respondent\u2019s earnings garnished on March 29, 1967. Respondent filed a. claim of exemption of the full amount garnished; pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 690.26 and 690.11, he alleged that the entire amount was necessary for the support of his \u201cwife, daughter and son.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAqY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Appellant caused his earnings to be garnished on four further occasions, at successive weekly intervals. Each time, and upon the same ground, respondent claimed exemption of the full amount garnished. On May 16, 1967, after a hearing, the trial court entered a \u201cjudgment of exemption\u201d which granted respondent\u2019s claim of exemption in' full as to the earnings garnished on March 29. On July 27, 1967, the court entered a similar judgment granting his claims of exemption in full as to the other four garnishments. The appeal is from both judgements<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We affirm the judgments. As pertinent here, Code of Civil Procedure section 690.11 provides that one-half of a judgment debtor\u2019s earnings are exempt from execution upon the judgment, \u2022 and that all thereof are exempt if they meet the standards prescribed therein and if the debtor claims the full exemption pursuant to section 690.26.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   As appellant contends, however, it is settled that section 690.11 will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>permit exemption, of a judgment debtor\u2019s earnings from execution upon a judgment for alimony: i.e., a judgment for alimony is an exception to the statutory exemption of earnings from execution thereupon. <em>(Bruton </em>v. <em>Tearle </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 48, 57-58 [59 P.2d 953, 106 A.L.R. 580] ; <em>McIntosh </em>v. <em>McIntosh </em>(1962) 209 Cal.App.2d 374, 375 [26 Cal.Rptr. 28] ; <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Henry </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 707, 709-711 [6 Cal.Rptr. 418] and authorities cited. See <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>Weinberg </em>(1967 ) 67 Cal.2d 557, 562-563 [63 Cal.Rptr. 13, 432 P.2d 709] ; <em>Yager </em>v. <em>Yager </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 213, 218-221 [60 P.2d 422, 106 A.L.R. 664] ; 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (1954) Enforcement of Judgment, \u00a7 10, pp. 1974-1975.) Accordingly, whether respondent\u2019s earnings are exempt from execution depends upon whether the delinquent support payments may properly be termed \u201calimony\u201d; and this, in turn, depends upon the character of the 1957 property settlement agreement incorporated in the divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">When the parties to a divorce action have made the provision for the wife\u2019s support and maintenance \u201can integral part\u201d of their property settlement (as was done here: see the agreement\u2019s prefatory sentence, quoted <em>supra), </em>the support payments have a dual character. They have \u201cthe indicia of alimony\u201d to the extent that they are designed to discharge the obligation of support and maintenance, but to the extent that they \u201cconstitute an inseparable part of the consideration for the property settlement, they are not alimony\u201d and cannot be modified. <em>(Dexter </em>v. <em>Dexter </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 36, 41 [265 P.2d 873] ; <em>DiMarco </em>v. <em>DiMarco </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 387, 392 [33 Cal.Rptr. 610, 385 P.2d 2] ; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 93, 100 [50 Cal.Rptr. 408] ; <em>Hecht </em>v. <em>Hecht </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 1, 6 [67 Cal.Rptr. 293].)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In its order of April 22, 1963, the trial court determined that the 1957 property settlement agreement was \u201can integrated agreement and as such not modifiable by the Court\u201d as to the support payments due appellant. This necessarily amounted to a determination that the payments constituted \u2018 an inseparable part of the consideration for the property settlement,\u201d and that they were \u201cnot alimony\u201d under the authorities just cited. (See also <em>Plumer </em>v. <em>Plumer </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 820, 824-825 [313 P.2d 549].) The 1963 order having become final in due course, the. issue was thereafter res judicata between the parties. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1908, 1911 ; <em>Bernhard </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1942). 19 Cal.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>807, 813 [122 P.2d 892] ; <em>Rynsburger </em>v. <em>Dairymen\u2019s Fertilizer Coop., Inc. </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 269, 275 [72 Cal.Rptr. 102], See 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45 [pp, 1926-1927], 51-52 [pp. 1936-1937], 62-65 [pp. 1947-1954].)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We are not persuaded to the contrary by appellant\u2019s arguments based upon <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>241 Cal.App.2d 93, and <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 424 [68 Cal.Rptr. 59], The <em>Roberts </em>decisions were made on successive appeals in the same divorce action. In the first one the appellate court held that a 1960 order by the trial court, refusing to modify monthly payments due the wife under a divorce decree bnt not determining that the underlying property settlement agreement was integrated, could not\u2014after it had become final\u2014be augmented by a subsequent order providing that the agreement was integrated and that the payments were not alimony. <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>241 Cal.App.2d 93, at pp. 96-97, 100-101 ; see <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d 424 at p. 426 [summarizing the first decision].)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The second <em>Roberts </em>court, called upon to decide the still-open question of the character of the same agreement, interpreted it as providing for support and maintenance in the literal sense and not \u201cintegrated,\u201d and, accordingly, held that the husband\u2019s obligation to make the payments had not been extinguished by his discharge in bankruptcy. <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d 424 at pp. 427-429.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The 1960 order in the first <em>Roberts </em>case denied modification of the payments but did not establish that the underlying property settlement agreement was integrated. So long as the latter question remained unresolved, the order could not be \u201caccorded res judicata effect\u201d as to issues which depended upon the answer; the second <em>Roberts </em>decision expressly so held. <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>261 Cal.App,2d 424 at p. 428.) In the present case, the 1963 order denying modification did not leave the question unresolved. It expressly determined that the 1957 agreement was integrated in character, and that the divorce decree was not modifiable for that reason. Since the <em>Roberts </em>action is wholly distinguishable on that basis, the 1963 order herein became res judicata on the question of the agreement\u2019s integrated character and on all issues dependent thereupon.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">With one exception, appellant\u2019s other arguments speak to her contention that the 1957 property settlement agreement was <em>not </em>integrated in character. Since this issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>became res judicata against her when the 1963 order became final, we do not examine the other arguments. The exception is a res judicata point of her own: she argues that the February 20, 1967, order established that the monthly payments were alimony because it refers to them as such, and that their character as alimony was res judicata in her favor when she attempted to levy execution after the 1967 order had become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The point fails under res judicata principles. In the proceeding which produced the 1967 order, the issue before the trial court was how much respondent owed, not whether he owed alimony or something else. Consequently, the court\u2019s determination of the amount owed did not adjudicate the character of the obligation, and the order\u2019s reference to the latter as \u201calimony\u201d did not reflect otherwise. (See <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Fox </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 49, 50-51 [265 P.2d 881].) The question whether the monthly payments were alimony came before the trial court when respondent sought exemption of his earnings from appellant\u2019s levy of execution. At that point, the parties were litigating an issue which had been adjudicated in 1963, not in February 1967. The principles of res judicata therefore directed the trial court\u2019s action on the basis of the_1963 order only. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1908 [a prior judgment-is conclusive between the parties or their successors \u201clitigating the same thing\u201d]; <em>ibid., </em>\u00a7 1911 ; <em>Bernhard </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>19 Cal.2d 807 at p, 813 <em>; Rynsburger </em>v. <em>Dairymen\u2019s Fertilizer Coop., Inc., </em>266 Cal.App.2d 269 at p. 275 [72 Cal.Rptr. 102].)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Since the trial court\u2019s 1963 order determined that the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement was integrated, and thereafter became final, it must be \u201caccorded res judicata, effect\u201d (cf. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d 424 at p. 428) in establishing that the monthly support payments \u201c. . . constitute an inseparable part of the consideration for the property settlement ...\u201d and therefore are not alimony. <em>(Hecht </em>v. <em>Hecht, supra, </em>259 Cal.App.2d 1 at p. 6, and authorities there cited.) This being so, they are not within the \u201calimony exception\u201d to the statutory exemption of respondent\u2019s earnings from execution levied to collect them <em>(Bruton </em>v. <em>Tearle, supra, </em>7 Cal.2d 48 at pp. 57-58 ; <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Henry, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.2d 707 at pp. 709-711, and authorities cited), and his earnings are exempt under the clear mandate of Code of Civil Procedure sections 690 and 690.11. (See fn. 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>ante. </em>See also 2 California Family Lawyer (Cont. Ed. Bar 1963) \u00a7 26.20, pp. 1184-1185.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In <em>Ogle </em>v. <em>Heim </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 7 [69 Cal.Rptr. 579, 442 P.2d 659], the Supreme Court affirmed an order which, in effect and pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 690.23, exempted a father\u2019s public-employment retirement benefits from execution levied to enforce his obligation to pay child support under a judgment of divorce. The court, distinguishing the exemption applicable to earnings under section 690.11, used this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">\u201cThe only exemption under which dependents have been accorded special treatment [in resisting claims of exemption from execution] is section 690.11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Section 690.11 renders one-half of a debtor\u2019s wages earned within the prior 30 days exempt, and allows total exemption \u2018if necessary for the <em>use of the debtor\u2019s family.\u2019 </em>(Italics added.) Claims of dependents are not barred by the exemption of section 690.11. <em>(Bruton </em>v. <em>Tearle, </em>7 Cal.2d 48, 53 . . . ; <em>McIntosh </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>209 Cal.App.2d 374 .. . ; <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>182 Cal.App.2d 707 . . . ; <em>Rankins </em>v. <em>Rankins, </em>52 Cal.App.2d 231. . . . ) The language of section 690.11 invited the creation of an exception by expressly referencing the needs of the debtor\u2019s family as a criterion for exemption. By contrast, the pension exemption statutes contain no similar criterion and refute any such exception. The peculiar development of the wage exemption is therefore inapposite, despite certain parallels between wages and pensions. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Ogle </em>v. <em>Heim, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 7 at p. 11.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">This language does not support appellant\u2019s contention that the \u201cearnings exemption\u201d (or \u201cwage exemption\u201d) should be unavailable to respondent. The decisions cited by the Supreme Court <em>(Bruton, McIntosh, Henry </em>and Bankins) involved the enforcement of judgments for alimony or for child support, or both. Thus, the quoted passage, referring to \u201cdependents\u201d whose claims for support are not subject to the earnings exemption, appears to define \u201cdependents\u201d as former wives receiving alimony or as the judgment debtor\u2019s children. The definition is not explicit, but we infer it because it makes sense. Children are obviously their father\u2019s \u201cdependents\u201d; a wife receiving alimony is her former husband\u2019s \u201cdependent\u201d as well, because alimony arises from his obligations to support her as imposed by the marital relationship. <em>(Hecht </em>v. <em>Hecht, supra, </em>259 Cal.App.2d 1 at p. 6.) In the present case, appellant is not receiving alimony and no child-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>support payments are involved. Appellant, therefore, cannot resist respondent\u2019s claim of exemption as his \u201cdependent\u201d within the <em>Ogle </em>court\u2019s meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The <em>Ogle </em>decision, speaking generally to statutory exemptions from execution, also reminds ,us that \u201c \u2018The general rule is that a court is not authorized in the construction of a statute, to create exceptions not specifically made. If the statute announces a general rule and makes no exception thereto, the courts can make none.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ogle </em>v. <em>Heim, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 7 at p. 9.) Although the rule disallowing the statutory earnings exemption (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 690.11) from execution upon alimony judgments has already been established by judicial interpretation <em>(Rankins </em>v. <em>Rankins </em>(1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 231, 234 [126 P.2d 125]), the general rule dissuades us from extending the alimony exception in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The purported appeal noticed on July 24, 1967, is dismissed. The judgments of exemption entered on May 16, 1967, and July 27,1967, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Devine, P. J., and Christian, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Respondent thereby established, for the first time shown in the record on appeal, that he had remarried. In his brief, he alleges that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u201cdaughter\u201d was one of the parties\u2019 two children and that the \u201cson\u201d was a child of his remarriage. The record does not show these facts, but it is undisputed that he had remarried, and had a second family, when he claimed that his earnings were exempt from execution upon the judgment of divorce in this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\">By separate notice of appeal filed on July 24, 1967, appellant also purportedly appealed from the trial court\u2019s written \u201cDecision On Claim Of Exemption,\u201d a memorandum which preceded the second judgment of exemption. The \u201cdecision\u201d was non-appealable as such, and its provisions became wholly merged in the second judgment (which we consider on the appeal therefrom). For the record, we therefore dismiss the purported appeal noticed on July 24, 1967.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b473-10\">The relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure sections here cited must be read in the context established by section 690 thereof.
