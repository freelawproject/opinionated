The trial court sustained the defendants \u2019 general demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend and plaintiff appeals from the subsequent judgment, contending:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The trial court erred in sustaining defendants\u2019 demurrer to the complaint on the grounds that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since the language' of the policy covers the injury to, and subsequent amputation of a portion of, plaintiff\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">On October 22, 1965, plaintiff, while in the course of his employment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Tulare Comity, suffered a crushing and mangling injury to his left hand that required emergency surgical care and treatment. The surgery resulted in the amputation of all of his left thumb at the wrist joint, all of his index finger, including a portion of the long or metacarpal bone in his hand, all of his middle finger and two and one-half bones of his ring finger, and two bones of his little finger. As a result of the amputation, plaintiff lost or had removed some 15 of the 27 bones in his left hand. The portion of the left hand remaining is useless and impairs his ability to utilize a prosthetic device.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">At the time of the accident, plaintiff was covered by a \u201cLloyd\u2019s Accident Policy.\u201d Following the injury to plaintiff\u2019s hand, the defendant insurer, pursuant to the policy, paid total temporary disability payments for the period beginning on the date of injury to July 25, 1966, for a total of $7,800. However, the defendants refused to pay plaintiff the sum of $40,000 under the 11 Loss of A Limb\u201d coverage and plaintiff seeks recovery under that benefit provision, alleging a breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">The insuring agreement provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">\u201cWe the Underwriters hereby agree with the Assured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>to the extent and in the manner hereinafter provided, that if anywhere in the World at any time during the period of this Policy he shall sustain any bodily injury caused by an accident, which shall solely and independently of any other cause within twelve calendar months from the date of the accident causing such injury occasion his death or disablement as hereinafter defined, we will pay to the Assured, or to the Assured\u2019s Executors or Administrators, according to the Schedule of Benefits overleaf within Seven Days after the total claim shall be substantiated under this Policy . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Under the \u2018 \u2018 Schedule op Benefits, \u2019 \u2019 the 'following is included :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">\u201c3. Total loss of one limb or total</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">loss of sight of one eye. $40,000 \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">On the first page of the policy, under the heading \u201cDefinitions,\u201d \u201closs of a limb\u201d is defined as meaning \u201closs by physical separation of a hand at or above the wrist or of a foot at or above the ankle. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Plaintiff, in his complaint, also alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">\u201cThat at the time of renewing said policy, plaintiff had a good left hand and he desired to insure against the loss of the use of that left hand. That he was not advised by defendants, or any of them, nor did he know or understand to be that the said insurers now claimed intent and meaning of the said policy coverage was such that, if in the course of a necessary amputation of his left hand, the surgeon should leave some useless portion of his hand to be a source of annoyance and inconvenience to him and that thereby his policy would be practically <em>worthless; </em>that instead of such meaning or intent, he sought and intended, at said time or renewal, to insure against the possible loss- of his hand as a useful member of his body. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention on appeal is that the injury and subsequent amputation of a portion of his left hand constitute \u201closs of a limb\u201d within the meaning of the policy. Thus, defendants\u2019 refusal to pay the benefit of $40,000 under the loss of a limb coverage constitutes a breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">The rules governing the interpretation of insurance contracts are set forth in <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hollender </em>(1951) 38 Cal.2d 73, 81 [237 P.2d 510] :  \u201cIn construing life insurance policies as in the construction of other contracts, the entire contract is to be construed together for the purpose of giving force and effect to each clause. [Citations.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>While it is settled law that in ease of doubt the provisions of the insurance contract will be construed most strongly against the insurer [citations], the rule is equally well established that where the terms of the policy are plain and explicit, the court will indulge in no forced construction so as to cast a liability upon the insurance company which it has not assumed [citations],  In the interpretation of any written instrument, the primary object is to ascertain and carry out the intention of the parties. [Citations.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">And in <em>O\u2019Doan </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 71, 77 [52 Cal.Rptr. 184], this court stated: \u201cPertinent rules of interpretation are simple enough. If the policy language is clear, the contract must be given effect as executed by the parties. [Citation.] If the language is ambiguous, any reasonable doubt will be resolved against the insurance carrier. [Citation.] The rule of construction against the insurer may not be invoked when the policy is clear. [Citations.] A policy provision is ambiguous only when, on its face, it is capable of two different constructions, both of which are reasonable. [Citations.] No term of a policy is ambiguous if its meaning can be ascertained by fair inference from the remaining terms. [Citations.]\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We reverse the judgment of the trial court and in so doing hold that as plaintiff\u2019s injury resulted in amputation of all usable portions of his left hand commencing at the wrist joint he suffered a total loss of limb by physical separation of the limb1 at the wrist joint.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Analogous situations have arisen in other states. Plaintiff relies heavily on the case of <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(1915) 75 Ore. 47 [146 P. 151, 47 Ann.Cas. 1917B, 1005, 47 L.R.A. 1915D, 264]. In <em>Moore, </em>the policy provided for a benefit in the event of the \u201c \u2018loss of hand\u2019 by removal at or above the wrist . . . . \u201d There the insured lost all of the bones of the hand at the wrist except the metacarpal bone of the thumb. The defendant insurer contended that the phraseology meant that the entire hand must be physically separated from the body at or above the wrist. The court rejected this argument and held that plaintiff\u2019s injury did indeed fall within the policy provisions. After reciting well-known rules of construction of insurance policies the Oregon court in <em>Moore, supra, </em>stated (at p. 153) : \u201cNow, in view of these salutary maxims of the jurists, let us consider the relations of the parties and the object which plaintiff had in view when he took out this policy. He had a good hand against the losing the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>which he desired to insure. If he had been told the intent and meaning of the policy was such that if in case of a necessary amputation the surgeon should leave some useless shred of his hand to be a source of annoyance and inconvenience, and thereby his policy would be practically worthless, does any sane person believe for a moment he would have taken out the policy? The substance of what he sought was insurance against the possible loss of his hand as a useful member of his body. Substantially he has lost his hand by removal at the wrist. In view of all the. decisions, it is apparent that the words \u2018by removal at or above the wrist\u2019 were introduced as a safeguard against possible fraud and to prevent a recovery in cases where there had been no substantial removal of the injured member; but here the hand, as a hand, is gone. Practically the plaintiff has no hand. What occasioned this practical loss of his hand ? The answer must be the gunshot wound, and the consequent removal at the wrist of all that made the member useful. An insurer should not be allowed by the use of obscure phrases and exceptions to defeat the very purpose for which the policy was procured. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The court in <em>Moore </em>also distinguished cases from other jurisdictions and concluded (at p. 152) : \u201cHow different from the case at bar, where substantially nothing remains of plaintiff \u2019s hand but a worse than, useless fragment! \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The phrase \u201cat or above the wrist\u201d is ambiguous and subject to judicial interpretation. In particular, the word \u201cat\u201d has an indefinite meaning; its primary sense is nearness or proximity. (See <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Sayle </em>(1950) 208 Miss. 559 [45 So.2d 138, 140] ; <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Nuttman </em>(1865) 27 Cal. 342, 345 ; see also definition in Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (2d ed. 1959), p. 172.) Plaintiff contends that the point of severance is denoted only to prevent false and fraudulent claims, and that to require a precise and technical severance at a particular point would be a frustration of the intent and pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>pose for which such a policy was purchased (i.e., to protect the insured against the possibility of the loss of use of one of his hands).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Defendants, on the other hand, maintain that there is no ambiguity in the contract of insurance and contends that the cases cited by plaintiff are distinguishable. Defendants first note that the cases cited by plaintiff involve policies that insure against loss of a hand or foot whereas defendants\u2019 policy insures against loss of a limb.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It then states that there is a category of cases that insure against loss of a hand or foot (or fingers) and define loss as meaning severance or separation of the insured member at a designated place, usually at or above the wrist or ankle. Defendants then contend that in the great majority of these cases the policies have been applied as written.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendants attempt to distinguish <em>Moore </em>(and other allied cases) since <em>Moore </em>involved a provision insuring against the loss of hand or foot, not a provision insuring against \u201closs of a limb.\u201d Defendants contend that the language of -the policy which insures against the risk of \u201closs of a limb,\u201d plainly means-that an insured who has lost a portion of one of his upper limbs, amounting to at least the hand and such portion of the wrist as to render the wrist useless as a joint, will be deemed to have lost an upper limb for the purpose of insurance coverage. It concludes that the subjective intent of the insured cannot overcome the plain language of the policy. (See <em>Fullerton </em>v. <em>Houston Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 743, 747 [44 Cal.Rptr. 711].)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Although no precise California ease on the point has been found, we note initially that in other states this type of insurance coverage has proved troublesome and has resulted in much litigation. The insurers have employed differing phraseology apparently in an attempt to restrict their liability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>distinct factual happenings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To attempt to reconcile the various phraseologies used, and the resultant judicial results, would involve us in a semantic jungle, which we do not care to explore. Bather, we think that there is an overriding factor here, and that is the intent of the insured to provide for financial security in the event of the loss of use of a hand or foot, thus precluding him from pursuing his livelihood.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">This court in <em>O\u2019Doan </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.2d at page 77, stated: \u201cThe initial objective, a decision whether the provision is clear or ambiguous, is frequently more elusive than the resolution of ambiguities. \u2019 \u2019 Nevertheless, in view of the intent behind this sort of coverage (see <em>Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London </em>v. <em>Hunefeld </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 31, 39 [40 Cal.Rptr. 659]), and being persuaded that the rationale of <em>Moore </em>is sound, we find that an ambiguity does exist. In other words, the subject provision could mean, strictly, severance of the entire hand at the joint of the wrist <em>or </em>where amputation commences at the wrist joint, enough loss of the hand so as to render it useless. (See <em>King </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>(1936) 20 Tenn.App. 246 [97 S.W.2d 651<em>] </em>cf., <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Locomotive Engineers\u2019 Mut. Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Assn. </em>(1899) 122 Mich. 548 [81 N.W. 326, 328, 80 Am.St.Rep. 598, 48 L.R.A. 86].)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Since we find that there is an ambiguity in the provision, capable of two distinct meanings, the provision must be construed strictly against the insurer in accordance with well-settled rules. <em>(Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London </em>v. <em>Hunefeld, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.2d at pp. 38-39.) We therefore hold that undpr the insurance policy in question, the insurer is liable for the injury here incurred to plaintiff\u2019s hand under the terms of the policy's coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Friedman, Acting P.
