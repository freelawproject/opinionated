He presents three main contentions for reversal: that there was insufficient evidence to justify the jury\u2019s verdict, that it is inherently improbable that he committed the burglary, and that during the trial errors of law occurred which resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The facts upon which this appeal is predicated are essentially these: On July 7, 1968, at approximately 10:25 p.m., the police dispatcher of the City of Fresno received a report that a burglary was in progress in a medical building located in the vicinity of North Fresno Street. A patrol car was dispatched immediately, and a few minutes later several policemen arrived at the scene. They discovered that a window in Dr. Robert Lusk\u2019s office had been smashed, and a ball peen hammer was found lying close by in the shrubbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">A short time later one of the officers who was checking outside heard someone crashing through the bushes at the rear of the building. Then he saw two men running from the back of the building. The officer ordered the men to halt, and when they failed to heed his command gave pursuit. One of the subjects, appellant, slipped and <em>fell; </em>the second subject stopped to help appellant get up and then took off running. However, appellant slipped again and was apprehended. The other subject eluded arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">An examination of the doctor\u2019s office disclosed that the rear door to the office was unlocked. Microfilm and pills were scattered about the floor in the interior of the office, and a drug cabinet was found open. A pair of gloves and a smoked cigarette were also found on the floor. Later, Dr. Lusk stated that he locked the door when he left earlier during the day and that the gloves and smoked cigarette were unfamiliar.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">At the trial appellant denied burglarizing Dr. Lusk\u2019s office. He testified that he was in the vicinity of the medical building to visit a woman named Evelyn Blevins who lived in a nearby apartment, and as he walked down the driveway of the medical' complex, he saw a man suddenly run from one of the offices and heard someone shout, \u201cThere he goes.\u201d He said that he also ran but fell when he reached the street and that the other man did not stop to assist him when he slipped but, rather, paused for a car or for some other reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Turning first to the alleged errors, the record indicates that after appellant admitted that he had been convicted of a felony involving possession of narcotics in 1962, the prosecutor forced appellant to also admit that the narcotics were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>demerol, morphine sulfate tablets and opium and belladonna suppositories. Then the following transpired;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u201cMr. Pitts: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">\u201cIsn\u2019t it a fact, Mr. Martin, at that time in 1962 you were addicted to the use of narcotic drugs ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\u201cA. No, sir, that is not a fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">\u201cQ. Did you have possession of these drugs, because you were selling them, you were a peddler ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">\u201cA. No, sir, I was using these drugs, but I wasn\u2019t addicted to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-11\">\u201cQ. Now, isn\u2019t it a fact that you obtained possession of these drugs that you were found with on February 7,1962, by burglarizing the Village Drug Company on the night of February 5 ? A. No, that\u2019s definitely not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-12\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it a fact these bottles, these drugs that were found in your possession matched the serial numbers of the serial numbers of the drugs in the Village Drug Company ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-13\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know where they came from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-14\">\u2018\u2018Q. Isn\u2019t it a fact you had a cut on your leg that had been recently sutured when, you were arrested on February 7, 1962?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-15\">\u2018 \u2018 Mr. Kazato : Again, your Honor, the fact if the defendant had possession of these bottles doesn\u2019t mean he burglarized this Village Drug Store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-16\">\u201cThe Court: \u201cWell, Counsel, I\u2019ll disallow this line until you have connected the cross-examination on the problem at hand, the case that happened. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-17\">Thus; while appellant concedes that it was proper for the prosecutor to ask him whether he had been convicted of a felony and, if so, the nature of the felony, he argues that the prosecutor was not entitled to ask for the details. Appellant also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s questions concerning the alleged burglary were irrelevant and highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-18\">We conclude that it was proper for the prosecutor to show that appellant\u2019s 1962 narcotics conviction involved possession of demerol, morphine sulfate tablets, opium and belladonna. Appellant was accused of burglarizing a doctor\u2019s office, and the fact that he was previously convicted of possession of dangerous drugs commonly found in a doctor\u2019s office was relevant to prove that he was familiar with, and possibly even addicted to, the use of such drugs. This in turn was relevant to establish appellant\u2019s motive for breaking into Dr. Lusk\u2019s office, and hence to prove his intent to steal, an essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>tial element to the crime for which he was charged in. the information. And, since the court thoroughly and accurately-instructed the jury on the limited purpose for which the jury could consider appellant\u2019s narcotics conviction, no error was committed in this respect.  It is firmly settled that evidence of other \"crimes to prove a relevant or material fact, other than that the accused is predisposed to commit crime, is admissible <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>60 Cal.2d 223 [32 Cal.Rptr. 424, 384 P.2d 16] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Peete, </em>28 Cal.2d 306 [169 P.2d 924]).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Appellant\u2019s secondary contention that the trial judge also erred when he allowed the prosecutor to question him about the burglary is also without substantial merit. The prosecutor was obviously attempting to show that the drugs found in appellant\u2019s possession in 1962 were stolen during a burglary committed under circumstances -essentially similar to the circumstances surrounding the burglary for which appellant stood charged, and hence to prove a \u201ccommon plan, scheme, system or design.\u201d However, after appellant denied the burglary the trial judge disallowed any further questions in this respect. Thus, since appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not charge the prosecutor with bad faith or cite him for misconduct, appellant cannot complain for the first time on appeal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Varnum, </em>70 Cal.2d 480, 488 [75 Cal.Rptr. 161, 450 P.2d 553] ; Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1963) \u00a7 748, p.722).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We turn to appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict of burglary in the second degree. He argues that while microfilm and drug samples were scattered about the floor, the doctor could not determine that anything had been taken. He also argues that appellant was not seen entering or leaving the medical building nor was anything from the doctor\u2019s office found in his possession when he was apprehended at the scene. He therefore vigorously asserts that although there was substantial evidence of a breaking and entering into Dr. Lusk\u2019s office, the evidence was insufficient to establish that appellant was the guilty party or, if so, that he intended to commit theft, as charged in .the information.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Admittedly, the evidence upon which appellant was convicted was entirely circumstantial.  However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>corpus delicti of a crime may be established by circumstantial evidence <em>(Reed </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>238 Cal.App.2d 321, 322 [47 Cal.Rptr. 815] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Conley, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 296 [33 Cal.Rptr. 866]).  And when the \u201c.totality of the circumstances\u201d of the instant ease is considered, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to justify the jury\u2019s verdict.  First, there was substantial evidence of a breaking and entering into Dr'. Lusk\u2019s office, and it is the rule that a burglarious intent can reasonably be inferred from an unsuccessful entry alone <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>204 Cal.App.2d 782, 786 [22 Cal.Rptr. 731]).  Second, appellant and another man were seen running from the back of the building by a police officer shortly after the police arrived at the scene. Then, to fortify the highly, incriminating circumstance of two men running from the scene of a burglary, appellant did not satisfactorily explain his presence in the back of the medical building and why he and his companion .fled when hailed by a policeman and then failed to heed his command to stop. Appellant merely stated that he was in the vicinity of the building to visit a woman by the name of Evelyn Blevins who lived nearby, but he did not produce her at the trial nor was such a person known to either the telephone company or the gas and electric company. He also stated that he did not know the other man who was running but did not satisfactorily explain why the man stopped to help him when he fell.  It is settled that a person\u2019s flight from the scene of a burglary, without reasonable explanation, is evidence of his participation in the burglary.  As this court stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jordan, supra, </em>204 Cal.App.2d 782, 786-787 : \u201cBurglarious intent can reasonably be inferred from an unlawful entry alone. (Citations.) Even if no crime be committed after the entry, circumstances such as flight after being hailed by an occupant of the building . . . without reasonable explanation of the entry, will warrant the conclusion by a jury that the entry was made with the intention to commit theft.\u201d [5c] Third, as we have already stated, appellant\u2019s felony conviction in 1962 established his motive for breaking into the doctor\u2019s office and was an additional incriminating circumstance in the chain of circumstantial evidence weaved by the prosecution to connect appellant to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Appellant\u2019s final contention that it was inherently improbable that he committed the burglary because he was on parole and wearing blue pants, an orange sweater and smooth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>soled leather shoes is so devoid of merit that no further comment is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Stone, Acting P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 28, 1969, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 24,1969.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">An intent to commit a felony was not charged in the information. Appellant was merely charged with intent to commit theft. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>158 Cal.App.2d 553 [322 P.2d 966].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
