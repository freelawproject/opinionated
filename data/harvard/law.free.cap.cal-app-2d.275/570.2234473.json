J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIn\">The issue to be determined is whether the issuance of a money order, for a fee, by defendant bank can be a violation of the \u201csales below cost\u201d and \u201closs leader\u201d prohibitions of the Unfair Practices Act (Bus, &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17000,17043,17044).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The case is here on plaintiff\u2019s appeal from a judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court had sustained a general demurrer to a second amended complaint, without leave to amend further.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The complaint alleges in substance the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Plaintiff is a trade association whose members are licensed to sell and cash checks and money orders under the Check Sellers and Cashers Law (Fin. Code, \u00a7 12000 et seq.). The causes of action of the members have been assigned to plaintiff. Each of the plaintiff\u2019s members sells checks or money orders to the public through agents who are usually independent businesses such as liquor stores, drug stores, food markets and other retail establishments. The public pays fees ranging from 20 to 35 cents per check, depending upon its size. The selling agent retains a portion of that fee as his commission, and the remainder is remitted to the seller. The amount of that commission is determined by bargaining. In practice the seller receives an average of 12 to 15 cents per check.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">In March 1966 the defendant, a national banking association, entered into the business of selling money orders to the public through agents in the Los Angeles area. Defendant offers its agents an arrangement whereby defendant receives only 10 cents of each fee and the agent keeps anything over that amount. It is alleged that the 10 cents received by defendant is less than its cost of doing business <em>\u2022 </em>that defendant has acted without regard for whether it made a profit and \u201cwith wanton and reckless disregard for the harmful injurious effect that said conduct would have upon competition in the money order industry,\u201d and that defendant\u2019s purpose was establishing new bank customers, including the agents themselves, from whom defendant might realize a profit through other aspects of the banking business.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>It is further alleged that agents of other cheek sellers are deserting them in order to sell defendant\u2019s money orders at the more favorable commission rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The complaint prays an injunction and a recovery of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">No question has been raised as to the standing of plaintiff to maintain this action. The act authorizes a trade association to bring an action to restrain a violation or recover damages (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17070).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Nor does defendant raise any contention that its status as a national hanking association provides any immunity from the provisions of the state laws which are here invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Before discussing the application of the Unfair Practices Act, it is necessary to take note of the important legal characteristics of the check selling business.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Under the Check Sellers and Cashers La.w, persons such as plaintiff\u2019s members, who engage in the business of selling or cashing checks or money orders for compensation, are required to first obtain a license from the Commissioner of Corporations. (Fin. Code, \u00a7 12200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">On the other hand, banks chartered under state or federal law are not subject to that statute. (Fin. Code, \u00a7 12100, subd. (a) ; see 41 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">The funds received by a licensed check seller or its agents from the sale of a check or money order, equal in amount to the face value of the instruments, constitute trust funds, which must not be commingled with the assets of the licensee, and must be deposited promptly in a trust account in a bank. (Fin. Code, \u00a7 12300.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">A bank which issues its own money order is under no such limitation on the use of the proceeds. The parties here agree that the court may take judicial notice that so long as the money order is outstanding defendant has the use of the money which it has received. Even though each money order is outstanding for only a few days, a bank which issues them in large volume will have on hand at all times a substantial amount of money augmenting the free assets of the bank which can be loaned or otherwise invested profitably. Thus, to a bank, the use of a customer\u2019s money is a part of the consideration for the issuance of a check or money order, whereas a licensed check seller, under the limitations of the regulatory law, can receive no such benefit from the customers \u2019 money.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">Although to the customer the money orders issued by defendant may be the exact equivalent of those sold by plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>tiff\u2019s members, the legal and economic characteristics of defendant\u2019s business are quite different from the business of plaintiff\u2019s members.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The Unfair Practices Act makes it unlawful \u201cto sell any article or product at less than the cost thereof\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17043) and \u201cto sell or use any article or product as a \u2018loss leader\u2019 \u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17044).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Section 17024 says \u201c \u2018Article or product\u2019 includes any article, product, commodity, thing of value, service or output of a service trade. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The statute contains no definition of \u201csell\u201d except to say that \u201c \u2018Sell\u2019 includes selling; offering for sale or advertising for sale.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17022.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">As a guide to interpretation the Business and Professions Code contains this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">\u201c\u00a7 17001. The Legislature declares that the purpose of this chapter is to safeguard the public against the creation or perpetuation of monopolies and to foster and encourage competition, by prohibiting unfair, dishonest, deceptive, destructive, fraudulent and discriminatory practices by which fair and honest competition is destroyed or prevented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">\u201c\u00a7 17002. This chapter shall be liberally construed that its beneficial purposes mav be subserved. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">Defendant argues that it does not come within sections 17043 and 17044 because it does not \u201csell\u201d anything. It is apparent from the definition of \u201carticle or product\u201d that the statute is designed to cover a great variety of transactions other than the conventional sale of real or personal property. The broad definition of \u201carticle or product\u201d compels a corresponding expansion of the word \u201csell\u201d as used in sections 17043 and 17044. Thus although cutting hair is not ordinarily described as a sale, an offer to cut hair at less than cost may be an unlawful \u201closs leader\u201d under section 17044. <em>(Garner </em>v. <em>Journeyman Barbers\u2019 etc. Union </em>(1963) 223 Cal.App.2d 101, 107 [35 Cal.Rptr. 693].)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">In the ordinary meaning of the words, a money order is a \u201cthing of value,\u201d and the issuer of a money order renders a service by holding itself ready to pay the face value to the holder of the instrument whenever he presents it. Thus, giving to the statute the liberal interpretation which the Legislature has commanded, we must conclude that, within the meaning of the Unfair Practices Act, defendant is engaged in selling a product.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Defendant also makes the argument that this case involves not sales, but only a division of commissions between the issuer of the check and its agents. Defendant says in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">\u2018 \u2018 It cannot be too strongly emphasized that Respondent and Appellant are both selling money orders at exactly the same price to the consumer. Both charge the consumer exactly the same fee for issuing money orders. The only difference is that the Bank gives up a greater portion of the fee to its agents than Appellant\u2019s members give up to their agents. \u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Defendant fails to note that the gravamen of the complaint is what the defendant is alleged to be doing, not what the plaintiff\u2019s members are doing. Under the allegations of the complaint, and under the law, the food market or liquor store which issues defendant\u2019s money orders to the public acts as an agent of the defendant, who is the issuer of the money order. (See 41 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 169,174.) Thus defendant is engaged in the business of selling its money orders to the individual customers, not to the sales agent. The amount which the defendant allows to its sales agents as a commission is a part of defendant\u2019s costs. If the 10 cents which defendant allegedly nets after paying the sales commission is too little, then the sale is below cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The complaint alleges that it is not possible for defendant to operate profitably on what it nets from its agents, and that defendant operates its money order business at a loss except with a few large agencies. A violation of section 17043 or 17044 involves both a sale below cost and an unlawful purpose or effect. (See <em>Balzer v. Caler </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 663 [82 P.2d 19] ; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Dallas </em>(1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 234 [248 P.2d 63].) The complaint alleges both elements and thus states a cause of action. Whether the defendant is selling at less than its cost, and whether the transactions have the unlawful purpose or effect referred to in the statute, are factual issues to be determined at a trial. The special legal and economic characteristics of the banking business, mentioned above, may have a bearing upon the truth of the allegations, but any discussion of that should await the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The judgment is reversed with directions to overrule the demurrer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Jefferson, J., and Dunn, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
