Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">Thomas, an employee of Miles Motor Transport System (Miles), drove his employer\u2019s truck onto premises of Cal-Pack to pick up a load of empty boxes. He was injured when a forklift, operated by Cal-Pack\u2019s employee Moses Melton, became entangled in the truck\u2019s tie-down cable. At the time Melton (as Avas determined by a jury in the instant action) was engaged in loading the Miles truck. Thomas commenced an action for personal injuries, naming both Cal-Pack and Melton as defendants. These parties tendered defense of the action to Transport whose insurance policy co\\rered the Miles truck. The tender was rejected by Transport. Subsequently, the case was settled by the Fund, as Cal-Pack\u2019s insurer, for $13,875. The fund incurred an obligation of $700 in attorney fees in defending the Thomas action.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">Under its policy, the Fund\u2019s liability limit was $100,000 for each person injured. Transport\u2019s limit, as indicated by a policy in evidence at the trial, appeared to be $10,000 for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>person injured. The trial 'court concluded that the two insurance carriers were liable for the Thomas settlement in proportion to their respective coverage limits. The Fund\u2019s liability was computed at $100,000/110,000' of the whole, or $13,250, and Transport\u2019s share at $10,000/110,000, or $1,325. It was accordingly adjudged that Transport pay to the Fund\u2019s insured, Cal-Pack, $1,325.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Cal-Pack contends, as a matter of law, that the trial court\u2019s allocation of liability was erroneous. It points out that Miles and its insurance carrier have a \u201cprimary\u201d liability for Thomas\u2019 injuries since Melton, the tortfeasor, was directly insured as a permissive user of the Miles truck. Cal-Pack then argues that its own liability is \u201csecondary\u201d since it arises solely by virtue of the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Belying on <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Constr. Co., </em>46 Cal.2d 423 [296 P.2d 801, 57 A.L.R.2d 914], <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Transport Indem. Co., </em>244 Cal.App.2d 110 [52 Cal.Rptr. 757], and <em>Pleasant Valley etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Cal-Farm Ins. Co., </em>142 CaI.App.2d 126 [298 P.2d 109], Cal-Pack contends that Transport must contribute' toward the Thomas settlement the full amount of its policy limit, which the parties in their briefs agreed was $10,000. These cases hold that where an employer\u2019s tort liability exists solely by virtue of the unauthorized negligence of an employee, automobile liability insurance directly covering the employee must first be exhausted before resorting to insurance covering only the secondarily liable employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">This contention of Cal-Pack is unacceptable for the reason that its liability for Thomas\u2019 damages is also <em>primary. </em>This liability arises from the admitted fact that Melton\u2019s permissive use of the Cal-Pack owned forklift, during the loading operation, proximately contributed to Thomas\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The Fund\u2019s policy insures against liability arising out of the use of any \u201cautomobile.\u201d It then proceeds to define that term rather enigmatically.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our best effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>understand this definition and apply it to the facts and circumstances of the instant case leads us to this meaning: An insured automobile is an owned automobile or land motor vehicle, unless it is equipment designed for use principally off public roads and is not subject to motor vehicle registration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The parties concede that a. forklift is a \u201cland motor vehicle.\u201d Such a vehicle is obviously designed \u201cfor use principally off public roads.\u201d But if it is subject to motor vehicle registration it is nevertheless an insured automobile under the Fund policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Vehicle Code section 4000 generally provides that all motor vehicles used upon highways shall be registered. An exception is provided by Vehicle Code section 4013 which states: \u201cAny forklift truck which is designed primarily for loading and unloading and for stacking materials and is operated upon a highway only for the purpose of transporting products or material across a highway in the loading, unloading or stacking process, and is in no event operated along a highway for a greater distance than one-quarter mile is exempt from registration. \u2019 \u2019  It is apparent that whether a forklift which is a motor vehicle is subject to registration, can be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>only by reference to the use to which the individual machine is put.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">It follows that forklifts generally <em>are </em>subject to registration when operated on a highway, other than for crossing, and in any event when used along a highway for more than a quarter mile. On the other hand they <em>are not </em>subject to registration when operated within the limits set by section 4013.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The Fund policy exempts from coverage certain motor vehicles \u201cnot subject to motor vehicle registration.\u201d It is not clear whether the reference is only to classes of motor vehicles which are per se exempt from registration (e.g., special construction equipment; see Veh. Code, \u00a7 4010), or if it includes individual vehicles ordinarily subject to such registration, but exempt therefrom because of the limited nature of their use (e.g., forklifts; see Veh. Code, \u00a7 4013).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u201cIf the insurer uses language which is uncertain any reasonable doubt will be resolved against it; if the doubt relates to extent or fact of coverage, . . . the [policy\u2019s] language will be understood in its most inclusive sense, for the benefit of the insured.\u201d <em>(Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Constr. Co., </em>46 Cal.2d 423, 437-438 [296 P.2d 801, 57 A.L.R.2d 914] ; <em>Pleasant Valley etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Cal-Farm Ins. Co., </em>142 Cal.App.2d 126, 132 [298 P.2d 109].) This rule is particularly applicable where, as here, the insurance carrier claims a certain risk is excluded, or property excepted, from coverage. <em>(California Comp. &amp; Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>62 Cal.2d 532, 534 [42 Cal.Rptr. 845, 399 P.2d 381].) And just what is excluded from the coverage of an insurance policy must be <em>conspicuous, plain and clear. (Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Ins. Co., </em>65 Cal.2d 263, 273 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104,419 P.2d 168].)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Applying the foregoing well-known rules of construction, we interpret the Fund policy as covering the subject forklift and providing \u201cprimary\u201d coverage to Melton, its permissive user at the time of Thomas\u2019 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">It follows that the superior court\u2019s conclusion that Transport and the Fund should contribute toward the Thomas settlement in proportion to their coverage limits was correct. However, for reasons we shall now discuss, the judgment of the lower court must nevertheless be modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">As previously indicated, the action below was tried on the theory that Transport\u2019s liability limit was $10,000 for each person injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Pending this appeal, and after filing of briefs, Cal-Pack moved, under the authority of Code of Civil Procedure section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>956a (now \u00a7909), for leave to present additional evidence. The subject evidence was alleged to be an undisclosed endorsement to the Transport policy in effect at the time of the Thomas accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Supporting the motion was a declaration of counsel which related the following. In a reciprocal exchange of policies before the trial, Cal-Paek was furnished with a copy of the Miles policy written by Transport. A question arose whether it was the effective policy, which resulted in Cal-Paek setting for hearing a \u201cMotion to Produce.\u201d Thereafter counsel for Transport sent to counsel for Cal-Pack a letter as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cEnclosed herein please find a copy of a letter received from Transport Indemnity Company verifying the fact that the policy that you have in your possession is the same as the policy effective at the time of the subject accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201cI trust this will eliminate the necessity of appearing at the Motion to Produce on June 7,1965.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u2018 \u2018 If not, please advise. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Enclosed with the letter was a copy of a letter from Transport to its attorney reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">\u201cPlease be advised that the policy of insurance that I forwarded to your office on December 3, 1964, pertaining to the coverage afforded to Miles and Sons Trucking Service was obtained from our Home Office in Los Angeles. This policy, issued July 1, 1964, to run until cancelled, is identical in its pertinent provisions to the policy of insurance issued to Miles and Sons Trucking Service effective at the time of the subject accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201cWe have checked the foregoing through our Home Office and are advised by them that the above is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">\u2018 \u2018 I trust that this letter answers your inquiry. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">The declaration continued, stating, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHK\">\u201cThe case proceeded through trial, and at no time was any further material with reference to the Transport policy supplied me by its attorneys. The action was tried on the basis of the policy as presented to me by Transport in June, 1965. During the course of this appeal, in June, 1968, it was discovered that a Public Utilities Commission endorsement was on file which applied to the Transport, policy which is the subject of this action, and which was in effect at the time of the accident. ... At no time prior to June, 1968, were plaintiffs and appellants aware of the existence of the Public Utilities Commission endorsement. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>This court granted the motion of Cal-Pack. As a result, not one, but two endorsements which were part of the effective Transport policy were disclosed. The effect of the first endorsement was to raise to $25,000 the limit for bodily injuries of one person. Transport now offers to stipulate that this endorsement with the described limit is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The second endorsement is entitled Public Utilities Commission LC 725. It was written after the other endorsement and raised the coverage limit for bodily injury of one person to $100,000. Transport concedes that this endorsement also was in effect at the time of the Thomas accident, but insists that it did not cover the Miles truck there involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Although the problem is not without difficulty, we conclude that Transport\u2019s endorsement LC 725, with its $100,000 limit, did cover Melton as the permissive user of the Miles truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Miles was a. \u201cHighway Common Carrier\u201d; it was also a \u201cHighway Common Carrier for Petroleum Products in Bulk,\u201d and a \u201cPetroleum Irregular Route Carrier.\u201d It was certificated by the Public Utilities Commission in each of these three classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Transport\u2019s specific contention is that endorsement LC 725 covers only petroleum-carrying vehicles; and that since the Miles truck being loaded by Melton was only a conventional truck being used under the authority of Miles \u2019 certification as a \u20181 Highway Common Carrier, \u2019 \u2019 the endorsement afforded no coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Transport\u2019s basic policy covered <em>all </em>owned vehicles of Miles, whether or not engaged in carrying petroleum. Endorsement LC725 was \u201cattached to and made a part\u201d of that policy. A general statement of the preamble or heading of the endorsement recites that it is applicable to \u201cpetroleum irregular route carriers, petroleum contract carriers, and highway common carriers of petroleum and petroleum products in bulk in tank trucks and/or tank trailers.\u201d However, a specific provision found in the body of the endorsement indicates that its applicability is not so limited.  Where general and specific provisions of an insurance policy differ as to its coverage or applicability, the specific provisions will prevail. <em>(Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Zurich Ins. </em>Co., 57 Cal.2d 27, 35 [17 Cal.Rptr. 12, 366 P.2d 455].)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Operation of the subject truck by Miles as a \u201cHighway Common Carrier\u201d required a Public Utilities Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>\u201ccertificate of public convenience and necessity.\u201d In the text of endorsement LC 725, we find the covenant, as pertinent here: \u201cIn consideration of the premium stated in the policy to which this endorsement is attached, the Company hereby agrees to pay, . . . any final judgment . . . resulting from the . . . use of <em>motor vehicles for which a certificate of public convenience and necessity or permit is required or has been issued to the insured by the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California, </em>...\u201d (Italics added.) The endorsement further recites: \u20181 [A] 11 terms, conditions, and limitations in the policy to which this endorsement is attached are to remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the Company\u201d and that \u201cNothing in this endorsement shall be construed to limit or restrict any coverage otherwise provided by the policy of which this endorsement is made a part. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">With the policy the foregoing language must reasonably be construed to extend $100,000 coverage for bodily injuries to one person resulting from the use of <em>any owned motor vehicle </em>of Miles, at least where, as here, the operation of such motor vehicle requires a certificate of \u201cpublic convenience and necessity. \u2019 \u2019 It follows, each insurance carrier having an applicable coverage limit of $100,000, that Cal-Pack is entitled to recover from Transport one-half of the cost of the Thomas settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Transport has pointed to a Public Utilities Commission order in support of its argument that endorsement LC 725 was intended to apply only to petroleum-carrying vehicles. However, even if that order be so construed it cannot reasonably prevail over the clear language of the endorsement that it applies to all \u201cmotor vehicles for which a certificate of public convenience and necessity\u201d is required or issued. The truck here involved was such a vehicle; and Transport received a premium for insuring that vehicle under the $100,000 limit of the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The judgment will be modified to direct that defendant Transport Indemnity Company pay to plaintiff California Packing Corporation the sum of $7,287.50 with interest thereon from the date of the Thomas settlement; as so modified the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Molinari, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied on August 26, 1969, and the following opinion was then rendered:</p>\n<author id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"AjP7\">In its petition for rehearing Transport urges that the opinion of the court does not resolve the questions arising out of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses of the respective policies. At the unreported oral argument on this appeal Transport and Cal-Pack conceded that if the forklift was an owned motor vehicle covered by the Fluid policy, the \u2018\u2018 other insurance\u201d clauses presented no issue on this appeal. In any event, Transport\u2019s endorsement LC 725 provides: \u201cWithin the limits of liability hereinafter provided it is further understood and agreed that no condition, provision, stipulation, or limitation contained in the policy, or any other endorsement thereon or violation thereof, or of this endorsement, by the insured, shall relieve the Company from liability hereunder. ...\u201d This clause supersedes and renders ineffective Transport\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d claims on which it now relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 24, 1969.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The entire policy definition follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkAY\">\u201c(b) Automobile.
