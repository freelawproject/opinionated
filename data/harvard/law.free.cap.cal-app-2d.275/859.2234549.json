J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACt\">On January 10, 1965, defendant, displaying what appeared to be a gun, held up Dale\u2019s food market in Van Nuys. He received some money, but the record is silent with respect to the amount. '</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">The next day, January 11, defendant again carrying what looked like a gun, approached one check stand at the Country Cousins market and relieved the checker, Ron Jones, of an unspecified amount of money. He then went to another check stand and demanded \u201cstack up all the ones, fives, tens and twenties.\u201d The checker, Miss Casanova, said: \u201cI will in just a minute. You will have to get at the end of the line and wait your turn.\u201d She thought defendant was kidding. Defendant said that he was not taking a turn and repeated his demand for the money. She looked at Glen Huling, the assistant manager, who nodded to her and she \u201cstacked it up.\u201d Even after she realized that defendant was not joking, she was not afraid. She was close enough to the gun to see that it had gray bullets in it. A minimum of $500 was taken from Miss Casanova. Defendant then said: \u201cI would advise you not to move until I have been gone five minutes. \u2019 \u2019 He left through a side door. Miss Casanova \u201csure didn\u2019t\u201d follow him or sound an alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">Deputy Sheriff Jones took defendant into his custody from the Denver police on January 23 or 24, 1965. Defendant was given a then adequate warning of his constitutional rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He freely confessed the three robberies, but claimed that he had used a toy gun. He did not, at that time, claim that \u201che was robbing from the Catholics to give the money to the Protestant Churches, or anything along that line . . .\u201d When arrested defendant had $890 on his person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It had been reported to Jones that defendant had told a Denver police sergeant that he was afraid that Sergeant Moulder of the Los Angeles Police Department, who had come to Denver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>with Jones, was going to kill him on the way back to Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Sergeant Moulder testified to a conversation with defendant in Los Angeles on January 25, 1965. In that conversation defendant again confessed the three robberies, stating that he got about $300 from Dale\u2019s and $1,600 from the Country Cousins market.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">When defendant committed these offenses he was on outpatient status from the Metropolitan State Hospital in Nor-walk. He had been acquitted of robbery and battery in Fresno in 1960, it having been found that he was not guilty by reason of insanity. After defendant had been in Vacaville for some time, the Superior Court of Solano County had ordered him transferred to Norwalk, while denying his petition to be released. It had never been found that his sanity had been restored. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1026a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">After defendant\u2019s arrest and the filing of the present information it was found that by reason of his mental condition he was unable to stand trial. He spent over a year at Atascadero before the criminal proceedings were resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">The case went to trial, non jury, on defendant\u2019s pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. Doctors Abe and Thompson were appointed pursuant to section 1027 of the Penal Code. Their reports were admitted in evidence. They also testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">In their reports, as well as in their testimony, both doctors concluded that at the time of the offenses defendant had been insane. We quote pertinent portions from the reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">Doctor Abe: \u201cDefendant was legally insane at the time of commission of offense. He appears to have been under the influence of delusions, causing him to commit his offenses. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">Doctor Thompson: \u201cIt is the opinion of the examiner that the defendant suffers with schizophrenia, paranoid type and that he is actively psychotic at the present time. He is quite delusional and has only recently stopped having hallucinations. He is disturbed at times and is very depressed and suicidal. He still has delusional ideas concerning the reasons behind his robbery. It is the opinion of the examiner that he is in need of further psychiatric care and treatment. He should be returned to a State Hospital for such further treatment. He is in fact so actively psychotic and depressed that I believe that he should have electric shock therapy. ... It is the opinion of the examiner that the defendant was insane at the time of commission of the offense. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>In their testimony both doctors amplified their finding of insanity by stating that although defendant knew the nature and quality of his acts, he did not know right from wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">In essence both psychiatrists were of the opinion that defendant was suffering from delusions. He felt that he was in contact with God, that he was robbing the markets in behalf of God and on behalf of the Protestant churches to bring them up to the standard of the Catholic church.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Another delusion was that the Governor wanted to put him in the gas chamber because he had been a burden on .the State of California for a long time. He also felt that God wanted him to take his own life before this happened. \u201cThey\u201d wanted to drive him to murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">\"When the court asked Doctor Abe whether defendant\u2019s demand that Miss Casanova not call the police for five minutes and his flight to Denver\u2014in other words his consciousness of possible legal consequences\u2014were consistent with the delusions, the doctor replied: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it would be consistent with the delusional material. I think in that event he would be sane, even if he had delusions. When he took those measures, I would say he would be legally sane.\u201d In Doctor Abe\u2019s view a person was legally sane, if he realized that his actions might make him responsible to the authorities \" even though the higher value indicated he should ignore that risk ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Doctor Thompson\u2019s view of legal sanity was not the same. In his view, even though defendant might have known that he could be arrested and punished for his activities he believed \u201cthat it [was] right to do what he did\u201d and therefore did not know the difference between right and wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">In addition to the reports of Doctors Abe and Thompson there was before the trial court an order of the Superior Court of the County of Solano dated February 28, 1963. The order referred to the fact that some time before that date defendant had been acquitted of robbery \u201cby reason of his insanity at the time of the alleged commission,\u201d had been found to be still insane at the time of the acquittal, had improved but not recovered his sanity at the time of the order and was in need of further treatment. The trial court also considered medical reports in connection with defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>hearing under section 1368 of the Penal Code which had resulted in his commitment to Atascadero. Unquestionably both psychiatrists \"who had examined defendant at that time diagnosed a mental abnormality as of the time of their examinations which took place more than a month after the two robberies. Also considered by the trial court were two municipal court records which contain further evidence of defendant\u2019s mental problems. All of these records have also been examined by this court. At best, from defendant\u2019s point of view, they are cumulative of the information furnished by Doctors Abe and Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">On appeal it is claimed that at the outset of the trial defendant\u2014because of his previous commitment under section 1026 of the Penal Code\u2014was presumed to be insane and that the presumption was not overcome at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Defendant\u2019s view that he did enjoy the benefit of a presumption of insanity is supported by <em>People </em>v. <em>Field, </em>108 Cal.App.2d 496 [238 P.2d 1052], Field, at the time of his offense, was an escapee from the Mendocino State Hospital. The court held that his previous commitment to that hospital \u2014though for reasons unknown\u2014created a presumption of insanity. While we are somewhat puzzled by that holding, since the <em>Field </em>opinion demonstrates that the court was well aware of the different types of insanity, the presumption was accepted by the trial court here. The court simply felt that- it was overcome by the non-psychiatric evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Of course it is not for doctors to formulate definitions of legal insanity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>61 Cal.2d 795. 811 [40 Cal.Rptr. 271, 394 P.2d 959].) There was no real factual conflict between Doctor Abe and Doctor Thompson although they differed in their views concerning the legal responsibility of a person who knows that he is violating temporal law, but does so in a, sincere belief that God has commanded it. There is no need for us to decide which of the two was legally correct. The plain fact is that the trial court felt that both had been taken in by the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   There is, of course, ample <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>authority for the proposition that the trier Of fact may consider \u2018 \u2018 \u2018 the conduct and declarations of the defendant occurring within a reasonable time before or after the commission of the alleged act, . . \u201d as proof of his mental condition at the time of the offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>61 Cal.2d 795, 805 [40 Cal.Rptr. 271, 394 P.2d 959], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>David, </em>12 Cal.2d 639, 649 [86 P.2d 811].)  Defendant's failure to obey the alleged delusional command, except as far as getting the money was concerned, his order not to call the police, his flight to Denver and his failure to soften the impact of his confessions, are more than adequate to support the court\u2019s finding of sanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Very recently in <em>People </em>v. <em>Coogler, </em>71 Cal.2d 153, 166-167 [77 Cal.Rptr. 790, 454 P.2d 686] our Supreme Court was faced with a claim that the expert psychiatric evidence unerringly pointed to diminished capacity. It said: \u201cWe recognize that the prosecution produced no expert witnesses of its own to contradict the defense testimony that defendant suffered from a disassoeiation reaction stemming either from organic or functional mental illness at the time he committed the acts charged. Although unanimity of expert opinion carries persuasive values (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 41, 55 [52 Cal.Rptr. 228, 416 P.2d 132]), a jury, under certain circumstances, can properly reject such opinions. As we recently explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bassett </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 122, 141 \u2018 \u201cThe chief value of an expert\u2019s testimony in this field, as in all other fields, rests upon the <em>material </em>from which his opinion is fashioned and the <em>reasoning </em>by which he progresses from his material to his conclusi\u00f3n. . . .\u201d \u2019 (Quoting <em>Carter </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C.Cir. 1957) 252 F.2d 608, 617 [102 App.D.C. 227].) . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">\u201c \u2018This was not a bizarre crime whose very character pointed to dissolution of the accused\u2019s deliberative faculties\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 149, 165 [67 Cal.Rptr. 601].) (Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Bassett, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 122; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nicolaus </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 866 [56 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>635, 423 P.2d 787] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Goedecke, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d 850 [56 Cal.Rptr. 625, 423 P.2d 777] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wolff, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d 795.) The prosecution\u2019s evidence generates the inference that after committing the robbery defendant shot at his victims to avoid identification. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Risenhoover </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 39, 52-53 [73 Cal.Rptr. 533, 447 P.2d 925] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nye </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 166, 172-173 [45 Cal.Rptr. 328, 403 P.2d 736].) Dr. Suarez did speculate that defendant might have killed the women because of a hatred of mother figures, but such an explanation took no account of the fact that defendant had almost fatally wounded Mr. Montoya; moreover, it \u2018did not enter [the psychiatrist\u2019s] mind' that defendant might have shot at his victims in order to avoid identification. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Only slight paraphrasing makes the Supreme Court\u2019s quoted statement applicable to this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Defendant also complains that his confessions should not have been admitted since he was not specifically advised that he was entitled to have an attorney present during the interrogation. The lack of any objection below precludes him from raising the point on appeal. <em>(In re Dennis M., </em>70 Cal.2d 444, 462 [75 Cal.Rptr. 1, 450 P.2d 296] ; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>67 Cal.2d 9, 14 [59 Cal.Rptr. 857, 429 P.2d 177].)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">In any event the point would have no merit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The first warning was given by Deputy Sheriff Jones in Denver. As he recalled it, he used a Denver Police Department form \u2018 \u2018 advising [defendant] of the fact that he could remain silent, that anything he said could be used against him, and [that] he was entitled to an attorney.\u201d Similar warnings have been held adequate. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>66 Cal.2d 536, 553 [58 Cal. Rptr. 340, 426 P.2d 908] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>65 Cal.2d 698, 704-705 [56 Cal.Rptr. 305, 423 P.2d 233] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>La Vergne, </em>64 Cal.2d 265, 270 [49 Cal.Rptr. 557, 411 P.2d 309] : <em>People </em>v. <em>Luker, </em>63 Cal.2d 464, 473 [47 Cal.Rptr. 209, 407 P.2d9].)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">According to Officer Moulder, before he received defendant\u2019s confession, he \u201ctold the defendant that he had a right to remain silent, he had the right to an attorney at all stages of the proceedings, that anything he said could be used against him in subsequent court proceedings. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Defendant appears to contend that the words \u20181 at all stages of the proceedings\u201d a,re misleading in that they appear to relate to court proceedings. We need not consider whether, standing alone, the words would have that effect. In the case at bar the words are clearly juxtaposed to \u201csubsequent court proceedings.\u201d We do not believe that defendant was misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Stephens, J., and Aiso, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-10\">The trial in the instant case started on April 13, 1966.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b886-11\">The total loss reported for the Country Cousins robbery was \u00a71,600.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Doctor Abe admitted that he would be more strongly persuaded of the existence of defendant\u2019s delusion, had he actually given the money to the Protestant churches. He also admitted that it could be of significance that two weeks after the robberies, when he confessed to the police, defendant had said nothing about his reason for the crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b889-9\">\u201c If you take all of the circumstances\u2014I am not unmindful of the fact that the defendant had the opportunity of quite an extensive opportunity of an education of psychiatry and the laiv. He spent quite a lot of time in the mental hospital of the psychiatric institution and has had quite a chance to think about a good story to give after he got out. Just as there is no necessary connection between committing a robbery, between carrying out the delusional purpose, and having the delusion, similarly it is not necessarily inconsistent that a man has a delusional system and yet at the same time know[s] that by displaying that delu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>sional system that he may lighten the burden that he may suffer on a nondelusional basis.\u201d When the court denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, it expressed itself similarly: \u201cSo that I must say that, although the doctors buy the proposition that his delusion was the entire cause of this robbery, and although I don\u2019t question that he probably did suffer from such delusion\u2014nor do I question that he is presently mentally ill, and that he has a psychotic process which was probably\u2014 which he has had for many years, and very likely will have for a long time in the future\u2014still I don\u2019t see\u2014I do not see that the evidence is satisfying at all, that that is what caused him to commit the robbery.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b891-10\">The reason why we discuss it in spite of the lack of an objection is that it is also argued that the failure to object deprived defendant of constitutionally adequate representation in the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, 464-466 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
