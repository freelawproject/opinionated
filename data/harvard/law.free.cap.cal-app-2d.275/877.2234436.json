J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYz\">By information filed on July 14, 1967, defendant was charged in two counts with the commission of two murders, in violation of Penal Code section 187, and he pleaded not guilty. On November 27, 1967, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>ease was called for trial and a jury trial was waived. By stipulation, the cause was submitted on the testimony contained in the transcript of the preliminary hearing, with each side reserving the right to offer additional evidence, and all stipulations entered into at the preliminary hearing were .deemed entered into for purposes of the trial. It was further stipulated that a part of the testimony given at the preliminary hearing (pages 117 through 184 of the clerk\u2019s transcript) was not to be considered by the court. On December 6, 1967, the court found defendant guilty of murder in the first degree on both counts. Defendant was then sentenced to state prison for the term of- his natural life, and for purposes of sentence, count II was merged with count I. This is an appeal from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The facts relating to the commission of the crimes which resulted in defendant\u2019s conviction need not be discussed.  The sole issue to be considered on-this appeal is whether the admission made by defendant and tape-recorded during the course of police interrogations conducted on August 7 and August 8, .1967 were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Defendant was arrested at 4 p.m. on August 7, 1967, and taken to' the University detective bureau interrogation room for questioning concerning the murders with which he was subsequently charged and of which he was convicted. At the time he was taken into custody, the arresting officer advised defendant\u2019s mother that an attorney should be obtained for defendant. At the outset, pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974], defendant was advised of his constitutional rights, and when asked if he wanted an attorney present during the interrogation, he said that he did.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The police then informed defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>that an attorney from the public defender\u2019s office would not be available until the next morning at 8 a.m. After defendant was told that no attorney would be available until the next morning, defendant agreed to be questioned by the officers. The interrogation was then resumed. The next morning, August 8, 1967, at approximately 10 or 11a.m., the police again interrogated defendant without further <em>Miranda </em>warn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>ing. During this investigation, defendant made significant incriminating admissions. No attorney was provided defend-ant at this time, though defendant had been told that counsel would be available at that time. No one told defendant he could make a phone call either to an attorney or to his mother. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>70 Cal.2d 469, 474 [74 Cal.Rptr. 889, 450 P.2d 265].) Defendant\u2019s extrajudicial conversations with the police on the night of August 7 and on the morning of August 8 were admitted as evidence at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">The facts of this ease are directly in line with the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Ireland, </em>70 Cal.2d 522 [75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580], where the court, in reversing the conviction, stated (pp. 535-536) : \u201cIn the recent ease of <em>People </em>v. <em>Fioritto </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 714 [68 Cal.Rptr. 817, 441 P.2d 625], we emphasized that \u2018A principal objective of [the <em>Miranda] </em>decision was to establish safeguards that would liberate courts insofar as possible from the difficult and troublesome necessity of adjudicating in each case whether coercive influences, psychological or -physical, had been employed to secure admissions or confessions.\u2019 (68 Cal.2d at p. 717.) We then went on to indicate that this objective imposed upon us a constitutional responsibility to insure that extrajudicial statements of criminal defendants not be admitted at trial unless the full range of \u2018protective devices\u2019 [footnote reference omitted] prescribed by <em>Miranda </em>was in operation at the time when such statements were obtained. [\u00b6] One of the primary \u2018protective devices\u2019 envisioned by <em>Miranda </em>is that requiring that custodial interrogation wholly cease when the suspect indicates in any manner that he wishes to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege. A suspect may indicate such a wish in many ways. He may, as in <em>Fioritto, </em>refuse to sign a waiver of his constitutional rights; he may simply refuse to continue an interrogation already in progress; or he may, as in the instant case, ask for an attorney. \u2018 Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked. <em>If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u2019 </em>(Italics added.) <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>384 U.S. 436, 474 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 723].) [\u00b6]... Clearly defendant request manifests a desire to have the assistance of his attorney at the earliest possible moment. This, under <em>Miranda, </em>is an assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege\u2014and therefore \u2018the interrogation must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>cease until an attorney is present.\u2019 (384 U.S. at p. 474 [16 L.Ed.2d at p.723].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">It seems beyond question that under the circumstances here present there existed a psychological persuasion at the time defendant, on the evening of August 7, consented to make a statement in the absence of an attorney. And, while it is true that the trial court meticulously stated its disbelief of defendant\u2019s testimony as to why he agreed to make a statement, the intangible pressure condemned in <em>Miranda </em>remained. In <em>People </em>v. Hamilton, 268 Cal.App.2d 393-394 [74 Cal.Rptr. 29], the court considered the problem of a defendant first requesting an attorney and then agreeing to speak in the absence of such safeguard. There, the court stated: \u201cThe officers took defendant to an interrogation room and placed him under arrest. Deputy Sipe advised defendant of his constitutional rights by reading from a printed card containing what was described as the standard <em>Miranda </em>formula <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra). He was asked whether he understood those rights and whether, having them in mind, he wished to talk to the officers. Defendant replied that he understood his rights as enumerated, and that he wanted a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">\u201cDeputy Sipe then advised defendant that since he requested a lawyer, the officers could not talk to him at all, that \u2018it just cut us off from having any conversation with him.\u2019 Officer Sipe correctly analyzed the situation, but he nevertheless told defendant that the officers were of the opinion \u2018that he had come to the Sheriff\u2019s Office to clear a Charles McGriff of the charges that was [sic] against him, and to admit some burglaries that were committed in the Oildale area. \u2019 Officer Sipe testified that defendant then said he would talk to them. Sipe reread the <em>Miranda </em>rights from the card; defendant again said he understood them and that he would talk to them. After interrogation, estimated variously between one and two hours, the officers obtained a confession from defendant. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">\u201cViewing the evidence most favorably to respondent, continued questioning by the officers after defendant told them he wanted an attorney runs afoul of <em>Miranda </em>as explicated in <em>Fioritto. </em>While it is true, as the Attorney General points out, the interrogation by Deputy Sipe after defendant announced he wanted an attorney was not directly accusatory, nevertheless the officer\u2019s leading and suggestive statements constituted psychological persuasion of the kind proscribed by the court in <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>\u201c. . . [I] t is just such tactics that are condemned in the language of <em>Miranda, </em>at page 1627: \u2018 Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear. If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. \u2019 In <em>Fioritto </em>the court gave this language strict and literal interpretation, characterizing it as \u2018the didactic language of the United States Supreme Court, \u2019 and observed that such language \u2018shows no disposition to permit subsequent interrogation in the absence of counsel even if authorities believe there has been a change of circumstances.\u2019 (P.719).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-5\">\u2018 \u2018 Since the officers continued to question defendant after he demanded an attorney, we are compelled, under the authority of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Fioritto, </em>to hold the confession of defendant inadmissible. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">In the present case, defendant made the request to have the assistance of counsel immediately prior to the interrogation. This is all that is required to put a halt to custodial interrogation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that defendant later agreed to be questioned by police does not negate his earlier assertion of his <em>Miranda </em>rights if his consent to be interrogated was upon the premise that no attorney would be made available to him for some 15 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">We also recognize that there is no requirement in <em>Miranda </em>which compels police officers to shut their ears or refuse to participate in general conversation <em>volunteered </em>by a defendant, but a fair reading of the record before us does not comport with the conclusion that the statements made by defendant were <em>volunteered. </em>The statements were given in the setting and form of an interrogation. As stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fioritto, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 714, 719: \u201cWe do not, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>disapprove of the use of statements, whether admissions or confessions, voluntarily initiated by a suspect. Such statements have been repeatedly sanctioned in the decisions of this court (see e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Jacobson </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 319, 328 [46 Cal.Rptr. 515, 405 P.2d 555]), and are also expressly authorized in the <em>Miranda </em>opinion. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The protective statement elicited by the sergeant from defendant in his effort to make effective the waiver of presence of an attorney was not nearly as strong as that in <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 469, 474, where the declarations of waiver were held to be ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements.were erroneously admitted. The weapons involved in the crimes were found as the result of those statements, and therefore should have been suppressed as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-7\"> Questions by Officer Philip Alexander and answers by defendant, as testified by Officer Alexander:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABHC\">\u2018 \u2018 Question.

Dictionary, p. 1182.)</p>\n<p id=\"AA46\">\u201cThis appears from the direction given in <em>Miranda, </em>at page 485 [16 L.Ed.2d at p. 730], approving the E.B.I. practice set forth in a quoted letter: \u2018When the person who has been warned of his right to counsel decides that he wishes to consult with counsel before making a statement, the interview is terminated at that point. ... If he is indecisive in his request for counsel, there may be some question on whether he did or did not waive counsel. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>270 Cal.App.2d 715, 722-723 [76 Cal.Rptr. 53].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b909-8\">AISO, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmZ\">I concur in the opinion of my brother Justice Stephens reversing the judgment below, except for his view that once a defendant in custody has asked for an attorney, the police under no circumstances whatsoever can resume interrogation despite a defendant\u2019s change of mind. In this respect, I concur with my brother Justice Reppy\u2019s concurring opinion, except for the portion which attributes ingenuousness to this contemporary 20-year-old, especially one who represents himself to be 22 years old when convenient for his own illegal purposes.</p>\n<author id=\"b909-9\">REPPY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApB\">In concurring in reversal, I wish to add some particular observations. Although Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> says that if an arrestee \u201cindicates in any manner and at any stage of the process that he wishes to consult with an attorney before speaking there can be no questioning\u201d (pp. 444-445), it is not clear that this rules, out any reconsideration at all by the arrestee of his own feelings and desires in light of an intervening circumstance no matter what it might be, and. even if it might be the receipt of information from law enforcement of a necessary lapse of considerable time, 15 hours in the instant case, before an attorney can be present to assist him. The concern in <em>Miranda </em>is that there be no improper influence impelling the arrestee to make a statement involuntarily. (P. 461.) It is not felt that in every circumstance inability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>arrange for requested counsel in a given time is such an improper influence; that it can never be accepted as a basis for retraction of an initial request to have counsel present at a proposed interrogation and for a waiver of the right.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">There are circumstances in the instant case which indicate that the purported delay factor should never have been considered as a valid premise for such a retraction and waiver; that the delay was not inevitable. Alternatively, if it is to be considered that the delay was unavoidable, it is believed that there were coercive elements additional'to the in-custody setting and the substantial delay before the public defender could be present.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">With respect to the first point, it is felt that the police lieutenant did not have all the information he should have \u2022had to guide him in making a decision as to whether he would pursue, and that for this and probably other reasons, he did not adequately and reasonably pursue avenues which would have led to' the securing' of counsel for defendant within a fairly short time.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Defendant was arrested on a Monday at his residence. He was then 20 years old.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At that time\" Sergeant Alexander told his mother that he was in very serious trouble and that she had better get him an attorney. Sergeant Alexander brought defendant to Lieutenant Barclay after defendant had indicated that he wanted an attorney<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at the interrogation which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>the sergeant desired to carry out. The lieutenant asked defendant if he had a private attorney. Defendant replied that he did not have one in mind. His reply did not rule out the fact that his family or close friends would have had reasonably prompt access to a lawyer. Defendant said that his mother might get him one. The lieutenant did not ask defendant if he had access to funds. Defendant had stated that he did not think his mother had funds right now. This remark hardly closed the subject; rather it invited further inquiry. If such an inquiry had been made it would have revealed that defendant was the beneficiary of $2,500 from his deceased father\u2019s estate of which his mother had charge. Most attorneys would have been satisfied to rely on this source of funds and would have been willing to attend an interrogation session in this type of case without a substantial advance retainer or any at all. Lieutenant Barclay did not consider and did not ask defendant his age. If he had heard defendant\u2019s version of his age, he should have been and, no doubt, would have been more concerned about making contact with a private attorney through the mother. The record is silent as to whether Sergeant Alexander advised Lieutenant Barclay of his warning to defendant\u2019s mother that she should get an attorney for <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the lieutenant had this information, he might well have, and, of course, should have taken a different approach about contacting defendant\u2019s mother. He could have anticipated that she had been malting efforts to get a lawyer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If he acted without this knowledge, it is no excuse because the sergeant\u2019s knowledge is imputable to the police as an entity. As it was, Lieutenant Barclay (although he knew defendant desired an attorney)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> did not call defendant\u2019s mother, nor have Sergeant Alexander call her (which would have been logical because he was the one who had become acquainted with and issued the warning to her) and advise her that he needed the legal services he had recommended right now. He did not indicate to defendant that he (defendant) could call her. He did not even advise defendant that he had the right to make a phone call.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Lieutenant Barclay testified that it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>been Ms intention to call a private attorney if defendant had one in mind. He should have carried out his intention to the extent of eallmg or having the sergeant call defendant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that it was not unreasonable for the lieutenant to conclude that defendant was indigent and that the only telephone call to be made was to the public defender\u2019s office, it is noted that the time when Lieutenant Barclay presumably concluded that no call was to be made to bring about contact with private counsel was 5 p.m., or just a few minutes thereafter. There was introduced into evidence a bulletin from the chief of police saymg that the services of the public defender were available between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and giving the telephone numbers to call during those hours and the names and extension numbers of three deputies, including the chief deputy. Smce calls could be made up to 5.p.m., it is reasonable to conclude that under unusual circumstances the office would send out personnel after that hour. Despite the fact that it was just at or only a few minutes after the terminal hour, Lieutenant Barclay did not call the public defender. Reasonable consideration of the constitutional rights of defendant suggests that such a call should have been made. The lieutenant too readily accepted the nonavailability of the public defender as inevitable. This purported impossibility of obtaining the public defender until the next day should not have been put to defendant at the time and in the manner it was. With the time just at or only fractionally over the authorized limit, the police could not rationally ignore the request for a public defender.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Enabling a defendant to obtain a lawyer when he requests one must be considered one of the procedural <em>safeguards </em>to secure the privilege against self-incrimination, the use of which must be demonstrated by the prosecution to make statements stemming from custodial interrogation admissible. <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>p. 444.) The showing of the People in the instant case fel\u00ed short of such demonstration. \u201c[A] heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant- knowingly and intelligently [and freely] waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to . . . counsel ['citations].\u201d <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>p. 475.) The burden no doubt should be heavier where the right to counsel has been claimed once. The People did not meet their burden of showing that the purported retraction and waiver by defendant in this case was freely made in light of the fact that they were prompted by a factor which should have been avoided. Had either a private attorney or the public defender been contacted, it is probable that the wait would have been less than an hour (not much more at the most), which is far different from the 15 hours which defendant felt he had to wait. Defendant\u2019s decision to retract his request and to be interrogated without an attorney cannot be said to have been an informed change of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">In connection with the alternative point, firstly attention is called to the circumstance that the officers were dealing with a 20-year-old man who was not so alert and sophisticated as to post-arrest procedures and constitutional rights but that he failed initially to comprehend what was meant by giving up his rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Secondly it is noted that there was no rebuttal contradiction<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> by the officers of defendant\u2019s testimony (as there promptly was as to other parts of it) that when he was advised that an attorney from the public defender\u2019s office could not be present until 8 a.m. the next morning, he asked, \u201cWhat else can I do?\u201d and was advised, \u201cWell, you know, you can help us out and make it easy on yourself. \u2019 \u2019 This, if a fact, was an additional coercive factor of the kind frequently faulted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defendant testified that he was told by the officers that he would not be booked until he gave a statement; that he was sleepy and that the officers kept waking him up. These claims were denied, in effect by the officers and were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>believed by the trial judge.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Defendant testified that he still wanted an attorney and did not realize, despite being asked if he had an attorney, that he could have one <em>then. </em>The trial judge could have disbelieved this also. However it is the difficult process of weighing such conflicting impressions and accounts as were given by the officers and defendant in the instant case from which the <em>Miranda </em>court believed the trial judge should be removed. As restated in <em>Ireland, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 522, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Fioritto, </em>68 Cal.2d 714 [68 Cal.Rptr. 817, 441 P.2d 625], a principal objective of <em>Miranda </em>was to <em>\u201c \u2018. . </em>. liberate courts . . . from the difficult and troublesome necessity of adjudicating in each case whether coercive influences\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ireland, supra, </em>at p. 535) had brought about admissions or confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Finally, the lieutenant abruptly terminated his queries when defendant said that \u201che did not want to wait that long\u201d and would \u201clike to get this done tonight.\u201d He was quickly satisfied to accept the delay as the sole motive for defendant\u2019s change of mind. What followed was not a spontaneous stream of utterances (which might have been acceptable under <em>People </em>v. <em>Ireland, supra) </em>but a full-fledged interrogation intended to elicit incriminating answers; an interrogation typical of the accusatory stage; the type with which <em>Miranda </em>is concerned. \" The fundamental import of the privilege while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of . . . counsel, but whether he can be interrogated. \u2019 \u2019 (P. 478.)</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-10\"> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>268 Cal.App.2d 393 [74 Cal.Rptr. 29], the problem was not one of time lapse before requested counsel could be present.

However <em>Miranda </em>concedes that its coercive aspect is not so strong but that, despite it, there can be a voluntary waiver of rights. (Pp. 444, 470, 475.) Official representation that requested counsel cannot be obtained for a substantial period of time adds an element of pressure of some sort, especially with respect to an arrestee wanting to give a statement. As indicated, I am not prepared to say that a retraction of a request for counsel can never be considered freely made under this combination of factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Information from a driver\u2019s license in possession of defendant gave his age as 22. However, it is not clear that either Sergeant Alexander or Lieutenant Barclay had digested .this information and relied on it.

Unquestionably he so would have advised the officers if he had been asked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b910-11\">There was in this request no differentiation between a private attorney and one from the public defender\u2019s office.
