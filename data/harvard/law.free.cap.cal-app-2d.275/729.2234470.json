He was survived by respondent, who is his ex-wife, by two minor sons of that marriage, who were and are in respondent\u2019s custody and of whom she is guardian, and by appellant, his widow. At the time of death, a divorce action was pending between appellant and decedent, in which she had received a pendente lite support order. The widow was appointed as administratrix of the estate and appears herein in that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">The divorce decree between decedent and respondent had ordered him to pay to respondent, for the support of the two children, $200 per month, together with medical and dental bills; the pendente lite order that appellant had received in her divorce action, gave her $20 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Respondent sought a family allowance for the two sons, asking for $200 a month, plus medical and dental expenses and an award of $250 for her attorney. The widow sought a family allowance, in the amount of her alimony award, plus an additional amount because of her costs for attorney fees. The court gave respondent $50 a month for each son for 12 months, retroactive to the date of death and $250 attorney fees; it denied any additional allowance for medical or dental expenses. On the widow\u2019s petition, it granted her $10 per week for 12 months, commencing on April 1, 1968. The widow in her fiduciary capacity as administratrix, has appealed from the order in favor of respondent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">The attack on the family allowance, as such, is based on section 682 of the Probate Code, which section reads as follows : \u201c If the widow, widower, or any minor child has a reasonable- maintenance derived from other property, and there are other persons entitled to a family allowance, the allowance shall be granted only to those who have not such maintenance. \u2019 \u2019  The widow contends that, since respondent is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>receiving $80 per month from social security for the children, and since she has received, as their guardian, $15,741.48, the proceeds of insurance on decedent\u2019s life, the terms of section 682 prohibit any allowance to the children. We disagree. It was held in <em>Estate of Jameson </em>(1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 517 [36 Cal.Rptr. 802], that social security payments were not monies \u201cderived from other property\u201d within the meaning of section 682.  As to the insurance proceeds, while it has been held that a court should look to the existence of <em>income producing </em>assets in passing on petitions for a family allowance <em>(Estate of Silver </em>(1949) 92 Cal.App.2d 173 [206 P.2d 895]), the law does not require that capital assets be invaded.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The argument against the allowance is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Although there is some question as to whether attorneys fees, as such,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may be awarded to a widow in connection with her petition for a family allowance, it was squarely held that such an award is proper where the petition is on behalf of a minor child. <em>(Estate of Filtzer </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 776, 781-784 [205 P.2d 377].)</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Jefferson, Acting P. J., and Dunn, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-12\"> There was no appeal from the order in favor of the widow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-10\">The insurance proceeds, if invested, would of course produce a small sum that would be available for support. In support of the order, we assume that the trial court found that that potential income was not enough to be a \u201c reasonable \u2019 <em>\u2019 </em>maintenance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b757-11\">In the case of a widow, the practice is to grant an allowance large enough (if possible) to enable her to treat the cost of securing the order as a part of her living expense. That was the device which the widow utilized in her prayer in the court below.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
