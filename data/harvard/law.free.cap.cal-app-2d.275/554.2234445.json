Travelers specifically disputes the trial court\u2019s findings (1) that the automobile was not being \u201cused in the automobile business\u201d within the terms of its policy exclusion at the time of the accident, and (2) that the driver was at the time of the collision operating the automobile as the owner\u2019s agent. Appellant\u2019s contentions have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">There is no reporter\u2019s transcript hut the relevant facts are stipulated. Prior to August 18, 1965, Travelers issued to . Simon D. Feigin, then a resident and domiciliary of the State of New York, its policy of automobile liability insurance No. MP 3215964 covering the 1963 Pontiac four-door sedan involved in the subject accident. The policy, which covered the period October 25, 1964, to October 25, 1965, was in full force and effect on the date of the accident. On August 18, 1965, Feigin delivered his 1963 Pontiac to Dolman Pontiac with instructions to remove the vibration which occurred in the automobile during its operation. Dolman Pontiac was then insured under Garage Liability Policy No. RMG 051401 issued by Royal and that policy was in full force and effect also on the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Robert Leston Button, an employee of Dolman Pontiac, applied weights to balance the wheels of the Pontiac and a road-test of the car\u2019s performance was thereafter indicated. The testimony of Button and Feigin relative to this determination is consistent. The decision, related in Button\u2019s language was translated into action as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u201cI concluded that the cause of the vibration had to he in the steering. By this time, I doubted that there was anything wrong with the car. I thought it might be just the owner\u2019s imagination. The only thing left to do was to road test the car to see if it really did vibrate. I wanted to see exactly what I was up against and if there was any type of vibration, just where it was coming from. I told the service writer, Vick, that I was going to road test the ear. He said: \u2018Allright\u2019. I asked Mr. Feigin to come along to show me what the vibration was. He asked me to drive after I started to walk around to the passenger side. He said: \u2018Why don\u2019t you drive it, then you can probably tell more about it than I can, \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\u25a0While Button was driving the car on the readiest with Feigin a passenger, the 1963 Pontiac was involved in an accident with a 1956 Oldsmobile driven by Babette T. DeBona, who had as a passenger in her vehicle Babette Terese Waxenfelter. Babette T. DeBona later filed Civil Action No. SW C7171 for personal injuries and for the alleged wrongful death of Babette Terese Waxenfelter naming various defendants including Button, Dolman Pontiac, Feigin, and both Travelers and Royal. Travelers originally undertook Feigin\u2019s defense, and Royal undertook the defense of Button and Dolman Pontiac in the subject action. Subsequently, however, Travelers made a demand upon Royal to assume and take over Feigin\u2019s defense and Royal made a demand that Travelers assume and take over the defense of Button and Dolman Pontiac. As a consequence of these cross-demands, Travelers instituted the present action for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\">Travelers in its complaint alleges that \u201cunder the laws of New York which govern the interpretation of its policy of insurance, that the policy exclusion which applies ... is a valid contractual agreement under the laws of the State of New York and that its policy of insurance does not afford protection to defendants Dolman and Robert Leston Button for the occurrence giving rise to the civil action brought by BABETTE T. DEBONA;</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The Travelers policy, a true and correct copy of which is attached to the \u201cSTIPULATION OF FACTS,\u201d in \u201cPart I-Liability\u201d provides that in addition to the named insured and any resident of the same household the coverage is extended to \u201cany other person using such automobile, provided the actual use thereof is with the permission of the named insured; ...\u201d \u201cExclusions\u201d applicable to Part I include, however, the following provision: \u201cThis policy does not apply under Part I; . . . (g) to an owned automobile while used in the automobile business, but this exclusion does not apply to the named insured, ...\u201d \u201cDefinitions\u201d under Part I include the following: \u201c\u2018automobile business\u2019 means the business or occupation of selling, repairing, servicing, storing or parking automobiles; . . . <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The trial judge correctly determined, in accordance with the weight of appellate decisions, that the 1963 Pontiac automobile was, at the time of the accident, not being \u201cused in the automobile business\u201d within the meaning of the exclusionary clause in the Travelers policy. The decisions relied upon by appellant to support its argument that this determination conflicts with controlling New York law fail to support its contention. A review of these decisions reveals that any apparent conflict between the jurisdictions is referable either to distinguishable facts or to exclusionary clauses phrased in language substantially different from that before this court. (See e.g., <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Exchange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1966) 49 Misc.2d 707 [268 N.Y.S.2d 495] ; <em>John F. Welgan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Government Emp. Ins. Co. </em>(1966) 49 Misc.2d 816 [268 N.Y.S.2d 700] ; <em>Piliero </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins.

Co., </em>33 Misc.2d 530 [227 N.Y.S.2d 226].)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\">The Supreme Court of Minnesota, in a persuasive decision which contains a comprehensive review of the relevant authorities, recently concluded with respect to an identical exclusionary clause that an automobile brought to a garage for parking or repair is not being used in the parking or automobile business. \u201cThe terms used in an insurance policy must be given their plain, ordinary, and popular meanings so as to effectuate the intention of the parties. [Citation.] Applying these rules to the language we have before us, we think the owner of this automobile would be quite astonished to learn that his car, while in the hands of the garage owner for repairs, was being used in the automobile business.\u201d <em>(Hammer </em>v. <em>Malkerson Motors, Inc. </em>(1964) 269 Minn. 563 [132 N.W.2d 174, 179].) Numerous authorities lend logical support to this conclusion. <em>(Western Alliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cox </em>(Tex.Civ.App., 1965) 394 S.W.2d 238 ; <em>McCree </em>v. <em>Jenning </em>(1960) 55 Wash.2d 725 [349 P.2d 1071] ; <em>Cherot </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(10th Cir. 1959) 264 F.2d 767 [71 A.L.R.2d 959] ; <em>American Fire </em>&amp; <em>Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Surety Indem. Co. </em>(1965) 246 S.C. 220 [143 S.E.2d 371] ; <em>Commercial Standard Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sanders </em>(Tex.Civ.App., 1959) 326 S.W.2d 298 ; <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

Co. </em>(La.App., 1965) 177 So.2d 790.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">\u201c\u2022 . . If the insurer would create an exception to the general import of the principal, coverage clauses, the burden rests upon it to phrase that exception in clear and unmistakable language. [Citation.] If this is not done any ambiguity or uncertainty is resolved in favor of the policyholder.  The courts will not sanction a construction of the insurer\u2019s language that will defeat the very purpose or object of the insurance. [Citations.] Indeed an exception must be couched in terms which are 1 clear to the ordinary mind\u2019 [citation]. . . .\u201d <em>(Osborne </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>155 Cal.App. 2d 201, 207 [318 P.2d 94].)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>According to the language of the clause presently under consideration, it is the business in which the car was being used rather than the business or occupation of the person using the car that constitutes the controlling factor. \u201c. . .  [0]rdinarily an automobile being driven from the place of business of the owner by a garage keeper to his garage for the purpose of making repairs requested by the owner is not being \u2018used in the automobile business\u2019 within the meaning of the present exclusion clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">\u201cThe . . . cases point out that an exclusionary clause of the type here involved refers to the use being made of the automobile and not to the occupation of the driver. The mere fact that the automobile is being driven at the time by one engaged in the automobile business is not conclusive. The use to which the vehicle is being put is the determining factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\u201c We are, therefore, primarily concerned with the application of the clause \u2018used in the automobile business.\u2019 The policy provides that \u2018automobile business means the business or occupation of selling, repairing, servicing, storing or parking automobiles. \u2019 To constitute such use, the vehicle must be employed for some purpose in connection with that business as defined. Whether an automobile is so used is an issue of fact, which must be determined with regard to the nature of the particular business and the circumstances surrounding the use at the time.\u201d <em>(American Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Surety Indem. Co., supra, </em>143 S.E.2d 371, 373.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Specifically, it has been determined that \u201c. . . a customer\u2019s automobile in the custody or possession of an automobile repairman who drives it for the purpose of testing the repairs which he has made is not being used in the automobile business within the meaning of the exclusion clauses in . . . [Travelers policy].\u201d <em>(Le Felt </em>v. <em>Nasarow, supra, </em>177 A.2d 315, 325.) Thus, both the legal authorities and the factual circumstances support the trial court\u2019s determination that Button\u2019s use of the car with Feigin\u2019s permission to road-test repairs and determine the need for additional service did not exclude the insured, the driver, or the driver\u2019s employer from coverage under the Travelers policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Appellant next contends that the additional ground upon which the trial court's decision relating to the inapplicability of the exclusionary clause rests, namely its finding that Button was Feigin\u2019s agent at the time of the accident, is erroneous and is inconsistent with the finding that the car was not being used in the automobile business. It is conceded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>the automobile was being driven by Button with Feigin\u2019s permissio<em>n </em>the further finding that Button was operating the car as Feigin\u2019s agent is supported by the facts and is not inconsistent with the determination that the car was not being used in the automobile business. (Cf., <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Exchange Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>268 N.Y.S.2d 495, 499 500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\">The question of agency is a factual determination and, depending upon circumstances, the driver of a vehicle may be the agent of the owner who is present in the vehicle. <em>(Flores </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>39 Cal.2d 622 [248 P.2d 922] ; <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Corti, </em>22 Cal.2d 454 [139 P.2d 645, 147 A.L.R. 861] ; <em>Glanville </em>v. <em>Cannick, </em>182 Cal.App.2d 514 [6 Cal.Rptr. 175].)  The employee of one party may become the agent of another with respect to a given transaction and the existence of an agency may be implied from the conduct of the parties. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Pacific Elec. Ry. Co., </em>55 Cal.2d 430, 438 [11 Cal.Rptr. 560, 360 P.2d 56].)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The trial court in the present case found that \u201cAt the time of the accident, Simon D. Feigin was an occupant of the automobile, with the power to control it and the position to govern the manner of its operation and to operate the automobile himself.\u201d As a result, the trial court found the existence of an agency between Feigin and Button.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">\u201cWhen it is claimed that the driver of an automobile is acting as the agent of his passenger, the crucial question to be determined is whether the latter has the right to control the former in the operation of the vehicle. [.Citation.]  If the car belongs to the driver, the mere fact that the trip may have been undertaken for the passenger\u2019s benefit is insufficient to establish that the passenger had the right of control. [Citation.]  Nor does the passenger have any right of control over his own car when the trip is undertaken for the driver\u2019s purposes and the passenger\u2019s presence is merely incidental. [Citation.]  However, when the passenger provides the ear and the driver is operating it for the passenger\u2019s own benefit, it has been held that the relationship of principal and agent exists as a matter of law. [Citations.] \u201d <em>(Glanville </em>v. <em>Cannick, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.2d 514, 517.) Clearly, under the circumstances of this case, it was a permissible inference that Button in operating the 1963 Pontiac acted as Feigin\u2019s agent to readiest the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The weight of persuasive authority supports the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the exclusionary clause in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Travelers 'contract and the evidence supports its findings that the 1963 Pontiac was, at the time of the accident, being driven by Button as the agent of Feigin, the named insured, and was not being used in the automobile business within the meaning of the Travelers policy. As a consequence, Travelers is primarily responsible to defend Civil Action No. SW C 7171. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The insurer agrees, in more detail, under the pertinent provisions of the policy issued to Simon D.
