Brown, son of my said son Charles Brown, the sum of twelve hundred dollars, to be paid to him by the executor of my said will, when he shall attain the age of twenty-one years.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-14\">Upon the death of Zephaniah the will and codicil were duly proved, on the 11th day of November, 1857, and the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>accepted the trust of executor, giving bond to pay debts and legacies ; and thereafter took possession under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-3\">The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was born November 15, 1840, and died in September, 1861. The plaintiff\u2019 was appointed administrator of his estate, and made demand on the defendant for the legacy, March 5, 1862. The will and codicil of Zephaniah Brown were referred to as a part of this case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-4\"><em>F. O. French, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\">The legacy given by the will of Zephaniah Brown to Hiram, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, was vested in Hiram at the death of Zephaniah. Payment only was postponed until Hiram should reach years of discretion; a provision which does not postpone the vesting of the legacy. 1 Jarm. on Wills 759. In <em>Furness </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>1 Cush. 134, the legacy was to one, \u201cif he shall arrive at the age of twenty-one, then to be paid over to him by my executorwhich was held to be not a contingent but a vested legacy. In <em>Cloberry </em>v. <em>Lampsen, </em>2 Ch. Cas. 155, S. C. 2 Freem. 24, A. gave B. \u00a3500 when she shall attain twenty-one, or be married, as shall first happen, to be paid with interest. B. having died before twenty-one, or marriage, a decree for its immediate payment was made; and the rule stated to be the same where legacy was without interest. S. P. <em>Stapleton </em>v. <em>Cheoles, </em>2 Vern. 673. In <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>2 P. Wms. 21, where a father gave \u00bf61000 to an infant, payable at twenty-one, the court saying \u201cthese being vested legacies,\u201d proceed to make provision out of the fund for the infant. In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>1 Ves. Sr. 217, legacy of \u00a36100 at death of mother: held vested legacy. The doctrine of these cases seems to be recognized in the recent decision of <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>41 N. H. 211.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-6\">In the ease at bar it is to be noted that the gift was from a grandfather to the only child of a deceased son, and that the legacy of $1200 was substituted for a devise of a farm to that son.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-7\">The assent of the executor is presumed in equity, if he has received assets. Story\u2019s Eq., sec. 540 (2); <em>Wind </em>v. <em>Jekyll, </em>1 P. Wms. 575. The same rule obtained from necessity in actions at law in this State. <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>6 N. H. 123. Having received property with notice, the defendant stands, like any trustee, charged with its application. 1 N. H. 217. It is contended that in case of residuary legatee giving bond under our statute, the representative character gives place to a strict trusteeship for creditors and legatees. Adams Eq. 251. In the light of cases not lately if ever questioned, this case seems to possess all the requisites of a vested and collectable legacy, and to stand outside of the realm of discussion and doubt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-8\"><em>Christie, </em>for the defendant. \u2022</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-9\">The defendant\u2019s position is, that the legacy sought to be recovered never vested, but, from the time of the death of the testator to that of the legatee, was contingent upon a condition precedent to its payment, namely, that the legatee should live to attain the age of twenty-one years; which condition, upon his death under that age, failed, and the legacy thereupon lapsed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Wills and bequests are to be construed and enforced according to the intention of the testator, and that intention is to be gathered from the whole language used. The material language in this case is, \u201cI give and bequeath to Hiram S. Brown the sum of twelve hundred dollars, to be paid to him, by my executor, when he shall attain the age of twenty-one years.\u201d Upon this language we submit and contend that the testator did not intend that this legacy should take effect and be paid to the legatee, or his representatives, unless he should live to attain the age of twenty-one years. The clause, \u201cto be paid when he shall attain the age of twenty-one years,\u201d was not intended simply and only to fix the time for the payment of said legacy, but to provide that it should never be paid if the legatee should not live to that age; and if he should, that then the legacy should be at once paid. See <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>14 Ves. 389; <em>Lester </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>1 Hare 10; <em>Stapleton </em>v. <em>Cheoles, </em>Pre. Ch. 317.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-5\">We are aware that the cases cited in the plaintiff\u2019s brief are against us, but we think the decisions in those causes contravened the intention of the testator, and are therefore wrong; and as we are not aware that, this doctrine has ever been adopted here, we pray the court to consider and decide the case upon principle rather than upon these or other such authorities.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b283-6\">Bellows, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afn\">The bequest being to the grandson of the testator, to be paid to him when he should attain the age of twenty-one years, and the legatee having died before that age, the question is whether his interest was vested or contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"An4\">is well settled that where the words of the bequest, which look to the future, apply to the substance of the gift, the vesting is suspended; but if they appear to relate merely to the time of payment, the legacy vests at once upon the death of the testator. In determining how this is, there is often great difficulty in ascertaining the will of the testator; but it appears to be an established rule-of construction, that if the bequest be of a sum of money to the legatee, \u201cat the age of twenty-one years,\u201d or, \u201cif or provided he-arrive at that age,\u201d then the interest is contingent, unless these terms are controlled by other parts of the will, such as a provision for the payment of the interest, in the mean time, to the legatee. On the contrary, where the gift is of a sum of money to the- legatee, \u201cpayable,\u201d or \u201cto be paid\u201d at the age of twenty-one, the legacy vests immediately, and, upon the legatee\u2019s death before that age, goes to his representative; and this is upon the ground that the testator intended the gift to be absolute, but chose to postpone the payment to a period when the legatee might better make use of his bounty^/</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">This distinction is established by a weight of authority too great to be shaken, and it may well be supposed that wills are made with reference to it, and it is decisive of the case before us.
