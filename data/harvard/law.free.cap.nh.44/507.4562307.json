I this day attached all the right, title and interest that the within named defendant has in or unto any lands, tenements and buildings, or real estate whatsoever, lying or being situated in the town of Hillsborough, in said county, and all the machinery or apparatus, movable or otherwise, in or about his buildings, used for the purpose of manufacturing coal, acid and tar, and all the wood and lumber in or about said works, by leaving at the\" dwelling-house of William B. Whittemore, town-clerk of said town, a true and attested copy of the within writ, with a like copy of this my return indorsed by me thereon, at 6 o\u2019clock and 10 minutes in the afternoon of said day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-10\">Charles Scott, Deputy Sheriff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-11\">The plaintiff did nothing to make an attachment, except to leave the copy with the town-clerk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-12\">Brown recovered judgment against Carter. His execution was put into the plaintiff\u2019s hands within thirty days after judgment, and the plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show that the machinery referred to in his return on the writ, <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>had, after the date of his return, gone into the possession of the defendants ; that the plaintiff, within said thirty days, having the execution in Ms hands, demanded the machinery of the defendants, who refused to give it up; that at the date of said return the retorts, weighing-several tons each, were set in brick work, in the town of Hills-borough, with fires under them, and iron pipe connecting them with the other machineiy, and after said date had been removed from Hillsborough to Manchester, and into the possession of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-13\">The court ordered a nonsuit, and, the plaintiff excepting, the questions were reserved.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-14\"><em>Briggs $ Teel, </em>and <em>Morrison, Stanley $ Clark, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI-\">cited <em>Fullam </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>30 Vt.443; <em>Perrin </em>v. <em>Leverett, </em>13 Mass. 130; <em>Ashmun </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>8 Pick. 404; <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Bellows, </em>7 N.

H. 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">If the articles are to be regarded as personal property, we think the return does not show a sufficient attachment. In <em>Lathrop </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>23 N. H. 59, the question whether machinery could be attached by merely leaving a copy of the writ and return with the town-clerk was left undecided.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Section 14 of chapter 184 of the Revised Statutes provides that \u201cthe officer attaching grain unthreshed, &amp;c., manufacturing or other machinery, &amp;c., may leave an attested copy of the writ and of his return of such attachment thereon as in the attachment of real estate; and in such case the attachment shall not be dissolved or defeated by any neglect of the officer to retain actual possession of the property.\u201d The provision is not that the attachment Inay be made, as in case of real estate, by leaving a copy. Rev. Stat., ch. 184, sec. 3; <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Bellows, </em>7 N. H. 427. Indeed, no attempt is made to change the mode of making the attachment, but a new and easier method of preserving it is provided. Before this statute there was not SO' much difficulty in making as in preserving attachments of the various articles enumerated in the 14th section of chapter 184. <em>Hemmenway </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>14 Pick. 410; <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>16 Pick. 144; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>2 Met. 38; <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Butterfield, 4 </em>Cush. 425; <em>Bicknell </em>v. <em>Trickey, </em>34 Me. 273; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>1 Met. 32. As the statute has only provided a new mode of preserving attachments of the articles specified, it is still essential to a valid attachment of them that they should be taken into the possession or placed under the control of the officer. <em>Odiorne </em>v. <em>Colley, </em>2 N. H. 66; <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, 2 </em>N. H. 318, 319; <em>Chadbourne </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>16 N. H. 132. In Maine a statute, providing that \u201cwhen any personal property is attached, which, by reason of its bulk, &amp;c., can not be immediately removed, the officer may, within five days thereafter, file in the office of the clerk of the town, &amp;e., an attested copy of so much of his return, &amp;c., and such attachment shall be as effectual and valid as if the property had remained in his possession and custody.\u201d The Maine statute (Rev. Stat., ch. 81, sec. 35), has received a similar construction. <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>36 Me. 370; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>18 Me. 238; see <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Fairbanks, </em>5 Met. 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The decisions in <em>Bucklin </em>v. <em>Crampton, </em>20 Vt. 261; <em>Fullam </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>30 Vt. 443, and <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>17 Vt. 82, were founded upon a statute differing somewhat from our own, as the Yermont statute enacts that \u201cwhen machinery, &amp;c., shall be taken by virtue of any writ of attachment, &amp;c., the officer serving such process shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>lodge a copy of the same with his return in the town-clerk\u2019s office, &amp;c., which shall be as effectual to hold such property against subsequent sales, &amp;c., as if such property had been actually removed and taken into the possession of such officer.\u201d Vermont Rev. Stat., ch. 18, sec. 15. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In the present case the officer does not return an attachment generally, but an attachment made by leaving a copy, &amp;c.; and this we think is insufficient.
