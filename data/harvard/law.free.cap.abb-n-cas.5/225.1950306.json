Chave, sole surviving administrator with the will annexed of James Espi\u00e9, deceased, and John L. Russell, Joseph T. Brown and Tabitha C. Smith, sureties on the bond of the said administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-12\">The foundation of the action was what was claimed to be a decree upon a final accounting before Surrogate Robert C. Hutching-s, in December, 1875, the last month in office of the said surrogate. The paper purporting to be the decree upon this accounting, was not signed, seen, or directed to be filed by said surrogate, but it appeared to have been indorsed \u201cfiled,\u201d by Stephen D. Yan Schaick, Esq., who at that time was the chief clerk in the said surrogate\u2019s office, and was also auditor to whom the accounts of said William Gr. 'Chave had been referred, and who succeeded said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Hutchings as surrogate. But there was no evidence to show by what authority he so marked the paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-5\">All the proceedings in said final accounting, up to the time when the aforesaid decree purported to have-been made, were had before said Surrogate Hutchings. This said decree was never signed by any surrogate until June 26, 1876, when Hon. Delano C. Calvin, then surrogate of New York county, signed it, and made a memorandum thereupon of the date of his signature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\">The counsel for the defendant, Joseph T. Brown, one of the sureties, claimed that this paper was no decree, inasmuch as it appeared that the accounting was had during the term of Surrogate Hutchings, and the auditor\u2019s report was filed before he went out of office, but the paper was signed by Surrogate Calvin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-7\">The case of Jennette E. Begg against the same defendants was decided at the same time, and the following opinion applied to both.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-8\"><em>Culver &amp; </em>Wright, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-9\"><em>Thomas H.

Pr. </em>366; 1 <em>L. </em>1870, p. 156, c. 74; <em>L. </em>1874, p. 602, c. 456.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b245-10\">Barrett, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amo\">In courts of record having equity jurisdiction, findings of fact and conclusions of law must be signed by the justice who tried the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">The decree is thereupon entered on his <em>fiat. </em>In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>surrogate\u2019s court the decree is signed by the surrogate, and entered in the minutes which he is directed to keep (2 <em>R. S. </em>221, \u00a7 7, subd. 4; <em>Laws </em>1837, ch. 460, \u00a7 21). In the act with respect to the surrogate\u2019s court in New York.city, the minutes of the surrogate are expressly recognized <em>(Laws </em>1870, ch. 359, \u00a7 11), and authority is given to make and enter all lawful orders and decrees <em>(Laws </em>1870, ch. 359, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"A3W\">In the case of Munro\u2019s estate (15 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>366), the surrogate said that the practice with respect to signing decrees had \u201cbeen long and surely settled. The original decree is the paper signed by the presiding officer of this court, written out in a sheet or sheets of paper. The record or minutes kept in pursuance of the provision of the revised statutes (3 <em>R. S. </em>[5th Ed.] p. 365, \u00a7 13, subd. 4), is the enrollment of the decree, which should conform to the original decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2q\">The statute evidently contemplates the actual signature of the surrogate to all papers of any importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The record of probate \u201c shall .be signed and certified by him\u201d (2 <em>R. S. </em>57, \u00a7 10). Every will so proved shall have a certificate of such proof indorsed thereon, signed by the surrogate, and attested by his seal of office (2 <em>R. S. </em>57, \u00a7 11). Letters testamentary, or of administration, or to a collector, shall be signed and sealed by him (2 <em>R. S. 80, </em>\u00a7 55). He shall indorse the discharge of any decree on the margin of the record thereof <em>(Laws </em>1867, ch. 782, \u00a7 9). Other instances might be added. In the present eases, the decrees were not signed by Surrogate Hutobxngs, nor is there any evidence of their entry. The minutes were not produced, nor was any record of the proceedings. There was not even an exemplification under 2 <em>R. S. </em>221, \u00a7 6. The plaintiffs simply rely upon an unsigned piece of paper, which without (so far as appears from the evidence) any authority from the surrogate, writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ten or even verbal, was indorsed \u201cfiled\u201d by a clerk. It is provided (2 <em>R. S. </em>360, \u00a7 11) that no judgment shall be deemed valid so as to authorize any proceedings thereon, until the record thereof shall have been signed and filed. In Goelet <em>v. </em>Spofford, <em>55 N. Y. </em>647, it was held that this provision does not apply to judgment rolls made up under section 281 of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">On the other hand, the latter section is inapplicable to surrogates\u2019 courts. But whether this section of the revised statutes is controlling or not, there can be no doubt that it is a strong legislative expression as to the invalidity of an unsigned judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The act of the clerk was entirely unauthorized. There is no proof that such clerk was, in writing, designated by an order of the surrogate duly filed and recorded <em>(Laws </em>1863, ch. 362, \u00a7 9). Even if such proof had been furnished, there is nothing in the act of 1863, much less in that of 1874 (ch. 456), authorizing him to file an unsigned decree, or otherwise validating it.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Nor was the matter helped by the signature of Surrogate Calvin. If the plaintiffs rely thereon as effecting an independent decree, the answer is that it was subsequent to the assignment of the bond and the commencement of this suit. If as completing the work of his predecessor, the answer is that there is no evidence that his predecessor ever had anything to do with it. But apart from that, chapter 9 of the <em>Laws of </em>1874 plainly limits this power of completion to the unfinished records of wills, proofs and examinations, and of letters testamentary, administration and guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The complaints must be dismissed with costs.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">There was no appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b247-10\"> After this decision, the matter was brought lip before Surrogate Calvin.
