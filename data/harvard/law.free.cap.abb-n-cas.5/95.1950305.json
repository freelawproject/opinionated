The complaint is bad on demurrer, because two causes of action have been improperly united, viz. : (1.) One arising on an alleged contract with Foster, as agent of the American Newspaper Union, and (2.) another arising on an alleged contract with Foster as agent of A. N. Kellogg\u2019s list. Any cause of action arising under the former, would not affect the defendant Kellogg, as proprietor of the Chicago list; nor would a cause of action arising under the latter, affect any defendant except such proprietor. It must appear upon the face of the complaint that all the causes of action united in the same complaint affect all the parties <em>(Code of Civil </em>Procedure, \u00a7 484, subd. 9). And this defect is alike fatal whether plaintiff seeks to sustain his complaint\" on a cause of action arising <em>ex contractu, </em>or <em>ex delicto, (a.) </em>If arising on contract. 1. That the alleged cause or causes of action arise <em>ex </em>contractu, and not <em>ex </em>delicto, is distinctly held in a recent similar case (Holtz <em>v. </em>Schmidt, 59 <em>N. Y. </em>257). 2. If so, it is such a joinder as is not permissible under section 484 of the Code, above cited, because such cause does not affect all the parties defendant according to the requirement of that section of the Code. The Code has not changed the rule established under the old practice, \u201c but now, as before, the causes of action to be joined must be in favor of all the plaintiffs, and against all the defendants, and must belong to the same class\u201d (Enos <em>v. </em>Thomas, 4 <em>How. Pr. </em>50; De Ridder <em>v. </em>Schermerhorn, 10 <em>Barb. </em>639, affirming Enos <em>v. </em>Thomas, supra, and citing many cases). (b.) If founded in tort. Granting that the alleged cause or causes of action arise <em>ex </em>delicto, and that the fraud and deceit suggested in the complaint are properly pleaded; the complaint is still open to the same objection \u2014 improper joinder of causes of action; for that a union of wrong-doers, as parties defendant, may be possible, \u201cthere must be some com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>munity in the wrong-doing among the parties who are to be united as co-defendants ; the injury must in some sense be their <em>joint </em>work\u201d <em>(Pomeroy\u2019s </em>Remedies, \u00a7 308, and cases cited). There are, therefore, two separate and distinct causes of action under the <em>ex delicto </em>theory, and the same fatal objection holds good \u2014 there is no allegation of community in the wrong-doing. The rule is the same, and the complaint is bad, whichever the theory, because of improper joinder of causes of action <em>(Code of Civil </em>Procedure, \u00a7 484, subd. 9).</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-5\">II. There is a defect of parties defendant, to wit: the original co-incorporators of the defendant, the New York Fewspaper Union, of which defendant Aikens is alleged to be one. 1. Organization under the statute referred to implies that there were three, at least, of the original'incorporators. Fo number less than three could effect an organization under the statute. The provision is \u201c three or more \u201d <em>(Laws </em>1848, ch. 40). 2. If one is liable as an incorporator, all are. 3. It is a matter of interest to each defendant that all liable be made co-defendants, that they may contribute to the defense and satisfaction of any judgment obtained by plaintiff. 4. The remaining coincorporators are presumed to be living unless the complaint shows the contrary <em>(Greenleaf on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 41). 5. And demurrer is the proper means of raising the question <em>(Code of Civil Pro. </em>\u00a7 488, subd. 6; Eaton <em>v. </em>Balcom, 33 <em>How. Pr. </em>80; Zabriskie <em>v. </em>Smith, 13 <em>N. Y. </em>336).</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-6\">III. Again, the complaint is radically defective in this. That it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Fo cause of action is stated in the complaint attaching to any of the defendants appearing, other than Kellogg and The American Fewspaper Union; for none of the defendants named can be held as parties to either of the contracts made by plaintiff with Foster as agent, unless it be Ansel F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Kellogg and The American Newspaper Union corporation. They alone appear respectively as parties of the second part of the supposed agreements. Moreover, The American Newspaper Union must be one thing or the other \u2014 a corporation or not a corporation. If it is a corporation, those composing it should not be made defendants ; it should be sued in its corporate name only. If it is not a corporation, it should not be sued in its corporate name, but in some other way, according to the nature of its <em>organization, </em>\u2014 e. <em>g., </em>if a partnership, by joining the copartners ; if an association, unincorporated, other than a partnership, according to its nature, \u2014 but in no case in the form adopted in this action. Such form is an <em>anomaly </em>in pleading, and without authority (Allen <em>v. </em>Patterson, 7 <em>N. Y. </em>476, 478; <em>Code of Civil Pro. </em>\u00a7 481, subd. 2).</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-5\">IV. Admission, by the demurrer, of facts alleged in the complaint is qualified, and is only an admission on the argument. It admits the facts if <em>well </em>pleaded, but it admits no mere statement of a conclusion of law. No importance attaches to the terms so often occurring in complaint: \u201cnot lawfully,\u201d \u201cunlawfully,\u201d \u201cfraudulently,\u201d \u201cexacted,\u201d and the like. They are insufficient, being conclusions of law merely. Such general allegations avail nothing. They are idle declarations, and not <em>\u201cconstitutive\u201d </em>under the new code (\u00a7 481, subd. 2). Butler <em>v. </em>Viele, 44 <em>Barb. </em>166; Lefler <em>v. </em>Field, 52 <em>N. Y. </em>622; Dubois <em>v. </em>Hermance, 56 <em>Id. </em>674.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-6\"><em>W. W. Mac Farland (O' Dwyer &amp; </em>Noonan, attorneys), for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b118-7\">Van Vorst, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVW\">In this action two causes are improperly united:</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">One growing out of an arrangement made with Foster as the agent of the American Newspaper Union, and the other as agent of \u201cA. N. Kellogg\u2019s List.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>There is no statement connecting \u201cKellogg\u2019s List,\u201d with the American Newspaper Union. For all that appears, they are entirely separate and distinct organizations. The American Newspaper Union is not liable for any damage incident to a breach of any agreement between plaintiff and Kellogg\u2019s List or its agent. In this cause the complaint is demurrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">I have already held, in the case of this same plaintiff against the American Newspaper Union and others, that the omission to make the original co-incorporations defendant is no valid objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">It is alleged to be a corporation. As such it was the representative of its incorporators in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">And for this reason I think it was improper to make the defendant, The New York Newspaper Union, a party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The allegation is, that the several corporations named constituted the \u201cAmerican Newspaper Union,\u201d of which Foster was agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">In that view, the redress of the plaintiff is in the first instance against that corporation. No cause of action is therefore stated against the New York Newspaper Union upon which the plaintiff could recover in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">There should be judgment in favor of the defendant demurring, with liberty to plaintiff to amend upon payment of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
