Supreme Court, First Department;</em></court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AqE\"><em>General Term, October, </em>1878.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b120-6\">Pleading. \u2014 Parties Plaintiff. \u2014 Demurrer to Complaint. \u2014 Code of Civ. Pro. \u00a7 448.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b120-7\">The fact that a partnership consists of more than forty members, residing in diSerent counties, does not authorize an action to be brought in the name of one of the partners, for the benefit of all. A <em>managing </em>partner has no legal right to bring an action in his own name for the recovery of an indebtedness to the copartnership.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-8\">Appeal by plaintiff from an order sustaining a demurrer to a complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-9\">This action was brought by Erastus Brainerd against Louis Gr. Bertram and others upon a promissory note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-10\">The defendant Bertram demurred to the complaint on the grounds that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action ; that there was a defect of parties plaintiff ; and that the plaintiff had not legal capacity to sue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-11\">The demurrer was sustained by the court at special term, on the following opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-12\">\u201cYak Yorst, J. \u2014 The plaintiff avers in his complaint, that Brainerds &amp; Co. are copartners ; that the members of the partnership are very numerous, to wit, more than forty in number ; that they reside in different countries, and that it is impracticable to bring them all before the court in this action, and that the plaintiff is the managing partner, wherefore he sues for the benefit of all the members.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-13\">\u201cThe fact that the plaintiff is the managing partner gives him no legal right to bring an action in his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>name for the recovery of an indebtedness to the co-partnership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-5\">\u201c The general rule is, that every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest <em>{Code, </em>\u00a7 111), except as provided in section 113. This section provides, that an executor or administrator, or a trustee of an express trust, or a person expressly authorized by statute, may sue without joining with him the person for whose benefit the action is prosecuted. But the plaintiff stands in no such relation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\">\u201c Section 119 provides, that those who are united in interest must be joined as plaintiffs, but when the parties are very numerous, and it may be impracticable to bring them all before the court, one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of the others. It is under this section, doubtless, that the plaintiff has ventured to bring this action in his own name. But I do not think that the plaintiff\u2019s case is of the character contemplated by the exception in the closing part of section 119. It is not impracticable to bring in, as plaintiffs, all the partners. And I think the defendant has the right to demand that those united in interest should be named as plaintiffs, and that they should take the responsibility of the litigation. The demurrer is sustained. But plaintiff is at liberty to amend upon the usual terms.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-7\">From the order entered thereon, the plaintiff appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-8\"><em>John </em>Hayes, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcA\">The second ground of demurrer is insufficient in not specifying the particular defect complained of (Skinner <em>v. </em>Stuart, 13 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>442; People <em>ex rel. </em>Lord <em>v. </em>Crooks, 53 <em>N. Y. </em>648; <em>Code of Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 448, 488, 490; <em>Code of Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 119, 122; Wallace <em>v. </em>Eaton, 5 <em>How. Pr. </em>99). The allegations of the complaint as to the character in which plaintiff sues are to be taken as admitted by the defendant demurring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>(Cutler <em>v. </em>Wright, <em>22 N. Y. </em>472); and being admitted, the plaintiff has clearly brought himself within the provisions of section 119 of <em>Code of Pro. </em>and has made out a <em>prima facie </em>cause of action. The plaintiff has legal capacity to sue (Le Page <em>v. </em>McCrea, 1 <em>Wend. </em>164; Chapin <em>v. </em>Clemitson, 1 <em>Barb. </em>311; Cunningham v. Littlefield, 1 <em>Edw. Ch. </em>104; Green v. Elmer, 8 <em>N. Y. </em>422; Briggs <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 Daly, 110, and cases cited; Myers <em>v. </em>Machado, 6 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>198). The provisions of the code are equally applicable to all manner of actions, whether legal or equitable <em>(Code of Pro. </em>\u00a7 69; Kirk <em>v. </em>Young, 2 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>453). Copartners can avail themselves of the provision (Jones <em>v. </em>Felch, 3 <em>Bosw. </em>66; McKenzie <em>v. </em>L\u2019 Amoreaux, 11 <em>Barb. </em>516); or any party united in interest with others, so numerous that it would be impracticable to bring them all in,\" or if brought in, to prevent the suit being continually abated by death or a change of interest (Smith <em>v. </em>Lockwood, 1 <em>Code R. N. S. </em>319; Wood <em>v. </em>Draper, 4 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>322; Bouton <em>v. </em>City of Brooklyn, 15 <em>Barb. </em>375; Roosevelt <em>v. </em>Varnum, 12 <em>How. Pr. </em>469; Towner <em>v. </em>Tooley, 38 <em>Barb. </em>598; Greene <em>v. </em>Breck, 10 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>42; Brooks <em>v. </em>Peck, 38 <em>Barb. </em>519; Habicht <em>v. </em>Pemberton, 4 <em>Sandf. </em>657). The exception to the general rule in the II. S. courts, that all persons interested must be made parties, is restricted to those whose interests are in the issue and to be affected by the decree (Cases cited above; and Mechanics\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Seton, 1 <em>Pet. </em>299, 306; Mandeville <em>v. </em>Riggs, 2 <em>Id. </em>482).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-5\"><em>Henry </em>Ferris, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKcZ\">The names of the parties should be set forth in the title or in the body of the complaint (Hill <em>v. </em>Thacter, 3 <em>How. Pr. </em>407; Stanley v. Chappell, 8 <em>Cow. </em>235). In stating the names of the parties it is not necessary to add any description (Sheldon <em>v. </em>Hoy, 11 <em>How. Pr. </em>15; Merritt <em>v. </em>Seaman, 6 <em>N. Y. </em>168). Section 119 of the Code of Procedure ap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>plies to cases where the parties are very numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court, and that fact should distinctly appear before the complaint can be upheld (Smith <em>v. </em>Lockwood, 13 <em>Barb. </em>218; Wood <em>v. </em>Draper, 4 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>322; Kirk <em>v. </em>Young, 2 <em>Id. </em>453). The plaintiff has not legal capacity to sue. (Russell <em>v. </em>Clapp, <em>7 Barb. </em>482; Bentley <em>v. </em>Jones, 4 <em>How. Pr. </em>202; McMurray <em>v. </em>Gifford, 5 <em>Id. </em>14; Parker <em>v. </em>Totten, 10 <em>Id. </em>233; Thomas <em>v. </em>Desmond, 12 <em>Id. </em>321; Freeman <em>v. </em>Fulton Fire Ins. Co., 14 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>407; Bank of Lowville <em>v. </em>Edwards, 11 <em>How. Pr. </em>216; Johnson <em>v. </em>Kimp, <em>Id. </em>186; Bank of Havana <em>v. </em>Wickham, 16 <em>Id. 97). </em>A cause of action is the right a party has to institute and carry through a proceeding (Meyer <em>v. </em>Van Collem, 28 <em>Barb. </em>231). Where it appears on the face of the complaint, that the subject of the action, though in possession of the plaintiff, is nevertheless the property of another, the complaint does not state a cause of action in the plaintiff (Palmer <em>v. </em>Smedley, 6 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>463; S. C., 28 <em>Barb. </em>468; People <em>v. </em>Booth, 32 <em>N. Y. </em>397; Myers <em>v. </em>Machado, 14 <em>How. Pr. </em>149; S. C., 6 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>198).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b123-5\">[The order of the special term was affirmed by the general term on the foregoing opinion of Vah Vorst, J.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
