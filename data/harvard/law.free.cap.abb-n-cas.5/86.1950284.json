Pr. </em>321; Leach <em>v. </em>Boynton, 3 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>1; Sherman <em>v. </em>Bushnell, 7 <em>How. Pr. </em>171), and it cannot be stricken out as sham (Thompson v. Erie R. R. Co., 45 <em>N. Y. </em>468.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel cites and relies much upon Kay <em>v. </em>Whittaker (44 <em>N. Y. </em>566), decided by the commission of appeals in September, 1871, and after the court of appeals had in the same year, in the cases of Wayland v. Tysen, and Thompson <em>v. </em>Erie R. R. Co. (45 <em>N. Y. </em>281, 468), held the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The case of Kay <em>v. </em>Whittaker goes much to sustain People <em>v. </em>McCumber (18 <em>N. Y. </em>315), which Judge Grover says, in Wayland <em>v. </em>Tysen, did not involve the point, and that it cannot be regarded as. an authority for the construction contended for, and the practice has since conformed to the latter case. Schultze <em>v. </em>Rodewald (1 <em>Abb. New Cas. </em>365), Fellows <em>v. </em>Muller (38 <em>N. Y. Super. Ct. </em>137), and Farmers\u2019 Nat. Bank of Fort Edward <em>v. </em>Leland (50 <em>N. Y. </em>673), appear to cover this case completely.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The motion must be denied ; but as it was sustained by Kay <em>n. </em>Whittaker, it is without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
