Tried before Judge \"Warren, May Term, 1849.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-8\">On the 12th March, 1822, a <em>ji.fa. </em>issued from Wilkes Superior Court, in favor of plaintiff in error, against Mary Sherburn and Charles Sherburn. On the 30th April, 1849, this <em>fi.fa. </em>was levied on a tract of land in Lee County, which was claimed by the defendants in error. On the trial, plaintiff in <em>fi.fa. </em>read in evidence a grant from the State to Charles Sherburn for the lot in dispute, dated 29th October, 1836.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-9\">The claimant showed a chain of title from Sherburn to himself, .and peaceable possession under the same, without notice, for more Qian, seven years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-10\">The only questions made in the Court below, and argued in this Court are, whether the Act of 19th December, 1822, which protects the title of a <em>Iona fide </em>purchaser, without notice, from a defendant in execution, after a definite period of time, can have a retroactive operation on judgments obtained before that Act. And whether, without that Act, the claimant is protected under the general Act of Limitations of 1767.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-11\">W. A.

If the claimant is not protected by the Act of 1767, against the lien of a <em>fi.fa. </em>issued before the 23d of December, 1822, still he may repose in confidence on the Act of the latter date. It is a Statute of Limitations, and protects real property from levy and sale, after seven years\u2019 possession, without actual no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>tice. There is no Constitutional difficulty in applying the Statute to the case under consideration ; the Statute only affects the remedy, and does not impair the obligation of contracts. <em>Jackson vs. Lampkin, </em>3 <em>Peters\u2019 R. </em>280. <em>Bronson vs. McKinzie, </em>1 <em>How.

No law is restrospective unless it <em>\u201cis to have an operation before the mdking thereof </em>\u2014 as <em>to commence at an antecedent time,\u201d </em>which is not the case here. <em>Calder vs. Bull, </em>3 <em>Dall. </em>386.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\"><em>By the Court. </em>\u2014</p>\n<author id=\"AkqX\">Lumpkin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aieq\">delivering the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\"><bracketnum>[1.]</bracketnum> The Legislature, in 1822, passed an Act, in which it was declared, \u201c That all judgments that <em>have </em>or may be rendered in any of the Courts of this State, on which no execution shall be sued out, or on which no return shall be made on the execution within seven years from the date of the judgment, shall be void and of no effect.\u201d <em>Dawson\u2019s Compilation, </em>209.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">This was the <em>third </em>section. It was further enacted by the <em>fourth </em>section, \u201c That no judgment should be enforced by the sale of any real or personal estate which the defendant may have sold and conveyed to a purchaser for a valuable consideration, and without actual notice of such judgment; <em>Provided </em>such purchaser, or those claiming under him, by such sale and conveyance, have been in peaceable possession of such real. estate for seven years, and of such personal estate four years, before the levy shall have been made thereon.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Will land which has been in the peaceable possession of the purchaser for a valuable consideration, without notice of the judgment, for thirteen years, under title from the defendant in execution, be protected under the fourth section of the Act of 1822, against a judgment rendered prior to its passage <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">If a text or pretext were wanting to write a <em>book, </em>a more pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>lific theme could not be desired than the subject of <em>retrospective Statutes. We </em>shall forego the temptation, and simply announce the judgment of this Court upon this vexed question.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The Superior Courts of the State having, under the <em>third </em>section of the Act of 1822, declared judgments and executions void, on which no return had been made for seven years preceding that date, the General Assembly, in 1823, repealed <em>this section, </em>and reversed the decision, by asserting that the judgments and executions thus pronounced void, were in as full force and effect as though the Act of 1822 had not been passed. \u25a0 <em>Dawson\u2019s Compilation, </em>214.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The fourth section of the Act, however, was left <em>untouched; </em>and it is under this that the present controversy arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\"><bracketnum>[2.]</bracketnum> And we are of the opinion that there is nothing to prevent the Legislative from fixing a time within which an existing judgment shall be enforced, as well as to pass any other Act of Limitations. Private justice, as well as public policy, authorize a period to be prescribed, to 'commence <em>in futuro, </em>in which rights \u00abhall be enforced, and to withhold the remedy after the lapse of \u25a0the appointed time. And this is no violation of the provision in the Constitution of the United States, which guards and protects the sacredness of contracts. The obligation of a contract is one thing \u2014 the remedy to enforce it, another. And while the former cannot be impaired, the latter may generally be left to the sound discretion of the Legislature. 3 <em>Dallas\u2019 (Penn.) R. </em>386. 7 <em>John. R. </em>447. 2 <em>Gallis\u2019 Cir. Ct. R. </em>105. 4 <em>Wheat. R. </em>122. 12 <em>Wheat. R. </em>349. 3 <em>Peters\u2019 R. </em>280.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">As was very properly remarked by the Court in the case last cited, cases may occur where the provisions of the law may be so unreasonable as to amount to a denial of a right, and to call for the interposition of the Courts. Such, however, is not the one under consideration. We think seven yeai's a reasonable time within which a judgment lien on land should be enforced; and that after the lapse of that period, a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser from the defendant should be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Finding no error in the judgment of the Superior Court, it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
