Tried before Judge Floyd, February Term, 1849.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\">George W. Martin, by bill filed in Pike Superior Court, alleged, that in January, 1841, he purchased of Tollesson T. Atkinson a tract of land lying in Pike county, for which he took a bond for titles, and in payment, made a deed to a tract of land in Dooly county, and gave his notes for $500, due December, 1842. Soon after the trade, Martin being about to place improvements on the land, it was levied on by <em>Ji. fas. </em>against Atkinson ; Martin then demanded a rescission of the contract-, but upon the promise of Atkinson to remove the incumbrance, and in the event the land was sold, to pay for all improvements, Martin proceeded to place improvements on the land to the value of $400 ; subsequently the land was sold under the <em>fi. fas. </em>and purchased by one Mangham, who sold to Neal, who re-sold to complainant for $400.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\">The bill prayed a reconveyance of the Dooly lot, the cancellation of the notes for $500, and a reasonable compensation for the improvements on the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-8\">Atkinson in his answer admitted the contract as alleged, denied the agreement to pay for the improvements, and insisted that Martin has suffered damage only to the amount paid to Neal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\">By a supplemental'answer, <em>(see 5 Ga. Rep.) </em>he denied that the Dooly lot was any part of the consideration of the land in Pike. On the trial, the complainant offered to prove, by witnesses who had seen a lot in Dooly county, its identity with the lot in dispute, from what was said by the neighbors and the tenant on the lot. The Court rejected the testimony, and complainant excepted..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-10\">John Neal testified, that out of kindness to'Marlin, he bought the land from Mangham, who purchased it at Sheriff\u2019s sale; he took the land at Mangham\u2019s bid \u2014 $245\u2014and sold it to Martin for $400 ; Mangham requested him not to deprive Martin of his home; there was no collusion to buy in the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-11\">Other evidence was before the jury, unnecessary to be repeated. The Court charged the jury, \u201c that they might give to the complainant redress for all the injury he had sustained by non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>compliance with the contract; that complainant had. alleged that he had purchased the land in Pike from defendant, and gave a lot in Dooly and notes for $500, but does not allege that he ever paid the notes. He further alleges that the land in Pike was afterwards levied on and sold by virtue of an execution against the defendant; that he has made large and valuable improvements, and prays a rescission of the contract. It turns out that upon the sale of the land in Pike by the Sheriff, the complainant is permitted to retain the land upon paying Mr. Neal a certain sum of money. We are called on to do equity between these parties ; you will inquire into the question of the consideration, and particularly, whether the complainant has paid for it, and so frame your decree as not to compel the defendant to pay for the loss of title to land for which complainant may not have paid. If you believe he has never paid the purchase money, you may decree the amount of injury he may have suffered to be credited on the notes given for the land, and if the injury was 'sufficient to cover the whole of the notes, you may decree that they be delivered up to be cancelled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">To this charge complainant excepted, and the questions made upon it in this Court were\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">1st.

This <em>implies </em>that in such a case as laying by and concealing title, the occupant might get pay, as well as where there was; a <em>special contract therefor. </em>But at best, it is a mere <em>negative </em>opinion or proposition: \u201c there is <em>no </em>adjudged\u201d case that he can. This may be true that there is no case that he can, yet we apprehend that it is equally true that there is <em>no adjudged case that he cannot.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\">In speaking of the reason of the passage of the Statutes in several of the States on this subject, he says : \u201c There were, however, peculiar and pressing circumstances which were addressed <em>to the equity of </em>the law given, and led to their passage.\u201d <em>lb.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-7\"><em>\u201c </em>No man ought to be entitled to it unless he entered and improved, in a case which appeared to him, after diligent and faithful inquiry, to be free from suspicion.\u201d <em>lb.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-8\">Judge <em>Story </em>in 2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. </em>\u00a7799, <em>b, </em>says : \u201c It has been sometimes <em>thought, </em>that as a matter of <em>justice, </em>Courts ought to go further, and in favor of a <em>bona fide </em>possessor of lands whose title is defective, decree compensation for the improvements put on in good faith against the true owner who asserts his title to it.\u201d \u201c But Courts of Equity have <em>never </em>gone to this extent, but have simply confined themselves to the administration of <em>the equity </em>in cases where their aid has been invoked by <em>the owner </em>in support of <em>his </em>equitable claims.\u201d \u201c They have <em>never </em>enforced, in a direct suit by the <em>bona fida possessor, 7ds </em>claim to meliorations,\u201d &amp;c. This appears also to be a mere <em>negative opinion, </em>but it <em>impliedly </em>goes a little farther than Chancellor <em>Kent.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-9\">Chancellor <em>Walworth </em>in <em>Putnam vs. Ritchie, </em>6 <em>Paige, </em>390, 405, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>says : <em>\u201c </em>This principle of <em>natural equity is </em>constantly acted upon in this Court, &amp;c. &amp;c. I have not been -able to find <em>any </em>case, however, in England or this country, wherein the Court has assumed jurisdiction to give relief to a <em>complainant </em>who has made improvements upon land, the legal title to which was in defendant, <em>where there has </em>been neither <em>fraud </em>nor <em>acquiescence </em>on the part of the latter, after he has knowledge of his rights,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\">Now this <em>implies </em>that there <em>are </em>cases giving the occupant redress in cases <em>o\u00ed fraud </em>and <em>acquiescence. </em>But still it, too, appears <em>negative. </em>That there is no case that he <em>can, </em>is not equivalent to a case that he <em>cannot.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-6\">It is clear that he could, by the Civil Law, and by the laws of those countries deriving their jurisprudence from it. <em>See Inst.

They have gone so far as to allow compensation to the occupant for his improvements, against the owner, whenever he sued, or there was <em>fraud </em>on his part, or <em>acquiescence </em>by him, after knowledge of his rights. 6 <em>Paige, </em>390, 405, <em>sup. </em>200. It does not appear to have ever been <em>decided affirmatively </em>that <em>he </em>couldnot, whenever he, theimprover, sued therefor; and where, we ask, is the difference in principle between a plaintiff and defendant, as to the equity? If it lies in favor of a defendant for defence, when sued, why would it not equally lie on a bill by him therefor ? It would appear that in principle, there is no difference. <em>See opinion of Supreme Court by Nisbet, J. in case of Davis et. al. vs. Smith et. al. 5 Ga. R. </em>288, \u20199. But we do not contend for the doctrine in its fullest extent, and we think there are many reasons for its limited restriction. Perhaps the cases show its full extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>which is asserted in <em>Putnam vs. Ritchie, </em>that it holds good in all cases of <em>fraud </em>or <em>unreasonable acquiescence.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-5\">But to return from this discussion to our case.

The bill is filed by the <em>bona fide </em>occupant of lands, of which he has been evicted by the laches of the defendant, his vendor, i. e. by execution against his vendor, for the cancellation of the notes given for the purchase thereof, and recovery of the amount paid as a deposit, (the Dooly lot,) and as ancillary to this relief, pay or compensation for improvements put on the land, in good faith, under a contract therefor. \"Will the bill lie ? It was once demurred to and the demurrer overruled. Still, if proven, will relief be granted, and on what terms? The Court below held, that the bill would lie, and would have allowed a re-coupment of all moneys paid on the notes; but as the terms of this relief, held plaintiff to payment of the notes first. Did he err? fie charged the Jury, in substance, that plaintiff could not recover till he paid the notes, and if the amount he paid on the re-purchase did not cover the notes, to <em>credit </em>them. We contend he erred, and shall endeavor to maintain the following positions \u2014 remarking first, that the Judge appears to have passed, intentionally, the most important, and almost the only question or issue in the case over in silence \u2014 I allude to the question of paying for improvements. The bill alleges them to he worth $400, and proves it, and most of the proof is to that issue, yet His Honor seems to disregard it altogether ; at all events, he held that we could not recover it till we paid the notes:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-9\">Isi <em>Position or Point. </em>\u2014 If A sells lands;to B, and takes his notes for the purchase money, and the land is afterwards sold under ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ecution against Mm for A\u2019s debts, and B evicted, the contract is rescinded and the notes avoided \u2014 their consideration has wholly and totally failed. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>87. <em>Chitty on Contracts, </em>307, 311. 2 <em>Wheat.

Where the action is for breach of covenant, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>quiet enjoyment, the measure of damages is the purchase money, with interest. This has been settled by this Court. <em>Davis et al. vs. Smith et al. 5 Ga. Rep. </em>285. Numerous cases could be here cited, but this case is so clear that it would be presumption in me to attempt to strengthen it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-5\">But the plaintiff takes the ground, that this suit is for the recovery of the value of work done on the premises, which the defendant promised he would pay in the event of an ouster. This is in the nature of a covenant against incumbrances, and must be governed by the same rule. The measure of damages, in such cases, is the amount paid by the vendee to remove the incumbrance. See <em>Prescott vs. Trueman, </em>4 <em>Mss. R. </em>627. <em>Wyman vs. Ballard, </em>12 <em>Mss. R. </em>304. <em>Chappell vs. Bull, </em>17 <em>Mss. </em>221. The same rule holds in New York.

This bill cannot, consistently with the authorities, claim more than the amount of damage <em>actually </em>sustained, and in this case the amount paid to remove the incumbrance is the amount.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\"><em>By the Court. </em>\u2014</p>\n<author id=\"AFs\">Lumpkin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQd\">delivering the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Martin filed his bill against Atkinson, alleging that he purchased of defendant a tract of land in Pike County, for which he gave him a lot in Dooly, No. 247, 2d District, and his notes for $500 ; that he took a bond for titles, and' went into possession; that shortly thereafter an execution against Atkinson was levied on the land, whereupon he applied to have the contract rescinded ; but upon being assured by the vendor, that the incumbrance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>should he removed, and that if he lost the land he should he fully remunerated for all the improvements which he might put upon it, he proceeded to clear ground and erect houses, and made other permanent and beneficial improvements on the premises, to the value of $400; that the land was again levied on and sold, under and by virtue of the lien which was outstanding at the time of the contract, and bought by one Mangham, at and for the sum of <em>$245; </em>that he was evicted by the Sheriff, and possession given to Mangham; that subsequently Mangham sold to Neal and Neal to complainant. The prayer of the bill is, that the notes given in payment may be cancelled, the Dooly land re-conveyed, and compensation made for the improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The original answer substantially admitted all the charges in the bill, except as to the agreement respecting the improvements. Afterwards, the defendant having obtained leave, amended his answer, and denied that the transfer of the Dooly land constituted any part of the price given for the tract in Pike; but stated that it was conveyed on other and distinct considerations altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\"><bracketnum>[1.]</bracketnum> During the progress of the trial, witnesses were introduced by the complainant, to prove the identity of the lot of land in Dooly County, by what they heard the neighbors and one Brown, the occupant, say, which evidence was rejected by the Court on the ground that it was <em>hearsay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Ancient boundaries, corners and station trees cannot, generally, be established otherwise than by reputation. Hence, this species of evidence is admissible for this purpose, from the necessity of the case. 2 <em>Pitt. </em>159. But this case does not fall within the rule. There was obviously higher and better evidence of the identity of the land in the power of the party, and therefore, that tendered was properly rejected. 12 <em>Vermt. </em>178. 24 <em>Pick. </em>71. 5 <em>Watts &amp; Serg. </em>60. 1 <em>Strobhart, </em>246.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">These pleadings present rather a novel question, which we will forbear to discuss, inasmuch as it is unnecessary to do so. The original answer admits, distinctly, that the lot of land in Dooly made a part of the price of the Pike tract. The amended answer expressly denies that it did, and states that the previous acknowledgment was made by mistake. Which is <em>the answer </em>of the defendant ? Both, or the latter as amended <em>1 </em>May the <em>last </em>statement be discredited by the <em>first </em>? Or does it still require two wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>nesses, or one and corroborating circumstances, to disprove the answer <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">After the testimony had closed, the Court charged the Jury, in substance, that the contract between Martin and Atkinson was still subsisting, and that'they might set off against the notes which he gave for the land, the amount of injury he had sustained; intimating that if he had bought the land from Neal for less than he was to pay Atkinson, that he was not damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\"><bracketnum>[2.]</bracketnum> In the opinion of this Court, the sale by the Sheriff was an eviction in law, and vacated the contract. Nor was the $400 paid by Martin to Neal the proper measure of damage for tho injiiry done to Martin. Indeed, it had nothing to do with the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\"><bracketnum>[3.]</bracketnum> Whenever a vendee, in order to protect his title, takes up an outstanding incumbrance, he is entitled only to be refunded the amount paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\"><bracketnum>[4.]</bracketnum> But when the property is, <em>bona fide, </em>sold under a mortgage or judgment lien, existing at the time of the contract, without fraud or contrivance on the part of the vendee, and the vendee re-purchases, the price which he pays is no criterion whatever of the damage sustained. Suppose Neal or Mangham had <em>given </em>the land to Martin, would that have relieved Atkinson from his liability <em>1 </em>What right has he to profit by the good fortune of the other party ? Then, on the other hand, suppose Martin had seen fit to give $1000 to retain the land, surely Atkinson would not have had to bear the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\"><bracketnum>[5.]</bracketnum> As to the right of Martin to recover compensation for the value of the improvements which he put upon the land, over and above the rents and profits while he occupied it, it would seem to be founded on the clearest principles of equity. Atkinson got the benefit of these improvements \u2014 what justice would there be in not making him pay for them <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
