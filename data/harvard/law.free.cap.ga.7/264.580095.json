This deed recited, that \u201c Whereas, in obedience to a writ <em>o\u00ed fieri facias, </em>issued out of the Justices\u2019 Court of the County of Newton, at the suit of Isaac Benham against Jesse Morrow, Alfred Livingston, former Sheriff of the County aforesaid, did lately seize the lot or parcel, of land,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-10\">This deed was objected to\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-11\">1st.

The lot of land was sold by Livingston, under execution, while in office, who failed to execute a title to the purchaser. Smith, the successor of Livingston, executed a deed to the purchaser after coming into office. It is said Livingston\u2019s successor could not do this without an order of Court. The 48th section of the Judiciary Act of 1799, answers the objection. By that section of the Act it is declared, \u201cthat the succeeding Sheriff <em>shall make titles to the purchasers for all property sold under execution and not conveyed by his predecessor. Prince, </em>431.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">The Act is <em>mandatory </em>in its terms, and an order of the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>could not enlarge or increase the duty and obligation of the succeeding Sheriff, to make a title to land sold by his predecessor to the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><bracketnum>[2.]</bracketnum> The next objection to the Sheriff\u2019s deed being read in evidence is, that it is invalid, inasmuch as it recites that the former Sheriff <em>seized </em>and sold the land under a Justice\u2019s Court <em>Ji. fa. </em>and that a Sheriff has no authority to seize property under a Justice\u2019s Court <em>fi. fa. </em>By the 18th section of the Act of 1811, Constables are authorized to levy Justice\u2019s Court <em>fi. fas. </em>upon land, and deliver over the same to the Sheriff of the County, with a return of the property levied on, who shall proceed to sell the same, with such formalities as are prescribed for the sale of real estates. <em>Prince, </em>506.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">When a Justice\u2019s Court execution hasbeen duly levied on land, and delivered over to the Sheriff, according to the provisions of the Statute, the Sheriff is <em>lawfully seized </em>of the same, for all the purposes of making sale thereof. The seizin of the Sheriff necessarily results from the operation of law, to enable him to sell the property and convey the title to the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\"><bracketnum>[3.]</bracketnum> The third objection is, that the loss of the Justice\u2019s Court <em>fi. fa. </em>under which the land was sold, was not sufficiently accounted for to dispense with its production on the trial. Did the evidence on the trial establish a <em>reasonable presumption </em>of the loss of the instrument <em>% </em>We think that it did, according to the rule established by this Court, in <em>Doe ex dem. Vaughn vs. Biggers, </em>6 <em>Ga. Rep. </em>194.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u2022 The Magistrate\u2019s docket of the district in which Morrow, the defendant in execution, lived previous to the date of the deed, was exhibited to the Court, which contained three cases against Morrow in favor of Benham, in which judgments had been entered and executions issued; there were two <em>fi.fas. </em>shown, neither of which had a levy of the land upon it. It was also shown by Williamson and Clark, that they had made search in the Clerk\u2019s and Sheriff\u2019s offices, and could not find the other <em>fi.fa.-, </em>that they had also called on the Magistrates who entered the judgments, and also the Bailiff, who lived in the district in which the land is situate, and the Sheriff in office at the'time of the .sale of the land, without success. Reasonable diligence was shown by the plaintiffbelow, to find the paper, by examining the places where, by <em>legal </em>presumption, it might be deposited, if in existence, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>out being able to learn any thing of it, -which, in our judgment, afforded a <em>reasonable </em>presumption of its loss or destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Let the judgment of the Court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
