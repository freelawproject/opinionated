That on the 21st day of September, 1952, the said Roy Hayes, minor son of the plaintiff, took and operated the said automobile of the plaintiff without the permission and/or consent of the plaintiff, either expressed or implied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-13\">\u201c10. That at the time and place of taking the said automobile the said Roy Hayes had no intention of permanently depriving his mother, the plaintiff herein, of the possession of or title to said automobile but did intend temporarily to deprive her of the possession thereof, and that while so driving and operating said motor vehicle without the consent, permission, authorization and/or approval of the plaintiff, either expressed or implied, the said automobile was wrecked as aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-14\">As its conclusion of law the trial court found that \u201cThe taking of said automobile by the said minor . . . constituted a theft within the meaning of the policy of insurance ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-15\">The trial court then awarded plaintiff the sum of $1,545.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-16\">Ordinarily the question as to whether or not a vehicle was used with the permission of the owner is one of fact, to be determined by the trial court. <em>(Mize </em>v. <em>Jorden, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 301 [253 P.2d 702]; <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Fortune, </em>78 Cal.App.2d 922 [179 P.2d 99].)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>The trial court is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses, and if there is any substantial support for a finding such finding will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>(Flemmer </em>v. <em>Monckton, </em>73 Cal.App.2d 271 [166 P.2d 380].)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Appellant here makes no attack on the findings of fact with respect to the unauthorized use of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile by her minor son. However, appellant does attack the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the son\u2019s unauthorized use of his mother\u2019s automobile constituted a theft thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Definition of Theft</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">\u201cEvery person who shall feloniously steal, take, carry, lead or <em>drive away </em>the personal property of another ... is guilty of theft ...\u201d <em>Penal Code, section 484.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">\u201cGrand theft is theft committed in any of the following cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-9\">\u201c1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-10\">\u201c2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-11\">\u201c3.

It is a word generally and commonly used and understood to convey the same meaning as the word \u2018steal.\u2019 To \u2018steal\u2019 is to commit a \u2018theft\u2019 in the usual and ordinary acceptation of the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">\u201cIn order to have a \u2018theft\u2019 something must be stolen by a thief.

Co., </em>108 Cal.App. 290, 291 [291 P. 698],</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">\u201c. . . the test of law to be applied to these circumstances for the purpose of determining the ultimate fact as to the man\u2019s guilt or innocence is, Did he intend to permanently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>deprive the owner of his property <em>\u00cd </em>If he did not intend so to do, there is no felonious intent, and his acts constitute but a trespass.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>105 Cal. 66, 69 [38 P. 518].</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Minority View</p>\n<p id=\"Agy\"><em>District of Columbia </em>(Municipal Court of Appeals)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">\u201c. . . a youth (sic) of the age of three and one-half years entered the car so parked and caused it to start down the hill . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">\u201ca child under seven years of age is held incapable of forming a criminal intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">\u201cHere . . . there is nothing from which we may infer a specific intent to deprive the owner of the automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">\u201cTo one who is a scholar and familiar with the history of the barbaric tribe whose depredations perpetuated its name in our dictionaries, to one \u2018skilled in the niceties of language\u2019, the point (no evidence of intentional injury) may have weight.\u201d <em>Unkelsbee </em>v. <em>Homestead Fire Ins. Co., </em>(D.C.Mun.App.) 41 A.2d 168, 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Two of the judges of this court held that the owner should recover from the insurance company because the child\u2019s \u201cacts were the proximate cause\u201d of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">The only discussion of the subject of theft is found in the dissenting opinion in which the following appears: \u201cI am unable to agree with the majority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">\u201cThe word \u2018theft\u2019 when used in a policy of this type is not to be confined in its meaning to the common-law definition of larceny, but ... it is not to be given a meaning contrary to the understanding of the word in common speech and thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">\u201cNo one, in my opinion, would say or think that the action of the child . . . was even akin to the common conception of theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-13\">\u201cI see no reasonable basis for holding that the collision was caused by theft within any meaning of the word, and I understand the majority to agree with me in this view.\u201d <em>Idem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-14\">\u201cThe reasoning of this New York case, and of others so holding, (against theft) is based upon the theory that in common thought and common speech theft means a taking and carrying away of the property of another with intent permanently to deprive the owner of his property and nothing more. This is at best a legalistic misconception. The common thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>and common speech meaning of theft is that which prevails, not among lawyers and judges, but among people (who) . . . have never heard of this old common-law definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">\u201cIt is true . . . that the numerical weight of authority is opposed to the position which we take. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Pennsylvania Indem. Fire Corp. </em>v. <em>Aldridge, </em>73 App.D.C. 161 [117 F.2d 774, 133 A.L.R. 914],</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">\n<em>Colorado</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">\u201cIt should be observed that the title of the law of 1919 is an act relating to and concerning \u2018the theft of automobiles.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">\u201cWe do not regard the law of 1919 (taking an automobile for temporary use) as making an essential change in the offense. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">\u201cThe word .\u2018theft\u2019 has a very general meaning, and we are of the opinion that . . . the act in question should be held to have been a theft for the purpose of this suit.\u201d <em>James </em>v. <em>Phoenix Assur. Co., </em>75 Colo. 209 [225 P. 213].</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">\n<em>Kansas</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">\u201cWhen we reflect that . . . the meaning of . . . recovering stolen automobiles are so efficient, the likelihood of the owner of it permanently deprived of it through trespass, theft, larceny or otherwise is so remote that it would scarcely be worth an owner\u2019s while to insure his car against \u2018theft\u2019 if the policy would only cover a ease where he is permanently deprived of it ... in the common practice of automobile thieves there is no intention of depriving the owner of it permanently . . . (but to) abandon it before the peril of his incriminating possession of it leads to his undoing.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co. </em>155 Kan. 26 [122 P.2d 710, 712].</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\"><em>New York </em>(County Court)</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">This is an opinion of the trial court in Erie County, New York, in which the trial court took cognizance of the rule established by the New York Supreme Court but, because the jury found that the taking of the automobile was a theft, this trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-14\">\u201cSeven years have elapsed since that pronouncement.\u201d (Van <em>Vechten </em>v. <em>American Eagle Fire Ins.

Co., </em>142 Misc. 654 [256 N.Y.S. 300, 301.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-3\">Manifestly the great weight of authority is in support of the holding that a mere temporary use, although unauthorized, where there is no intent permanently to deprive the owner of his property, does not constitute theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Since plaintiff may recover only if her automobile were damaged as a result of theft we need not consider any of the other points discussed in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Hilliard, J., and Coughlin, P.
