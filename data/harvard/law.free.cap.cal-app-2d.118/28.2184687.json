Manufacturing Company, a corporation, with the intent to commit theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Following entry of a plea of not guilty, the cause proceeded to trial before a jury, resulting in a verdict finding defendant guilty as charged, and fixing the offense as burglary of the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied. Proceedings were ordered suspended and defendant was granted conditional probation. From the order denying his motion for a new trial defendant prosecutes this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Epitomizing the factual background surrounding this prosecution, we find in the record testimony by Sydney Rubin, secretary and treasurer of the Z.M.R. Manufacturing Company, that the business of this corporation was located on a portion of the' third floor of a seven-story building at 224 East 11th Street, in the city of Los Angeles. That there was a large double door which was the main entrance, with two smaller and swinging doors on each side. That the building had a stairway and the front elevator was automatic after 6 p. m. The entrance to the manufacturing company\u2019s premises on the third floor was off a hallway. That there was a wooden frame double door which had three locks.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">This witness testified he was the last person to leave the company\u2019s premises on the evening in question. That he departed about 5 p. m. and locked up the premises. That his company was engaged in the business of manufacturing ladies\u2019 and misses\u2019 coats and that a stock of such garments was maintained on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">Lyle L. Sandlin, a Los Angeles City police officer, testified that on the night here in question he was near the aforesaid building, was in uniform, and stationed at the southeast corner of 11th and Santee Streets. That just prior to 7 p. m. (it was still daylight and the sun was shining) he observed defendant seated on the driver\u2019s side of his automobile parked at the curb and headed west on 11th Street on the opposite side thereof from 224 East 11th Street. That he was about 150 feet from the vehicle. The witness observed a man run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>out of the main entrance of the building with an armful of ladies\u2019 coats. This man ran to the rear of defendant\u2019s automobile; at about the time he reached it, defendant got out, opened the trunk and the other person threw the garments inside. Defendant slammed the cover down. A red sleeve of one of the coats stuck out from under the. trunk lid. Defendant raised the lid, shoved the coat sleeve in again, slammed the door down and got into the driver\u2019s side of the automobile. In the meantime, the other person ran back across the street and reentered the building. The placing of the coats in the trunk and the closing of the trunk took place very rapidly. After defendant got back in his automobile he started the motor, drove west 35 or 40 feet to an alley, made a U-turn and came back and parked directly in front of 224 East 11th Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The officer started to walk across the street toward where defendant was. The latter looked in the officer\u2019s direction then looked in the direction of the main entrance of the building \u201cand made a negative shake of his head and a motion with his hand. . . . Shaking his head from side to side in a negative manner while looking in the direction of the doorway of this building, then made this hand motion in the negative manner.\u201d (Swinging his hand from side to side with the palm up towards the entrance of the building).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">After about two minutes, defendant drove the automobile toward the officer at a slow rate of speed. The officer was about 30 to 40 feet from the automobile when it started to move. Defendant was about 25 or 30 feet away from the entrance when the officer told him to stop the automobile. The officer directed defendant to get out of the automobile on the passenger side, which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The officer instructed defendant to open the trunk of the automobile. Defendant walked to the rear of the automobile, took a key from among the keys on his key ring and opened the trunk. This was after some urging by the officer and after trying several keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">When the trunk of the automobile was finally opened the officer observed the coats therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Concerning what thereafter transpired, the officer testified, \u201cI looked at the defendant. The defendant looked at me. I looked at the defendant. The. defendant looked at me, I didn\u2019t say anything. And the first words he said to me\u2014 he spread his hands with the palms open, up like this, and he says, \u2018Well, you have got me.\u2019 He says, \u2018let\u2019s go.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>While waiting the defendant toward the sidewalk the officer inquired. \u201cWho is your buddy up in the building?\u201d to which the former replied, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give you the time of day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Shortly thereafter, the officer observed the person who had put the coats into defendant\u2019s ear running very fast out the small door farthest from the officer and defendant towards an alley, headed west on 11th Street. The officer and defendant were about 25 or 30 feet east of the main entrance of the building. The officer put further questions to defendant as to who this individual was but could get no answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">At the request of the officer, a passing pedestrian put in a telephone call for \u201chelp,\u201d resulting in the arrival of other officers and the aforesaid Mr. Rubin. The latter accompanied the police up to the premises of the manufacturing company. The double door that opened into the premises had been tampered with. \u201cThe door was slammed through. The two Yale locks were snapped. It was pushed in. The double-bar lock was broken and hanging to one side of the door with part of the jamb from the other side of the door hanging to the lock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">An inventory taken on the following morning disclosed that 14 coats were missing from the premises. At the trial Mr. Rubin identified a coat found in defendant\u2019s automobile as one of the missing articles of merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Sworn as a witness in his own behalf, defendant testified that on the day in question he stopped at a market to get some cigarettes. That when he returned to his automobile he was accosted by a man whom he had previously seen and spoken to in that neighborhood but whose name he did not know. That when the latter asked defendant to drive him \u201cdown town\u201d and that he would \u201cgive you (defendant) a couple of bucks to get you some gas,\u201d the defendant agreed to do so. That his passenger directed him to a location and asked him to \u201cwait a minute\u201d across the street from 224 Bast 11th Street. Defendant testified that he saw the police officer standing in a filling station on the corner of 11th and Santee Streets as he approached the place where his passenger directed him to stop. That the man left the automobile, walked into the building and after five or ten minutes emerged therefrom with an armful of coats. That this man asked him to open the automobile trunk, which he did, and the. coats were deposited therein. That the man asked him to turn his automobile around and stop in front of the building because there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>a few more pieces to get and then they would leave. Defendant testified that he made the U-turn when he observed the officer approaching; that his automobile \u201cmay have crept towards\u201d the officer because defendant had released pressure on the brakes. That the officer approached the automobile, \u201cstuck his head in the door, saying, \u2018I got you.\u2019 \u201d That the officer directed him to open the trunk of the automobile, that one of the coats mnst have been caught in the lock inasmuch as defendant had to twist the key continuously to get the lock open. Defendant testified that he was apprehensive lest the officer might harm him because of the delay in getting the trunk lock open. That he asked the officer to wait a minute and the latter said he had defendant \u201cwith the goods.\u201d Defendant denied he made any signals with his hands bnt that he held them \u201cstraight up,\u201d palms open, because he feared the officer might shoot him. That the officer asked him who his \u201cbuddy\u201d was in the building. That he replied he did not know the person\u2019s name and inquired of the officer why the latter did not wait there and intercept him. That the officer said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know a damn thing. You don\u2019t even know the time of day.\u201d On cross-examination defendant denied that the person he transported in his automobile said to him, \u201cDo you want to make a fast buck?\u201d but said only, \u201cI will give you a couple of bucks to get you some gas.\u201d However, on reeross-examination defendant admitted he had a conversation with Officer Billingsley on November 5th, and when asked whether, in that conversation, he did not state that the man he picked up asked him, \u201cif you eared to make a fast buck,\u201d replied, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think I did, because I was frightened. I don\u2019t know. I may have.\u201d Officer Billingsley, however, testified positively on rebuttal, that in the aforesaid conversation, defendant told him, \u201cthat the person he picked up at Central and Adams asked him if he wanted to make a fast buck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The principal attack upon the judgment of conviction herein is that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict. In that regard appellant asserts that \u201cthere is not one scintilla of evidence in the record to indicate a conspiracy or knowledge on the part of the appellant of the unlawful intent of suspect number two.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Undoubtedly, it is the law that before one can be stigmatized as an abettor he must have instigated or advised the commission of the crime, or have been present for the purpose of assisting in its consummation. In the instant case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>we are satisfied that the facts therein proven require that the order appealed from be affirmed. It was the province of the jury to declare appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence, and unless we can say that it clearly appears that upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support the conclusion reached in the court below, the verdict of the jury, which has been approved by the trial court, cannot be set aside upon the ground \u201cof insufficiency of the evidence.\u201d  And, if the circumstances reasonably justify the verdict of the jury, the opinion of the reviewing tribunal that those circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled\" with the innocence of the accused will not warrant interference with the determination of the duly constituted arbiters of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Bearing these well established rules in mind, we are here confronted with the following incriminatory circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">(1) Possession by defendant of the stolen property ;</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">(2) Defendant assisting the thief on the latter\u2019s emergence from the building where the theft was committed, in placing the property in defendant\u2019s automobile, which was done hastily; then defendant driving his automobile nearer the building after the thief ran back in;</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">(3) Defendant looking in the direction of Officer Sandlin when the latter started toward where defendant was parked, then defendant looking in the direction of the main entrance of the building which the thief had reentered and making \u201cnegative\u201d signs with his head and hand;</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">(4) Defendant\u2019s automobile starting in motion thereafter;</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">(5) Defendant\u2019s hesitancy in picking out the key to and opening the trunk of his automobile at the officer\u2019s direction;</p>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">(6) Defendant\u2019s admission to the officer, after he had opened the trunk which contained the stolen property, \u201cWell, you have got me,\u201d and his statement \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d in conjunction with spreading his hands with the palms open.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">The law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence in the degree of proof required. It requires only that evidence of the one character or the other or both he sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in the minds of those bound to act conscientiously upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">Appellant insists that there was no motive for the theft. That \u201cAppellant had in his possession at the time of his apprehension some $5,000.00 worth of tangible assets, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>had a job paying $70.00 per week, not to mention an outside source of income. Obviously, the purpose of theft is to acquire money, and yet on the meager amount of evidence available, the jury found that a man in the financial position of the appellant would commit burglary for some $294.00 worth of coats. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">However, when it is remembered that an inference is founded upon such a deduction from a fact legally proven \u201cas is warranted by a consideration of the usual propensities or passions of men, the particular propensities or passions of the person whose act is in question, the course of business or the course of nature\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1960), it is difficult to understand how a person financially situated as appellant was would <em>be </em>interested in driving a practical stranger from Adams Boulevard and Central Avenue to downtown Los Angeles to obtain for himself \u201ca couple of bucks to buy gasoline.\u201d The very circumstances adverted to by appellant impress us that the jury was justified in concluding that his testimony lacked the essence of verity, and that he was a knowing and willing participant in the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Finally, appellant complains that the court erred to Ms prejudice in excluding testimony of the entire conversation had with Officer Billingsley, and, as to a portion of which the officer testified on his direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">In that regard the record reflects that on rebuttal, the officer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">\u201cQ. Did you have a conversation with the defendant on the night of May 5, 1952, at the City Hall in the presence of a couple of other officers ? A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">\u201cQ. In that conversation did the defendant tell you that the person he picked up at Central and Adams asked him if he wanted to make a fast buck ? A. He did. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">On cross-examination the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">\u201cQ. By Mr. Drabin (Appellant\u2019s counsel) : Officer Billingsley, what else did he tell you at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">\u201cMr. DonNell an (Deputy District Attorney) : Objected to as not cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-13\">\u201cThe Court: It calls for hearsay. Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-14\">\"Q. By Mr. Drabin : Officer, did you ask him at that time whether or not he had stolen these coats ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-15\">\u201cMr. Donnellan.- Objection. Improper cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-16\">\u201cThe Court: Objection sustained. It calls for hearsay, a self-serving declaration. Sustained. The only question is whether he did or did not make that particular statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>On direct examination appellant testified that the person he drove to the scene of the burglary had stated he would give him, <em>\u201ca </em>couple of bucks to get gas.\u201d On cross-examination appellant denied that this person asked him if he \u201cwanted to make a fast buck.\u201d And, on recross-examination appellant testified he did not-think he made a statement to Officer Billingsley that his passenger had asked him if he \u201cwanted to make a fast buck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In support of the proposition that when part of a conversation is admitted in evidence the opposing party may have the entire conversation admitted, appellant relies upon section 1854 of the Code of Civil Procedure; <em>People </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>195 Cal. 584, 596 [234 P. 374], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Brac, </em>73 Cal.App.2d 629, 638 [167 P.2d 535], However, the cited cases go no farther than to hold that when one part of a subject matter is brought out by a party it is proper for the opposing party to bring out all that was said on the subject.  In other words, the rule that where part of a conversation has been shown in evidence, the remainder of that conversation may be brought out by the opposing party, is necessarily subject to the qualification that the court may exclude those portions of the conversation not relevant to the items or subject matter thereof which have been introduced. In the instant case it was not shown that disclosure of the entire conversation would have any bearing on the limited point of challenge of appellant\u2019s credibility <em>(People </em>v. <em>Horowitz, </em>70 Cal.App.2d 675, 691 [161 P.2d 833]). As cogently stated by the trial court, \u201cThe only question is whether he (the witness) did or did not make that particular statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">We are satisfied that the trial judge did not err or abuse the discretion vested in him in limiting the cross-examination as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">For the foregoing reasons the order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial from which this appeal was taken, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
