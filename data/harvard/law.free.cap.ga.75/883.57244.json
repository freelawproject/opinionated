The prayer was for an accounting, etc. The answer denied all allegations of fraud and undue advantage, and set up a release of all interest in the property as being fairly and deliberately executed by her. On demurrer to so much of the billas sought a construction of the will, it was agreed by counsel that if the demurrer should be sustained, the bill should be dismissed with right of exception to the Supreme Court. In this court the case yas dismissed as prematurely brought. 73 <em>Ga., </em>134. The remitter, as amended, provided that the cause \u201cstand for a hearing in the court below as if never brought here or ruled there on demurrer; that to this end, if stricken, the case be re-instated and tried <em>de novo, </em>and such other action be had as is necessary to effectuate this direction, it having been the true intent and meaning of this court, in the judgm\u00e9nt rendered, simply and solely to decline to rule on the demurrer because it was prematurely brought.\u201d The case was heard again on demurrer, with no amendment, except the striking of certain allegations as to statements made by testator during the last few years of his life. The' demurrer was to so much of said bill as set up complainant\u2019s construction of the will. The judge sustained the demurrer. His order, after reciting the demurrer, proceeded as follows: \u201cIt was ordered that the said demurrer be and is hereby sustained, and that the parties proceed to try the issues made by the bill and answer; and thereupon complainant\u2019s counsel having stated in open court that if complainant, on a final construction of said will, was not entitled to the whole estate, they did ndt wish the settlement disturbed, and stated that tbe bill ought to be dismissed. The court thereupon dismissed the bill for want of equity.\u201d A bill of exceptions <em>pendente lite, </em>with an acknowledgment of service thereon, was filed, and also a writ of error t &gt; this court sued out:</headnotes>\n\n\n<headnotes id=\"b904-6\">(&amp;.)

Both parties seem anxious for a hearing upon the merits of the case, and counsel for defendant in error declined to move to dismiss the writ of error, on the ground that counsel for plaintiff in error had consented to the ruling, and this distinguishes it from <em>Zorn vs. Lamar, </em>71 <em>Ga., </em>80. Had such a motion been made, it probably would have been sustained, unless the decree that .the bill should be dismissed for want of equity went beyond the consent of counsel for plaintiff in error.</p><p id=\"AoK\"><em>(o.) </em>Questions suggested as proper issues to be submitted to the jury \u00f3n the trial of the case.</p><p id=\"b904-8\">Writ of error dismissed with directions.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
