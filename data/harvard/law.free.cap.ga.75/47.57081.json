Woodruff, a minor, by his next friend, Joseph P. Woodruff, brought suit against the Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company for a personal injury, alleged to have been received by him through the negligence of the defendant, without fault on his part, while engaged as a brakeman on the defendant\u2019s railroad in Alabama Joseph P. Woodruff, the father, also brought suit for the loss of his son\u2019s services. The latter case was tried with the former by consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-11\">On the trial, the evidence for the plaintiff was, in brief, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-12\"><em>Joseph P. Woodruff </em>testified: His son was eighteen years of age when hurt. He left his father\u2019s home in Atlanta, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the latter did not know where he was until he heard of the injury. He had never given his consent to his son\u2019s receiving his own wages, but he had always collected them himself before the son left. He did not consent to his employment by the defendant, and did not know of it. It was a dangerous business. For a while before, he had run with his father as a brakeman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\"><em>William L. Woodruff </em>testified:' He left home witnout his father\u2019s knowledge or consent, and went to Birmingham, Alabama. He asked the conductor on an ore-train if he did not wish to employ him. The latter said he would see, and went to see about it; he saw the agent, and that afternoon employed the plaintiff at $1.80 per day. The plaintiff dealt with no other person than the conductor, and the latter could discharge as well as employ him. He had been working on this ore-train, hauling ore between Birmingham and certain mines for twelve or fifteen days, when he was hurt. The ore cars have steep, slan ing ends, with a trap-door at -the bottom, which is worked by a crank and chains. At a place near the mines, known as Potter\u2019s, the ore-train went on a side-track to allow the passenger train to pass. After it did so, the conductor instructed the plaintiff to change the switch and get on the cars and set the brakes, and said that he would give the cars a start, or \u201ckick\u201d backward, and let them roll. The plaintiff changed the switch and got on the car, set one brake and started to set another. He passed along a sill about eight inches wide. This was the only way to get from one car to the other, and was the proper way. The conductor gave a signal to a negro brakeman at the front of the train to cut the engine loose. A drag-bar became hung in the draw-head of the engine, causing a sudden jerk and throwing the plaintiff off in the middle of the track, where a number of cars passed over him, injuring him (the distance of the ore cars above the track being about three feet), and an open trapdoor in one of the cars struck him, breaking his leg. The drag-bar was too large for the draw-head. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>knew that the door was down, but it was not his place to keep it up, and he had no crank to keep it up with. The men employed by another company at the ore chutes put them up. He was not at fault, so far as he knew.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-5\">On cross-examination, he stated that he knew the jerk was caused by the drag-bar being caught in the draw-head, because the jerk could not have been produced in any other way. He did not see it, and could not swear absolutely that it did so. He did not see the engine cut loose, but when he got from under the cars, the engine was on a different track, and besides, the cars could have been stopped quicker than they were if the engine had been attached. The other brakemen \u00bband employ\u00e9s were old men in their places, and good men in the business, so far as he knew. He had been about the engine several times; knew that the drag-bar had been taken off and put back several days before the injury, but did not know there was any fault in it. He had been employed altogether as a brakeman about three .years. It was raining some that afternoon, and the plaintiff had on a new pair of boots. The cars were good, so far as he knew.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">. There was other evidence as to the extent of the injury, the loss of time, etc., and as to a settlement claimed by the defendant, which need not be set out in detail. The tables of life expectancy were also introduced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">On motion, the court granted a non-suit, and the plaintiff excepted</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-8\">Hopkins &amp; Glenn, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq4\">cited, on master\u2019s duty to furnish proper machinery, 100 U.

Such, at least, has, for a long time, been the settled practice of our courts, and because the casualty happened in another jurisdiction, this is not a sufficient reason to justify a change in our modes of trial and procedure. With these differences in regard to plaintiff\u2019s relation to defendant and- the place of the occurrence, this case is within <em>Fraser et al. vs. Charleston and Savannah Railway Company, </em>determined at this term. While the rule referred to does not commend itself to our judgment, and while we would greatly prefer seeing it modified, and always feel reluctant when called upon to enforce it, yet it has been too long and too firmly established to justify any departure from it, and we are constrained to yield it obedience, and to declare that the non-suit should not have been awarded, and must order the judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
