Relator's application was not timely filed in the district court, and he fails to carry his burden to show that an exception applies. La.C.Cr.P. art. 930.8 ;\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Glover v. State\n   </em>\n   , 93-2330 (La. 9/5/95),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7457541\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/660/1189/\">\n    660 So.2d 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, relator's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is repetitive. La.C.Cr.P. art. 930.4(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Finally, relator fails to show he is factually innocent of the crimes under the standard of\n   <em>\n    State v. Conway\n   </em>\n   , 01-2808 (La. 4/12/02),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9429254\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/816/290/\">\n    816 So.2d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Relator has now fully litigated two applications for post-conviction relief in state court. Similar to federal habeas relief,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Louisiana post-conviction procedure envisions the filing of a successive application only under the narrow circumstances provided in La.C.Cr.P. art. 930.4 and within the limitations period as set out in La.C.Cr.P. art. 930.8. Notably, the Legislature in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20La.%20Acts%20251\">\n    2013 La. Acts 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   amended that article to make the procedural bars against successive filings mandatory. Relator's claims have now been fully litigated in accord with La.C.Cr.P. art. 930.6, and this denial is final. Hereafter, unless he can show that one of the narrow exceptions authorizing the filing of a successive application applies, relator has exhausted his right to state collateral review. The district court is ordered to record a minute entry consistent with this per curiam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Hughes, J. would grant the writ in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   GENOVESE, J., would grant in part and remand only to assess the Brady claim.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
