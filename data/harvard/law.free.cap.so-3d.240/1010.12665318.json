The trial court found the plaintiff, Brenda Gaines, solely at fault in causing the accident due to her failure to yield. Ms. Gaines appeals, contending that the trial court erred in failing to find the defendant, Laura Wilson, solely at fault due to her improperly changing lanes. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of a two-vehicle accident that occurred on November 5, 2014, at approximately 5:30 p.m., in the vicinity of the eastbound I-10 exit ramp onto Chef Menteur Highway (\"Chef Menteur\") in New Orleans, Louisiana. Claiming personal injuries and property damage to the rental car that she was driving, Ms. Gaines sued, among others, the driver of the other vehicle, Ms. Wilson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her petition, Ms. Gaines averred that the accident occurred as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 [Ms. Gaines] was driving a [rented] 2015 Kia Soul automobile in an eastbound direction, in the right lane of travel of Chef Menteur Highway, near the intersection of Reynes Street in New Orleans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Suddenly and without warning, while driving a 1994 Mazda Protege automobile, Laura Wilson executed a U-turn from westbound Chef Menteur Highway at Reynes Street, crossed over the left and center eastbound lanes, and crossed into the far right eastbound lane occupied by plaintiff, resulting in a collision with plaintiffs vehicle ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A one-day bench trial was held in this matter. From the trial testimony and evidence, it is clear that Chef Menteur is a major highway with three lanes in each direction-eastbound and westbound-separated by a median with turning lanes. It is also clear that the I-10 exit ramp merges into the right eastbound lane of Chef Menteur. Approaching that merger, the right eastbound lane is bordered on the left by a solid white line.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The right eastbound lane, however, was not a protected lane dedicated to traffic merging from I-10 onto Chef Menteur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At trial, the two drivers were the principal witnesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The drivers shared some similarities: both were in their seventies; both were\n   <em>\n    en route\n   </em>\n   to their homes, which were located nearby, when the accident occurred; and both were familiar with the area where the accident occurred. Both drivers testified that the accident occurred in the right eastbound lane of Chef Menteur. Each driver's version of the accident, however, was different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Ms. Gaines, when the accident occurred, she had exited the I-10 exit ramp to Chef Menteur and had fully cleared the exit ramp. Ms. Gaines did not recall whether there was a yield sign at the end of the I-10 exit ramp, and she believed that she had no duty to yield to traffic in the right eastbound lane of Chef Menteur. Nonetheless, she testified, before merging into that lane, she looked and observed no traffic in that lane. She indicated that it was still daylight when the accident occurred and that there was no impediment blocking her view of eastbound traffic. When asked whether she knew where Ms. Wilson came from, Ms. Gaines testified that, \"[w]hen I saw Laura Wilson and her car, it was into my car.\" Ms. Gaines further testified that after the accident, Ms. Wilson's car was located in the right eastbound lane. Ms. Gaines described the damage to Ms. Wilson's vehicle as being on the passenger side front and back door, and the damage to her rental vehicle as being on the front driver's corner bumper and fender by the headlight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to Ms. Wilson, she was returning home from picking up food at Lucky Jean Seafood (\"Lucky\"), when the accident occurred. When she left Lucky, which was on the westbound side of Chef Menteur, she made a U-turn to return\n   home. After she made the U-turn, she pulled into the right eastbound lane of Chef Menteur-the lane closest to the I-10 exit ramp. She lived on the right side of Chef Menteur; she intended to remain in the right lane until she made a right turn to go home. Ms. Wilson testified that she remained in the right lane from the time she made a U-turn until the time of the impact. According to Ms. Wilson, Ms. Gaines \"hit me from the right as I passed, because I already passed her.\" Ms. Wilson testified that there was a big yield sign facing motorists coming off the I-10 exit ramp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court found that Ms. Gaines was solely at fault for causing the accident and rendered judgment dismissing her suit. The trial court also issued the following written reasons for judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Mrs. Gaines initially testified that there was no \"yield\" sign directing vehicles coming off the eastbound I-10 exit ramp at Chef Mentuer Highway. After some cross examination, she expressed less certainty on this issue, saying that she did not remember.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Mrs. Wilson testified emphatically that there was a \"yield\" sign for vehicles coming off the ramp, \"a big one.\" The court credits Mrs. Wilson's testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Mrs. Gaines did not see Mrs. Wilson's vehicle until the impact. Had she checked the right lane of traffic just before merging onto Chef Mentuer Highway from the ramp, she would have had an opportunity to observe Mrs. Wilson's vehicle approaching. Mrs. Gaines is at fault for this accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As noted at the outset, Ms. Gaines' contention is that the cause of the accident was not her failure to yield, but Ms. Wilson's improper lane change. She cites as the controlling standard of care La. R.S. 32:79.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Wilson counters that the trial court correctly concluded that the cause of the accident was Ms. Gaines' failure to yield. She cites as the controlling standard of care as La. R.S. 32:123(D).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The manifest error standard of review governs this court's review of a trial court's factual findings, including its findings of liability.\n   <em>\n    Watson v.

She further contends that the evidence presented at trial established that the accident occurred so far east of the I-10 exit ramp that the yield sign was irrelevant. She contends that by the time the accident occurred, she had \"successfully merged onto Chef Hwy without incident,\" and Ms. Wilson caused the accident by crossing the solid line and colliding into her vehicle. We find this argument unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ms. Wilson consistently testified that she was traveling in the right eastbound lane of Chef Menteur for quite some distance before the accident. Ms. Gaines acknowledged that she never saw Ms. Wilson's vehicle until the accident occurred; thus, Ms. Gaines could not testify about which of the three lanes of eastbound Chef Menteur Ms. Wilson's vehicle was travelling in before the accident. Nor could she testify as to whether Ms. Wilson had changed lanes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In an attempt to establish that the accident occurred so far east of the I-10 exit ramp that Ms. Wilson must have changed lanes, Ms. Gaines cites a Google Maps aerial photograph on which Ms. Wilson placed a dot depicting the location of the accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Wilson placed the dot on the Google Maps photograph in her pre-trial deposition and confirmed at trial that this was the location of the accident. According to Ms. Gaines, Ms. Wilson's placement of the dot established that the location of the accident was considerably east of the intersection of the I-10 exit ramp and Chef Menteur. Ms. Gaines also cites Ms. Wilson's testimony that she was concerned about going into an intersection controlled by a traffic light, which was considerably east of the I-10 exit ramp. According to Ms. Gaines, the traffic light was at the intersection of Dale Street and Chef Menteur, which was located another block east of the I-10 exit ramp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under Ms. Gaines' version of the accident, Ms. Wilson was solely at fault because she changed lanes improperly when it was unsafe for her to do so given that Ms. Gaines had successfully merged into the eastbound right lane. The trial court rejected this version of the accident and determined that Ms. Gaines was solely at fault in failing to yield the right of way. The record supports the trial court's factual finding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Wilson's testimony that she never changed lanes provided the trial court with a reasonable basis for concluding that Ms. Gaines was solely at fault for\n   failing to yield. Ms. Wilson never contradicted her testimony that she remained in the right eastbound lane of Chef Menteur from the time she made a U-turn until the time of the impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Considering the testimony and evidence in this case, we conclude that the trial court's factual finding that Mr. Gaines was solely at fault in causing the accident is supported by the record, is reasonable, and is not manifestly erroneous. This is not the rare occasion \"[w]here documents or objective evidence so contradict the witness's story, or the story itself is so internally inconsistent or implausible on its face, that a reasonable fact finder would not credit the witness's story, [and] the court of appeal may well find manifest error or clear wrongness even in a finding purportedly based upon a credibility determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Menard\n   </em>\n   , 09-1869 at p. 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7056047\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/31/996/#p1011\">\n    31 So.3d at 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the contrary, this case involves a reasonable factual conclusion that Ms. Wilson was travelling at all pertinent times in the right eastbound lane of Chef Menteur when the vehicle she was driving was struck on the right passenger side by the rental vehicle Ms. Gaines was driving and that the sole cause of the accident was Ms. Gaines' failure to yield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Ms. Gaines also named as defendants Ms. Wilson's insurer, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, and Ms. Gaines' uninsured motorist insurer, Esurance Insurance Company.

Google Maps uses a close variant of the Mercator projection, and therefore cannot accurately show areas around the poles.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Google Maps, Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google Maps (Last visited February 22, 2108).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ryans v.
