In this lien priority case, a property owner defaulted on his obligations, and the construction lender foreclosed the property. The general contractor had a materialman's lien on the property. At the foreclosure sale, the purchase price for the property was significantly lower than the total amounts owed. The sole issue before the chancery court was which lien had priority-that of the construction lender, or that of the contractor. The chancery court found that the contractor's lien had priority. Because the chancery court did not abuse its discretion, this Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2. Knight Properties purchased a piece of property on which it planned to build a residential development. In February 2007, Hancock Bank issued a line of credit\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Knight Properties in the amount of $2.25 million. In gathering information to approve the loan, Hancock obtained the contract between Knight Properties and Triangle Construction Company, Inc., entered into on February 12, 2007, for Triangle to be the contractor on the project. Before approving the loan, Hancock checked Triangle's contractor's license to ensure it possessed a valid one. Hancock and Knight executed a promissory note and a deed of trust on the property. Later in 2007, Knight conveyed the property to Reunion of Biloxi Development LLC, a conveyance that was essentially a name change. Reunion assumed Knight's debt to Hancock and a new promissory note in the amount of approximately $1.9 million was signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. The first draw on the loan was made on February 19, 2007, in the amount of $966, 872.71, and was used to pay off the balance of the existing purchase loan on the land. Hancock Bank had financed the original purchase of the property, so it used the line of credit to pay off the existing balance to itself. The remaining draws occurred sporadically through May 11, 2009, with Hancock distributing a total of nine draws, in the total amount of $1,704,660.42. For each distribution, Hancock's attorney, George Murphy, checked the chancery court for liens on the property and obtained an owner and/or contractor affidavit from Chad Knight. The affidavit attested that all subcontractors, materialmen, and other such laborers had been paid in full any amounts owed. The affidavit also had the contractor waive any claim to a lien and affirmed that \"[t]he owner has no interest or ownership in the contracting firm or firms and the contractor has no interest in the real property described above[.]\" Chad Knight then signed each affidavit twice for Reunion, as both the owner and the contractor. Murphy testified that Hancock had not informed him that Triangle was the contractor, and that information would have changed the way he did things in that he \"certainly\" would have had the contractor sign the affidavit. Hancock asserted that the information that Triangle was the contractor was sent to Murphy at some point via fax. Hancock also had the site inspected by an engineer to ensure that the progress matched the requested disbursement amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4. On March 31, 2008, Reunion and Triangle entered into a contract for Triangle to be the contractor on the project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It\n   provided that Triangle \"agrees to furnish all materials and perform all work necessary to complete Reunion Place Subdivision .... The scope of work to achieve completion is further described as Site Improvements, Water Improvements, Sewer Improvements, Storm Drainage Improvements. The project will be constructed based on the plans drawn by [the engineer.]\" It also provided that all subcontracts were subject to the approval of both the owner and the engineer. The contract stated that the contractor would submit an invoice to the owner and the engineer on the twenty-fifth of every month and that the invoice was payable by the tenth of the following month. It provided that work on the project would cease if the invoice was not paid in full by the fifteenth of the following month. Work commenced on the project. Financial problems then arose for Chad Knight. Some time around October 2008, Triangle pulled off the work site for nonpayment, but it eventually returned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. In December 2008, Henry Knue and Donna Smith, Hancock Bank employees assigned to the Reunion loan, had a conversation about Triangle. Knue emailed Chad Knight with a subject line \"Draw Pending-Triangle Construction\" and stated \"Please email or fax invoice due Triangle construction so that I may accurately instruct attorney for disbursement.\" Chad Knight replied that he was faxing the invoice, \"However, I'm not sure what you mean regarding the disbursement instructions to the attorney. The draw needs to be disbursed to Reunion Development as all draws have been. We will pay our contractors and vendors.\" Knue forwarded this to Smith as an \"fyi,\" and Smith responded that \"All of our attorney letters that support the disbursement instruct the attorney to disburse any outstanding invoices, etc. that may be out there. I know he is aware of this.\" Knue replied that the fax he had received from Knight was not a Triangle invoice, but a Reunion invoice. He stated that he \"delivered the check so as not to delay the draw given the urgency in posting before end of day on Wednesday. Attorney has historically disbursed to them and executing an affidavit stating no outstanding invoices. Maybe we can address this in Tuesday's meeting with them as well?\" Smith replied that \"I think that is fine .... As long as there are no liens outstanding to Triangle and they are continuing to do the work, then we should be fine. But be sure that your instructions letter to the attorney states that any outstanding liens are paid for.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. On April 27, 2009, Chad Knight emailed Smith with a draw request, and stated \"FYI, we plan to send payment from this draw and our funds directly to the subcontractor (Warren Paving), as our last payment to the Triangle construction apparently did not end reach the sub. We've taken steps to protect against this happening again.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 28, 2009, Carla Roy from Hancock emailed George Murphy's paralegal and asked her to update Reunion's title in anticipation of a \"progress draw.\" On May 5, 2009, the paralegal informed Roy that the update was complete. Roy responded \"Great, I will schedule the draw with you as soon as we have everything in place on our end. Thanks for the update.\" Smith, who was copied on this email chain, then emailed\n   Roy, stating \"I have a call into Chad to discuss the draw amount, no work on the property since the contractor called and stated he pulled off the property and also the Erosion issues that I inspected this morning!! I will let you know when I hear from him!!\" Smith described her inspection of the property, noting that \"the roads like caving in and it look [sic] delapidated [sic] basically, like nothing had been going on for several weeks. There was no movement on the property.\" Yet Hancock distributed a draw to Reunion on May 9, 2009. Additionally, during the majority of this time period, Hancock was aware that Reunion was having financial difficulties. One Hancock document noted that \"[t[here have been some issues with the contractor on the job and payment issues with him being paid which both sides state are being taken care of however, this has caused the contractor to pull off the job site for more than 8 weeks now and no work has been complted [sic].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. Triangle filed a construction and materialmen's lien on the property on December 16, 2009, in the amount of $214,314.18. After Reunion defaulted on the construction loan, Hancock filed a complaint against Chad Knight, Reunion, and Triangle, among others, and also moved for foreclosure. The chancery court authorized Hancock to foreclose on the property. A third party purchased the property at the foreclosure sale for $800,000. Triangle filed a counterclaim against Hancock for the $214,314.18 it was owed. Hancock filed a motion for summary judgment as to Triangle, which the chancery court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. After a bench trial on the matter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the chancery court found that Triangle's lien had priority over Hancock's claims. The chancery court specifically found that Triangle was the general contractor on the project and that Hancock failed to use reasonable diligence in disbursing the construction loan. It thus ruled that Triangle's lien had priority over Hancock's deed of trust, and that Triangle must be paid first out of the foreclosure proceeds. The chancery court awarded Triangle attorneys' fees in the amount of $106,350.48 and awarded Triangle pre- and post-judgment interest at the rate of eight percent. Hancock appeals, arguing that 1) the chancery court erred in its determination that the loan funds did not go into the project because the first portion of the loan funds went to pay off an existing loan on the property; 2) the chancery court erred by determining that Hancock did not use reasonable diligence in disbursing the loan; 3) the chancery court erred in awarding Triangle pre- and post-judgment interest at the rate of eight percent; and 4) the chancery court erred in awarding Triangle attorney's fees and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.

Hancock argues that because the first disbursement went to pay off itself for the existing loan on the land, those funds actually went into the construction, because construction is impossible without the land, a so-called \"purchase-money\" rule within the construction funds test. The chancellor rejected this argument. Triangle argues that money advanced to purchase undeveloped land is clearly not money that went into the construction project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12.

The Court did not consider the financing of the property as a version of a \"construction loan.\" It considered it separately; if the bright-line rule was that the purchase price of the land to be used for a construction project automatically consists of \"funds going into construction,\" L &amp; T in this case would have automatically trumped the materialmen's liens, because its loan to purchase the property would have been deemed as a \"cost of construction.\" However,\n   <em>\n    Peoples Bank\n   </em>\n   clearly contemplates that the purchase price of the property is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a cost of construction under some circumstances.

The dissent advocates that we adopt a bright-line legal rule that the purchase money for the land in a construction loan is automatically a cost of construction. Chancery courts are courts of equity. We find that the better rule is to allow a chancery court to examine the facts and equities of each case and determine whether purchase money for the land can be claimed as a cost of construction that fairly prioritizes a construction lender's lien over those of materialmen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This result is supported by the caselaw that goes in both directions, because, in each case involving purchase money cited by both this opinion and the dissent, this Court affirmed the findings of the trial court, either way. Examining the specific facts of this case under the standard of review, thus assuming that the chancellor resolved all conflicts in the evidence on fact issues with respect to which the chancellor made no findings of fact in favor of Triangle and giving Triangle the benefit of all reasonable inferences, we cannot find reversible error in the failure to credit the $966,000 that Hancock disbursed to pay itself as a cost of construction. Hancock using a generic \"line of credit\" to pay itself the balance of the original loan is even further removed from the actual construction on the project than L &amp; T Developers' financing the original land purchase in\n   <em>\n    Peoples Bank\n   </em>\n   . For this reason, this Court finds that the chancery court did not abuse its discretion when it found that Hancock's lien did not have priority over Triangle's\n   lien.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. Whether Hancock exercised reasonable diligence.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 15. Hancock argues that it used reasonable diligence in disbursing the construction funds by obtaining an owner/contractor affidavit, checking the chancery court records for liens, and inspecting the property before disbursements. To be sure, Hancock dotted the \"i's\" and crossed the \"t's.\" Yet, the chancery court rejected this argument because Hancock knew or should have known that materialmen and contractors were not being paid. Hancock may not cloak its actual knowledge of the issues that were occurring by simply doing the \"proper\" paperwork.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 16. First, the affidavits stating that no payments were outstanding were suspect. Chad Knight signed as both owner and contractor, despite averring that the owner and contractor had no financial interest in one another in the same affidavit, and despite the evidence indicating that Chad Knight was not indeed the general contractor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   a fact that evidence indicates Hancock knew. Murphy testified that had he known that Triangle was actually the contractor, he would have done things differently. Chad Knight also informed Hancock at one point that Triangle had not paid a subcontractor. In December 2008, Hancock employees had a conversation regarding Triangle's invoices and a disbursement, indicating that Hancock may have known of payment problems, especially when giving Triangle the benefit of all reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence, as this Court's standard of review demands. Moreover, before the May disbursement, Triangle informed Hancock that it was not being paid. Smith inspected the site herself and noted that it appeared as though no work had been done for awhile and noted that \"the\" contractor had pulled off the project. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Triangle, it is not implausible to find that Hancock knew that Triangle was the contractor, knew that Reunion was having difficulty paying contractors and subcontractors, and knowingly allowed Chad Knight to falsely sign affidavits as the contractor. The chancery court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Hancock did not exercise reasonable diligence in disbursing the construction loan funds and thus its lien does not receive priority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5. Whether eight percent interest was appropriate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 17. Hancock argues that an interest rate of one percent over prime would be fair in \"today's financial world.\" Triangle argues that Hancock waived this argument by failing to make a contemporaneous objection and, in any event, that the award is fair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 18.

The chancellor stated that \"[t]here was no dispute expressed as to the [pre-judgment] interest that I would also award.\" Hancock did not object. The chancellor then awarded post-judgment interest at eight percent and the attorney for Hancock replied \"Thank you, sir.\" Hancock did not object to an eight percent interest rate in chancery court. Therefore, this argument is waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Jackson v.

Hancock argues that the chancery court's award of attorney's fees is unreasonable. It argues that the chancery court did not consider the appropriate factors, but that all it \"required as proof was that the former governor lay his bill on the table.\" Triangle argues that Hancock waived any objection to the award of attorney's fees by failing to make a contemporaneous objection, and in the alternative, argues that the chancery court did not commit manifest error, as the chancellor went through the appropriate factors and found that the fees were reasonable and warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 20. While Hancock did not object to the reasonableness of the attorney's fees at the moment the chancellor made the award, it did vociferously object to the reasonableness of the fees at the time Triangle placed the attorney's bill into evidence. Thus, Hancock preserved this argument for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 21. The chancery court has wide discretion in awarding attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

In this case, the chancellor found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   With respect to the attorney's fees, they're higher than what lawyers on the Coast get, but we are used to seeing lawyers come in here from other places that do get much higher fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   I went through the whole first round of casinos failures and junk bonds and all that, and all the-everybody that came down here from anywhere else-they had a lot of lawyers from New York and they charge a whole lot more than you lawyers from Jackson do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   But I would assume that the-and I would think that the fees are consistent with what could be demanded by Governor Musgrove.

Because the chancellor did not abuse his discretion in determining that Triangle's lien took priority over Hancock's lien, and because Hancock's loan for the undeveloped land did not go into construction, this Court affirms the judgment of the chancery court.

Ample evidence in the record disputes this, such as the contract between Reunion and Triangle indicating that Triangle was the general contractor; statements in emails by Hancock indicating that Triangle was \"the\" contractor; Chad Knight's deposition testimony that Triangle was the general contractor on the project; communications between Triangle and Reunion regarding Triangle, and not Reunion, paying subcontractors; and communications between Chad Knight and Hancock indicating that Triangle had the responsibility to pay subcontractors. The chancery court specifically found that Triangle was the general contractor on the project, and under an abuse of discretion standard, we cannot find that the chancery court erred in making this factual finding, given the abundance of evidence indicating that Triangle was the general contractor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Regardless of the veracity of Chad Knight's statement, he certainly put Hancock on notice that he had outstanding, unpaid invoices to contractors and/or materialmen.

Yet, as this Court has already noted, allowing errant construction lenders to automatically trump materialmen stifles development, as materialmen are less willing to work on credit, an arrangement that benefits everyone. Allowing a chancery court to perform its duties by finding facts and balancing equities ensures that the proper lien will receive priority under the specific facts of each case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    If a portion of a construction loan for undeveloped land automatically and always trumps materialmen, it would be antithetical to ever give materialmen priority. To be sure, the current statute regarding contractor's liens (which was not in effect at the time Triangle's lien was filed) requires that, to maintain priority, a construction mortgagee must obtain either an affidavit from the owner stating that no work has been done and no materials delivered to the property, or it must obtain \"an affidavit or sworn statement from the contractor, or owner if there is no contractor, ... regarding payment for work, materials or services provided.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2085-7-405\">\n     Miss.

The main issue is whether the amounts used in the first draw to pay off the existing purchase loan on the land constituted funds that went into construction.

The logic behind these holdings is clear. We want banks to make construction loans. The bank, in general, is not going to make a construction loan unless its lien has priority. Therefore, it includes funds to pay off the existing mortgage as a part of the construction loan, thus ensuring its priority. In our case, although the bank was the same, Whitney was able to place its construction loan in a superior position by extinguishing the first mortgage. To hold otherwise would stifle such loans unless the purchase-money mortgage holder is willing to subrogate its priority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 29. The majority cites two cases which are held forth as supporting the proposition that such funds are not funds that went into construction.

Thus, the case turned on these two issues, and it never addressed the purchase price of the land and whether it was considered part of the construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 32. The majority also deems the issue to be a finding of fact subject to an abuse-of-discretion standard. The issue of whether funds used to pay off the existing purchase loan on the land constitutes money going into the construction project is a question of law. That is not to say that there will not be circumstances where a fact finding is necessary when there is some question as to the purpose of the loan, whether the money was used to pay off the existing mortgage, diversion of the money, etc. The majority states that this dissent advocates adoption of \"a bright-line legal rule that the purchase money for the land in a construction loan automatically is a cost of construction.\" Maj. Op. at \u00b6 14. Where the issue is a question of law, my dissent merely upholds our precedent on the status of the purchase money. However, as stated above, where there are circumstances in which fact finding is necessary, my dissent does not hinder that in any way. In this case, however, the issue is one of law. All parties agree that the first draw went to pay off the balance of the existing purchase loan on the land, and no evidence has been submitted that this was anything other than the intention of the parties. Therefore, as all parties agreed to the status of the first draw, unlike the Majority states, I dissent to state that this Court should affirm the findings of the trial court but reverse the application of the law to the facts, as was done in\n   <em>\n    Deposit Guaranty\n   </em>\n   (and in\n   <em>\n    Wortman\n   </em>\n   on the issue of reasonable diligence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 33. The amount used to pay off the existing purchase loan on the land constitutes funds that went into construction. The determination of whether the monies used to pay off the balance of the existing purchase loan on the land is dispositive in that it consumes the entire amount obtained at the foreclosure sale. (The payoff was $966, 872.71 and the foreclosure purchase price was $800,000). Therefore, it is\n   not necessary to get to a reasonable-diligence analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 34. For these reasons, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   MAXWELL, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
