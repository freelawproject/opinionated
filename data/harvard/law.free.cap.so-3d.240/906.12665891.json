The district court's order requiring defendants to amend their interrogatory answer to give a specific answer as directed by the court is vacated and set aside. The case is remanded to the district court to consider alternatives to its order, such as limiting the scope of the interrogatory and compelling defendants to answer the interrogatory as limited.</p><p id=\"p-7\">CRICHTON, J., additionally concurs and assigns reasons.</p><p id=\"p-8\">CRICHTON, J., additionally concurs and assigns reasons:</p><p id=\"p-9\">Although this Court generally leaves pre-trial discovery matters to the great discretion of the trial court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this matter warrants our intervention. I therefore agree with the Court's decision to grant this writ and remand with the direction to the district court to consider alternatives to its order. Here, applicants assert that the response to interrogatories imposed by the trial court would force defendants and their counsel to make an untenable choice: commit perjury and violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, respectively, or subject themselves to being held in contempt of court or sanctioned. In my view, compelling such an alternative could create a material injustice.</p><p id=\"p-12\"><em>See,</em> <em>Caminita v.
