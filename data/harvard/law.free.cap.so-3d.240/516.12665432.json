Gary Wayne Stacks appeals from the denial of his motion for post-conviction\n   relief (PCR). The circuit court terminated Stacks's term of post-release supervision (PRS) and recommitted Stacks to the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) after Stacks violated multiple conditions of his PRS. In his PCR motion, Stacks argued that the circuit court lacked authority to recommit him to MDOC custody because his original sentencing order did not expressly impose a suspended sentence to correspond with his term of PRS. This Court rejected the same argument in\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n    89 So.3d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 649-51 (\u00b6\u00b6 7-12) (Miss. Ct. App. 2011). Therefore, we affirm the circuit court's order denying Stacks's PCR motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. In 2007, Stacks pled guilty to manufacturing methamphetamine. Pursuant to a plea agreement, the State recommended a sentence of ten years in MDOC custody followed by five years of PRS and a fine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State also agreed to retire a second charge to the files.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court accepted Stacks's plea, followed the State's recommendation, and sentenced Stacks to ten years in MDOC custody to be followed by five years of PRS, a $5,000 fine, and court costs. At his plea/sentencing hearing, the court specifically warned Stacks of the consequences of a violation of the conditions of his PRS:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court: [Y]ou [are] sentenced to 10 years in the Department of Corrections ... to be followed by 5-years post-release supervision. Pay the minimum fine of $5,000 and all cost of court.\n   <strong>\n    The fine and the court cost will be paid as a condition of the 5-years post-release; which means if you do not pay it, you'll have to pick up and serve the other five. Do you understand that?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Stacks:\n   <strong>\n    Yes, sir.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court: Now, there are some other conditions to a post-release sentence. The other conditions are these: You must be a honest law-abiding citizen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Stacks: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court: You must report to the Department of Corrections as they direct, usually once a month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Stacks: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court: Each time you report, you're required to pay the State of Mississippi $45 as a supervision fee. But if you don't have the money you still report. You can use no illegal drugs: cocaine, LSD, heroin, marijuana, speed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Stacks: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court: No alcohol: beer, wine, or whiskey. And they're going to be testing you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Stacks: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court:\n   <strong>\n    Again, if you violate any of these conditions, Mr. Stacks, you have to pick up and serve the other five years.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Stacks:\n   <strong>\n    Yes, sir.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court: Do you have any questions about the sentence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Stacks: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 3. Stacks completed his ten-year term in MDOC custody in 2016\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was discharged\n   to begin PRS. About six months later, a warrant was issued for his arrest for multiple violations of the conditions of his PRS: he failed to report in July and August 2016, failed to pay his supervision fees, failed to pay his fine and court costs, twice tested positive for amphetamine and methamphetamine, and failed to attend required drug and alcohol treatment. The circuit court held a revocation hearing, found that Stacks had violated the conditions of his PRS, and sentenced him to serve his term of PRS (5 years) in MDOC custody. Stacks subsequently filed a PCR motion challenging his revocation, which the circuit court denied. He then filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 4. Stacks argues that the circuit court lacked authority to sentence him to serve five years in MDOC custody for violating the conditions of his PRS. Stacks argues that his entire sentence had expired before he was placed on PRS because the original sentencing order did not impose a suspended sentence to correspond with his five-year term of PRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 5. This Court rejected the same basic argument in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Anderson originally was sentenced to serve five days in MDOC custody, with no suspended sentence and ten years of PRS.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n    89 So.3d at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 7). Anderson subsequently violated the terms of his PRS, and the circuit court revoked eight years of his PRS and sentenced him to serve the same amount of time in MDOC custody.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n    at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 3). In a PCR motion, Anderson argued that because \"no portion of his sentence was suspended originally ..., the circuit judge could not order him to serve any more time in jail.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n    at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 7). On appeal, this Court rejected \"[t]his assertion [as] clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 6. We first pointed out that at Anderson's original sentencing hearing, the judge clearly informed him that \"he faced up to possibly ten more years in [MDOC] custody\" if he violated the conditions of his PRS, and \"Anderson answered in the affirmative when asked if he understood.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 8). Second, we emphasized that Mississippi Code Annotated section 47-7-34 (Rev. 2015), which governs the imposition and termination of PRS, \"contains no language that a suspended sentence must be given if the circuit court ... wants to impose PRS\" following a term in MDOC custody.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n    at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 9). Thus, we held that even if an offender's original sentence does not expressly include a \"suspended sentence,\" if the offender subsequently violates the conditions of his PRS, the circuit court has the authority to terminate the offender's PRS and recommit the offender to MDOC custody for all or part of the term of PRS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n    at 650-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 9-12). As a practical matter,\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   treats a term of PRS as inclusive of an implied suspended sentence, even if the offender's sentencing order does not expressly reference a suspended sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 7. The result in this case is the same as in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   . At Stacks's plea/sentencing hearing, the circuit court clearly informed him that he faced five additional years in MDOC custody if he violated the conditions of his PRS, and Stacks stated that he understood. In addition, as\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   holds, section 47-7-34 does not require the circuit court to expressly suspend part of the defendant's sentence when the court imposes a term of PRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Therefore, the circuit court had the authority to sentence Stacks to serve five years in MDOC custody after Stacks violated multiple conditions of his PRS. Stacks's argument to the contrary \"is without merit.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n    89 So.3d at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 8. In\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , we stated, \"It is customary procedure for the circuit court to suspend a portion of the sentence when utilizing PRS. For clarity and consistency in sentencing, we encourage such practice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n    at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 10). We further stated that \"the most logical way to utilize PRS is to impose a term of incarceration, suspend a portion of the term, and place the defendant on a period of PRS.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013307\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/89/645/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 11). We again encourage circuit courts to follow this customary practice and to suspend a portion of the offender's sentence when imposing a term of PRS. However, as\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   holds, a technical deviation from this customary practice does not limit the circuit court's authority to terminate an offender's PRS and order him to be recommitted to MDOC custody if the offender violates the conditions of his PRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 9.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   LEE, C.J., GRIFFIS, P.J., BARNES, CARLTON, FAIR, GREENLEE, WESTBROOKS AND TINDELL, JJ., CONCUR.
