Kendall Martin was convicted of possession of more than one kilogram of marijuana with intent to distribute. Martin was sentenced as a subsequent drug offender and as a nonviolent habitual offender to sixty years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections without the possibility of parole. On appeal, Martin argues that the trial court erred by admitting the evidence because the initial traffic stop was not based on probable cause or reasonable suspicion and the stop was unreasonably extended in violation of Martin's Fourth Amendment rights. Martin also argues that the State failed to prove that he was a habitual offender under Mississippi Code Section 99-19-81, and that the trial court erred in sentencing him as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Around 4:55 p.m. on March 27, 2013, Officer Jason Johns, a deputy for the Rankin County Sheriff's Department, was traveling on I-20 eastbound when he observed Kendall Martin cross over the right lane fog line. Martin was traveling in a Chevrolet SUV in front of Officer Johns. At that point, Officer Johns, according to his standard procedure, pulled beside Martin to see if he was wearing a seatbelt and how many occupants were in the vehicle. Officer Johns then dropped back behind Martin, observed him hit the line or \"g[e]t real close to it\" again, and then initiated the traffic stop. The second encroachment upon the fog line was recorded on Officer Johns's car camera.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Officer Johns approached the passenger-side window. When he leaned in to ask for Martin's driver's license and proof of insurance, he could smell an overwhelming odor of air fresheners and a faint odor of marijuana coming from the car. He testified that, in his experience, people who transport drugs use air fresheners to cover the odor. Officer Johns worked as a sergeant and K-9 handler for the Flowood Police Department. He also was a sworn deputy for the Rankin County Sheriff's Department on the drug task force. He testified that he has had hundreds of classes in narcotics and criminal interdiction, and he had \"been doing drug interdiction work pretty much [his] entire career.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Officer Johns asked Martin to step out of the vehicle while he radioed in Martin's driver's license information. Martin told Officer Johns that he was driving back to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, from Austin, Texas, where he had been visiting his cousin for a few days. Martin also handed Officer Johns a personal insurance card for a rental vehicle, which Johns considered suspicious. When the dispatcher radioed back that Martin's driver's license was valid, Officer Johns informed Martin that he had smelled marijuana in the vehicle. He then asked Martin if he could search the car, to which Martin replied, \"it don't matter.\" Before searching the vehicle, Officer Johns asked Martin if he or his cousin had smoked in the vehicle, if anyone else besides Martin had used the vehicle, and if there were any guns in the vehicle. Martin informed Officer Johns that he had driven to Austin in one rental vehicle and had traded it in the night before in Austin to drive back in the bigger SUV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. The smell of marijuana became much stronger when Officer Johns opened the passenger's side door. When he opened the back hatch, the odor of marijuana \"nearly blew [him] down.\" Officer Johns found a black duffel bag that felt like it contained bricks. He testified that he could tell just by feeling the bag that there were illegal narcotics in the bag. Martin was then placed under arrest and read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights. When Officer Johns opened the duffel bag, he found 9.9 pounds of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Martin filed a motion to suppress evidence of the drugs found during the search because the search and seizure violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Martin argued that Officer Johns did not have reasonable suspicion to stop him, and that the stop was in reality motivated by racial profiling. He also argued that Officer Johns illegally extended the stop to search the car after the investigation of the traffic violation had concluded. At the suppression hearing, Officer Johns testified that he pulled Martin over for careless driving after observing him twice cross or bump the fog line, which he believed to constitute a violation of Mississippi Code Section 63-3-1213. The trial court found that there\n   was sufficient probable cause for the stop and there was no unreasonable delay in the search, and, therefore, denied the motion to suppress. After a jury trial, Martin was found guilty of possession of more than one kilogram of marijuana with intent to distribute. Because Martin had four prior felony drug convictions, the trial court sentenced him as a habitual offender and subsequent drug offender to sixty years without the possibility of parole in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. \"Whether probable cause or reasonable suspicion exists is subject to a de novo review.

In reversing the district court, the Fifth Circuit concluded from the broad language of Section 63-3-1213 and the cases from the Mississippi Court of Appeals \"that a traffic stop for careless driving is justified in Mississippi when a law enforcement officer observes an automobile hit the fog line.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=592%20Fed.%20Appx.%20246\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=592%20Fed.%20Appx.%20246\">\n    at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court found that an officer's observation of just one hit of the fog line constitutes sufficient probable cause that a violation of Mississippi's careless-driving statute has occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20. Here we have two incidences. First, we have the testimony of Officer Johns, upon which the trial court relied, that the officer had observed Martin's vehicle cross the fog line once before the camera began recording. The second incident is seen in the video of the stop. Martin's vehicle comes close to the fog line, if not contacting it. Officer Johns testified that he believed it had touched the fog line. As in\n   <em>\n    Dominick\n   </em>\n   , the video does not contradict Officer Johns's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 21. Martin argues that there is no evidence that Officer Johns had probable cause to believe that a traffic violation had occurred, and that the video evidence contradicts Officer Johns's testimony. The Court discerns no instance in which the video contradicts Officer Johns's testimony. Martin's argument also seems to discount the fact that the officer testified to observing Martin's vehicle cross the fog line before the video began recording. The trial judge found the officer's testimony to be credible, and the Court holds that it was not clear error for him to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22. Martin also argues that Officer Johns admitted that he had not decided to stop Martin until he pulled beside him and could see that Martin was a black male driving a car with out-of-state license plate, which is evidence that the stop was based on racial profiling. However, that is not what Officer Johns stated or what should be inferred from his statement. Officer Johns testified that he had not definitively made the decision to stop the vehicle until he dropped back behind the vehicle and observed it hit the fog line again, but he already had initiated his standard stop procedure after the first observed cross of the fog line. The video of the traffic stop corroborates Officer Johns's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23. Martin further argues that the fact that Officer Johns told Martin that he was not going to issue a traffic citation for careless driving is indicative of racial profiling. After Martin already had consented\n   to a search of the vehicle, Officer Johns told Martin that he was not going to write him a ticket for crossing the fog line. He then informed Martin that he was going to check the vehicle, and, \"if everything checks out, you'll be on your way.\" \" 'There is no requirement that an officer issue a citation for the predicate traffic violation to have a valid stop or search.' \"\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Because Officer Johns observed Martin's vehicle cross the fog line once, and then again approach or \"bump\" the fog line, and the video evidence, while unclear, does not directly contradict Officer Johns's testimony, the Court holds that there is sufficient evidence that Officer Johns had probable cause to believe that Martin had driven \"in a careless or imprudent manner, without due regard for the width ... and use of the streets and highways\" in violation of Section 63-3-1213.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Officer Johns had probable cause to search the vehicle as soon as he smelled marijuana, and thus, the stop was not unconstitutionally extended.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 25. Martin next argues that, even if Officer Johns had probable cause to stop Martin, the detention became illegal after the investigation of the reason for the initial stop was over. When an officer observes a traffic violation, he has probable cause to detain that person long enough to issue a traffic citation.\n   <em>\n    Floyd v.

In the present case, Officer Johns testified that he smelled an overwhelming odor of air fresheners and an odor of marijuana as soon as he leaned in the window to retrieve Martin's license and insurance card. He testified that in his experience, that meant drugs were present. The video of the stop does not contradict Officer Johns's testimony.

Therefore, as soon as Officer Johns smelled the marijuana at the beginning of the stop, he had probable cause to search the vehicle.

After giving consent, Officer Johns asked a few more questions to determine if anyone else had been in the vehicle, when the vehicle had been rented, and how long Martin had been driving.

He was arrested again on February 15, 2006, and convicted of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance on September 6, 2006. Martin was sentenced to eight years in custody for that offense. Finally, he was arrested on June 6, 2006, for trafficking cocaine. He pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a controlled substance on September 6, 2006, and was sentenced to fifteen years in custody. That sentence was ordered to be served concurrently with Martin's other three sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 31. Martin argues that he was sentenced incorrectly as a habitual offender under Section 99-19-81 because his sentences for four prior felonies were served concurrently and not consecutively. In\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. State\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that \"[t]he appellant contends that concurrent sentences are not 'separate terms' required by the statute for sentencing as a recidivist. There is no merit to Martin's contention. The language of the statute requires sentencing to separate terms, specifically omitting the requirement that they must be served separately, or that they must be served at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

The trial court properly allowed the evidence obtained during the search of Martin's vehicle. The officer had probable cause to stop the vehicle based on a reasonable belief that a traffic violation had occurred. Then, as soon as the officer smelled the odor of marijuana, he had probable cause and consent to search the vehicle. The officer did not prolong the stop improperly. Further, the trial court properly sentenced Martin as a habitual offender because the State presented evidence that Martin previously had served concurrent sentences for four prior drug offenses. Concurrent sentences for different crimes are separate sentences under the habitual offender statute. Martin's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 33.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   RANDOLPH, P.J., MAXWELL, BEAM AND CHAMBERLIN, JJ., CONCUR.

Officer Jason Johns's traffic stop of Kendall Martin was not, in fact, based upon probable cause. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying Martin's motion to suppress, and I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 35. The Mississippi careless driving statute provides that: \"[a]ny person who drives any vehicle in a careless or imprudent manner, without due regard for the width, grade, curves, corner, traffic and use of the streets and highways and all other attendant circumstances is guilty of careless driving,\" which \"shall be considered a lesser offense than reckless driving.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2063-3-1213\">\n    Miss.

I agree with the majority that a law enforcement officer has\n   <em>\n    probable cause\n   </em>\n   to initiate a traffic stop upon observation of the commission of a traffic violation. Maj. Op. \u00b6 12 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At the hearing on Martin's motion to suppress, Officer Johns testified that while driving eastbound on I-20, at about the 66-mile marker, he observed a Chevrolet SUV, which later he determined was being driven by Martin, \"[run] over the right lane fog line.\" Officer Johns then \"pulled up next to him on the driver's side, because I look inside the vehicles before I stop then, and made sure he had his seatbelt on, and then pulled in behind him, stopped him.\" Officer Johns says that he stopped Martin for careless driving. The officer testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress that he made the decision to stop Martin's vehicle \"[w]hen I seen him hit the line ....\" At trial, Officer Johns testified that, after observing the vehicle \"[run] over the fog line\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the right side of the roadway,\" he then \"got up beside\" the vehicle for the purpose of observing \"who's in the vehicle,\" whether the vehicle's occupants were seatbelted, and \"how many occupants are in the vehicle for officer safety.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 37. When he ascertained that the vehicle's sole occupant was wearing a seatbelt, Sergeant Johns slowed down and \"dropped in behind\" the vehicle. He then observed the vehicle get \"real close to\" the fog line. It was at that point that Sergeant Johns activated his blue lights and pulled the vehicle over for careless driving at about the 68-mile marker, west of the Pelahatchie exit. Sergeant Johns approached the passenger side of the vehicle, examined the driver's license and insurance cards, and determined that the driver was Kendall Martin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 38. At trial, Officer Johns testified that he had not decided to pull Martin over after perceiving that he \"ran over the fog line,\" but rather that he had been \"in the process of pulling him over.\" He then stated that \"I don't know if I would have stopped him if he had not\n   <em>\n    hit it\n   </em>\n   again or if I would.\" (Emphasis added.) When asked specifically whether he had intended to pull Martin over\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   having observed him running over the fog line, Officer Johns stated the following: \"I don't know. Probably I might have let him go, but when he\n   <em>\n    hit it\n   </em>\n   again, I mean, that did it.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 39. Officer Johns failed to describe the point at which he decided to pull Martin\n   over and whether his decision was triggered by Martin's having \"[run] over the fog line\" or his having later come \"real close\" to it. Officer Johns's testimony lacked consistency with regard to Martin's latter encounter with the fog line. He could not articulate whether Martin had \"hit\" the fog line or whether he had come \"real close\" to it. And the video of the stop does not, as the majority finds, support Officer Johns's testimony. Maj.

To the extent Officer Johns testified that Martin's vehicle came \"real close\" to the fog line, such observation, standing alone, would have provided no probable cause for Officer Johns to initiate a traffic stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2063-3-603\">\n    Miss.

No violation of Section 63-3-1213 occurs when a person drives\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the \"width, grade, curves, corner, traffic and use of the streets ....\" Officer Johns lacked probable cause to stop Martin for coming \"real close\" to, but remaining\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the \"width, grade, curves, corner, traffic and use of the streets ....\" Such driving does not constitute a traffic violation.

And this Court, in holding that Section 63-3-1213 was not unconstitutionally vague, also held that the statute requires a showing of negligence: \"the statute echoes the familiar tort law standard, requiring that drivers on Mississippi roads exercise the same standard of care as a prudent person would in the same circumstances.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Leuer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11548097\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/744/266/\">\n    744 So.2d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit also upheld the statute with the understanding that \"[b]ecause it applies only to conduct that is negligent, such that the conduct endangers the motorist or others, the Mississippi law does not empower the police to punish whatever conduct they choose.\"\n   <em>\n    Escalante\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076291\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/678/\">\n    239 F.3d 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It is true, as the majority has observed, that this Court has upheld a finding of probable cause in the context of a mistaken but reasonable belief that the that the accused was operating a vehicle in violation of the traffic laws.\n   <em>\n    Harrison v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9472914\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/800/1134/#p1139\">\n    800 So.2d 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1139 (Miss. 2001) (\"In the instant case, the two deputies paced Harrison as driving between 67-70 miles per hour, which was in violation of the posted sixty (60) mile per hour speed limit. Regardless of whether there were construction workers present in the area the deputies had an objective reasonable basis for believing that Harrison violated the traffic laws of Mississippi by exceeding the speed limit.\"). In the context of the careless driving statute, where the standard is negligence, an \"objective reasonable basis\" for a probable cause traffic stop requires more than a singular instance of crossing or bumping the fog line, particularly in light of our mandate to construe criminal statutes strictly against the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 48. In\n   <em>\n    Escalante\n   </em>\n   , Judge Carl E. Stewart\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   observed in dissent that the goal of the officer who stopped Escalante's vehicle \"was obviously not to catch speeders but instead to employ his drug-sniffing dog.\"\n   <em>\n    Escalante\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076291\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/678/\">\n    239 F.3d at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Stewart, J., dissenting). Here, Officer Johns testified that he is \"assigned to a specialized drug task force with the Rankin County Sheriff's Department\" and that he had \"been doing drug interdiction work pretty much my entire career.\" He stated that \"drug interdiction\" involves enforcing traffic laws and apprehending \"criminals during that process.\" But I, as was Judge Stewart, am\n   skeptical that Officer Johns's purpose that day was to catch violators of the careless driving statute. Instead, Officer Johns noticed a Chevrolet SUV with Texas plates \"[run] over the fog line\" once, determined the vehicle was being driven by an African-American man, and admittedly pulled up beside the vehicle to see \"if he's wearing a seatbelt.\" Because the vehicle's occupant was lawfully belted, Officer Johns waited until the vehicle got \"real close\" to the fog line before initiating a stop. The entire exercise was undertaken solely for the purpose of manufacturing a pretextual excuse to stop the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 49. No Mississippi statute criminalizes a motorist's touching a fog line with the tires or any other part of a vehicle, driving across a fog line, or interacting with a fog line in any manner whatsoever. In fact, no Mississippi statute even mentions a \"fog line,\" nor does any regulation of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, the Mississippi Department of Transportation, or any other agency of the Mississippi government. Other than the \"judge-made law\" crafted by our Court of Appeals, Mississippi jurisprudence stands utterly mute on the subject of so-called fog lines. Nothing in our laws or regulations tells the public what a fog line is, what a fog line is for, where, if anywhere, such a thing should be placed on a roadway, who, if anyone, has the authority to decide whether or where to place one, or how to pay for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 50. While law enforcement efforts to curb drug trafficking through the State of Mississippi are necessary and laudable, they must be performed in a manner consistent with the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 3, Section 23, of the Mississippi Constitution. Because Officer Johns did not have an objective, reasonable basis for stopping Martin's vehicle and because the trial court should have granted the motion to suppress the fruits of the illegal search, I would reverse and render his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   WALLER, C.J., AND KING, J., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Officer Johns described the \"fog line\" as \"the white line that runs on the outside lane before you hit the-wake-up bumpers.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The majority references\n    <em>\n     Dominick v.
