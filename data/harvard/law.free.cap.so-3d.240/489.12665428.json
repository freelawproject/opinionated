Lakeisha and Keith Bowdry appeal the circuit court's dismissal of their negligence claims based on discovery violations. This case considers whether the dismissal was appropriate under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 37 and\n   <em>\n    Pierce v. Heritage Properties, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/\">\n    688 So.2d 1385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1997). We find reversible error and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On April 15, 2011, Keith was on duty as a Tupelo police officer. He was pulling out of a Texaco gas station when his vehicle collided with another vehicle traveling on South Gloster Street in Tupelo, Mississippi. As a result of the accident, Keith was taken to North Mississippi Medical Center where he was treated for complaints of pain in his head, neck, left knee, and lower back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Keith and his wife Lakeisha filed a complaint against T. Mart Inc. and Tommy Brooks Oil Company (collectively \"T. Mart\"), the owners of the Texaco gas station. The complaint alleged that the shrubbery on T. Mart's property negligently inhibited the sight line of an exiting vehicle. Keith sought to recover damages from the accident, and Lakeisha sought damages for loss of consortium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Keith was served with interrogatories related to his prior medical history and treatment. He was asked whether he ever had been involved in any other accident or incident or if he had any illness or sickness of any kind of any type or severity that required or resulted in him being seen or treated by any medical professional. In response, Keith disclosed a motor-vehicle accident that occurred on August 25, 2005, in a Tupelo Walmart parking lot. Keith's response did not provide information as to any injuries that resulted from the accident. But, the response stated that Keith saw two separate medical providers and a physical therapist following the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Keith later was deposed by T. Mart. Keith was asked whether he ever had experienced prior neck problems, and he responded that he had not. Keith also was asked about lower-back issues, and he responded-\"[n]ot lower back.\" After the deposition, T. Mart obtained Keith's prior medical records. The records revealed that he had received medical treatment for his neck and lower back after the 2005 accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. T. Mart believed Keith's discovery responses were false. T. Mart then filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2) and 37(e). After a hearing, the trial court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice. The trial court concluded that, under the circumstances, no sanction less than dismissal would be appropriate to satisfy the deterrent value of Rule 37. Also, because Lakeisha's claim was derivative in nature, it too was dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. \"A trial court's dismissal of a cause of action as a sanction for discovery abuse is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Avare v.

The supreme court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   provides us with the framework we must consider in this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Pierce contends that the circuit court erred and abused its discretion by imposing the sanction of dismissal with prejudice, thereby barring her from any recovery for injuries caused when the ceiling fan fell on her. Specifically, the appellant argues that the trial court misapplied\n   Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2) by imposing the \"death penalty\" and dismissing her lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The decision to impose sanctions for discovery abuse is vested in the trial court's discretion. The provisions for imposing sanctions are designed to give the court great latitude. The power to dismiss is inherent in any court of law or equity, being a means necessary to orderly expedition of justice and the court's control of its own docket. Nevertheless, the trial court should dismiss a cause of action for failure to comply with discovery only under the most extreme circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/\">\n    688 So.2d at 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).

T. Mart obtained Keith's medical records. The records included the following information about Keith's medical care for injuries he received in the accident:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   1. On April 4, 2005, Keith was treated at Plantersville Clinic for low back pain that had started a few days prior. The Plantersville Clinic record shows that Keith had \"low back pain, started Saturday.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   2. In August 2005, Keith was involved in an automobile accident and was treated at North Mississippi Medical Center. His chief complaint was characterized as \"MVA THIS A.M. C/O LOW BACK PAIN[;] UNRESTRAINED DRIVER.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   3. On August 31, 2005, Keith was at Plantersville Clinic due to continued pain from the accident. The record shows that Keith \"had MVA last Thursday, hurts from neck all the way down back\" and \"leg weakness and burning sense [after] MVA-hurting at night in back and legs.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   4. The injury was severe enough to necessitate MRIs of the lumbar spine, thoracic spine[,] and cervical spine. On each of the MRI reports, the indication was \"neck and back pain.\" The MRI of the cervical spine showed \"mild reversal of the normal lordotic curvature of the cervical spine\" and \"mild disc osteophyte complex mainly at the C3-C4 and C4-C5 levels but borderline to mild spinal stenosis as described.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   5. Also, Keith was at North Mississippi Medical Center on September 10, 2005, due to \"neck and back problems, wreck 8/25/05.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   6. Further, in October 2005, Keith was at Plantersville Clinic due to \"L shoulder pain-hurts to raise arm, low back pain, neck pain, needs excuse for light duty[,]\" and, \"burns down into buttock. Lumbar back.\" He was diagnosed with shoulder strain and lumbar strain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   7. Five days later, Keith was a patient at Semmes Murphey Neurologic &amp; Spine Institute. He complained of \"left shoulder, neck[,] and back pain, without radicular symptomatology\" and \"severe pain in his back.\" A physical examination was performed[,] which showed \"cervical range of motion is limited on forward flexion, hyperextension[,] and lateral bending[.] He also has some myofascial trigger points in the lumbar area with a restricted range of motion in the lumbar spine on forward flexion and hypertension.\" He was diagnosed with \"cervical and lumbar spasms,\" and physical therapy was prescribed due to \"cerv/LB pain.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   8. He returned to Semmes Murphey Clinic in November 2005 due to \"lumbar myofascial pain\" as well as shoulder pain. Keith was again noted to have \"cervical myofascial spasms\" and \"lumbar myofascial spasms.\" He was prescribed \"aggressive\n   physical therapy for myofascial release of the cervical and lumbar areas[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 15. From this evidence, the trial judge granted the motion to dismiss and ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A comparison of Keith Bowdry's answers to interrogatories and deposition testimony with his pre-accident medical records show that he intentionally and deceitfully misrepresented his pre-existing medical condition with respect to his neck and back. Mississippi's appellate courts have consistently found this type of concealment of facts to be willful and in bad faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 16.

This Court determined that dismissal was appropriate because the plaintiff had acted in bad faith, and that any sanction other than dismissal would virtually allow the plaintiff to get away with lying under oath .... The Court noted, however, that it would remain very reluctant to affirm such a harsh sanction, and did so in that case only because it provided the\n   <em>\n    paradigm\n   </em>\n   situation in which the plaintiff knowingly refused to be forthcoming and actively withheld the truth from the court and gave a great deal of perjured testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   In other cases in which this Court has affirmed dismissal, the discovery violations were similarly egregious.

This Court affirmed, again noting that this case presented a rare instance where the conduct of a party is so egregious that no other sanction will meet the demands of justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   More recently, in\n   <em>\n    Ashmore v. Mississippi Authority on Educational Television\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922325\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/977/#p985\">\n    148 So.3d 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 985 (Miss. 2014), we affirmed a dismissal where the plaintiff had lied by concealing a right-knee surgery and degenerative joint disease in his right knee. The plaintiff also had hidden the existence of a subsequent left-knee injury or degenerative disc disease in his back, despite medical reports to the contrary. Once again, the discovery violations that justified dismissal were clear and unequivocal falsehoods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   However, where the discovery violation at issue is less extreme and open to potential truthful interpretations, this Court will not hesitate to reverse a trial court's Rule 37 dismissal.

This Court reversed, finding that the only discovery response which was contradicted by evidence at the hearing on the motion to dismiss was one ambiguously worded response to one interrogatory question.\" As the plaintiff's response indicated that he could still perform certain tasks, just with less enjoyment than before, the Court held that the defendants did not establish that the plaintiff knowingly made false statements in discovery and it was certainly not established that the plaintiff had engaged in a pattern of such false responses. The Court held that the alleged untruthfulness in Wood's interrogatories, if any, d[id] not constitute a sufficiently egregious discovery violation such that no other sanction will meet the demands of justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   We find the discovery violation in this case to be more similar to the alleged discovery violation in\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   than the unequivocally false and misleading discovery violations found in\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Scoggins\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Ashmore\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff stated that he could no longer enjoy certain activities as he could before being injured. Here, Kinzie stated that he could not perform several activities as he could before his injury. He was truthful when it came to his medical record and his medically diagnosed work restrictions. Kinzie indisputably was injured. He went to an emergency room immediately after his accident and, at that time, was diagnosed with central-disc protrusion, disc desiccation, and disc bulging. He underwent an invasive surgical procedure on his spine. The activity observed in the undercover video did not stray outside of his medical work restrictions, and it did not encompass any of the specific activities that he stated he no longer could perform. The trial court found this to be a discovery violation. While the trial court cannot be said to have been manifestly wrong in its determination that there was, in fact, a discovery violation, the severe sanction of dismissal amounts to clear, reversible error amounting to an abuse of discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Kinzie did not blatantly lie about the existence of a witness, as did the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   , nor did he completely misrepresent years of medical history and procedures, as did the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Scoggins\n   </em>\n   , nor did he hide any other surgeries, as did the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Ashmore\n   </em>\n   . The Court finds no \"total lack of congruence\" between Kinzie's responses and his medical records, as the trial court found in\n   <em>\n    Scoggins\n   </em>\n   . Nor do we find this to be the paradigm situation in which the plaintiff knowingly refused to be forthcoming and actively withheld the truth from the court and gave a great deal of perjured testimony as this Court found in\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   . Instead, and similar to the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   , Kinzie answered an interrogatory about the extent of his injuries in a way that the trial court thought was misleading. And here, although the trial court found Kinzie's response to be false, the perceived falsehood arose in an isolated incident, and it certainly has not been established that Kinzie's statements in discovery indicate any kind of pattern of misleading or false responses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Analogously, this Court has reversed a trial court's dismissal based on Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) where the trial court failed to consider lesser sanctions, including fines, costs, or damages against plaintiff or his counsel, attorney disciplinary measures, conditional dismissal, dismissal without prejudice, and explicit warnings. Just as this Court found then, in this case, it is not at all certain that lesser sanctions would have been futile in expediting the proceedings. Although we do not find, as did the Court of Appeals, that the trial court abused its discretion when it determined that Kinzie had committed a discovery violation, we hold that the trial court erred when it dismissed the case completely as a result of that violation while paying mere lip service to the possibility and practicality of lesser sanctions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Dismissal is appropriate only under the most extreme circumstances and only where lesser sanctions will not suffice. This is not an extreme case, and lesser sanctions can deter misleading responses without dismissing Kinzie's claims altogether. A jury will watch this video, and that may influence its ultimate determination. But a jury ought to make that ultimate determination, not the trial judge. The discovery violation at issue is not sufficiently extreme to justify a full and final dismissal of the case. We therefore affirm that portion of the judgment of the Court of Appeals which held that dismissal with prejudice was not warranted. We reverse the Court of Appeals' finding that the trial court abused its discretion when it determined that Kinzie had committed a discovery violation. We reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County dismissing the case with prejudice, and we remand the case for trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 18. The supreme court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Kinzie\n   </em>\n   applies here. Dismissal was simply not a reasonable sanction. T. Mart argues that Keith made intentional and deceitful misrepresentations. However, we find no evidence to support the conclusion that Keith intentionally misled or blatantly lied when he testified that he had not suffered prior neck and lower-back problems. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   , Keith's interrogatory responses and the reasonably expected discovery efforts of the defendants led to the medical records that may contradict Keith's deposition testimony. Certainly, these medical records may be offered to attack Keith's credibility at trial and to accurately present evidence of his prior medical history and condition. However, under these circumstances, a lesser sanction of attorney's fees and costs associated with obtaining the medical records would be an appropriate sanction. Dismissal is certainly not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 19. The judicial administration of civil claims is governed by the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. These Rules provide the mechanism for bringing civil claims, to obtain discovery, and to attain a resolution. Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 1 provides that \"[t]hese rules govern procedure in the circuit courts ... in all suits of a civil nature .... These rules shall be construed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\" Here, we must construe how the trial court applied Rule 37. Appellate courts often recognize that a litigant \" 'is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one,' for there are no perfect trials.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Likewise, there are no perfect trials in civil cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 20. Yet, the dissent seeks perfection in discovery. At trial, T. Mart will have the ability to cross-examine and impeach Keith about his deposition testimony versus his medical records. The jury will then be able to assess his credibility and reach a fair verdict based on the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 21. The facts of this case simply do not rise to the level of deception or concealment in\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Eaton v. Frisby\n   </em>\n   , as argued by the dissent. Instead, this is similar, if not identical, to this Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Westfall v.

In\n   <em>\n    Westfall\n   </em>\n   , we noted that anytime a defendant asks for dismissal of the action for a discovery violation, the trial judge and this Court must begin with the important admonition in\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   -dismissal is appropriate \"only under the most extreme circumstances\" and only where lesser sanctions will not suffice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204511138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204511138\">\n    2017 WL 4511138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (\u00b6 21) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/\">\n    688 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1388-89 ).

Mart for injuries Keith claimed to have sustained as the result of a motor vehicle accident that occurred as he was exiting a Texaco station. Keith alleged that shrubbery on T.

Lakeisha filed a claim for loss of consortium-a derivative claim stemming from Keith's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 26. During the course of pretrial discovery, T. Mart served Keith with interrogatories related to his prior medical history and treatment. Specifically, the interrogatories asked whether Keith ever had been involved in any other accident or incident, or had any illness or sickness of any kind and of any type or severity, which required or resulted in him being seen or treated by any medical professional. Keith responded with information regarding a 2005 accident in a Tupelo Wal-Mart parking lot. However, he failed to provide any information as to any injuries that resulted from the accident. Keith did state that he saw two separate medical providers following the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 27. T. Mart later deposed Keith and further questioned him regarding his medical history. When asked whether he ever had experienced prior neck problems, Keith responded that he had not. When asked whether he ever had experienced prior lower back issues, Keith responded, \"Not lower back.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 28. Following Keith's deposition, T.

Mart filed a motion to dismiss Keith's complaint pursuant to Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2) and 37(e), claiming that Keith provided \"willful, false deposition testimony and grossly evasive, misleading discovery responses.\" Following a hearing, the circuit court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice, concluding that under the circumstances, no sanction less than dismissal would be appropriate to satisfy the deterrent value of Rule 37.

Keith argues that the circuit court erred in finding that he wilfully misrepresented his medical history during discovery. As stated, Keith's medical records reflect that he received injuries to his neck, lower back, and shoulder as the result of a car accident in 2005. However, during Keith's deposition, T. Mart's counsel asked Keith whether he had any prior problems with his neck and lower back. Keith denied ever suffering any lower back problems, and he mentioned only the removal of a cyst from the back of his neck when he was in eighth grade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 32. At the hearing before the circuit court, Keith denied that he provided false testimony. In support of his argument, Keith asserted that he had not signed some of the prior medical records.

The circuit court found these arguments without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 33. On appeal, however, Keith now argues that he did not lie about the injuries stemming from the 2005 car accident; rather, Keith asserts that he \"merely forgot\" that he suffered neck and lower back pain.

A consideration of the facts presented herein ... demonstrates that [Keith]'s misrepresentation regarding his pre-existing medical condition was willful and in bad faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The record clearly supports the circuit court's findings as to this factor. Regarding his prior medical history, Keith was specifically asked the following through T. Mart's interrogatories:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     INTERROGATORY NUMBER 9\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : Before or after the date of the occurrence which is the subject of this action, had you ever been involved in any other accident or incident or had any illness or sickness of any kind and of any type or severity, which required you to be seen or resulted in your being seen or treated by any doctor, hospital[,] or other medical provider? If so, please state in detail the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (a) The date and place of the accident, incident, illness[,] or sickness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   (b) A description of the accident, incident, illness[,] or sickness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   (c) Names, addresses and phone numbers of witnesses to the accident, incident, illness[,] or sickness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (d) The name of the defendant (or person or entity against whom you made your claim), if lawsuit, action[,] or claim was made on your behalf;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (e) The court or other tribunal where any action or claim was filed, together with any identifying action number;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (f) The names, addresses[,] and phone numbers of all medical doctors, any other medical personnel, hospitals, or other medical facilities or medical providers wherein you received treatment as a result of the accident, incident, illness[,] or sickness[ ] identified above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     RESPONSE TO INTERROGATORY NUMBER 9\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : [Keith] was involved in an automobile accident in 2005 on the Wal-Mart parking lot in Tupelo, Mississippi, when [Keith's] vehicle was struck by a vehicle being driven the wrong way by an employee of Lencare Medical Supply. [Keith] does not recall the name of the driver. [Keith] was seen by a doctor at Semmes Murphy Neurologic and Spine Institute ...; Debra Hill, NP, and Reenea Willis, PT, of Rehab Solutions, PLLC. No lawsuit was filed, however, [Keith] was compensated for damages by the insurance company for Lencare Medical Supply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     INTERROGATORY NUMBER 10\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : Please identify the names, addresses and phone numbers of your regular family\n   doctor and the names, addresses and phone numbers of any other medical doctors or any other medical personnel not previously listed, who have treated you or given you any medical advice for the past ten years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     RESPONSE TO INTERROGATORY NUMBER 10\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : Dr. Norris Crump-898 Lynden Blvd., Tupelo, MS 38801[;] and Debra Hill, NP-Plantersville Clinic, 2489 Main St., Plantersville, MS 38862[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 39. Keith's subsequent deposition-testimony addressed the medical records reflecting that Keith injured his neck, lower back, and shoulder as the result of a car accident in 2005. During Keith's deposition, T. Mart's counsel asked Keith whether he suffered any problems with his neck, head, or lower back prior to the accident at issue. Keith denied ever suffering any lower back problems or headaches before the accident, and he mentioned only the removal of a cyst from the back of his neck when he was in eighth grade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 40. Following the information provided by Keith in his sworn answers to interrogatories and deposition testimony, T. Mart obtained Keith's prior medical records, which reflected a vast medical history. T. Mart included Keith's medical records in its motion to dismiss and attached the records for the circuit court to review. The circuit court accordingly dismissed Keith's complaint after finding that he had misrepresented his prior medical history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 41. A review of Keith's medical records herein reflects that Keith indeed suffered from neck and low back pain beginning in April 2005, six years before the accident at issue in this case. These medical records reveal the following relevant treatment sought by Keith in response to suffering from neck and low back pain:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    April 4, 2005\n   </strong>\n   -Keith received treatment at the Plantersville Clinic for\n   <em>\n    low back pain\n   </em>\n   that started two days earlier.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    August 25, 2005\n   </strong>\n   -Keith was involved in an automobile accident and received treatment at North Mississippi Medical Center. The record from North Mississippi Medical Center reflects that Keith's chief complaint was \"\n   <em>\n    LOW BACK PAIN\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    August 31, 2005\n   </strong>\n   -Keith returned to the Plantersville Clinic for treatment due to continued pain from the accident. The records states that Keith complained that he \"\n   <em>\n    hurts from neck all the way down back[,] has burning pain\n   </em>\n   \" and had suffered \"leg weakness and burning since [the motor vehicle accident]-\n   <em>\n    hurting at night in back and legs\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    September 9, 2005\n   </strong>\n   -Keith received MRIs of the lumbar spine, thoracic spine, and cervical spine. On each of the MRI reports, the indication was \"\n   <em>\n    neck and back pain\n   </em>\n   .\" The MRI of the cervical spine showed \"mild reversal of the normal lordotic curvature of the cervical spine\" and \"mild disc osteophyte complex mainly at the C3-C4 and C4-C5 levels but borderline to mild spinal stenosis as described.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    September 10, 2005\n   </strong>\n   -Keith received treatment at North Mississippi Medical Center due to \"\n   <em>\n    neck and back problems\n   </em>\n   \" from the August 2005 wreck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    October 14, 2005\n   </strong>\n   -Keith received treatment at the Plantersville Clinic due to \"[left] shoulder pain.\" The record shows that Keith complained that it hurt to \"raise [his] arm\" and he suffered from \"\n   <em>\n    low back pain, neck pain\n   </em>\n   \" that \"burns down into [his] buttock.\" The record reflects that Keith stated that physical therapy \"does not help\" and that he was not taking any medicine. Keith was then diagnosed with \"shoulder strain and\n   <em>\n    lumbar strain\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    October 19, 2005\n   </strong>\n   -Keith received treatment at Semmes Murphey Neurologic &amp; Spine Institute. There, Keith complained of \"left shoulder,\n   <em>\n    neck and back pain\n   </em>\n   , without radicular symptomatology.\" Keith also complained of \"\n   <em>\n    severe pain in his back\n   </em>\n   \" when he had to stand for prolonged periods. A doctor performed a physical examination which showed \"cervical range of motion is limited on forward flexion, hyperextension[,] and lateral bending.... [Keith] has some\n   <em>\n    myofascial trigger points in the lumbar area with a restricted range of motion in the lumbar spine\n   </em>\n   on forward flexion and hypertension.\" Keith was diagnosed with \"\n   <em>\n    cervical and lumbar spasms\n   </em>\n   \" and \"left rotator cuff strain.\" The doctor prescribed physical therapy due to \"cerv/LB pain\" and \"rotator cuff pain.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    November 11, 2005\n   </strong>\n   -Keith returned to Semmes Murphey Clinic due to \"\n   <em>\n    lumbar myofascial pain\n   </em>\n   \" as well as shoulder pain. The record reflects the doctor assessed that Keith suffered from \"cervical myofascial spasms\" and \"\n   <em>\n    lumbar myofascial spasms\n   </em>\n   .\" As a result, the doctor prescribed \"\n   <em>\n    aggressive physical therapy for myofascial release of the cervical and lumbar areas\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   (Emphasis added). As stated, in light of this evidence, the circuit court found that Keith had wilfully and in bad faith misrepresented his prior medical history, thus favoring dismissal of his cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 42. In\n   <em>\n    Eaton Corp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951883\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/133/735/#p748\">\n    133 So.3d at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 60), the supreme court found \"no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision to impose [a] monetary sanction issued [as the result of serious pretrial discovery misconduct], despite the absence of a motion to compel.\" The\n   <em>\n    Eaton\n   </em>\n   court held that \"gross indifference\" or \"willful negligence\" of a discovery requirement are both are \" 'willful' violations and an abuse of the truth-seeking process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951883\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/133/735/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951883\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/133/735/#p748\">\n    at 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 49). The supreme court further explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   A willful violation of a discovery rule occurs when there is a conscious or intentional failure to comply with the rule's requirements. A finding of willfulness may be based upon either a willful, intentional, and bad faith attempt to conceal evidence or a gross indifference to discovery obligations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951883\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/133/735/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/\">\n    688 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1388 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6 43. In his brief to this Court, Keith admits that he \"was wrong when he denied having ever complained of neck and lower back pain prior to the 2011 accident.\" As such, I find the evidence sufficient to support the circuit court's conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conklin v. Boyd Gaming Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7028473\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/75/589/#p595\">\n    75 So.3d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595 (\u00b6 19) (Miss. Ct. App. 2011) (finding willfulness where plaintiff knew he had undergone prior treatment for injuries but chose not to admit such during discovery).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 44. As to the second\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   factor-whether Rule 37's deterrent value could be achieved through less drastic sanctions-the circuit court found dismissal was the only proper remedy. I agree, as \"[t]he other sanctions considered by the [trial] court would not achieve the deterrent value of the dismissal.... [A]ny other sanction beside dismissal would virtually allow the plaintiff to get away with lying under oath without a meaningful penalty[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/\">\n    688 So.2d at 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 45. Next, regarding the factor of prejudice, the circuit court found that Keith's false representations indeed prejudiced T. Mart, thus weighing in favor of dismissal. Keith, however, argues on appeal that because the misrepresentations were discovered prior to trial, no prejudice resulted. I disagree. First, \"there is no requirement that the defendant be substantially prejudiced by the absence of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (holding substantial prejudice is a mere consideration of the court, not a requirement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Second, there is nothing in the record to illustrate that the circuit court erred in finding Keith's conduct prejudiced T. Mart during trial preparation. As such, I agree with the circuit court as to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6 46. Finally, the circuit court found that Keith's deceptive responses were in no way attributable to his attorneys, nor were the inquiries regarding his prior medical history confusing. To that point, Keith makes no argument on appeal as to confusion or misunderstanding-again, he merely asserts that he \"forgot.\" As that argument is procedurally barred, I find the record-evidence supports the circuit court's finding as to this prong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8411028\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/934/1006/#p1012\">\n    934 So.2d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1012 (\u00b6 16) (Miss. 2006). This issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 47. In sum, I acknowledge that \"[d]ismissal with prejudice is a sanction that should be imposed only in those rare instances where the conduct of a party is so egregious that no other sanction will meet the demands of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Scoggins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11562435\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/743/990/\">\n    743 So.2d at 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 36). \"Further, where a party has frustrated the orderly judicial process by false or erroneous responses to interrogatories, that party should not be able to argue that its own conduct has removed it beyond the reach of sanctions.\"\n   <em>\n    Avare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845653\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/178/796/#p798\">\n    178 So.3d at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 15). In order \"to reverse the trial court's decision, this Court must have a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon weighing of relevant factors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845653\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/178/796/#p798\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/\">\n    688 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1388 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6 48. The record reflects that the circuit court weighed the relevant\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   factors and applied them to the evidence in the record. I can find no error warranting reversal. I thus find that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it held that any sanction less than dismissal would not adequately serve Rule 37's deterrent purpose. Accordingly, I would affirm the circuit court's judgment dismissing Keith's claim with prejudice. And because Lakeisha's loss-of-consortium claim is derivative of Keith's, I also would affirm the circuit court's judgment dismissing her claim with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J &amp; J Timber Co. v.
