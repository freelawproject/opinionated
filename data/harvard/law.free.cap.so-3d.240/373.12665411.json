Rebecca Keyes, a former employee of Dollar General, filed suit against Dollar General Corporation; DG Mize, LLC; Dolgencorp, LLC d/b/a Dollar General Store # 11775 (collectively \"Dollar General\"), alleging counts of malicious prosecution, infliction of emotional distress, defamation, false imprisonment, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation, after Dollar General filed a criminal affidavit against Keyes in the Municipal Court of Mize, Mississippi, causing Keyes to be arrested for embezzlement. Dollar General filed a motion to dismiss and compel arbitration, which was granted by the Circuit Court of Smith County. With the exception of the defamation claim, we find that the trial court erred in compelling arbitration, for Keyes's remaining claims are not within the scope of the arbitration agreement. We affirm the trial court's order as to the defamation claim and reverse its judgment as to the remaining claims, remanding for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. The underlying facts of Keyes's alleged embezzlement are not at all clear from the record. In the Complaint, Keyes alleged that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   on or about May 28, 2015, Plaintiff, Rebecca Keyes, was an employee of Dollar General in Mize, Smith County, Mississippi. On said date, Rebecca performed a cash reload to a money network card in the amount of $500.00, which did not go through properly. Rebecca Keyes informed her manager of the problem and placed the receipt on the office desk. Rebecca was told not to worry about the problem and that it would be fixed. On June 2, 2015, Rebecca Keyes was arrested for embezzlement. Thereafter, on July 16, 2015, Rebecca was found not guilty of the charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Keyes moved to have the charges dismissed for failure of a Dollar General representative to appear and prosecute the claims. Her motion was granted. She then filed the instant lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3. Dollar General filed its Motion to Dismiss and Compel Arbitration, requesting that all of Keyes's claims be dismissed or alternatively stayed, and that she be compelled to submit her claims to binding arbitration. Michael Rusie, Senior Director, Labor and Employment Law at Dollar General Corporation, provided sworn testimony that all employees hired by Dollar General in and after August 2014 were presented with Dollar General's Employee Arbitration Agreement. Each employee had the option of consenting to the agreement or opting out. When Keyes was hired in November 2014, she checked the box indicating that she \"agree[d] to the terms of the Agreement. I understand and acknowledge that by checking this box, both Dollar General and I will be bound by the terms of this Agreement.\" Pertinent parts of the agreement read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   You agree that, with the exception of certain excluded claims described below, any legal claims or disputes that you may have against Dollar General, its parent and subsidiary corporations, employees, officers and directors\n   <em>\n    arising out of your employment with Dollar General or termination of employment with Dollar General\n   </em>\n   (\"Covered Claim\" or \"Covered Claims\") will be addressed in the manner described in this Agreement. You also understand that any Covered Claims that Dollar General may have against you\n   <em>\n    related to your employment\n   </em>\n   will be addressed in the manner described in this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The procedures in this Agreement will be the exclusive means of resolving Covered Claims relating to or arising out of your employment or termination of employment with Dollar General, whether brought by you or Dollar General. This includes, but is not limited to, claims alleging violations of wage and hour laws, state and federal laws prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, claims for\n   <em>\n    defamation\n   </em>\n   or violation of confidentiality obligations, claims for wrongful termination, tort claims, and claims alleging violation of any other state or federal laws, except claims that are prohibited by law from being decided in arbitration, and those claims specifically excluded in the paragraph below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Covered Claims do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   include claims for unemployment insurance benefits, workers' compensation benefits [workers' compensation discrimination and retaliation claims\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   Covered Claims], whistleblower claims under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and claims for benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Covered Claims also do not include claims pending in court as of the date this Agreement is signed by you, and claims concerning the scope or enforceability of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 4. Keyes did not dispute the existence of the Arbitration Agreement, but she argued the agreement was unconscionable, that Dollar General had waived its right to arbitrate by filing criminal proceedings against Keyes, and that her claims were not covered within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 5. Dollar General argued that it did not file charges against Keyes; it simply \"reported something to the police .... It simply exercised its right to make a criminal complaint to the police department, and the police department kind of got the ball rolling, and then the rest is history, so to speak.\" It further argued that the agreement inherently applied to civil, not criminal matters. Dollar General admitted\n   that it had the option of seeking recoupment of its lost money through arbitration but did not pursue it because its goal was to bring \"an offender to justice.\" Dollar General argued it did not waive arbitration because it could have a parallel criminal claim, while pursuing claims against Keyes in civil court (or arbitration).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 6. The trial judge found that Keyes's claims most likely related back to the agreement, but his concern was whether Dollar General had waived arbitration by first filing criminal charges in the municipal court. While the trial judge stated that he agreed with Keyes's argument, he likened this case to \"self-help\" cases, where this Court had held \"taking possession of the collateral or other similar actions [did] not waive a party's right to arbitration,\" because self-help did not equate to judicial proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Russell v.

The first prong considers two factors: (1) whether a valid arbitration agreement exists, and (2) whether the parties' dispute is within the scope of the valid arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8357964\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/963/1116/#p1119\">\n    963 So.2d at 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Keyes argues Dollar General's own action in pursuing criminal claims in municipal court is evidence that the parties did not intend to arbitrate any claims related to a criminal charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 19. The Arbitration Agreement contains no exclusions of any criminal proceedings, but it expressly includes claims for defamation. Keyes's claim for defamation is within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement. The order of the trial court is affirmed as to the defamation claim, and the court is instructed to stay this claim, pending arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 20. As to all other claims, we find that, like\n   <em>\n    Pedigo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , Keyes's claims are beyond the scope of the Arbitration Agreement. When Keyes agreed to arbitrate all claims arising out of her employment\n   or termination of employment with Dollar General, no evidence was presented that she contemplated she would be arrested for embezzlement and later have those charges dismissed after Dollar General refused to prosecute. The Arbitration Agreement specifically identified defamation as a covered claim. However, as the author of the Arbitration Agreement, Dollar General did not include claims of malicious prosecution, infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation as covered claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 21. Keyes's suit is based on Dollar General's swearing out of a criminal complaint against her. Such an action was not included in the Arbitration Agreement. We reverse the circuit court's decision ordering Keyes's claims of malicious prosecution, infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation to arbitration and remand those claims for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Keyes is free to pursue them against Dollar General in the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    II. IF KEYES'S CLAIMS ARE \"COVERED CLAIMS\" UNDER THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHETHER DOLLAR GENERAL WAIVED ITS RIGHT TO ARBITRATE BY FILING CRIMINAL CHARGES IN MUNICIPAL COURT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 22. As to the second prong regarding legal constraints external to the agreement foreclosing the possibility of arbitration, Keyes argues that, even if any of her claims were covered under the Arbitration Agreement, Dollar General waived its right to arbitrate by filing criminal charges against her in municipal court. Dollar General argues that merely reporting a crime to the authorities does not invoke the judicial process, as is required in a finding of waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    University Nursing Assocs., PLLC v. Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9336133\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/842/1270/#p1278\">\n    842 So.2d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1278 (Miss. 2003) (waiver could be found when the party seeking arbitration \"substantially invokes the judicial process to the detriment or prejudice of the other party.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 23. Swearing out a criminal affidavit does not constitute waiver of the right to arbitrate. Although no Mississippi court has addressed this issue, the vast majority of courts which have considered this issue have held that filing a criminal affidavit, in and of itself, does not waive the right to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Consorcio Rive, S.A. de C.V. v.

The law does not require choosing between reporting a crime and maintaining the right to arbitrate future disputes that may arise. Dollar General did not have to arbitrate whether Keyes had committed a crime. Dollar General was not limited to arbitration to seek recoupment of its lost funds. Therefore, Dollar General was not avoiding an arbitration action because it was not required to arbitrate a criminal action under the plain language of the arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 25. Because Dollar General did not waive all arbitration claims and Keyes's claim for defamation falls within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement, we affirm the trial court's finding submitting this claim only to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 26. Only Keyes's claim for defamation falls within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement. Because Dollar General did not waive its right to arbitrate all claims by filing a criminal complaint, the trial court's order staying the claim and submitting the defamation claim to arbitration is affirmed. The other claims brought by Keyes do not fall within the Arbitration Agreement, and those claims were not properly submitted to arbitration. The order dismissing Keyes's claims for malicious prosecution, infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation against Dollar General and compelling arbitration of them is reversed, and these claims are remanded to the Smith County Circuit Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 27.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   MAXWELL, BEAM, CHAMBERLIN AND ISHEE, JJ., CONCUR.

I concur with the majority's conclusion that Keyes's claims against Dollar General for malicious prosecution, infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation are not subject to arbitration, as those claims fall outside the scope of the arbitration clause in Keyes's employment contract. However, I disagree with the majority that Keyes's defamation claim must be submitted to arbitration. Accordingly, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 29. The majority finds that Keyes's defamation claim must be arbitrated because her employment contract includes \"defamation\" as a \"Covered Claim\" subject to arbitration. However, the inclusion of \"Covered Claims\" in a contract, while relevant to the scope of the parties' agreement, is not dispositive of whether a specific claim is subject to arbitration. Regardless of the legal causes of action asserted by the plaintiff, we still must look to the factual allegations in the complaint to determine whether a claim falls within\n   the scope of the arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    Scruggs v. Wyatt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034267\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/758/#p766\">\n    60 So.3d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 766 (Miss. 2011). Under the arbitration clause at issue here, a plaintiff's claims must arise out of or relate to his or her employment or termination to be subject to arbitration. Keyes's defamation claim bears no more relation to her employment or termination than her other claims, which the majority correctly finds are outside the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement. Thus, despite the inclusion of \"defamation\" as a Covered Claim, I would find that the parties did not intend that Keyes would be forced to arbitrate a defamation claim based on Dollar General's filing of a criminal complaint for embezzlement against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 30. Because none of Keyes's claims fall within the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement, Keyes's argument that Dollar General waived its right to arbitration by filing a criminal complaint against her is moot, and I would decline to address it. We reached the same conclusion recently in\n   <em>\n    Pedigo v. Robertson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204838243\">\n    2017 WL 4838243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 n.1 (Miss. Oct. 26, 2017) (\"Because we find Pedigo's suit to be outside the scope of the arbitration agreement, we need not address whether RAC waived its right to arbitration.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 31. For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the trial court's judgment as to all of Keyes's claims and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   KITCHENS, P.J., KING AND COLEMAN, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
