Mr. Thomas alleged that Dr. Drew failed to properly monitor him post-operatively, resulting in his early release and subsequent overdose causing Mr. Thomas to lapse into a coma. Mr. Thomas claims the trial court erred in finding that his expert affidavit was inadmissible and failed to create a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 20, 2013, Dr. Drew examined Mr. Thomas. Mr. Thomas was eighteen years old at the time and complaining of repeated dislocations of his right shoulder. Dr. Drew noted that Mr. Thomas liked to work out heavily and planned on performing heavy labor. Mr. Thomas was also thinking about going into the armed services. His pain was a six out of ten. An MRI indicated an anterior, inferior, and posterior glenolabral injury. After examination, Dr. Drew recommended therapy as a first option and surgery as a second option. Mr. Thomas wanted to proceed with the surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The pre-admit process was performed on June 28, 2013. It was noted that the surgery would take one to two hours, including anesthesia time and that Mr. Thomas was a smoker on rare occasions. Mr. Thomas denied any health issues. It was also noted that he had never had anesthesia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 1, 2013, Mr. Thomas was admitted to Lafayette Surgicare at 7:35 a.m. for an outpatient right shoulder arthroscopy with SLAP and Bankart repair for painful rotator cuff syndrome. Surgery began at 8:49 a.m. and ended at 11:13 a.m. His parents were notified at 10:15 a.m. of the progress in surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before the procedure, Mr. Thomas was administered an interscalene nerve block of 100 mg Ropivicaine. In conjunction with the block, he was administered 2 mg of Versed, 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 100 mg of Propofol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Medications Mr. Thomas received during surgery while under anesthesia included 2 mg of Midazolam, 100 mcg of Fentanyl, and 200 mg of Propofol. He was also dispensed 4 mg of Zofran, 4 mg of Decadron, 1000 mg of Ofirmev, and 30 mg of Toradol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The operative report indicates that Mr. Thomas tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition. During recovery, additional medications were dispensed to Mr. Thomas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At 11:55 a.m., Mr. Thomas was administered 25 mg of Demerol for shivering management. At 12:05 p.m., Mr. Thomas woke up in severe pain. The nurses' notes indicate that orders were taken from Dr. Baudoin regarding pain medication. At 12:05 p.m. and 12:07 p.m., Mr. Thomas was given 5 mg of Morphine. Another nerve block of 100 mg of Ropivicaine was administered. At 12:10 p.m., 12:12 p.m., 12:15 p.m., and 12:17 p.m., Mr. Thomas was given 1 mg of Dilaudid. Mr. Thomas received 2 mg of Versed at 12:20 p.m. for the second block. It was observed that he was sedated at 12:25 p.m. He then received 0.2 mg of Romazicon at 12:40 p.m. for a reversal. At 1:02 p.m., the airway was removed and it was noted that Mr. Thomas was feeling better. He was discharged at 1:50 p.m. into the care of his parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The anesthesia discharge notes indicate that Mr. Thomas was alert and oriented and able to sit up and stand without dizziness or significant change in vital signs. Mr. Thomas was instructed to use an EB ice machine as needed, an arm sling, and place no weight on the right arm. It was noted that Mr. Thomas was given a prescription for Hydrocodone at the doctor's office before surgery and this medication was to be used at home for pain. The notes indicate that the patient and family were unsure of the dose, but the prescription was at home once needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Later that evening at 7:48 p.m., an ambulance was called to the Thomas home because Mr. Thomas was unconscious. The ambulance records indicate that Mr. Thomas's mom had given one Oxycodone. He was given Narcan but did not respond. He was intubated through his nose and transferred to the emergency room. According to the petition, Mr. Thomas fell into a coma for five days following his release and lost the use of his left side. A medical review panel opinion rendered on May 26, 2016, found that \"[a]ll parties involved met the standard of care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 26, 2016, Mr. Thomas filed suit against Dr. Drew. He also sued the anesthesiologist, Lafayette Surgicare, Lafayette Surgery Center, and The Regions Health System of Acadiana. Mr. Thomas claims the surgery and post-surgical care required extensive anesthesia and heavy narcotic medication. He claims that he was released too early following his surgery and went into a coma for five days causing a brain injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dr. Drew filed a motion for summary judgment on February 15, 2017. A hearing on the motion was held on May 15, 2017. The trial court granted Dr. Drew's motion and dismissed all of Mr. Thomas's claims\n   against Dr. Drew. Mr. Thomas then filed the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In support of his motion for summary judgment, Dr. Drew offered the medical review panel opinion which unanimously found that he met the applicable standard of care in his treatment of Mr. Thomas. Mr. Thomas opposed the motion for summary judgment with the affidavit of Dr. Albert Gros, an anesthesiologist and pain management physician, who opined that \"[t]he patient was not monitored long enough prior to discharge from the Recovery Room at Lafayette Surgery Center.\" Dr. Drew argued that Dr. Gros is not qualified to render an opinion on whether or not Dr. Drew breached the standard of care of an orthopedic surgeon in his treatment of Mr. Thomas. In his motion for summary judgment, Dr. Drew further argued that Mr. Thomas did not offer any expert testimony that Dr. Drew's alleged breach caused or contributed to any injury damages sustained by Mr. Thomas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Thomas first claims that Dr. Drew failed to follow the proper procedural requirements for objecting to the admissibility of Dr. Gros's expert opinion.

Now La.Code Civ.P. art 966 (D)(2) provides that \"[a]ny objection to a document shall be raised in a timely filed opposition or reply memorandum.\" \" Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure article 1425(F) sets out in detail the procedure which should be followed in order to challenge the qualifications of an expert or the methodology used by the expert in reaching his opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Adolph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12367936\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/227/316/\">\n    227 So.3d at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Dr. Drew did challenge the qualification of Dr. Gros in his reply memorandum. Therefore, he followed the proper procedure pursuant to La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(D)(2) in objecting to Dr. Gros's affidavit. We do agree with Mr. Thomas that in deciding whether to admit an expert opinion affidavit at the summary judgment stage, the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standards should be considered by the trial court in determining whether the expert is qualified to render an opinion.\n   <em>\n    Independent Fire Ins.

A reading of the transcript indicates that the trial court considered the qualifications of Dr. Gros regarding his ability to testify about the duty of care owed by Dr. Drew. We find that the trial court conducted a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   analysis regarding Dr. Gros's qualifications \"as an expert witness on the issue of whether the physician departed from accepted standards of medical care.\" La.R.S. 9:2794(D)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Thomas next argues that the fact that Dr. Gros is not an orthopedic surgeon is not dispositive of the issue of his ability to testify as an expert in this matter. He further argues that Dr. Gros's affidavit creates a genuine issue of material fact prohibiting summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In reviewing the grant of summary judgment, an appellate court conducts a de novo review using the same standards that the trial court used in making its determination.\n   <em>\n    Domingue v.

Rather, Mr. Thomas argues that the malpractice occurred in his post-operative care and release. Therefore, we agree with Mr. Thomas that an expert in orthopedic surgery was not required. However, even if we were to find that Dr. Gros is qualified to offer an opinion as to whether Dr. Drew breached the standard of care regarding Mr. Thomas's post-operative care, we find that Dr. Gros's affidavit is insufficient to establish that Dr. Drew breached the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Dr. Gros never states what standard of care was owed to Mr. Thomas by Dr. Drew post-operatively or that Dr. Drew breached any standard of care at all in his care of Mr. Thomas. Dr. Gros never even mentions Dr. Drew in his affidavit. He simply makes a conclusory statement about Mr. Thomas's post-operative care. Affidavits that are conclusory with no supporting underlying facts are legally insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Baez v. Hosp. Serv. Dist.

Dr. Drew established through the medical review panel opinion that he did not breach the standard of care owed to Mr. Thomas.

Dr. Baudoin was the attending anesthesiologist assigned to administer and monitor the effects of the drugs listed in the expert's report. The standard of care breached, according to the expert, was the failure to \"monitor long enough prior to discharge\" Thomas' tolerance and recovery from the drugs administered. The duty allegedly breached was the failure to monitor. Neither the record evidence nor the expert's opinion identified Dr. Drew as the responsible party upon whose shoulders this duty was placed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
