Curtis Giovanni Flowers was indicted on four counts of capital murder with the underlying felony of armed robbery, stemming from the 1996 murders of four employees of Tardy Furniture Store in Winona, Mississippi. Following his sixth trial, he was convicted on all four counts of capital murder and sentenced to death. The Court affirmed his convictions and death sentence in\n   <em>\n    Flowers v.

The Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   after\n   <em>\n    Flowers VI\n   </em>\n   had been decided by the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the sole issue raised in\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   was whether the prosecution's use of peremptory strikes was racially motivated in violation of\n   <em>\n    Batson v.

Accordingly, the remaining issues addressed by the Court in\n   <em>\n    Flowers VI\n   </em>\n   were not disturbed and the Court's opinion as to the remaining issues is reinstated as fully set out herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. On remand, the Court afforded the parties an opportunity to submit supplemental briefs in light of\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   as directed by the Supreme Court. After review and further consideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   , we discern no\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation and reinstate and affirm Flowers's convictions and death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. At approximately 9:00 on the morning of July 16, 1996, Bertha Tardy, the owner of Tardy Furniture Store, called Sam Jones and asked him to come to the store to train two new employees. When Jones arrived at the store a short time later, he discovered the bodies of Bertha Tardy, Robert Golden, Carmen Rigby, and Derrick Stewart. All four victims had been shot in the head; Stewart was the only victim still alive when Jones arrived. Jones went to a nearby business and asked an employee to call the police. Johnny Hargrove, the City of Winona Police Chief, was the first law enforcement officer to arrive; he called for backup and ambulance services. Shell casings from 0.380 caliber bullets were recovered from the scene, and a bloody shoeprint was found near one of the victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Shortly after officers arrived at the scene, law enforcement officers received a call about an auto burglary at Angelica Garment Factory in Winona. Deputy Sheriff Bill Thornburg responded, and he learned that someone had burglarized Doyle Simpson's car and had stolen a 0.380 caliber pistol. Katherine Snow, an Angelica employee, placed Curtis Flowers at Simpson's car around 7:15 that morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Police interviewed Flowers around 1:30 that afternoon, and Flowers consented to a gunshot residue test. Police interviewed Flowers again two days later on July 18, 1996. Flowers claimed to have been babysitting his girlfriend's children on the morning of the murders, but he provided inconsistent statements about his schedule. During the July 16 interview, Flowers said that he woke up around 6:30 a.m. on the day of the murders and went to his sister's house around 9:00 a.m., then went to a local store around 10:00 a.m. On July 18, Flowers said that, on the morning of the murders, he woke up around 9:30 a.m., went to his sister's house around noon, and went to the store at approximately 12:45 p.m. Flowers told investigators that he had been employed at Tardy Furniture for a few days earlier that month, but he had been fired on July 6 after he did not show up for a few days. Flowers moved to Texas in September 1996. After further investigation, Flowers was arrested and brought back to Mississippi. He was indicted on four separate counts of capital murder in March 1997.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Flowers was tried for the murder of Bertha Tardy in October 1997. After a change of venue from Montgomery County to Lee County, Flowers was convicted and sentenced to death. Flowers appealed and we reversed and remanded for a new trial on the ground that Flowers's right to a fair trial had been violated by admission of evidence of the other three murder victims.\n   <em>\n    Flowers v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11174202\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/773/309/\">\n    773 So.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2000) (\"\n   <em>\n    Flowers I\n   </em>\n   \"). Flowers's second trial was for the murder of Derrick Stewart; it was held in Harrison County in March 1999. The jury returned a guilty verdict and sentenced Flowers to death. On appeal, we again reversed and remanded for a new trial. The Court held that Flowers's right to a fair trial had been violated, again, by admission of evidence of the other victims and by the prosecution arguing facts that were not in evidence.\n   <em>\n    Flowers v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319808\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/842/531/\">\n    842 So.2d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2003) (\"\n   <em>\n    Flowers II\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. The Montgomery County Circuit Court held Flowers's third trial in 2004 and tried him for all four murders. The jury found Flowers guilty and sentenced him to death. Finding that the State had engaged in racial discrimination during jury selection, the Court once again reversed and remanded the case for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Flowers v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8343240\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/947/910/\">\n    947 So.2d 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2007) (\"\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   \"). Flowers's fourth and fifth trials also were on all four counts of capital murder. Both resulted in mistrials when the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict during the culpability phase. The State did not seek the death penalty in the fourth trial but did seek it in the fifth trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. The circuit court conducted Flowers's sixth trial, the subject of the instant appeal, in June 2010 in Montgomery County. The State tried Flowers for all four murders. The State called twenty-one witnesses in its case-in-chief. Police Chief Johnny Hargrove was the State's first witness. Hargrove testified that police had found a bloody shoeprint at the scene. Hargrove had asked the District Attorney's Office and the Highway Patrol to help investigate the murders. Mississippi Highway Patrol Investigator Jack Matthews testified that he saw a bloody shoeprint and shell casings scattered near the bodies. Matthews testified that cash was taken from the store during the murders and that he found Flowers's time sheet and a check made out to him for $82.58 on Bertha Tardy's desk. Matthews said that, according to the documents on Bertha Tardy's desk, the store would have had $300 cash on hand that morning. However, there was only change, no bills, in the cash drawer. During his investigation, Matthews spoke with Roxanne Ballard, Bertha Tardy's daughter, and learned that Flowers recently had been fired from his job at Tardy Furniture. Matthews testified that $235 was found hidden in Flowers's headboard after the murders. He also testified that Flowers wore a size ten-and-a-half shoe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Ballard was the bookkeeper at Tardy Furniture and had worked in the store her whole life. Looking at the books from the morning of the murders, Ballard testified that the store had $400 in the cash drawer that morning. However, she confirmed Matthews's testimony that the books showed $300, but Ballard saw a receipt for a late charge in the amount of $100, so she knew the drawer had contained a total of $400. Ballard testified that $389 was missing from the cash drawer after the murders. Also, looking at pictures from the crime scene, Ballard testified that the photos showed a bank bag lying wide open on a pile of fabric swatches. She testified that the bank bag was always closed and it should have been in a drawer or on Carmen Rigby's desk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Melissa Schoene, a crime scene expert with the Mississippi Crime Laboratory, testified that she took impressions of the bloody shoeprint and collected the 0.380 caliber casings. Sheriff Bill Thornburg testified that he had gone to Angelica Garment Factory on the day of the murders to investigate Doyle Simpson's stolen 0.380 caliber pistol. Thornburg testified that it looked like a screwdriver or tire iron had been used to pry open the glove box of Simpson's car. Thornburg also went to Simpson's mother's home to collect spent 0.380 hulls from Simpson's gun. A few days after the murders, Thornburg searched the home of Connie Moore, Flowers's girlfriend. He found a size ten-and-a-half Fila Grant Hill shoebox in a dresser at Moore's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. David Balash, a firearms identification expert, testified that the bullets collected from Tardy Furniture either matched the bullets or were consistent with the bullets collected from Simpson's mother's house. Joe Andrews, a forensic scientist specializing in trace evidence, testified that Flowers's gunshot residue test revealed one particle of gunshot residue on the back of Flowers's right hand. Andrews also analyzed the shoeprint found at Tardy Furniture, and he determined that the print was consistent with size ten-and-a-half Fila Grant Hill tennis shoes. Patricia Hallmon Odom Sullivan, one of Flowers's neighbors, testified that she saw Flowers wearing Fila Grant Hill tennis shoes at 7:30 a.m. on the day of the murders. Elaine Goldstein, another neighbor, testified that she had seen Flowers wear Fila Grant Hill tennis shoes a couple of months before the murders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13. Multiple witnesses placed Flowers at or around Angelica Garment Factory and Tardy Furniture on the morning of the murders. Katherine Snow, an Angelica Garment Factory employee, testified that she saw Flowers leaning against Simpson's car at 7:15 on the morning of the murders. Snow also identified Flowers in a photographic lineup and in court. James Kennedy testified that he saw Flowers walking toward Angelica Garment Factory at 7:15 a.m. Edward McChristian testified that he saw Flowers walking north, away from Angelica Garment Factory, between 7:30 and 8:00 a.m. Mary Jeanette Fleming testified that she saw Flowers walking toward Tardy Furniture at approximately 9:00 a.m. Beneva Henry testified that she saw Flowers walking toward downtown Winona, in the direction of Tardy Furniture, sometime between 9:00 and 9:30 a.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clemmie Fleming testified that she was going to Tardy Furniture to pay a bill a little after 10:00 a.m, and she saw Flowers running away from the back of Tardy Furniture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14. Porky Collins testified that he saw two African-American men, who appeared to be arguing, outside Tardy Furniture at around 10:00 on the morning of the murders. Collins circled the block and returned to where he saw the men arguing; at that point, the men were headed toward Tardy Furniture. Collins identified Flowers as one of the men he saw that morning. Doyle Simpson testified that his 0.380 caliber pistol was in his car's glove compartment when he arrived at Angelica the morning of July 16, 1996. Simpson discovered that his gun was missing at approximately 11:00 a.m. that day. Simpson, who was Flowers's uncle, testified that Flowers\n   knew he had a gun and that Flowers had seen it in his car before. Odell Hallmon, a jailhouse informant who had been in a cell next to Flowers, testified that Flowers had confessed to killing four people at Tardy Furniture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15. After the State's case-in-chief, the defense moved for a directed verdict, which the trial court denied. The first witness to testify in the defense's case-in-chief was Mike McSparrin, a fingerprint expert. McSparrin testified that the fingerprints found at the crime scene, as well as on the Fila shoebox, did not match Flowers's fingerprints. The defense also called Steve Byrd, a firearms forensic analyst. Byrd testified that he could not definitively determine whether all of the bullets recovered from the crime scene were fired from the same gun. James Williams, a law enforcement investigator, testified that he did not see a bloody footprint when he first arrived at Tardy Furniture. Billy Glover testified that, on the day of the murders, he saw Flowers around 9:00 a.m. at a friend's house and that they talked for fifteen or twenty minutes. Connie Moore, Flowers's girlfriend at the time, testified that she had purchased a pair of size ten-and-a-half Fila Grant Hill tennis shoes for her son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16. Stacey Wright testified that Clemmie Flemming had admitted to her that she had lied about seeing Flowers running away from Tardy Furniture on the morning of the murders. Wright testified that Clemmie had said she would get money or have her bill paid at Tardy Furniture in return for her statement against Flowers. Clemmie's sister, Mary Flemming, testified that she was with Clemmie the morning of the murders and that Clemmie did not go to Tardy Furniture to pay her bill that morning. Latarsha Blissett also testified that Clemmie had told her that if she made a statement against Flowers, she would get money or have her account at Tardy Furniture paid. Further, Blissett testified that investigators had asked her if she knew Flowers's shoe size and had implied that she would receive reward money for providing a statement. Kittery Jones, Flowers's cousin, also testified that investigators had implied that he would receive reward money in return for providing a statement linking Flowers to the murders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17. On June 18, 2010, the jury returned a guilty verdict for all four murders. Following the sentencing hearing, the jury sentenced Flowers to death. The jury found the following aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons; (2) the capital offenses were committed while the defendant was engaged in the commission of an armed robbery for pecuniary gain; and (3) the capital offenses were committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing lawful arrest or effecting an escape from custody. Flowers filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, in the alternative, for a new trial, which was denied. Flowers timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18. Flowers raises the following thirteen assignments of error on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1.

Flowers's right to a fair trial, as guaranteed by Mississippi law and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, was violated when the prosecution repeatedly\n   argued material facts not in evidence during its culpability phase closing argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   3. The in-court and out-of-court eyewitness identifications of Flowers by Porky Collins were constitutionally unreliable and the trial court erred in overruling Flowers's objections to their admission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   4. The trial court's exclusion of expert testimony explaining the deficiencies in law enforcement's investigation, and the defects in the composition of the photo lineups shown to Porky Collins, violated Mississippi law and Flowers's right to present a defense as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   5. The trial court erred in refusing to exclude prosecution testimony that a single particle of gunshot residue had been detected on Flowers's hand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   6. The jury selection process, the composition of the venire and the jury seated, and pervasive racial and other bias surrounding this matter violated Flowers's fundamental constitutional rights protected by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   a. The prosecutor violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when he struck five African American jurors after utilizing disparate questioning and citing pretextual reasons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   b. The jury failed to adequately deliberate because it was influenced by racial bias in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   c. Pervasive racial bias in the venire infected the fairness of the proceedings, and requires reversal and remand for a new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   7. The State's six attempts to convict Flowers of the same offense violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   8. The trial court reversibly erred in refusing Flowers's requested circumstantial evidence instructions at the culpability phase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   9. The trial court reversibly erred in the penalty phase instructions to the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   10. The convictions and death sentences in this matter were obtained in violation of the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the counterparts in the Mississippi Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   11. This Court should set aside its prior order denying Flowers's Motion for Remand and Leave to File Supplemental Motion for New Trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   12. The death sentence in this matter is constitutionally and statutorily disproportionate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   13.

Flowers claims that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of Porky Collins's out-of-court and in-court identifications of Flowers. Collins died in 2002, so his testimony from the 1999 trial was read to the jury. Collins's testimony was that, on the morning of the murders, he had seen two African-American men who appeared to be arguing outside Tardy Furniture. Collins thought the men were about to fight, so he circled the block and returned to see what was going on. The second time Collins saw the men, they were walking toward Tardy Furniture. Collins saw only one man's face when he drove past them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 21. After hearing about the murders at Tardy Furniture, Collins went to police the same day, reported what he had seen that morning, and gave a description of the men. On August 24, 1996, police showed Collins two photo arrays with six photos each-the first group included Doyle Simpson's photograph; the second group included Flowers's photograph. Collins testified that he was not expected to identify the man whose face he did not see. According to police department notes, in response to the first photo array, Collins pointed to Simpson and said that he \"looked like\" the man he had seen, but he was unable to be positive. The entirety of the officer's handwritten notes were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Porky Collins\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Picture Line-up 11:10 a.m.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   # 1 and # 3 resembles, but hairline was further back\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   # 6 Pointed to Simpson said hairline like this, may have appeared a little darker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \"But it looks like him.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"Face was also same shape, round like this.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"Unable to be positive.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Collins then was shown the second photo array, and he identified Flowers as the man he had seen in front of Tardy Furniture. The officer administering the photo array made the following notes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   2nd Line Up\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   11:16 a.m.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Pointed to Curtis Flowers # 4\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"I think that's him.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"He was about my height.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"I'm 5' 10?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \"The complexion is also right.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \"I believe that's him, it look[s] like him.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Identified # 4\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   I asked Porky if he knew Curtis Flowers, he said, \"No. But I know the person I just identified is the person I saw in front of Tardy's 7-16-96.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   During the 1999 trial, Collins identified Flowers in court as the man whose face he had seen outside Tardy Furniture. Flowers filed a pretrial motion to suppress Collins's out-of-court and in-court identifications, which the trial court denied.

In the photo array that included Flowers's photograph, Flowers's head is slightly larger than the others, as it appears his photo was taken from a closer angle than the others. However, the use of a different photographic technique creates only a minor difference, and that is not enough to render the photo lineup impermissibly suggestive.\n   <em>\n    Batiste v.

Accordingly, Flowers fails to show that the lineup was unduly suggestive. Further, Collins provided a description to police on the day of the murders, and he was confident in his identification of the man he saw in front of Tardy Furniture. The trial court did not err in admitting Collins's out-of-court identification.

Although Flowers's issue statement asserts that Collins's in-court identification was \"constitutionally unreliable,\" he provides no substantive argument or support for that claim. The extent of his argument is a footnote, which provides: \"there is no issue of the admissibility of the in-court identification, given that Collins could not positively identify Flowers in the courtroom at the second trial, and was deceased by the time of this, the sixth trial.\" His assertion is incorrect. Collins unequivocally identified Flowers at the second trial. Flowers also implies that the typical jury consideration of determining Collins's credibility is not applicable in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   because his testimony was read to the jury, as opposed to live testimony. Although the jury did not personally observe Collins testifying, defense counsel's cross-examination of Collins adequately addressed credibility. For example, defense counsel asked Collins about his memory, any medication he was taking that could affect his memory, and whether he wore glasses. The characteristics of trial itself-trial by jury, an impartial judge, representation by counsel, and witnesses subject to an oath and cross-examination-adequately protect against any suggestiveness of in-court identifications at trial.\n   <em>\n    Galloway v.

Johnson's Proffered Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 30. During the voir dire, Johnson testified at length about his law enforcement experience. Johnson is currently a law enforcement consultant and previously served as police chief in Jackson, Mississippi; Jackson, Michigan; and Lansing, Michigan. He was Commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Corrections from 2000 to 2002. Johnson has a master's degree in public administration, and he graduated from the FBI National Academy and the FBI Law Enforcement Executive Development program. During his career, Johnson performed homicide investigations as a detective and directly supervised homicide investigations. Johnson also developed protocols for criminal investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 31. Johnson testified that generally accepted standards for homicide investigations exist, and he opined that the investigation in today's case failed to meet them in various ways. First, Johnson said the investigation lacked management and organization. In support of his contention, Johnson referred to the testimony of law enforcement officers who said the investigation was a \"shared responsibility.\" Johnson also said the investigation lacked an in-depth case file, which should have included all original notes and reports. Johnson testified: \"There has to be somebody who is the recipient of all the information coming from a variety of sources and is able to correlate that information and further direct the direction that the investigation needs to develop.\" He said that the investigation also lacked written reports of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 32. Johnson next criticized the crime scene integrity. Johnson said that the integrity of the crime scene could have been compromised by law enforcement officers and investigators meeting within the crime scene to discuss and organize the investigation. According to Johnson, a crime scene log should have been maintained listing who came and went from the crime scene to ensure that it was not contaminated. Next, Johnson testified that he was \"concerned\" about the investigation's early focus on one suspect-Flowers-to the exclusion of any other suspects. Johnson said early focus can result in lost evidence: \"It's okay to very quickly focus on one suspect; that happens all the time, you know. But to the exclusion of all else and all others is where it becomes problematic, and you sometimes lose vital evidence that may be had because you haven't included and kept them in as a potential suspect or person of interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 33. On cross-examination, Johnson admitted that Mississippi has no minimum standards for criminal investigations. He also admitted that the Justice Department guidelines he mentioned in direct examination were not requirements and that there are no national minimum standards for criminal investigations. Johnson stated that, rather than minimum standards, he based his opinions on generally accepted practices in police work. Further, when asked if he could provide an opinion on whether investigations that lack written reports lead to incorrect results, Johnson said investigations with written reports are \"more complete.\" He did not, however, state that an investigation without a written report would lead to an incorrect result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In\n   <em>\n    Ross II\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals addressed the proffered expert testimony and found that the trial court did not err in excluding the testimony.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7026940\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/22/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7026940\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/22/400/\">\n    at 420-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 99-104). First, the expert testimony was cumulative because the investigating officers had been cross-examined about their investigative techniques and had admitted that \"things could have been handled better.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7026940\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/22/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7026940\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/22/400/\">\n    at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 102). Second, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the testimony failed to meet the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   reliability prong because the expert's \"memberships and associations were voluntary and fee based, not peer reviewed or tested\" and \"the trial court was unable to evaluate the value of [the expert's] certifications because the trial court was unaware of the requirements for certification.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7026940\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/22/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7026940\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/22/400/\">\n    at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 103-104).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 35. Under Rule 702, the first prong of the inquiry for determining whether expert testimony should be admitted is whether the witness is \"qualified by virtue of his or her knowledge, skill, experience[,] or education.\"\n   <em>\n    Galloway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6999665\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/122/614/#p663\">\n    122 So.3d at 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 28) (quoting\n   <em>\n    McLemore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9056174\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/863/31/#p37\">\n    863 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   35 ). Johnson certainly is qualified through his knowledge, experience, and training in the field of criminal investigations. Further, there is no question that Johnson's testimony is relevant. Johnson's testimony addressed facts relating to the criminal investigation that eventually led to Flowers's arrest; thus, his testimony had a \"tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Miss. R. Evid. 401.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 36. The critical inquiry, however, is whether Johnson's testimony is reliable. The trial court focused on the inability to test Johnson's theories as a basis for excluding the testimony, holding: \"Because there is no valid way of testing the field of police investigatory techniques, this Court finds the proposed testimony in the field fails to meet the reliability standards required under Rule 702.\" Whether the expert's theory can be tested is one factor to be considered under\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , but it is not conclusive. Johnson's proffered testimony is not the typical expert testimony contemplated by the testing factor-for example, one cannot test what effect the lack of organization and leadership would have on a murder investigation. As such, reliance on the testing factor alone would have been error. However, the trial court cited other reasons for excluding the testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 37. The trial court also found that, although Johnson testified that the investigation fell below generally accepted standards and practices in law enforcement, Johnson did not sufficiently articulate the standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGee v. River Region Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7035538\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/59/575/#p579\">\n    59 So.3d 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. 2011) (An expert testifying about a failure to meet generally accepted standards must \"identify and articulate the requisite standard that was not complied with.\") A review of the proffered testimony reveals that Johnson did articulate standards relating to some-but not all-of his opinions. Johnson offered four opinions: (1) that the investigation lacked organization and management; (2) that the integrity of the crime scene was compromised; (3) that\n   the investigation focused on one suspect too quickly; and (4) that the photo lineup used during Collins's identification was flawed. Johnson did not articulate a standard for his opinion relating to the investigation's early focus on Flowers as a suspect. And Johnson said that he was not familiar with the procedures used during Collins's identification. Thus, the trial court did not err in excluding his testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dedeaux Util. Co., Inc. v. City of Gulfport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8473557\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/938/838/#p841\">\n    938 So.2d 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841 (Miss. 2006) (expert testimony must be based on sufficient facts and data).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 38. Johnson did provide applicable standards for his opinions related to the investigation's organization and management and crime scene integrity. Regarding the investigation's organization and management, Johnson testified that, based on his experience and knowledge, the investigation should have had centralized leadership that collected information, maintained the case file, and directed the investigation. Johnson said, \"There has to be somebody who is the recipient of all the information coming from a variety of sources and is able to correlate that information and further direct the direction that the investigation needs to develop.\" Regarding crime scene integrity, Johnson said a crime scene log should have been maintained at the crime scene. He explained that the crime scene can be contaminated, evidence can be overlooked, and evidence can be deposited after the crime. He said, \"There may be a number of issues related to the presence of people at the crime scene, so you want to have a record of when they were there, how long they stayed and when they left.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 39. Although Johnson provided some standards on which he based his opinions, we cannot say the trial judge abused his discretion when he held the standards insufficient. Johnson testified that the standards he applied in forming his theories were \"generally accepted practices in police work.\" Certainly, expert testimony can be based on experience, and one factor that may be considered in determining reliability is general acceptance in the relevant expert community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gillett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034612\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/56/469/#p494\">\n    56 So.3d at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 64) ;\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p592\">\n    509 U.S. at 593-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p592\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Johnson did not provide support for his statement that the practices he referenced were, in fact, generally accepted. Allowing an expert simply to state that his opinions are based on \"generally accepted practices,\" without support for the assertion, could lead to essentially permitting experts to qualify themselves. While Johnson's opinions and standards seem sensible, we cannot say that he presented enough evidence that his opinions were sufficiently reliable such that the trial court abused its discretion by not allowing the testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 40. Further, the trial court was correct that Johnson's testimony was cumulative. Law enforcement officers who participated in the investigation were thoroughly questioned about the investigation and admitted that there were flaws in the investigation. Specifically, officers admitted that a crime scene log was not maintained, and the police chief testified that one should have been maintained. The officers also admitted that there was not a lead investigator, and the police chief testified that responsibilities should have been assigned, an investigative plan should have been developed, and information should have been shared with investigators and first responders. The trial court did not commit an abuse of discretion in not allowing Johnson's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Dr. Jeffery Neuschatz\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 41. During Flowers's fourth trial, he filed a motion to determine the admissibility of Dr. Neuschatz's testimony\n   on the reliability of eyewitness identification evidence. Dr. Neuschatz's affidavit and\n   <em>\n    curriculum vitae\n   </em>\n   were attached to the motion. Dr. Neuschatz's affidavit essentially provided two opinions: (1) that Collins's identification of Flowers could have been affected by a number of different circumstances; and (2) that the identification procedure was flawed. Before the fourth trial commenced, the State announced that it would not seek the death penalty, and Flowers withdrew his motion regarding Dr. Neuschatz's testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 42. At Flowers's fifth trial, the State sought the death penalty, and Flowers renewed his motion to determine the admissibility of Dr. Neuschatz's testimony. The court held a hearing on the motion, but Flowers did not provide a proffer of Dr. Neuschatz's testimony other than the affidavit previously submitted. The trial court denied the motion, holding that, because Collins was extensively cross-examined, the expert testimony would not assist the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   And he was extensively cross-examined, even into the most minute detail about issues concerning what path he took driving around town that morning. He stated in his testimony that he had a brief glimpse of who he believed to be Mr. Flowers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   There was-he was cross-examined about his ability to remember things. He was cross-examined about whether he had had difficulty with memory problems in the past. I mean I do not think there could be a more thorough cross-examination of a witness than was done with Mr. Collins.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   So I think given the extensive cross-examination of Mr. Collins and because all other witnesses knew Mr. Flowers on sight, I do not believe an expert on witness identification would assist the jury in the least bit in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The court also found that Flowers did not demonstrate that Dr. Neuschatz's testimony was reliable based on the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   factors. In the present case, Flowers renewed his motion on the admissibility of Dr. Neuschatz's testimony. The trial court denied the motion, adopting its ruling from the fifth trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 43. Again, in determining whether expert testimony is reliable, the court may consider the following factors: whether the expert's theory can be or has been tested; whether the theory has been the subject of peer review and publication; the known or potential rate of error of the technique or theory when applied; the existence of standards to control the technique's operation; and the general acceptance that the theory has garnered in the relevant expert community.\n   <em>\n    Gillett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034612\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/56/469/#p494\">\n    56 So.3d at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 64) (citing\n   <em>\n    McLemore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9056174\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/863/31/#p37\">\n    863 So.2d at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p592\">\n    509 U.S. at 592-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p592\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The admissibility of Dr. Neuschatz's testimony was addressed recently in\n   <em>\n    Corrothers v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6911251\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/278/\">\n    148 So.3d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2014),\n   <em>\n    reh'g denied\n   </em>\n   (Oct. 23, 2014). In\n   <em>\n    Corrothers\n   </em>\n   , the Court applied Rule 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   to Dr. Neuschatz's testimony concerning the reliability of eyewitness identification procedures and found that Dr. Neuschatz's testimony was unreliable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Dr. Neuschatz attempted to apply the principles and methodologies underlying his expertise in eyewitness identification to opine that [the eyewitness's] identification \"could\" be unreliable. But Dr. Neuschatz's opinions were undermined by his inaccurate and incomplete understanding\n   of the facts on which he based his opinions and his complete lack of expertise on [the eyewitness's] brain injury. These deficiencies rendered his opinions so fundamentally unsupported that they could offer no assistance to the jury and amounted to nothing more than unsupported speculation. His testimony was unreliable, and there was no abuse of discretion in excluding it. We further note that Dr. Neuschatz's testimony was inconclusive and speculative because he did not offer his opinions to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, but testified only that Josh's lineup identification \"could\" be unreliable and that in-court identifications \"probably\" are suggestive. Nor did Dr. Neuschatz submit any peer-reviewed publications supporting his principles and methodologies; the trial court had only the benefit of Dr. Neuschatz's curriculum vitae and his testimony that his studies had been subjected to peer review and publication and were generally accepted in the relevant scientific community. These facts further support the exclusion of Dr. Neuschatz's testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    Corrothers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6911251\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/278/\">\n    148 So.3d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 44. In the instant case, the trial court applied the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   factors and held that Dr. Neuschatz's theories were not generally accepted and that he did not provide information about the rate of error or the principles and methods used. As to the first factor, Dr. Neuschatz's affidavit cited several tests that support his theory that exposure time, appearance change/disguise, and post-identification feedback may affect eyewitness identifications. However, he did not submit documentation of the tests. Regarding peer review and publication, Dr. Neuschatz's affidavit stated that he has \"published several articles in peer reviewed journals, written peer invited chapters, and presented [his] research findings at regional and national conferences.\" Again, however, he did not provide the articles. The same was true in\n   <em>\n    Corrothers\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Corrothers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6911251\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/278/\">\n    148 So.3d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 35). Dr. Neuschatz's affidavit did not mention anything relevant to the third or fourth factors-the known or potential rate of error of the applied theory and the existence of standards and controls-therefore, the factors were not satisfied. Finally, Dr. Neuschatz cited several articles and studies supporting his theories to show that his theory is accepted in the scientific community but again, the articles were not submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 45. Because Flowers did not provide an additional proffer of Dr. Neuschatz's testimony, we have no way of knowing whether Dr. Neuschatz could have offered further support for the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   factors if he had provided live testimony. We do not hold that every expert is required to submit every article or report on which he or she relies. However, here, the trial judge-in exercising his considerable discretion-found that the defense did not present sufficient evidence in support of Dr. Neuschatz's opinions. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the affidavit alone was insufficient to withstand the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   analysis and in denying Dr. Neuschatz's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 46. Dr. Neuschatz's affidavit included two opinions: that Collins's identification could have been affected by several factors and that the photo identification process was flawed. Regarding the photo array, the same issue was addressed in\n   <em>\n    Corrothers\n   </em>\n   , and we held that Dr. Neuschatz's testimony may have been more prejudicial than probative due to the risk of confusion.\n   <em>\n    Corrothers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6911251\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/278/\">\n    148 So.3d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 36). Allowing testimony from Dr. Neuschatz that the photo identification process was flawed, while also admitting evidence of the identification because the court determined\n   that it was not impermissibly suggestive, could result in confusing the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the trial court did not err in excluding Dr. Neuschatz's testimony about the photo-identification process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 47. As to Collins's identification, discussed at length\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the judge held: \"[G]iven the extensive cross-examination of Mr. Collins and because all other witnesses knew Mr. Flowers on sight, I do not believe an expert on witness identification would assist the jury in the least bit in this case.\" The quoted finding represents precisely the type of finding the trial judge is called upon to make. In determining the admissibility of expert testimony, the trial judge must determine whether the testimony will \"assist the trier of fact\" in understanding the evidence or issues, and the judge must be satisfied that the testimony is \"more probative than prejudicial.\"\n   <em>\n    Corrothers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6911251\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/278/\">\n    148 So.3d at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 24, 27) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 48. We recognize that many courts admit expert testimony regarding eyewitness identification, and we do not hold that such expert testimony is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   inadmissible. Rather, we recognize that the decision of \"whether to admit this testimony is squarely within the discretion of the trial judge[.]\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit explained that \"the trial court should exercise its discretion in deciding whether or not to admit it and should balance the reliability of the testimony against the likelihood that the testimony would overwhelm or mislead the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1556406\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/786/1308/#p1312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (discussing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Like the eyewitnesses in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , Collins's identification was far from the only evidence of guilt in the instant case, and it cannot be labeled \"critical.\" No fewer than seven other witnesses placed Flowers near Angelica Garment Factory, where Simpson's gun was stolen, and near Tardy Furniture on the morning of the murders. Collins's testimony was no different. He identified Flowers as a man he saw outside Tardy Furniture. Out of all of the witnesses, Collins was the only witness placing Flowers near the scene who did not know Flowers. The other witnesses provided even more credible testimony as they recognized Flowers by sight, having known him previously.

Investigator Jack Matthews interviewed Flowers on the day of the murders and asked him to submit to a gunshot residue test. Flowers agreed to the test. A single particle of gunshot residue was found on the back of Flowers's right hand. Joe Andrews, a forensic scientist who analyzed the gunshot residue test, testified that three scenarios can result in the presence of gunshot residue on a person's hands: (1) the person actually fired a gun; (2) the person was in close proximity to a discharged gun; or (3) the person handled an object that had gunshot residue on it. At trial, Flowers moved to exclude the evidence concerning the gunshot residue, and the trial court denied the motion. Flowers contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that a particle of gunshot residue was found on his hand approximately three hours after the murders were reported.

First, although Flowers vehemently argues on appeal his theory that the number of victims and the placement of the gunshot wounds demonstrate that the murders were \"almost certainly\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a one-man crime,\" that theory was not presented at trial. Therefore, Flowers cannot raise it on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Lyons v.

Regarding motive, Flowers claims that the State failed to prove that he was so aggrieved about being firing from Tardy Furniture that the firing resulted in his murdering four people. To support his contention, Flowers cites his statement given to the police shortly after the murders. Flowers told investigators that he had worked at Tardy Furniture for about three days at the beginning of July 1996. On his last day, Flowers improperly loaded large tractor batteries, and they fell off the truck and were damaged. Bertha Tardy told Flowers that the cost of the damaged batteries would be deducted from his paycheck. Flowers failed to return to work after the incident. After not reporting to work for several days, Flowers called Bertha Tardy and asked if he still had a job. Bertha Tardy told Flowers that he no longer had a job and that the majority of\n   his paycheck was \"covered up with [the] batteries.\" Flowers never stated that he was angry with Bertha Tardy for losing his job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6 63. Flowers is correct that the State did not provide direct evidence of any anger toward the Tardy Furniture employees, but the State did provide evidence that Flowers had lost his job at Tardy Furniture and had his paycheck reduced as a result of the damaged batteries. A reasonable juror could conclude from that evidence-and it is in the jury's province to draw such inferences if reasonable-that Flowers had a motive to rob Tardy Furniture and kill four employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9305293\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/860/704/#p739\">\n    860 So.2d 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739 (\u00b6 125) (Miss. 2003) (\"It is within the jury's province to draw reasonable inferences from facts based on experience and common sense.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

The State's evidence supported the contention that Flowers had a motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 64. Next, Flowers contends that the State's theory hinged on proving that Flowers knew he would find a gun in Simpson's car the morning of the murders, and he claims the State failed to prove that. He cites Simpson's testimony that Flowers did not know Simpson's gun was in his car on the morning of the murders:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   Q. Your testimony was you did not recall agreeing and saying there was no way that Curtis Flowers would have known that gun was in the car that particular morning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   A. No. He, he didn't know it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   Q. He did not know it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   A. He did not know it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Although Simpson stated at that point in his testimony that Flowers did not know the gun was in his car on the morning of the murders, Simpson had first testified that Flowers had seen the gun in Simpson's car previously. In a followup question regarding whether Flowers knew the gun was in his car that morning, Simpson confirmed that Flowers had seen the gun in his car before.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   Q. So you had known [Flowers] pretty much forever.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   A. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   Q.

You were asked ... whether or not there was any way he knew the gun was in there that morning and your answer was that it wasn't; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   A. That's right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   Q. But you were also asked how [Flowers] knew you kept a gun in your car, I believe.

Yes, sir, he had.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   \u00b6 65. Because Flowers previously had seen Simpson's gun in his car, the evidence supports the contention that Flowers knew he would find the gun in Simpson's car the morning of the murders. The jury, as \"the ultimate finder of fact,\" is responsible for considering the evidence and weighing the credibility of witnesses, and the Court will not reweigh the evidence on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Conley v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085293\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/790/773/#p807\">\n    790 So.2d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 807 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. 2001) (\"We do not have the task of re-weighing the facts in each case and going behind the verdict of the jury to detect whether the testimony and evidence they chose to believe was or was not the most credible.\"). Whether the jury believed that Flowers knew Simpson kept a gun in his car was one piece of evidence for the jury to consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   \u00b6 66. Flowers also attacks the credibility of the witnesses who placed him walking between his home, Angelica Garment Factory, and Tardy Furniture the morning of the murder. He asserts that the $30,000 reward for information lured the witnesses to testify. Several witnesses testified that they were aware a reward was being offered for information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some witnesses were not asked about the reward. Two of Flowers's fact witnesses, Latarsha Blissett and Kittery Jones, testified that investigators had implied that they would receive the reward if they provided statements implicating Flowers. The reward was never given. The jury heard testimony related to the reward, and Flowers's counsel argued during closing argument that investigators allegedly had tried to entice witness statements by offering the reward. The issue was within the jury's province of determining credibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7011231\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/110/776/#p782\">\n    110 So.3d at 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \u00b6 67. Flowers also claims that testimony from people who saw him on the morning of the murders is not credible because the witnesses' testimony contains \"irreconcilable differences.\" One difference Flowers cites is the witnesses' descriptions of his clothing. One witness testified that Flowers was wearing black windsuit pants; another said Flowers had on brown pants; and another thought Flowers wore white shorts. Flowers also points out that the times at which the witnesses claimed to have seen him at various locations in Winona overlap. For example, James Kennedy testified that he saw Flowers in front of his home at 7:15 a.m., but Katherine Snow said that she saw Flowers at Angelica at 7:15. Inconsistency in witness testimony is an issue of credibility for the jury. \"It is within the jury's province to determine the weight and credibility to give to the evidence, resolving all conflicts in the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7011231\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/110/776/#p782\">\n    110 So.3d at 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   \u00b6 68. Finally, Flowers claims that the physical evidence linking him to the murders lacks probative value. First, he argues that the bloody shoeprint found at the scene does not connect him to the crime, because another person could have come into the store after the murders and stepped on the bloody floor. His assertion lacks merit. The shoeprint was from a size ten-and-a-half Fila Grant Hill tennis shoe. Flowers wore a size ten-and-a-half shoe. A shoebox for size ten-and-a-half Fila Grant Hill tennis shoes was found in Flowers's girlfriend's home. Witnesses testified that they had seen Flowers wearing Fila Grant Hill shoes. Second, Flowers contends that the gunshot residue particle found on his hand has no probative value, claiming that it could have come from another source. As discussed above, Joe Andrews, a forensic scientist, testified that the gunshot residue found on Flowers's hand could prove one of three things: (1) he had discharged a weapon; (2) he had been in close proximity to a discharged weapon; or (3) he had handled an object that had gunshot residue on it. Although the gunshot residue could have come from another source (for example, coming in contact with an item at the police station), one alternative was that Flowers actually fired a weapon. Thus, the evidence does have some probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   \u00b6 69. The State responds to Flowers's claim that the evidence was insufficient by citing the following evidence linking Flowers to the murders: Flowers was fired from Tardy Furniture and was told he would not receive pay for his days worked. Flowers was seen standing next to Simpson's car-where the gun used in the murders was located-on the morning of the murders. Numerous witnesses saw\n   Flowers walking to and from Tardy Furniture on the morning of the murders. The shoeprint found at the crime scene matched Flowers's shoe size and matched a pair of shoes he had been seen wearing. Flowers tested positive for gunshot residue. The only paperwork that had been disturbed at Tardy Furniture was Flowers's paycheck and timecard. Cash was found hidden in Flowers's headboard after the murders. Hallmon testified that Flowers had confessed to committing the murders. When the evidence is viewed as a whole and in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that any rational trier of fact could have found that the State had proved the essential elements of capital murder beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Whether Flowers's right to a fair trial, as guaranteed by Mississippi law and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, was violated by the prosecution referencing facts not in evidence during the culpability phase closing argument.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   \u00b6 70. Flowers claims that the prosecution improperly argued facts not in evidence during its culpability phase closing argument.

Sam Jones's Arrival at Tardy Furniture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   \u00b6 74. Flowers claims that, during closing argument, the State misrepresented Sam Jones's testimony regarding the timeline of events on the morning of the murders. Jones died prior to Flowers's 2010 trial, so his testimony from the 2007 trial was read into evidence. Jones initially testified that he arrived at Tardy Furniture between 9:15 and 9:30 a.m. When the State questioned Jones about the timeline, the State's attorney misstated Jones's arrival time as being closer to 10:00 a.m. The State's attorney asked, \"... when you got to the store, that was going to be closer on up to 10 o'clock, wasn't it?\" Flowers's counsel objected to leading, but the judge overruled the objection. However, Jones never responded to the question. During closing argument, the State discussed the timeline and the attorney said: \"Mr. Sam Jones came into the store slightly after 10:00 on the morning of the 16th and discovered the bodies.\" Flowers claims the statement was prejudicial because it skewed the timeline in the State's favor. Both Porky Collins and Clemmie Flemming testified that they had seen Flowers near Tardy Furniture around 10:00 a.m. Flowers claims that, if Jones's testimony that he arrived at the store between 9:15 and 9:30 had been described accurately, it would have raised a question in the jurors' minds about what Flowers was doing near the murder scene thirty to forty-five minutes after the murders could have occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   \u00b6 75. The State responds that, although Jones did not testify to arriving at the store at 10:00 a.m., other evidence presented at trial supported that position. For example, the 911 call reporting the murders was placed at 10:20 a.m., and Jones testified that he was in Tardy Furniture for ten to fifteen minutes before going to a nearby business to call for help. So, working backward, the conclusion could be drawn that Jones arrived at Tardy Furniture closer to 10:00 a.m., rather than 9:15 or 9:30. Further, the State claims that any misstatement relating to the time Jones arrived was harmless error, and the error was cured with the following comments by defense counsel in its closing statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   [Sam Jones] came in and you know, his testimony, I looked it up as they were saying that. His original testimony was he might have gotten there, started his voyage to go in to-as early as 9:00. He, he thought maybe he got there closer to 9:30. But we know from the police that the call came in at 10:20. And if you will remember, Mr. Jones also told you he thought it might have been 15 minutes before he recovered himself enough to go and actually make the report. So there is a bunch of time in there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Sam Jones did not testify that he arrived at Tardy Furniture at 10:00 a.m. However, a reasonable inference could be drawn from the other evidence, including the 911 call, that Jones may have arrived closer to 10:00. Defense counsel's summary of the timeline in closing and the reasonable inference that could be drawn from the evidence as a whole preclude a finding of plain error on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Flowers's Motive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   \u00b6 76. Next, Flowers claims that the following statement by the prosecutor about Flowers's alleged motive was not based on facts in evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   The investigators learned pretty quickly when they asked who in the world could have had some reason, some motive, some anything to attack four people like this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   Have you had anybody that's had beef with the store? Just one. Well, that doesn't mean he did this though, does it? No. But you check that out. You look at him. And in the course of deciding what, if anything, Curtis Flowers had to do with this crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   In his brief, Flowers claims that no evidence was presented to support the State's theory that Flowers was angry about being fired. To the contrary, the State identified several facts that supported the contention that Flowers \"had beef\" with Tardy Furniture: Flowers lost his job days before the murders. Bertha Tardy deducted the cost of damaged inventory from Flowers's paycheck. Police Chief John Johnson testified that the Tardy family considered Flowers a threat and that \"they were concerned about their safety dealing with him.\" Investigator Jack Matthews testified Flowers was the only employee who had been fired from Tardy Furniture in the last few years and was the only person with whom they had had any problems. Doyle Simpson testified that he had heard that Flowers had \"problems\" with Tardy Furniture. A reasonable inference could be drawn from the evidence that Flowers had ill will toward Tardy Furniture. We cannot say that the State's comment during closing rose to the level of plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Porky Collins's Response to the Photo Lineups\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   \u00b6 77. In his third assignment of error, regarding alleged misstatements by the prosecution, Flowers claims that the prosecutor misrepresented Porky Collins's response to the photo lineup that included Doyle Simpson's photograph. The misrepresentation was prejudicial to Flowers's defense, he claims, because his defense was based partially on the theory that Simpson committed the murders. Collins testified that he did not remember if he had identified Simpson as one of the men he had seen arguing outside Tardy Furniture. Notes taken by an investigator during the photo arrays provided that Collins had said that two of the individuals resembled one of the men but that the \"hairline was further back.\" Investigator Wayne Miller testified that Collins had pointed to Simpson during the photo array and said he looked like the person, but he could not be positive. Collins was shown a second array of photos, and he definitively identified Flowers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   \u00b6 78. During closing argument, the State's attorney said the following about Collins's identification: \"He said the guy ain't there. They took another six photographs and said look at this second set. He said that's him right there. ... You know, see if he is in there. No, he is not. Is he in the second group? Yeah. That's him right there.\" The State correctly reiterated that Collins had identified Flowers in the second photo array as one of the men he had seen arguing outside Tardy Furniture. While the State's statement that Collins had said \"the guy ain't there\" was not an\n   accurate representation of Collins's response to the first photo array, the reality is that Collins did not identify Simpson. He said he could not be sure. He pointed to Simpson's photograph in the first array and said he \"looked like\" the man he saw but he was \"unable to be positive.\" However, when Collins saw Flowers in the second array, he was positive. The prosecutor's statement was slightly inconsistent with the facts, but we cannot say that the comment rose to the level of plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Location of the Victims at the Crime Scene\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   \u00b6 79. Flowers contends that the prosecutor incorrectly described the location of the victims at the crime scene. The prosecutor stated during closing argument that Sam Jones had discovered \"all four victims basically laying in a pile, in a group right at the front counter in Tardy Furniture Store.\" The evidence presented at trial, however, showed that three of the victims were lying a few feet apart from one another, while the fourth victim was a considerable distance away. Flowers argues that the prosecutor's statement was prejudicial because it aided in undercutting the theory that the murders were committed by more than one person. Essentially, Flowers claims that the idea of four victims \"piled together\" aligns with a one-person crime, whereas victims spread across a larger area paints the picture of a two-man crime. The State admits that the \"lying in a pile\" statement was incorrect, but the State points out that three of the four victims were lying close to one another. The State asserts that the statement did not prejudice Flowers. As previously mentioned, Flowers did not present the \"two-man crime\" theory to the jury. And Flowers does not claim that the prosecutor's statement prejudiced him in any other way. Applying the plain error doctrine, the statement may have been an error, but we cannot say that it resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice or resulted in an unfair trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7015589\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/92/676/#p682\">\n    92 So.3d at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

In today's case, Flowers cites four statements made during closing argument that he claims were not supported by the evidence.

The statement about the bodies being piled up was a misstatement, but it does not satisfy the standard for plain error.

That is each sides [sic] gets to make peremptory challenges. But because\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   was\n   reversed on\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   is certainly no grounds for saying that they should now be denied the right to use peremptory. The Supreme Court of this State has certainly never said that on a retrial you could not use peremptory challenges, nor has the United States Supreme Court ever said that. And so you're pulling that motion totally out of thin air and without any basis in law or in fact for making it. So it's denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   \u00b6 107. Flowers's counsel continued to argue the history of\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violations in support of the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claim at trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-234\">\n   And we think it is, therefore, pretextual specific and particularly in light under-of the history of race discrimination in jury selection in this district and in this particular case found by the Mississippi Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v. Flowers\n   </em>\n   after the third trial, the first one in this district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Indeed, the trial court was presented with and rejected Flowers's present argument that he had advanced at trial. Flowers argued to the trial court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-236\">\n   And I think that that is in\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   , what the Supreme Court of Mississippi said was that when you are looking at\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   , you look at the totality of the circumstances and you go beyond little excuses. And that the danger, certainly, in\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   is to devolve-for the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenging process, to devolve into an effort of uncovering and coming up with facially neutral reasons that are merely a mask for actually racially discriminatory reasons, the desire to bleach or-I suppose, if it were the other way around darken or make male or make female, the jury and that the Court, considering the totality of the circumstances, cannot simply express this distinction. This is based on the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause. And there is a huge body of equal protection civil litigation. It is referred to by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , the most recent case in which a verdict was reversed on\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   in the United States Supreme Court. And basically, the situation is that you may go behind the facial neutrality if anything in the record suggests that one or more of the reasons may be either unconnected and related to what is really a material issue in this case and/or appears to have been pursued with more vigor in an attempt to uncover some excuse that is of less than universal relevance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Again, Flowers's counsel ensured that the trial court consider the totality of the circumstances, including historical evidence of racial discrimination by the district attorney.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-238\">\n   Again, we would cite the totality of the circumstances and the apparent cherry picking of the African-American jurors for scrutiny and attention. And in light of the history of racial discrimination by this district attorney's office in this district, we would say the totality of the circumstances makes this a pretext for discrimination and attempt to look for race-neutral reasons for racially motivated peremptory striking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   \u00b6 108. The trial court not only considered Flowers's counsel's argument in its consideration of the totality of the circumstances; the\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   Court also considered other circumstances showing that Evans did not have discriminatory intent. The trial court certainly considered circumstances surrounding the previous trials as evidenced by its response to Flowers's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   But you know full well from past experiences in this county because of the number of people that know Mr. Flowers, they know his parents, they know his brother, they know his sisters, and he I mean he has got a large number of\n   siblings. And all of those people you know, I mean he is so well-known here that, you know, you've got a number of African-Americans that say I know him. I can't be fair. I know these people. I can't sit in judgment of their son. And there is there is no way to avoid that if this case is tried in this county. Because this is the same type things that, that occurred in the previous trials where he had so many people that knew him. You know, I don't-I hadn't kept a running count of anything in here but, you know, there is nothing that has-that has-no discrimination that's occurred that has caused this, what you call, statistical abnormality now. It is strictly because of the prominence of his family.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   \u00b6 109. The prior adjudications of the violation of\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   do not undermine Evans's race neutral reasons as the despicable jury selection file in\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   had undermined the prosecution's race neutral explanations. We cannot say that the exceptional circumstances discussed in\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   are present in today's case so as to prevent the Court from deferring to the trial court's factual determinations. Moreover, we cannot conclude that the trial court's factual findings were clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   \u00b6 110. Flowers's post-remand briefs spend far more time re-urging the arguments from his original appellate brief than addressing\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   itself. Accordingly, Flowers appears to rely on\n   <em>\n    Miller-El v.

We turn to address Flowers's arguments raised on appeal. Flowers claims that the State exercised its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory way by: (1) disparately questioning African-American jurors as compared to white jurors; (2) responding differently to African-American jurors' voir dire answers as compared to answers of white venire members; and (3) mischaracterizing the voir dire responses of African-American jurors. We do not ignore the historical evidence of racial discrimination in the previous trials in our consideration of Flowers's arguments. However, the historical evidence of past discrimination presented to the trial court does not alter our analysis, as set out in\n   <em>\n    Flowers VI.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Disparate Questioning\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   \u00b6 112. Flowers claims that the questioning of African-American and white jurors was so \"starkly different\" that the questioning led to purposeful discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   First, Flowers asserts that the State asked potential African-American jurors more questions during individual voir dire than potential white jurors. Flowers claims that all African Americans who were struck by the State were asked more than ten questions. That statement is not supported by the record. For example, the State asked Carolyn Wright, an African American against whom the State exercised a peremptory strike, only three questions. However, overall, the State did ask more questions of African-American jurors than of potential white jurors. The State responds that more questions were asked only when a potential juror's answers to voir dire questions were unclear or needed further elaboration. Disparate questioning is evidence of purposeful discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Miller-el v.

Second, Flowers claims that the State did not question white venire members about their relationships with defense witnesses even though African-American jurors were extensively questioned about similar relationships. To support his argument, Flowers claims that, during voir dire examination by the trial court, four white venire members-Larry Blaylock, Harold Waller, Marcus Fielder, and Bobby Lester-stated that they knew defense witnesses. The record reveals that the potential jurors knew members of law enforcement, the Tardy family, and the victims; but they did not know members of the Flowers family. Of the white jurors who survived for-cause challenges, five knew members of Flowers's family. Four of them knew only one member of Flowers's family; the State did not follow up with them. Pamela Chesteen knew Flowers's father, mother, sisters, and a cousin. The State did not question Chesteen about the relationships during voir dire; however, the trial court asked Chesteen whether the relationships would affect her ability to serve as a juror, and she said they would not. Several African-American venire members were questioned about their relationships with Flowers's family, as will be discussed in detail in the following section. However, the State did not question all potential African-American jurors about their relationships with persons involved in the case. For example, Alexander Robinson, an African American who was selected to be a juror, stated that he knew Flowers's brother, but the State did not question Robinson about that relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   \u00b6 114. The State's assertion that elaboration and followup questions were needed with more of the African-American jurors is supported by the record. Most of the followup questions pertained to the potential juror's knowledge of the case, whether they could impose the death penalty, and whether certain relationships would influence their decision or prevent them from being fair and impartial. The jurors who had heard little about the case, who said they would not be influenced by what they had heard, and who said they would not be influenced by relationships were asked the fewest questions. The jurors who knew more about the case, who had personal relationships with Flowers's family members, who said they could not be impartial, or who said they could not impose the death penalty were asked more questions. Those issues are appropriate for followup questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   \u00b6 115. We have held that voir dire \"is conducted under the supervision of the court, and a great deal must, of necessity,\n   be left to its sound discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Howell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9305293\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/860/704/#p739\">\n    860 So.2d at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 67) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ballenger v.

The trial judge participated in voir dire, asking his own questions when necessary. Flowers was given ample opportunity to question jurors, rehabilitate jurors, and make challenges. That he had these opportunities is evidence of a fair and proper jury selection process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9305293\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/860/704/#p739\">\n    860 So.2d at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 69) ;\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , 806 So.2d at 1062 (\u00b6 139). There is no evidence of discrimination based on the number of questions asked alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Disparate Treatment of Individual Venire Members\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   \u00b6 116. Flowers also contends that the State: (1) responded differently to African-American jurors' voir dire answers compared to the answers of white venire members, and (2) mischaracterized the voir dire responses of African-American jurors. For the purpose of our analysis, the two issues are addressed together by discussing the African-American venire members who were struck from the venire by the State's use of peremptory strikes. We address the State's race neutral reasons for striking the jurors, as well as Flowers's arguments regarding each, which includes his contentions that the State mischaracterized the voir dire responses of the jurors and responded differently to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Carolyn Wright\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   \u00b6 117. The State gave the following reasons for its peremptory strike of Carolyn Wright: (1) she knew several defense witnesses; (2) she was sued by Tardy Furniture for an overdue account; and (3) she had worked with Archie Flowers Sr. at Walmart. At the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing, Flowers offered rebuttals for the State's reasons, but the trial court held that the State's reasons for striking Wright were race neutral. The trial court summed up its finding by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   If the only reason the State offered was that she knows some of these defense witnesses, then there might be something there. But the fact is knowing these defense witnesses that you're intending to call, plus the fact that Tardy Furniture had to sue her, plus the fact that she worked with Archie, in my mind, creates race-neutral reasons for striking her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   \u00b6 118. One reason the State gave for striking Wright was that she knew multiple defense witnesses. In fact, Wright knew a total of thirty-four people who were involved with Flowers's case. Flowers argues that striking Wright because she knew several potential witnesses was pretextual because the State did not strike white jurors who were acquainted with multiple people involved in the case. Specifically, Flowers points to Pamela Chesteen, who knew thirty-one people involved in the case; Harold Waller, who knew eighteen people involved in the case; and Bobby Lester, who knew twenty-seven people involved in the case. We recognize that one of the indicia of pretext is \"the presence of unchallenged jurors of the opposite race who share the characteristic given as the basis for the challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11241066\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/765/516/#p519\">\n    765 So.2d at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 9). However, the number of acquaintances was not the sole reason given by the State, so the basis is not an automatic showing of pretext.\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021419\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/90/613/#p626\">\n    90 So.3d at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 37) (\"Where multiple reasons lead to a peremptory strike, the fact that other jurors may have some of the individual characteristics of\n   the challenged juror does not demonstrate that the reasons assigned are pretextual.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   \u00b6 119. The second reason the State gave for striking Wright was that she had been sued by Tardy Furniture. As a rebuttal to that reason, Flowers alleged at the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing that the State did not question white jurors about their accounts at Tardy Furniture. However, the court had asked all jurors during group voir dire if they had accounts at Tardy Furniture and if they had been sued by the store. The court found that the basis was race neutral because none of the white jurors had been sued by Tardy Furniture. On appeal, Flowers claims that the State mischaracterized Wright's litigation with Tardy Furniture by claiming that her wages had been garnished as a result of the litigation. Nothing in the record supports the contention that Wright's wages were garnished. However, that does not change the fact that being sued by Tardy Furniture was a race neutral reason for striking Wright. Prior litigation is a race neutral reason for a preemptive strike.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webster v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11551892\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/754/1232/#p1236\">\n    754 So.2d 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1236 (\u00b6\u00b6 9-11) (Miss. 2000) (finding that potential juror's company being sued by defense attorney in previous and unrelated litigation was sufficient race neutral reason for peremptory strike).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   \u00b6 120. The State's third reason for striking Wright was that she worked with Archie Flowers Sr. at Walmart. At the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing, Flowers rebutted that reason by comparing Wright's working relationship with Archie to Chesteen, a teller at a local bank where members of the Flowers family were customers. The trial court found this to be a race neutral reason and found that Wright's working relationship with Archie was distinguishable from the professional relationship Chesteen had with the Flowers family. Chesteen worked at a local bank in Winona and stated that she knew Archie Flowers Sr., Lola Flowers, and Flowers's sisters from her work at the bank. We agree with the trial judge that a coworker relationship and bank employee/customer relationship are distinguishable. Further, the trial court stated that the Winona Walmart was the \"smallest Wal-Mart ... in existence\" that he knew of, implying that Wright and Archie certainly had known each other. The trial court also stated that no white jurors had reported working at Walmart with Archie. Being acquainted with the defendant's family is a race neutral reason for striking a juror.\n   <em>\n    Manning v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11659883\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/735/323/#p340\">\n    735 So.2d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340 (\u00b6 32) (Miss. 1999) (\"We have condoned a peremptory challenge against a juror who was acquainted with the defendant's family.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Porter v.

Flowers's claim that the State provided \"no convincing reasons\" for striking Wright is simply unfounded. Wright had worked with Flowers's father, she knew thirty-two of the potential witnesses, and she had been sued by Tardy Furniture. We also note that, on her juror questionnaire, Wright wrote that she previously had served as a juror in a criminal case involving the \"Tardy Furniture trial.\" The State had multiple, credible, race neutral reasons for striking Wright, and the trial judge did not err in denying Flowers's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge as to the juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Dianne Copper\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   \u00b6 122. The State cited the following reasons for its exercise of a peremptory strike of Dianne Copper : (1) she had worked with Flowers's father and sister; (2) she knew several members of the Flowers family; (3) she said she \"leaned toward\" Flowers's side of the case due to her relationships with the Flowers family; and (4) she knew several defense witnesses. Flowers offered rebuttal to the State's reasons by again asserting that the State had\n   not challenged white jurors connected to people involved in the case. He also claimed that the State did not attempt to rehabilitate Copper after she said leaned toward Flowers. The trial court found the State's reasons to be race neutral, concluding that Copper's relationships were distinguishable from those of the white jurors who were not challenged and recognizing that other jurors had not said they favored Flowers as Copper did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   \u00b6 123. During voir dire, Copper was questioned about her relationships with members of the Flowers family, and she revealed the following: Copper once lived in the same neighborhood as the Flowers family. She had worked with Flowers's sister, Cora, at Shoe World for \"a year or two.\" She also had worked with Flowers's father for \"one or two years.\" Copper testified that she knew Flowers's mother, Lola, and his brother, Archie Jr. She also knew more than twenty other potential witnesses. Altogether, Copper knew at least thirty people involved in the case. The State asked Copper about her comment that knowing so many people connected to the case would make her lean toward Flowers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n   Q. And I think it was yesterday and my notes show that you said that the fact that you know all of these people could affect you and you think it could make you lean toward him because of your connection to all of these people. Is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-263\">\n   A. It-it's possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-264\">\n   Q. Okay. That would be something that would be entering into your mind if you were on the jury, wouldn't it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-265\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-266\">\n   Q.

Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   At that point, Flowers's counsel attempted to rehabilitate Copper :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-269\">\n   Q. ... What I'm trying to find out is just as you could put aside all the information you heard before about this case, could you not also put aside the fact-if you got picked as a juror, put aside the fact that you have met Mr. Flowers, that you know some other people in these cases and be fair to the Tardys, the Stewarts, the Goldens, and Rigbys, and make whatever decision or vote that you're going to make based on the evidence and the evidence only. Could you do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-270\">\n   A. I feel like I could. But, you know, it-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n   Q.

You'd prefer not to-I get the impression you're saying that you'd rather not be a juror. But if you got picked to be one, you would take the responsibility seriously, and you would follow the law and the rules that the Court give[s] you, and you would put aside anything that you are required to put aside and make your evidence and make your vote based on just the evidence you hear in the courtroom. Is that fair to say?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-274\">\n   A. Yes, sir. That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Clearly, Copper knew several members of the Flowers family and she was uncomfortable serving on the jury.

On appeal, Flowers claims that the State mischaracterized Copper's statement that she \"leaned toward\" Flowers due to her relationship with the Flowers family, but a reading of the record shows that the State correctly described her voir dire testimony. The State made the following argument during the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-277\">\n   And the reason I point that out, it's not just that she knows those witnesses, but that because of knowing the family and working with those two family members, she stated that that relationship would influence her.

But because of all those relationships, she clearly stated, when I asked her, that they would influence her. She could not have an open mind, and she was leaning toward the Defendant's family.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   The State's argument accurately reflected Copper's testimony, including the defense's attempt to rehabilitate her. Even more, defense counsel asked Copper if she would \"rather not be a juror,\" and she agreed. The Court has recognized that reluctance to serve as a juror is a race neutral basis for a peremptory strike.\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021419\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/90/613/#p626\">\n    90 So.3d at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 36) (citing\n   <em>\n    Lynch v.

Flowers claims that the State's strike of Copper was pretextual because white jurors who knew several defense witnesses were not struck. As mentioned above, one indicium of pretext is \"the presence of unchallenged jurors of the opposite race who share the characteristic given as the basis for the challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11241066\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/765/516/#p519\">\n    765 So.2d at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 9). However, like Wright, the number of acquaintances was not the sole reason given by the State for striking Copper, so the instant basis is not an automatic showing of pretext.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021419\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/90/613/#p626\">\n    90 So.3d at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 37). Again, Flowers claims that the State did not provide any convincing reasons for striking Copper and, again, Flowers's claim is unfounded. Copper lived in the same neighborhood as the Flowers family, knew multiple members of the family, and had worked with Flowers's father and sister. She admitted that, in light of the relationships, she leaned toward Flowers in the case. Copper also said that she would rather not serve as a juror. All of the given reasons are race neutral reasons for a peremptory strike. The trial court did not err in denying Flowers's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge as to Copper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Flancie Jones\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   \u00b6 126. The State gave several reasons for the peremptory strike of Flancie Jones: (1) she was related to Flowers; (2) she was late for jury selection twice; (3) she provided inconsistent statements on her view of the death penalty; and (4) she lied on her juror questionnaire in an attempt to get out of jury service. The trial court found that the State had provided sufficient race neutral reasons for the strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   \u00b6 127. In response to the State's first basis-that Jones is related to Flowers-Flowers claims that the State mischaracterized and exaggerated Jones's relationship with Flowers. The State described the relationship between the two as follows: \"She is related to the defendant. She admitted that she was related-she was a cousin-or the defendant's sister, Angela Jones, is her niece. So she said she guessed she must be related to him. Well, I guess so. He would be her nephew.\" During voir dire, Jones said that Flowers was her \"sister-in-law's sister's son.\" She also said that Flowers's sister was her\n   niece. Jones's statements regarding her relationship to Flowers were confusing, but the trial court seemed to understand and concluded that Jones had more than one familial connection to Flowers. The trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-283\">\n   She said that Angela Ward Jones was married to Mark Jones, and she said that was her nephew. She's not directly related to Mr. Flowers. She's related by marriage to Mr. Flowers's sister. And then Hazel Jones is her husband's brother's wife and, you know, that's another family connection there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   Although one may not typically describe the child of an in-law's sibling as a niece or nephew, Jones's own statement that Flowers's sister was her niece supported the State's position that Flowers was Jones's nephew. Flowers's contention that the State mischaracterized and exaggerated the relationship is without merit. And, again, being acquainted with the defendant's family is a race neutral reason for striking a juror.\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11659883\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/735/323/#p340\">\n    735 So.2d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   \u00b6 128. The other reasons the State provided for its strike also are race neutral. Jones was late for jury selection on two days. For one of the days, Jones's excuse was that she had difficulty waking up early in the morning because she used to work nights. On the other day, Jones said she was late because she was looking for her jury questionnaire. Jones also provided inconsistent statements on her view of the death penalty, and she admitted that she wrote on her questionnaire that she was against the death penalty in an effort to get out of jury service:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-286\">\n   Q: ... And I think on your questionnaire, you said you were strongly against the death penalty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n   A: I guess I'd say anything to get off.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-288\">\n   Q: Okay. Well, are you saying that you didn't tell the truth?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-289\">\n   A: No, that's not that. It's just that if I didn't have to be here, I wouldn't want to be here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-290\">\n   Q: Well, I want to know when you put down you were strongly against the death penalty-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-291\">\n   A: I was trying to not be-I-really and truly, I don't want to be here. I'll say it like that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-292\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-293\">\n   Q: When you put down that you strongly didn't believe in the death penalty, were you being truthful?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-294\">\n   A: No ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   Being late on two days, lying on her questionnaire, and blatantly saying that she did not want to be there and that she would \"say anything to get off\" reflect an overall attitude of contempt toward jury service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   \u00b6 129. Jones's late arrival and her attitude toward jury service, evidencing a lack of concern about or commitment to the proceedings, are two race neutral reasons for a peremptory strike.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214636\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/877/1254/#p1274\">\n    877 So.2d at 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 59) (reluctance to serve was a race neutral basis for a peremptory strike);\n   <em>\n    Brewer v.

The State did not misrepresent Jones's relationship with Flowers, and the State provided several race neutral reasons for striking her. Flowers's claims regarding Jones are without merit. The trial court did not err in denying Flowers's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge regarding the juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Tashia Cunningham\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   \u00b6 131. The State's reasons for striking Tashia Cunningham included: (1) her working relationship with Flowers's sister, and (2) her wavering statements about the death penalty. At the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing, Flowers attempted to rebut by pointing to Cunningham's testimony that she could be a neutral juror and could set aside her relationship with Flowers's sister. Flowers compared Cunningham to Chesteen, who knew Flowers's family from the bank. Finally, Flowers claimed that Cunningham's alleged wavering views on the death penalty were similar to the views of white jurors. The trial court held that the State's reasons were race neutral, concluding: \"Ms. Cunningham's all-over-the-map response to the death penalty, plus her situation about working so closely with Mr. Flowers's sister, in my mind, the State has shown race-neutral reasons for that strike.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   \u00b6 132. During voir dire, Cunningham said she did not have a close relationship with Flowers's sister, Sherita Baskin. She said they had a \"working relationship.\" Cunningham said she and Baskin had worked the same shift for two or three years, but they did not see each other every day at work. Cunningham said she worked at the end of the assembly line, and Baskin worked at the front of the line. The State asked Cunningham further questions about that relationship:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-302\">\n   Q: And you work with the Defendant's sister, Sherita Baskin?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-303\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-304\">\n   Q: Now, the other day, I think you said that you do not work close to her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-305\">\n   A: No, I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-306\">\n   Q: Would you think about that for a minute?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-307\">\n   A: I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-308\">\n   Q: Are you sure that you do not work side by side with her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-309\">\n   A: No, I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-310\">\n   Q: And you're saying that under oath?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-311\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   The State then called Cunningham's employer, ADP, to confirm her testimony relating to her working relationship with Baskin. An ADP quality control clerk, Crystal Carpenter, testified that Cunningham and Baskin worked on the same assembly line with twenty-five to thirty-five people. Carpenter testified that Cunningham and Baskin worked side-by-side,\"nine or ten inches\" apart from one another. Carpenter testified that she saw the women working every day and that her testimony was based on her personal observations. Flowers's counsel asked Carpenter if there was documentation supporting the location of Cunningham and Baskin on the assembly line, and Carpenter said she could provide documentation supporting her testimony. Apparently, Carpenter did not provide the documentation. Thus, Flowers claims that the instant basis for the State's peremptory strike is unfounded. Flowers's claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   \u00b6 133. We hold that the blatantly conflicting testimony of Cunningham and Carpenter was a race neutral basis for the State's challenge, as concern about a juror's honesty constitutes a race neutral reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

The State cited Cunningham's wavering views on the death penalty as a second basis for its peremptory strike. On her juror questionnaire, Cunningham marked that she had \"no opinion\" on the death penalty but, on the very next question, she marked that she would not consider the death penalty under any circumstances. During voir dire by the trial court, Cunningham first said she \"would not\" consider the death penalty and that she \"did not believe in the death penalty.\" She confirmed for the court three times that she would not consider the death penalty. However, as questioning continued, Cunningham wavered, saying she \"might\" be able to consider it. During voir dire by the State, Cunningham went back to her initial position that she did not think she could consider the death penalty. Then, when questioned by defense counsel, Cunningham said that she could consider both life in prison and the death penalty. We have held that \"having doubts as to one's ability to follow the law and vote for the death penalty when appropriate is a sufficient race-neutral reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11659883\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/735/323/#p340\">\n    735 So.2d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 31) (citing\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

In\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that striking an African American who had \"virtually indistinguishable\" views on the death penalty as white jurors who were not struck raised an inference of discrimination, although, standing alone, it did not warrant finding a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation.\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8343240\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/947/910/\">\n    947 So.2d at 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the instant case, no white jurors survived for-cause challenges who had views on the death penalty comparable to Cunningham's views. Thus, this basis was not pretextual. Cunningham's seeming dishonesty about her relationship with Baskin, her doubt about whether she could impose the death penalty, and her inconsistent statements about the death penalty are all race neutral reasons for a peremptory strike. The trial court did not err in denying the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge as to Cunningham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Edith Burnside\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   \u00b6 136. The State gave the following reasons for striking Edith Burnside: (1) she knew Flowers and members of his family; (2) she was sued by Tardy Furniture; and (3) she had provided inconsistent statements regarding her views on the death penalty. As discussed above, during group voir dire, the trial court asked the entire venire if anyone had been sued by Tardy Furniture. Thus, again, Flowers's claim that only African-American venire members\n   were asked about prior litigation is incorrect. Burnside responded in the affirmative, telling the court that she had been sued by Tardy Furniture. She later explained that she had paid the amount she owed and that the litigation had arisen from a misunderstanding about her account after the murders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   \u00b6 137. At the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing, the State incorrectly stated that a garnishment had been issued against Burnside. The prosecutor said: \"She also was sued by Tardy Furniture, and a garnishment was issued against her. She tried to deny that and said that she just settled with them when she came back but she was, in fact, sued by them.\" In response to the trial court's question about being sued by the store, Burnside had said: \"I had an account there, but I was not sued by Ms. Bertha. It was later on when it was took over by Mr. Frank and Roxanne.\" During individual voir dire, Burnside confirmed that she was sued by Bertha Tardy's son-in-law, but that she had paid him and they \"never had a falling out about it.\" She said the lawsuit would not cause her any difficulty in Flowers's case. Like the State's characterization of Wright's litigation with Tardy Furniture, the statement that Burnside's wages had been garnished and that Burnside had denied it was not supported by the record. However, prior litigation is a race neutral basis for a peremptory strike.\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11551892\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/754/1232/#p1236\">\n    754 So.2d at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 9-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   \u00b6 138. Another reason the State gave for striking Burnside was her relationships with Flowers and his family. Burnside said that she had once lived near the Flowers family, and Flowers and his sister used to visit her home. Flowers was a friend of Burnside's sons and played football with them. Burnside said that the relationships would not affect her ability to serve as a juror. No white venire members had relationships remotely comparable to the relationships Burnside had with Flowers and his family. A juror's relationships with the defendant's family is a race neutral reason for a peremptory challenge.\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11659883\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/735/323/#p340\">\n    735 So.2d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 32). And, again, \"living near the defendant\" is a race neutral reason for a peremptory strike.\n   <em>\n    Lockett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7587151\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/517/1346/#p1350\">\n    517 So.2d at 1356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If simply living near the defendant is a valid reason, then certainly the defendant having visited the juror's home and having been a friend to her children is a valid, race neutral reason. Although Burnside said her connections to the Flowers family would not affect her jury service, the basis is not pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   \u00b6 139. Finally, the State cited Burnside's statements regarding whether she could judge another person and whether she could impose the death penalty as bases for its peremptory strike. During voir dire, Burnside testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-321\">\n   Q: ...

Further, there were no white jurors in the venire whose views and hesitation regarding judgment were comparable to Burnside's views. Although Flowers's counsel did rehabilitate Burnside, her remarks unquestionably were a race neutral basis for the challenge. The trial court did not err in denying the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge as to Burnside, as the State provided multiple race neutral reasons for striking her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   \u00b6 141. We hold Flowers's claim that the trial court erred in denying his\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenges to be without merit.

Further, the State's contention that the additional questions were asked to clarify and follow up on certain issues is supported by the record. The State provided multiple race neutral reasons for the peremptory strikes against each of the five African Americans.

Flowers takes several approaches to support his contention that he was denied the right to a fair trial because the jury was biased. He asserts that: (1) racial bias in the community is evident by the Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   ; (2) racial bias and tension was demonstrated by the arrest of two African Americans for perjury during one of Flowers's previous trials; (3) excessive law enforcement personnel were present at the trial; (4) a majority of the jurors empaneled were acquainted with either Flowers or the victims or had formed opinions related to the case prior to trial; (5) the trial court erroneously denied several of Flowers's challenges for cause; (6) the trial court erred by failing to quash the entire venire; and (7) the jury interrupted an important mitigation witness. To cure the alleged biases, Flowers claims that the trial court should have quashed the venire or, in the alternative, provided for a \"cooling-off period\" until an unbiased jury from Montgomery County could be empaneled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   \u00b6 147. First, Flowers asserts that bias is evident from the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   . Flowers's claim comes from the Court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   that the case presented \"as strong a prima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8343240\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/947/910/\">\n    947 So.2d at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 66). The problems surrounding jury selection in\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   are not present in today's case. In that case, the State exercised all twelve of its peremptory strikes on African Americans and its three peremptory\n   strikes for alternate jurors on African Americans.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8343240\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/947/910/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8343240\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/947/910/\">\n    at 917-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court found that the following facts resulted in a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation: the State exercised peremptory strikes against African-American veniremen who shared characteristics with tendered white jurors; the State's proffered race neutral reasons for striking African Americans were not supported by the record; and the State failed to voir dire other jurors as to a characteristic cited as a race neutral basis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8343240\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/947/910/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8343240\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/947/910/\">\n    at 935-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the facts were particular to the third trial, and\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that the community as a whole-and any future venire-would be biased. The claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   \u00b6 148. Second, Flowers claims that racial tension was escalated by the arrests of two African-American jurors for perjury during Flowers's fourth trial. During that trial, Mary Annette Purnell, an African American who was selected to serve as alternate juror, said during voir dire that she did not know Flowers or his family, but after the jury was selected, another juror reported to the prosecution that Purnell knew Flowers and his family. Purnell admitted to meeting with Flowers prior to the trial but after the jury summons. Apparently, during jury selection, Flowers gave his attorney a note that said they needed to \"fight for\" Purnell to be on the jury. Flowers's counsel denied having read the note prior to the perjury accusations. Purnell pleaded guilty to perjury and received two ten-year sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   \u00b6 149. At the end of the fourth trial, after the jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision, jurors reported to the trial court that James Bibbs, an African-American juror, had told other jurors that the police did not adequately investigate the murders and that evidence had been planted. After the jury was released, the trial court questioned Bibbs about the reports. Bibbs denied making the exact statements, but he admitted that he had told other jurors that he had been in an alley close to Tardy Furniture on the day of the murders and that investigators did not inspect that area. Bibbs claimed that he did not report the information during voir dire because he misunderstood questions relating to whether he had knowledge of the crimes. Although the reason is unclear from the record, the perjury charges against Bibbs eventually were\n   <em>\n    nolle prossed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   \u00b6 150. Flowers claims that Bibbs was possibly the only juror at the fourth trial who did not vote to convict Flowers. He further contends that the perjury arrests \"escalated\" racial tension and that the arrests were reported in the press and \"pervaded the jury venire\" in today's case. To support his contentions, Flowers cites local media articles discussing the perjury arrests. Nothing in the record, however, discusses whether members of the venire in today's case were aware of the arrests. Further, nothing in the record suggests that the arrests were anything less than legitimate. Clearly, Purnell admitted to perjury, and Bibbs admitted to having knowledge that he did not disclose during voir dire. The contention is not supported by the record and is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-372\">\n   \u00b6 151. Next, Flowers's claim that excessive law enforcement presence caused bias in the venire also is without merit. When Flowers's counsel raised concerns that venire members were standing close to a law enforcement officer during voir dire, the trial court responded by reminding counsel that the potential jurors could be questioned about any contact with law enforcement during voir dire. Considering the notoriety of the crimes in the case, a large number of law enforcement personnel would be expected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-373\">\n   \u00b6 152. Further, Flowers's claim that the jury interrupted a mitigation witness is not supported by the record. During the mitigation phase, pizza was ordered for the jury. Apparently, the pizza arrived while Archie Flowers Sr., Flowers's father, was providing mitigation testimony. In response to the food arriving, Flowers's counsel stated: \"Your honor, if the jurors' food is here, I don't want to stand in the way of that.\" There is no indication that the jury interrupted the witness, and Flowers's counsel encouraged the recess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   \u00b6 153. Flowers asserts that a majority of the jurors empaneled were acquainted with Flowers, acquainted with the victims, or had formed opinions related to the case prior to trial. Flowers claims that the venire was skewed in favor of the prosecution because a higher percentage of potential jurors who were familiar with Flowers and his family were struck from the venire compared to venire members who were familiar with the victims and their families. He claims that, because potential jurors who were familiar with the Flowers family were more likely to state that their relationships with the family would affect their ability to serve as fair and impartial jurors, ultimately, a higher percentage of jurors who were familiar with the victims and their families was empaneled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   \u00b6 154. Jurors who state that their relationship with a defendant or a victim would affect their ability to be impartial properly are struck for cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11659883\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/735/323/#p340\">\n    735 So.2d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 31) (\"doubts as to one's ability to follow the law and vote for the death penalty when appropriate is a sufficient race-neutral reason\");\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , 806 So.2d at 1062 (\u00b6 138) (removal of juror is justified where the trial court is \"is left with the impression that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wainwright v.

Flowers's claim that the trial court erred by denying several of his challenges for cause fails. The potential jurors that Flowers challenged for cause were not selected to serve as jurors, and Flowers did not exercise all of his peremptory challenges. \"Denial of challenge for cause is not error where it is not shown that the defense has exhausted peremptory challenges and is thus forced to accept the juror.

Lastly, Flowers suggests that the trial court should have quashed the entire venire or provided for a \"cooling-off period\" until a fair and impartial jury could be empaneled, and he claims that the trial court's failure to do so was error. Flowers's suggested remedies are not viable. Flowers's claim that a pervasive bias existed throughout the community conflicts with his suggestion that another venire should have been empaneled. If the bias was in fact pervasive, another venire from the same community likely would contain the same bias. Flowers's suggested \"cooling-off period\" is even more troublesome, as Flowers himself would be left in\n   limbo awaiting another trial. In\n   <em>\n    Hughes v.

Instruction D-34 provided: \"The Court instructs the jury that if you cannot, within a reasonable time, agree as to punishment, the court will dismiss you and impose a sentence of imprisonment for life without the benefit of parole.\" Flowers claims that the trial court should have granted the instruction because the jury did not receive guidance on what would happen if the jurors could not agree unanimously on a punishment. Flowers contends that the alleged error is evident by a note sent from the jury during the penalty phase.

Similar to\n   <em>\n    Gillett\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   , the trial court in today's case instructed the jury that it could reach three possible outcomes in the penalty phase: death, life without parole, or being unable to agree unanimously on a punishment. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing instruction D-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-411\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Instructions D-38 and D-39\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-412\">\n   \u00b6 169. Flowers claims that the trial court erred by refusing instructions on the jury's ability to consider mercy. Proposed instruction D-38 read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-413\">\n   A mitigating factor is anything that in fairness and mercy may reduce blame or that may justify a sentence less than death. Even if a factor does not justify or excuse the crime it may still be a mitigating factor. It is for each of you to decide if a factor is mitigating.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-414\">\n   Mercy alone can be a mitigating factor you can consider in deciding not to impose the death penalty and to impose a sentence of life without parole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   Instruction D-38 is clearly a mercy instruction, and the Court has recognized that such instructions are not required and \"may be given at the discretion of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11352192,11352518\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/639/1263/\">\n    639 So.2d at 1300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Flowers's counsel recognized during the sentencing instruction hearing that D-38 was a mercy instruction. The trial court did not err in refusing the instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   \u00b6 170. Instruction D-39 provided: \"The death penalty is never required. You may always find that Mr. Flowers should be sentenced to life in prison or life in prison without the possibility of parole.\" Although Flowers describes D-39 as a \"mercy instruction,\" upon close examination, the instruction simply seems to instruct the jury on its ability to impose a sentence of life in prison rather than the death penalty. At the sentencing instruction hearing, the trial court refused the instruction because it was repetitive of the omnibus sentencing instruction given by the trial court. As part of the omnibus instruction, the jury was instructed: \"In the event that you find that the mitigating circumstance(s) do not outweigh or overcome the aggravating circumstance(s), you\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   impose the death sentence.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the jury was given the option to sentence Flowers to life without parole or to impose the death penalty if it found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. Although the life without parole option was stated more clearly in D-39 than in the omnibus instruction, it cannot be said that the jury was not given the instruction. The trial court did not err in refusing instruction D-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Aggravating Circumstances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   \u00b6 171.

In\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that the evidence did not support the \"great risk\" aggravator because the defendant had killed only one person, whom he had been hired to kill, and he fled the scene after shooting that person, even though other people were inside the house at the time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11620879\" index=\"344\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/732/899/#p906\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Corrothers v.

Flowers asserts that the evidence does not indicate that the person who killed the four victims had any intention to harm anyone other than the victims he was robbing. The State's theory was that Flowers intended to kill Bertha Tardy because she fired him and withheld his pay and, in the process of doing so, he shot and killed the others. Flowers knew Carmen Rigby from working at the store, but there is no evidence that he knew Robert Johnson or Derrick Stewart, as the day of the murders was their first day to work at the store. Based on the State's theory of the case, which was presented to the jury, we hold that there was sufficient evidence on which the jury could have found that Flowers caused a great risk of death to people other than his intended victim, Bertha Tardy. Further, because Flowers shot four victims in the same room, the evidence was sufficient to warrant the instruction.\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7427951\" index=\"346\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/672/468/#p490\">\n    672 So.2d at 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   \u00b6 175. Flowers also claims that \"to allow the same conduct that is an essential element of the underlying crime to also aggravate that crime for sentencing purposes\" violates the Eighth Amendment. Flowers does not cite any authority for this proposition, nor does he explain how the aggravator violates the Eighth Amendment.

The instruction given to\n   the jury stated, in part: \"Consider only the following elements of aggravation in determining whether the death penalty should be imposed: ... The capital offense was committed while the Defendant was engaged in the commission of the crime of armed robbery for pecuniary gain.\" Mississippi Code Section 99-19-101(5) lists ten aggravating factors the jury may consider during the penalty phase of capital punishment cases.

Flowers recognizes that the Court previously has found similar aggravating-circumstances instructions permissible, but he encourages the Court to reconsider its reasoning. In\n   <em>\n    Howell v.

Whether the Court should set aside its prior order denying Flowers's motion for remand and leave to file supplemental motion for new trial.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-476\">\n   \u00b6 197. In May 2012, Flowers filed a motion for remand and leave to file supplemental motion for new trial on the basis that the State failed to disclose information relating to the credibility of one of its witnesses, Patricia Hallmon Sullivan Odom. Approximately four months prior to the start of Flowers's sixth trial, a federal grand jury indicted Odom for tax fraud. Odom's trial was in September 2010-three months after Flowers's trial. Flowers contends that the State should have disclosed Odom's indictment. Flowers's motion was based on the United States Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"456\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/#p87\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"457\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/#p87\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"458\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/#p87\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), \"that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\" In response to Flowers's motion, the State claimed that the issue should not be presented to the Court through motion or direct appeal because the issue was not presented to the trial court. The State also submitted District Attorney Doug Evans's affidavit, which provided that he was not aware of Odom's indictment until after Flowers's trial. The Court denied Flowers's motion. Because the issue was not presented to the trial court, it is not proper on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-477\">\n   <strong>\n    XIV. Whether the cumulative effect of the errors mandates reversal of the verdict and/or the sentence of death entered pursuant to it.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-478\">\n   \u00b6 198. Flowers claims that, even if the Court has doubts about the harm of any one error in isolation, the cumulative effect of the errors warrants reversal. Certainly, the Court often has applied the cumulative-error doctrine in capital cases where, \"although no error, standing alone, requires reversal, the aggregate effect of various errors may create such an atmosphere of bias, passion[,] and prejudice that they effectively deny the defendant a fundamentally fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Goff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7056584\" index=\"459\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/14/625/#p665\">\n    14 So.3d at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 210) (citation omitted).

To put it simply, the United States Supreme Court issued a GVR in this case because a majority of its members believed that a reasonable probability exists that this Court got it wrong on the first try. Yet, this Court ignores that strong implication and makes the same erroneous decision on remand. Because the errors in this case, particularly the denial of Flowers's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claims highlighted by the United States Supreme Court, resulted in Flowers being denied his right to a fair trial, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-492\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Prosecution's Argument of Facts Not in Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-493\">\n   \u00b6 205. Three instances of the prosecution arguing facts not in evidence appear in today's case: (1) the prosecution misstated the time Sam Jones discovered the victims' bodies at Tardy's; (2) the prosecution stated an unsupported basis for Flowers's alleged motive; and (3) the prosecution incorrectly described Porky Collins's reaction to the photo arrays. In\n   <em>\n    Flowers II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319808\" index=\"472\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/842/531/\">\n    842 So.2d at 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the prosecution's misstatement of facts during closing argument was one basis,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , for this Court's reversal. In that appeal, Flowers cited approximately fourteen alleged misstatements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319808\" index=\"473\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/842/531/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319808\" index=\"473\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/842/531/\">\n    at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court found that the following misstatements by the prosecutor resulted in an unfair trial: (1) that defense witnesses tried to coerce the State's witnesses to lie; (2) that Sam Jones received a call at 9:30 a.m. from Bertha Tardy asking him to come to the store; and (3) that Flowers \"was mad\" about losing his job and having his pay docked.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319808\" index=\"474\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/842/531/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319808\" index=\"474\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/842/531/\">\n    at 555-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-494\">\n   \u00b6 206. The statements that resulted in this Court reversing Flowers's conviction and death sentence in\n   <em>\n    Flowers II\n   </em>\n   are notably similar to the statements raised in today's case. While this repetition of prosecutorial misconduct is alarming, the Majority's approval of the same is even more startling. Courts have long recognized-and reasonably feared-that misconduct during closing argument may become commonplace in our trial courts. Despite regular admonishments, such misconduct still occurs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-495\">\n   That despite our consistent warnings to the Government we should still be called upon to admonish against such conduct\n   is reprehensible per se because it constitutes a disregard for our directives. But additionally it is particularly pernicious because it results in an unnecessary waste of judicial resources, both at the trial and appellate level, by diversion and attention to review of what now should be understood to be totally unacceptable conduct by those who lay claim to representing the Government ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-496\">\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

The Majority in today's case, by endorsing the prosecutor's misstatements-the same misstatements which warranted reversal in\n   <em>\n    Flowers II\n   </em>\n   -takes Mississippi one step closer to having misrepresentation of the facts presented at trial commonplace in our trial courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-497\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Sam Jones died prior to Flowers's 2010 trial, and his testimony from Flowers's 2007 trial was read into evidence.

Flowers claims that the statement in today's case prejudiced him by essentially skewing the timeline in the State's favor. Porky Collins and Clemmie Flemming both testified that they saw Flowers near Tardy's around 10:00 a.m. Flowers claims that if Jones's testimony had been accurately described-that he arrived at the store between 9:15 and 9:30-the question of what Flowers was doing so close to the scene of a murder thirty to forty-five minutes after the murders could have occurred would have been raised in the jurors' minds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-518\">\n   \u00b6 212. There is no doubt that the prosecutor's statement is not supported by Sam Jones's testimony and that there is no direct evidence supporting the contention that Jones arrived at Tardy's at 10:00 a.m. The prosecution's statement is not based on facts and prejudiced Flowers by deliberately painting an incorrect picture for the jury of the events surrounding the discovery of the murders-this same picture was painted in\n   <em>\n    Flowers II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-519\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Flowers's Motive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-520\">\n   \u00b6 213. The second misstatement Flowers cites relates to his alleged motive to commit the murders.

Defense counsel objected on the basis that the prosecutor was mischaracterizing Campbell's testimony, and when the prosecutor responded that he was quoting verbatim from his notes, the trial court overruled the defense objection. ... After a thorough examination of Campbell's testimony, it is clear Campbell never testified Flowers was upset at Mrs. Tardy. The State never questioned Campbell about Flowers's feelings toward Tardy or about any money. On redirect, Campbell was asked if Flowers ever mentioned anything was wrong with Mrs. Tardy, and Campbell stated Flowers never mentioned anything to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1926748\" index=\"486\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/200/527/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-523\">\n   \u00b6 214. In today's appeal, Flowers claims that the following statement by the prosecutor was not based on facts in evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-524\">\n   The investigators learned pretty quickly when they asked who in the world could have had some reason, some motive, some anything to attack four people like this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-525\">\n   <strong>\n    Have you had anybody that's had beef with the store? Just one.\n   </strong>\n   Well, that doesn't mean he did this though, does it? No. But you check that out. You look at him. And in the course of deciding what, if anything, Curtis Flowers had to do with this crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-526\">\n   Flowers claims that no evidence was presented at trial supporting the contention that he was angry as a result of his termination. In response, the State argues that the following supports the contention that Flowers \"had beef\" with Tardy's:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-527\">\n   1. Flowers losing his job days prior to the murders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-528\">\n   2. Bertha Tardy deducting the cost of damaged inventory from Flowers's paycheck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-529\">\n   3. Police Chief John Johnson's testimony that the Tardy family considered Flowers a threat:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-530\">\n   Q. Okay. How did Curtis Flowers become a suspect by then, by 6:30?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-531\">\n   A. I knew that the Tardy family had considered Curtis a threat and that they were concerned about their safety dealing with him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-532\">\n   4. Investigator Jack Matthew's testimony about employees who had been fired from Tardy's:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-533\">\n   Q. You asked who else had worked there the last couple of years and those kind of things?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-534\">\n   A. Well, we asked if there was anybody that they'd had any problem with or anybody that had been fired from there, and that was the-Curtis was the only one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-535\">\n   5. Doyle Simpson's testimony that Flowers had \"problems\" with Tardy's:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-536\">\n   Q. Okay. Did you know anything about Curtis having any problems with Tardy Furniture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-537\">\n   A. I had heard about it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-538\">\n   \u00b6 215. This evidence cited by the State supports the contention that Tardy's employees were concerned about Flowers. But the feelings and perceptions of Tardy's employees must be distinguished from Flowers's perception. The statements cited by the State do not establish that Flowers had ill will toward Tardy's employees. Further, Doyle Simpson's testimony is too vague to support a statement that Flowers \"had beef\" with the store. \"Problems\" could easily refer to the firing itself or the damaged inventory. The State's contention that Flowers \"had beef\" with Tardy's is unsupported by the facts. As this Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    FlowersII\n   </em>\n   , this factually unsupported statement resulted in Flowers having an unfair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-539\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Porky Collins's Response to Photo Arrays\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-540\">\n   \u00b6 216. Next, Flowers claims that the prosecutor misrepresented Porky Collins's response to the first photo array-the array that contained a photograph of Doyle Simpson. Flowers claims that this misrepresentation was particularly prejudicial because part of his defense was based on the alternative theory that Doyle Simpson was the perpetrator. Collins saw two African-American men arguing outside Tardy's the morning of the murders. When Collins testified, he stated that he did not remember if he identified Simpson as one of the men standing outside Tardy's. The notes taken during the photo arrays state that Collins had the following reaction to the array containing Simpson's photo:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-541\">\n   # 1 and # 3 resembles, but hairline was further back\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-542\">\n   # 6 pointed to Simpson, said hairline like this, may have appeared a little darker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-543\">\n   \"But it looks like him.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-544\">\n   \"Face was also same shape, round like this.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-545\">\n   \"Unable to be positive.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-546\">\n   Investigator Wayne Miller testified that Collins did point out Simpson during the photo array:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-547\">\n   Q. All right. So he did actually point out Mr. Simpson here as somebody who was-looks like the person he'd seen; is that a fair characterization?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-548\">\n   A. Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-549\">\n   \u00b6 217. The State presented the following closing argument related to Collins's identifications:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-550\">\n   When Porky found out that some people had been murdered in front of Tardy's, he told James Taylor Williams. He said I saw something I think y'all ought to know about. He said I think I can identify that guy if I see him again. Now, here's the interesting thing about Mr. Porky Collins. Porky didn't know Curtis. Never claims to have ever seen him before. Didn't know him. Didn't know those other people, as far as them having seen him. Porky says I can identify him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-551\">\n   I'm going to refer to this some more in a minute but I just want you to-you've seen these. We had them passed to y'all. Here are two line-ups. These line-ups were shown to Porky at the same setting. First was this one that has Doyle Simpson's picture on it. Because later on when they did this line-up, they already knew that the gun came out of Doyle's car. And so they gave this thing to Porky first and said is the guy that you saw in front of Tardy's in this group.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-552\">\n   Now, if he was going to make a misidentification, ladies and gentlemen, that would have been the perfect time for him to pick one of these guys and say yeah, there he is right there. But you know what? Porky did not misidentify anybody.\n   <strong>\n    He said the guy ain't there.\n   </strong>\n   They took another six photographs and said look at this second set. He said that's him right there. You heard Mr. Miller talk about Porky, said he was positive. He made a positive identification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-553\">\n   Now, why is Porky's i.d.-Porky doesn't know him. Porky wasn't able to say yeah, I know him. When he saw the photograph of Curtis Flowers, he pointed him out. So you have got two different kinds of identifications and they agree. You've got identification by all these witnesses who knew him, Porky, who didn't know him, and they both agree. And he was offered-Porky was offered a prime chance to mess up. The perfect chance to make a mistake. He almost-it didn't develop out that way it, but it was almost like a trick.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-554\">\n   <strong>\n    You know, see if he is in there. No, he is not.\n   </strong>\n   Is he in the second group? Yeah. That's him right there. So that's a pretty strong identification, isn't it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-555\">\n   \u00b6 218. While the State correctly characterized Collins's identification of Flowers in the second photo array, the State deliberately failed to recognize Collins's statement that Simpson's photograph in the first array \"looks like\" a man he saw outside of Tardy's and that he was \"unable to be positive.\" The State's argument that Collins stated \"the guy ain't there\" was not an accurate representation of Collins's identification. Because Flowers's defense was based, in part, on the argument that Doyle Simpson was a likely suspect for the murders, the State's misstatement regarding Collins's identification of Simpson prejudiced Flowers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-556\">\n   \u00b6 219. As in\n   <em>\n    Flowers II\n   </em>\n   , the prosecution's repeated argument of facts not in evidence in today's case prejudiced Flowers and denied him his right to a fair trial. Under this Court's heightened review of death penalty cases, these misstatements-standing alone-should be enough\n   to warrant reversal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fulgham v.

Disparate Treatment-The Numbers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-570\">\n   \u00b6 228. Like the history of today's case, a review of the statistics relating to the prosecutor's use of peremptory strikes is not, standing alone, dispositive of the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   inquiry. These numbers, however, reveal a clear pattern of disparate treatment between white and African-American venire members. In today's case, a special venire of 600 citizens was drawn. The original venire consisted of forty-two percent African Americans. After the jury qualification and initial for-cause challenges, the venire consisted of twenty-eight percent African Americans. Ultimately, one African American\n   served as a juror and one African American served as an alternate juror. Despite the initial venire consisting of forty-two percent African Americans, the jury that convicted and sentenced Flowers consisted of eight percent African Americans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-571\">\n   \u00b6 229. An analysis of the number and type of questions asked by the prosecutor further reveals a pattern of disparate treatment. During individual voir dire, the prosecutor asked white jurors an average of approximately three questions. African-American jurors, however, were asked approximately ten questions each by the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-572\">\n   \u00b6 230. Further, in what appears to be mere lip service to the voir dire process, when questioning most white jurors during individual voir dire, the prosecutor essentially repeated questions that the trial court had just asked. The trial court asked each juror standard death-penalty-qualification questions. The prosecutor would then-in substance-ask the same questions and then hand the juror off to be questioned by the defense. The prosecutor asked only nine percent of white jurors something beyond these duplicated questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-573\">\n   \u00b6 231. In a stark contrast, the prosecution asked sixty-three percent of African Americans questions outside the standard death-penalty-qualification questions. As an example, fifty-five percent of African-American jurors who had some kind of connection to the Flowers family (through work, the community, or family) were asked questions by the prosecutor about this connection. Although five white jurors had similar connections to the Flowers family (through work and the community), the prosecutor failed to ask any questions about these connections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-574\">\n   \u00b6 232. As noted in\n   <em>\n    Miller-El v. Cockrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191097\" index=\"529\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/322/#p339\">\n    537 U.S. 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191097\" index=\"530\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/322/#p339\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191097\" index=\"531\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/322/#p339\">\n    154 L.Ed.2d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003), statistical analysis can raise a question as to whether race influenced the jury selection process.

Individual Jurors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-576\">\n   \u00b6 233. The pattern of disparate treatment is further revealed when comparing the treatment of individual jurors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   , 947 So.2d at 921 (citing\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11241066\" index=\"532\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/765/516/#p519\">\n    765 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   519 ) (A side-by-side comparison of jurors is helpful to determine whether purposeful discrimination existed.). Explanations by the prosecution are difficult to credit where the State accepted white jurors with the same traits it used to strike black jurors.\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1750.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-577\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Carolyn Wright\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-578\">\n   \u00b6 234. The State exercised one of its peremptory strikes on Carolyn Wright for the following reasons: (1) she knew several of the defense witnesses; (2) she was sued by Tardy's for an overdue account; and (3) she used to work with Flowers's father, Archie Flowers, Sr. During the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing, Flowers rebutted the State's bases for its peremptory strike first by noting that Pamela Chesteen, Harold Waller, and Bobby Lester all had a significant number of acquaintances involved in the case. Flowers responded to the fact that Tardy's had sued Wright by noting that the State had not questioned white jurors regarding their accounts at Tardy's. Finally, Flowers rebutted the basis relating to Wright's working relationship with Flowers's family by comparing Wright to Chesteen, who was a bank teller at a bank where the members of the Flowers family were customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-579\">\n   \u00b6 235. Finding that the State's reasons for striking Wright were race-neutral, the trial court specifically noted that all jurors\n   were asked by the court during group voir dire if they had accounts with Tardy's and whether they had been sued by Tardy's. The court found that this basis was race neutral because none of the white venire members reported that they had been sued by Tardy's. The trial court found that Wright's working relationship with Archie Flowers was distinguishable from the professional relationship Chesteen had with the Flowers family. Specifically, the court stated that the Winona Walmart was a \"relatively small\" Walmart and seemed to imply that Wright had a close relationship with Archie Flowers because of the small size of the store. The trial court also stated that no white jurors had reported working at Walmart with Archie Flowers. The trial court summed up its finding by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-580\">\n   If the only reason the State offered was that she knows some of these defense witnesses, then there might be something there. But the fact is knowing these defense witnesses that you're intending to call, plus the fact that Tardy's had to sue her, plus the fact that she worked with Archie, in my mind, creates race-neutral reasons for striking her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-581\">\n   Each of the State's reasons for the peremptory strike is analyzed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-582\">\n   <em>\n    Wright's Relationships with Persons Involved in the Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-583\">\n   \u00b6 236. In sum, Carolyn Wright had some type of connection to thirty-four people involved in Flowers's case. Flowers compares Wright to Chesteen, who knew thirty-one people involved in Flowers's case; Waller, who knew eighteen people involved in the case; and Lester, who knew twenty-seven people involved in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-584\">\n   \u00b6 237. Similar to Wright, Chesteen, Waller, and Lester all had a significant number of relationships with witnesses and persons involved with the case. One indicium of pretext this Court considers is \"the presence of unchallenged jurors of the opposite race who share the characteristic given as the basis for the challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   , 947 So.2d at 917 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11241066\" index=\"533\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/765/516/#p519\">\n    765 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   519 ). Indeed, \" '[i]f a prosecutor's proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack [panelist] who is permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination.' \"\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1754 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Miller-El\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"534\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/#p241\">\n    545 U.S. at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"535\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/#p241\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). As such, this basis is suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-585\">\n   \u00b6 238. Flowers also claims that the State mischaracterized Wright's relationships with Flowers's family. Specifically, Flowers points out that the State claimed that Wright knew Flowers's sister, Sherita Baskin. Wright, however, never indicated that she knew Baskin. The State does not address this in its brief. This one statement could have simply been a slip of the tongue. However, \"lack of support in the record for the reason given for a peremptory strike has been identified as an indicator of pretext.\"\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   , 947 So.2d at 924 (citing\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11241066\" index=\"536\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/765/516/#p519\">\n    765 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   519 ).\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   emphasized this notion, noting that the prosecutor's \"misrepresentations of the record\" constituted evidence that a strike was motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1754.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-586\">\n   <em>\n    Wright's Litigation with Tardy's\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-587\">\n   \u00b6 239. Flowers claims that the State mischaracterized Wright's litigation with Tardy's by claiming that her wages had been garnished as a result of the litigation. Nothing in the record supports the contention that Wright's wages were garnished. The only statements Wright made regarding the actual litigation were that she was sued, but that \"it was paid off.\" Wright also stated that her involvement with the litigation would not affect her if she were selected as a juror. During the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing, the State produced a copy of the judgment in Wright's case, and Flowers's counsel asked if a garnishment order was attached. The trial court did not directly respond to this question, but instead stated that \"it's an abstract of justice court where she was sued.\" Because there is no evidence that Wright's wages were garnished, the State did mischaracterize its basis for the peremptory strike. Further, unlike the misstatement discussed above relating to Wright's acquaintance with Sherita Baskin, the statement that Wright had her wages garnished seems to go directly to reasoning for the State's strike-that Wright would have some sort of ill will toward Tardy's as a result of her wages being garnished. It is easy to imagine that litigation which ends in friendly terms-for example, a settlement-might result in the parties having different feelings toward one another as opposed to a suit which results in garnished wages. As such, the State's unsupported characterization of the lawsuit is problematic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   , 947 So.2d at 924 (citing\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11241066\" index=\"537\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/765/516/#p519\">\n    765 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   519 );\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1754.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-588\">\n   <em>\n    Wright's Working Relationship with Archie Flowers, Sr.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-589\">\n   \u00b6 240. Wright worked with Flowers's father, Archie Flowers, Sr., at Walmart; and on its face, this basis seems to be race-neutral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11659883\" index=\"538\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/735/323/#p340\">\n    735 So.2d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (This Court \"has condoned a peremptory challenge against a juror who was acquainted with the defendant's family.\"). However, a review of the record reveals that this basis may have been pretextual. Although the State cited Wright's working relationship with Archie Flowers as a basis for its strike, the State made no effort during voir dire to question Wright about the working relationship beyond a general question as to whether the relationship would affect her ability to serve as a juror. One could easily assume that the two worked in different departments and during different shifts. Further, Wright stated during group voir dire that she was unaware of whether Archie Flowers still worked at Walmart or if he had retired. This supports an inference that Wright and Flowers did not have a close working relationship. The lack of questioning related to this basis is suspect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller-El\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"539\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/#p241\">\n    125 S.Ct. at 2328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (failing to conduct meaningful voir dire on subject with which State is allegedly concerned suggests that \"explanation is a sham and a pretext for discrimination\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-590\">\n   \u00b6 241. The questionable nature of the State's reason is compounded by its failure to strike Pamela Chesteen. Chesteen worked at a local bank in Winona and stated that she knew Archie Flowers, Sr., Lola Flowers, and Flowers's sisters from her work at the bank. Although the coworker relationship and bank-employee/customer relationship are not exactly comparable, the concern relating to the influence such relationships would have on a juror are the same-a concern that the coworker or employee would be influenced toward a family member of another coworker or a customer. The disparate treatment of Wright and Chesteen, along with the failure to conduct meaningful voir dire regarding Wright's working relationship with Archie, Sr., suggests this basis for the State's peremptory strike was pretext.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   , 947 So.2d at 924 (\"Failure to voir dire as to the characteristic cited for the strike is also an indicator of pretext.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-591\">\n   \u00b6 242. When the State's bases and the record in today's case are viewed\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   , evidence of disparate treatment and pretext exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 937 (\"Though a reason proffered by the State is facially neutral, trial judges should not blindly accept any and every reason put forth by the State, especially where, as here, the State continues to exercise challenge after challenge\n   only upon members of a particular race.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-592\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Dianne Copper\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-593\">\n   \u00b6 243. The State provided the following reasons for striking Dianne Copper : (1) she worked with Archie Flowers and Cora Flowers, Flowers's sister; (2) she knew several members of the Flowers family; (3) she stated that she \"leaned towards\" Flowers's side of the case; and (4) she knew several defense witnesses. For the most part, the State focused on Copper's statement that she would lean toward Flowers as a result of her relationships with the Flowers family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-594\">\n   \u00b6 244. Flowers rebutted the State's reasons by again noting that several white jurors with multiple connections to persons involved in the case had not been challenged by the State. Flowers also argued that the State did not attempt to rehabilitate Copper when she stated that she would lean toward Flowers's side of the case. The trial court accepted the State's reasons as race neutral, finding that Copper's relationships with persons connected to the case were distinguishable from those of the white jurors not challenged by the State. The trial court also found that Copper was distinguishable from other jurors because she stated that she would tend to favor Flowers's side of the case and had worked with Flowers's father and sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-595\">\n   <em>\n    Copper's Relationships with Persons Connected to the Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-596\">\n   \u00b6 245. Similar to his argument relating to Carolyn Wright, Flowers claims that the State's strike of Copper was pretextual because white jurors who knew several defense witnesses were not struck. Further, Flowers claims that the State mischaracterized Copper's statements relating to whether she \"leaned towards\" Flowers in the case as a result of her relationship with the Flowers's family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-597\">\n   \u00b6 246. Copper knew thirty-one people involved in the case. Copper also testified about her relationship with the Flowers family and witnesses during voir dire:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-598\">\n   Q.

As mentioned above, one indicium of pretext is \"the presence of unchallenged jurors of the opposite race who share the characteristic given as the basis for the challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 917 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11241066\" index=\"540\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/765/516/#p519\">\n    765 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   519 ). As such, the State's basis that Copper knew several witnesses in the case is suspect. While the other bases the State provided appear to be race neutral-namely, Copper's relationship with Flowers's family and the possibility that it could cause her to \"lean toward\" Flowers, the unchallenged jurors with a shared characteristic must still be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-640\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Flancie Jones\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-641\">\n   \u00b6 249. The State provided the following reasons for striking Jones: (1) she is related to Flowers; (2) she was late for jury selection on two separate occasions; and (3) she provided inconsistent statements on her view of the death penalty by lying on her juror questionnaire in an attempt to avoid serving as a juror. After reviewing the record, the State's bases for striking Jones appear to be race-neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-642\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Tashia Cunningham\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-643\">\n   \u00b6 250. The State cited Cunningham's working relationship with Flowers's sister and her wavering statements on the death penalty as bases for its peremptory strike. During the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing, Flowers's counsel rebutted the State's reasons by pointing out that Cunningham stated that she could set aside her relationship with Flowers's sister and be a neutral juror. Defense counsel also compared Cunningham to Chesteen, the juror who knew several of Flowers's family members from working at a local bank. Finally, Flowers's counsel compared Cunningham's alleged wavering views on the death penalty to views of white jurors. The trial court found that both of the State's reasons were race-neutral:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-644\">\n   And Ms. Cunningham's all-over-the-map response to the death penalty, plus her situation about working so closely with Mr. Flowers's sister, in my mind, the State has shown race-neutral reasons for that strike.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-645\">\n   <em>\n    Cunningham's Working Relationship with Flowers's Sister\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-646\">\n   \u00b6 251. During voir dire, Cunningham stated that she and Sherita Baskin, Flowers's sister, did not have a close relationship; Cunningham described it as a \"working relationship.\" According to Cunningham, she and Baskin would \"sometime\" see each other, but would not see each other at work every day. Cunningham also stated that she worked at the end of the assembly line, and Baskin worked at the front of the line. The two women worked the same shift for two or three years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-647\">\n   \u00b6 252. Apparently, the State called Cunningham's employer, ADP, to confirm her testimony relating to her working relationship with Baskin. During individual voir dire, the State asked Cunningham further questions about the relationship:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-648\">\n   Q: And you work with the Defendant's sister, Sherita Baskin?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-649\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-650\">\n   Q: Now, the other day, I think you said that you do not work close to her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-651\">\n   A: No, I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-652\">\n   Q: Would you think about that for a minute?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-653\">\n   A: I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-654\">\n   Q: Are you sure that you do not work side by side with her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-655\">\n   A: No, I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-656\">\n   Q: And you're saying that under oath?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-657\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-658\">\n   \u00b6 253. In response to Cunningham's statements, the State called an ADP quality control clerk, Crystal Carpenter, to give testimony. Carpenter testified that Cunningham and Baskin both worked on the \"raw 2 line\" and that the women worked side-by-side-\"nine or ten inches\" apart from one another. Twenty-five to thirty-five persons worked on this particular assembly line. Carpenter also testified that the women would occasionally not work side-by-side if another employee was absent from work and a spot in another location needed to be filled, but that the women typically worked next to one another. Carpenter observed the women working every day and based her testimony on her personal observations. Flowers's counsel asked Carpenter if there was documentation supporting the location of Cunningham and Basking on the assembly line, and Carpenter stated that she could provide documentation supporting her testimony. Apparently, Carpenter did not provide the documentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-659\">\n   \u00b6 254. At first glance, the conflicting testimony of Cunningham and Carpenter tends to provide a race-neutral basis for the State's challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11659883\" index=\"541\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/735/323/#p340\">\n    735 So.2d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When considering the voir dire process as a whole, however, the State's investigation of Cunningham is suspect. As discussed above, the State accepted Pamela Chesteen as a juror even though she stated that several members of the Flowers family were customers at the bank where she worked. There is no evidence in the record that the State further investigated the relationship between Chesteen and the Flowers family, and the State did not voir dire Chesteen on this subject. The absence of voir dire and investigation for Chesteen compared to the thorough investigation for Cunningham is problematic and tends to evidence disparate treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller-El\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"542\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/#p241\">\n    125 S.Ct. at 2328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (failing to conduct meaningful voir dire on subject with which State is allegedly concerned suggests that \"explanation is a sham and a pretext for discrimination\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   , 947 So.2d at 924 (\"Failure to voir dire as to the characteristic cited for the strike is also an indicator of pretext.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-660\">\n   <em>\n    Cunningham's Wavering Views on the Death Penalty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-661\">\n   \u00b6 255. The State cited Cunningham's wavering views on the death penalty as another basis for its challenge. On her juror questionnaire, although she stated that she had \"no opinion\" on the death penalty, Cunningham stated that she would not consider the death penalty under any circumstances. During voir dire by the trial court, Cunningham initially stated that she could not consider the death penalty as a punishment, but she then stated that she \"might\" consider it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-662\">\n   Q: ...

This Court has recognized that a juror's views on the death penalty may provide a race-neutral basis for a peremptory challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Batiste v.

In\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   , this Court found that the striking of an African American who had \"virtually indistinguishable\" views on the death penalty as compared to white jurors who were not struck raised an inference of discrimination, although, standing alone, it did not warrant the finding of a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation.\n   <em>\n    Flowers III\n   </em>\n   , 947 So.2d at 921. In today's case, there are no white jurors who survived for-cause challenges whose views on the death penalty were comparable to Cunningham's. As such, it cannot be said that this basis was pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-696\">\n   \u00b6 257.

No evidence in the record provides a basis for the in-depth investigation. Likewise, nothing in the record evidences that a similar investigation was performed for all other jurors. With this suspect record, the prosecution's unusual investigation of Cunningham must be seen for what it is worth-a questionable search for a race neutral basis, indicating that striking Cunningham was \"motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1754 (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-697\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Edith Burnside\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-698\">\n   \u00b6 258. The State provided the following reasons in support of its peremptory strike of Burnside: (1) she knew Flowers and members of his family; (2) she was sued by Tardy's Furniture; and (3) she provided inconsistent statements regarding her views on the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-699\">\n   <em>\n    Burnside's Litigation with Tardy's\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-700\">\n   \u00b6 259. During voir dire, the trial court asked the entire venire if anyone had been sued by Tardy's, and Burnside responded that she had been sued by the store. Later, Burnside explained that she was able to pay off the amount that she owed the store and that the litigation stemmed from a misunderstanding about her account after the murders occurred. During the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing, the State represented that Burnside had a garnishment issued against her. The prosecutor stated: \"She also was sued by Tardy Furniture, and a garnishment was issued against her. She tried to\n   deny that and said that she just settled with them when she came back but she was, in fact, sued by them.\" The State's description of the litigation and Burnside's testimony regarding the same is not completely supported by the record. In response to the trial court's first inquiry during group voir dire, Burnside stated: \"I had an account there, but I was not sued by Ms. Bertha. It was later on when it was took over by Mr. Frank and Roxanne.\" Burnside then confirmed that she was sued by Tardy's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-701\">\n   \u00b6 260.

She hired me to work for Mr. Tardy before she was married to him the first time. I was caring for Ms. Lena Tardy. That's how I met Ms. Bertha. So when me and my husband was going through a divorce, she let me have some furniture. And she said she was going to note it on the book. Sometimes, I cleaned up for her and I paid for it and we just have, like, a little understanding about it. Okay. When she got killed, it was still on the book.

Similar to the State's characterization of Wright's litigation with Tardy's discussed above, the State's representation that Burnside's wages were garnished and that Burnside \"denied\" this is unsupported by the record in today's case.

While the Court has focused on the interests of Flowers in having a jury not tainted by racial bias, it has ignored the right of prospective jurors not to be subjected to racial bias. Beyond question, the right to a jury selection process free from the taint of racial discrimination belongs both to the parties and to the prospective jurors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powers v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319062\" index=\"556\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/400/#p416\">\n    499 U.S. 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319062\" index=\"557\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/400/#p416\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319062\" index=\"558\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/400/#p416\">\n    113 L.Ed.2d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) (Courts are \"under an affirmative duty to enforce the ... policies embodied in [the] prohibition\" on the discrimination in the selection of jurors.). When the trial court and this Court, in robotic fashion, merely say that the prosecution gave facially race-neutral reasons, which were not rebutted by the defense, both completely disregard the constitutional right of prospective jurors to be free from a racially discriminatory selection process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-757\">\n   \u00b6 267. No attorneys are present in the courtroom to protect the constitutional rights of perspective jurors. Thus, of necessity, that responsibility must be undertaken by the trial courts. The honest exercise of that responsibility demands that the trial court look beyond the mere recitation of the words \"race neutral.\" In this case, the trial court completely ignored and failed in that responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-758\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-759\">\n   \u00b6 268. As noted previously, this case has been twice reversed by this Court for some of the same issues presented to the Court today. In the retrial of a case under these circumstances, where the same issues are confronted, the trial court is obligated to look beyond the surface. The United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   affirms this principle. The trial court failed in that obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-760\">\n   \u00b6 269. Because of that failure, I cannot conclude that Flowers received a fair trial, nor can I conclude that prospective jurors were not subjected to impermissible discrimination. For these reasons, I would reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-761\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Additional Errors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-762\">\n   \u00b6 270. While the United State Supreme Court focused its remand on the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation, and while I find the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation dispositive, I continue to believe that other errors occurred at trial that also warrant reversal. Those errors were memorialized in Presiding Justice Dickinson's dissent in the original appeal on this matter.\n   <em>\n    Flowers v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890367\" index=\"559\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/158/1009/\">\n    158 So.3d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1076-83 (Miss. 2014) (Dickinson, P.J., dissenting). The circuit judge erred by refusing to allow the accused to defend the charges by calling a qualified expert to provide perfectly admissible expert opinions, and by instructing the jury on an aggravating factor for which the State provided no evidence. I reiterate those errors here, with credit to then-Justice Dickinson.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890367\" index=\"560\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/158/1009/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Dickinson, P.J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-763\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The trial judge categorically prohibited Flowers's expert, Dr. Jeffrey Neuschatz, from providing expert testimony on eyewitness identification. It was not that the trial judge disagreed with the evidence in Dr. Neuschatz's expert affidavit-he ignored it. The trial judge felt that any helpful information that could have been provided by the expert could just as easily have been developed through cross-examination. But the information the expert would have provided could never be developed on cross examination, because the witnesses would not know they had made misidentifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-765\">\n   \u00b6 272.

The trial judge is to act as a gatekeeper and may look to \"a non-exhaustive, illustrative list of reliability factors for determining the admissibility of expert witness testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9056174\" index=\"564\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/863/31/#p37\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9056174\" index=\"564\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/863/31/#p37\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). The five factors referenced in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   look at whether: (1) the theory or technique can be and has been tested; (2) the theory has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) there is a high known or potential rate of error; (4) there are standards controlling the technique's operation; and (5) the theory or technique enjoys general acceptance\n   within a relevant scientific community.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9056174\" index=\"565\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/863/31/#p37\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted). The presence or absence of any one of these factors is not dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-767\">\n   \u00b6 274. The issue of allowing experts to testify about the reliability of eyewitness identification is not new. A majority of state jurisdictions allow eyewitness identification experts to testify, provided they are properly qualified and their opinions satisfy reliability concerns, such as those set forth in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   . For instance, the Tennessee Supreme Court-evaluating factors similar to those mentioned in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   -reversed its prior position seven years ago and now allows properly qualified eyewitness experts to testify, finding that such testimony can be helpful in the jury's evaluation of an eyewitness's identification.\n   <em>\n    State v. Copeland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8374283\" index=\"566\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/226/287/#p302\">\n    226 S.W.3d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302-304 (Tenn. 2007). And the vast majority of states and the District of Columbia either give trial courts discretion to allow eyewitness identification expert testimony, or require the admission of such testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-768\">\n   \u00b6 275. In this case, the trial judge first found that the trier of fact did not need\n   Dr. Neuschatz's testimony. He stated: \"Given the extensive cross-examination of Mr. Collins and because all other witnesses knew Mr. Flowers on sight, I do not believe an expert on witnesses identification would assist the jury in the least bit in this case.\" This conclusion was demonstrably incorrect. The trial judge provided no analysis of how cross-examination of the witnesses could develop the opinions provided by Dr. Neuschatz, or how the witnesses themselves could provide expert testimony. The eyewitnesses certainly could provide the facts, such as distance, lighting, length of time, etc. But Dr. Neuschatz was not presented to testify to the facts alone. His role was to begin with the facts provided by the eyewitnesses, and then provide expert testimony as to the difficulties and reliability associated with identification. The eyewitnesses themselves certainly could not provide the testimony expected from Dr. Neuschatz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-769\">\n   \u00b6 276. Nor could cross-examination provide an adequate substitute for Dr. Neuschatz's testimony. A skillful attorney may utilize cross-examination to expose contradictions in a witness's testimony. But no attorney-of even the greatest skill-can cross-examine a witness in such a way as to expose that the witness did not see what the witness actually believes he saw. And that is exactly the purpose of expert eyewitness identification testimony. Dr. Neuschatz-if allowed to testify-would have explained scientific principles affecting the accuracy of a witness's perception of what he saw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-770\">\n   \u00b6 277. The trial judge's entire\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   analysis was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-771\">\n   Further, though, I think aside from the fact that I do not think this would assist the trier of fact, I do not think all the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   principles have been shown to the Court to apply to this testimony. The defense has not offered to this Court this idea that the theories the defense would testify to or the area of expertise proffered are generally accepted. I do not know whether the testimony has a potential or known high rate of error. I do not have anything about that. I do not know anything about the principles and methods used to come to conclusions. And basically, the witness did not apply the principles and methods to the facts of this case. He made broad generalizations in the document that was submitted, but he did not specifically apply those principles and methods to the facts of this case. So for all these reasons, I do not think that this witness testimony would be appropriate, and I am going to deny the testimony of this witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-772\">\n   The following is a detailed analysis of each sentence of the trial judge's\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   analysis, and it demonstrates that the trial judge abused his discretion in refusing to allow Dr. Neuschatz to testify as an expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-773\">\n   <em>\n    \"I do not think all the\n    <strong>\n     Daubert\n    </strong>\n    principles have been shown to the Court to apply to this testimony.\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-774\">\n   \u00b6 278. This statement suggests the trial court erroneously believed the defendant had a burden to show that \"all the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   factors\" applied. Clearly, this is not the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-775\">\n   <em>\n    \"The defense has not offered to this Court this idea that the theories the defense would testify to or the area of expertise proffered are generally accepted.\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-776\">\n   \u00b6 279. This conclusion was incorrect. Dr. Neuschatz cited thirty-three studies in his affidavit, each of which indicated general acceptance in the field of psychology. The State offered no evidence in rebuttal of Dr.\n   Neuschatz's affidavit on this point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-777\">\n   \u00b6 280. The majority's only reason for agreeing with the trial judge on this point is that Dr. Neuschatz did not attach each article to his affidavit. But under our Rules of Evidence, experts are not required to attach the basis of their opinions to their affidavits. Instead, they are allowed to rely on studies that they do not provide to the court, unless requested by the court. Rule 705 provides\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-778\">\n   The expert may testify in terms of opinion or inferences and give his reasons therefor without prior disclosure of the underlying facts or data, unless the court requires otherwise. The expert may in any event be required to disclose the underlying facts or data on cross-examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-779\">\n   Miss. R. Evid. 705.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-780\">\n   \u00b6 281. In this case, neither the trial judge nor the State requested production of the underlying data or the articles upon which Dr. Neuschatz relied. It was clear error for the trial judge to reject Dr. Neuschatz's affidavit merely because the articles were not attached. And the majority compounds the error by requiring the expert in this case to do something other experts are not required to do,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and something this very Court's rules specifically do not require.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-781\">\n   \u00b6 282.

Though this Court found that the trial court properly excluded the expert's testimony because the studies did not support his conclusion, the Court never questioned his failure to provide those studies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8358937\" index=\"569\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/990/143/#p146\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-782\">\n   <em>\n    \"I do not know whether the testimony has a potential or known high rate of error. I do not have anything about that.\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-783\">\n   \u00b6 283. Again, on this point, the trial judge was incorrect. In his affidavit, Dr. Neuschatz discussed extensive testing that produced precise error rates. For instance, in discussing the factor of exposure time, Dr. Neuschatz stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-784\">\n   Exposure duration had a significant impact on identification accuracy. Ninety-five percent of the young adults and 85% of the older adults made correct identifications from the robber-present photo arrays when the robber was exposed for 45 seconds, but only 29% of the young adults and 35% of the older adults made correct identifications when the robber was exposed for 12 seconds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-785\">\n   \u00b6 284. In discussing the appearance change disguise factor, he stated: \"The average performance levels across the six studies, which involved over 1,300 eyewitness identifications, was 57% correct when uncovered and versus 44% when a hat was worn.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-786\">\n   \u00b6 285. In discussing cross-race identification, Dr. Neuschatz stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-787\">\n   The reliability of the ORB [own-race bias] was examined by Meissner and Brigham (2001) who meta-analyzed the results of 31 separate studies involving 91 separate experimental tests of own versus same-race identifications. The studies included over 5,000 participants. Across all studies, eyewitnesses were 1.4 times more likely to correctly identify members of their own race than members of other races, and they were 1.56 times more likely to falsely identify members of other races than members of their own race.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-788\">\n   \u00b6 286. These and other studies cited in the affidavit speak not only to error rates but also to the reliability of Dr. Neuschatz's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-789\">\n   <em>\n    \"I do not know anything about the principles and methods used to come to conclusions.\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-790\">\n   \u00b6 287. Here again, the trial judge was incorrect. The studies cited above, and the balance of Dr. Neuschatz's affidavit are replete with descriptions of the methods and principles used in the numerous studies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-791\">\n   \u00b6 288. Dr. Neuschatz's affidavit contained detailed information about studies on: (1) how memory works; (2) effect of exposure time on reliability of memory; (3) effect of appearance changes and disguises on identification; (4) the phenomenon of unconscious transference where one situation is confused with another; (5) problems with cross-racial identifications; (6) problems with post identification feedback; and (7) problems with suggestive line-up procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-792\">\n   <em>\n    \"And basically, the witness did not apply the principles and methods to the facts of this case. He made broad generalizations in the document that was submitted, but he did not specifically apply those principles and methods to the facts of this case.\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-793\">\n   \u00b6 289. Again, the trial judge was incorrect. Dr. Neuschatz indeed applied the principles and methods in his field of expertise to the facts in the Flowers case. For instance, he analyzed in detail the effect of the police's line-up identification. Also, he addressed issues involving Porky Collins's identification, including problems with cross-racial identifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-794\">\n   <em>\n    Refusing to allow Dr. Neuschatz to testify was not harmless error.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-795\">\n   \u00b6 290. Dr. Neuschatz's testimony would have provided the jury a fair basis upon which to judge the accuracy of Collins's identification. I also cannot accept the majority's conclusion that \"Collins's identification was far from the only evidence of guilt in the instant case, and it cannot be label 'critical.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-796\">\n   \u00b6 291. It is true that the State had other witnesses, but none provided the powerful eyewitness testimony that Collins provided. He is the only witness who placed Flowers at the scene of the murders shortly before they were committed. None of the witnesses was more critical to the State's case, and none was more important for the defense to attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-797\">\n   \u00b6 292. The State offered\n   <em>\n    nothing\n   </em>\n   in rebuttal of Dr. Neuschatz's opinions: no experts, articles, studies, or evidence of any kind that tended to refute his opinions and methodology. Accordingly, Dr. Neuschatz should have been allowed to testify in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-798\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The trial judge should have denied the State's requested instruction on the commission of a capital crime to avoid arrest aggravator.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-799\">\n   \u00b6 293. When Flowers's case proceeded to the sentencing phase, the trial judge instructed the jury to consider three potential aggravating factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-800\">\n   1. The Defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-801\">\n   2. The capital offense was committed while the Defendant was engaged in the commission of the crime of armed robbery for pecuniary gain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-802\">\n   3. The capital offense was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing lawful arrest or effecting an escape from custody.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-803\">\n   The jury found each aggravating factor and sentenced Flowers to death. Because the trial judge erred when he instructed the jury to consider the third aggravating factor, I would reverse Flowers's death sentence and remand for resentencing even if this Court affirmed his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-804\">\n   \u00b6 294.

But that standard-stated in that way with nothing more-cannot be the law. Saying jurors may draw an inference is not enough, unless the inference is so strong that, standing alone, the inference is sufficient for a finding beyond a reasonable doubt. The inference in this case clearly does not fall into that category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-806\">\n   \u00b6 296. The Majority says a reasonable juror could infer that Flowers killed one of the victims to prevent identification and avoid arrest. While a reasonable juror might very well find that to be a possibility, it would be no more than a guess. And no reasonable juror could make that finding beyond a reasonable doubt. Judges should submit issues to juries through instructions\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   when a reasonable juror could find the beyond a reasonable doubt burden of proof satisfied on that issue.\n   <em>\n    Henley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6958115\" index=\"588\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/136/413/#p415\">\n    136 So.3d at 415-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

Stated another way, jurors certainly are free to draw reasonable inferences from the facts. But a juror's ability to draw a reasonable inference is not the same as a reasonable juror's ability to find that fact beyond a reasonable doubt. For instance, one may draw a reasonable inference that a person who usually goes to lunch from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. is at lunch on a particular day at 12:30 p.m. But that does not mean one may reach that conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-808\">\n   \u00b6 298. So a trial judge should grant a State's request to instruct the jury on this aggravating factor only where the State has presented evidence from which a reasonable juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt that \"a substantial reason for the killing was to conceal the identity of the killer or killers or to 'cover their tracks' so as to avoid apprehension and eventual arrest by authorities.\"\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975860\" index=\"592\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/138/817/#p865\">\n    138 So.3d at 867-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gillett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034612\" index=\"593\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/56/469/#p494\">\n    56 So.3d at 505-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Leatherwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7638777\" index=\"594\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/435/645/#p651\">\n    435 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   651 )). And any case that categorically establishes inferences as sufficient to satisfy the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard should be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-809\">\n   \u00b6 299. The State presented insufficient evidence to meet its burden. The most that may be said in this case is that the jury could speculate that Flowers committed one of the murders to avoid arrest. There was no evidence that he did. In fact, the State argued in the guilt phase that Flowers committed the murders for different purposes: revenge and anger over being fired as well as to effectuate the robbery. From its opening statement, the State's theory of the case was that Flowers possessed a motive to commit the murders because he had been fired by Tardy's. This motive-a revenge killing-is at odds with a conclusion that he killed out of a necessity to avoid arrest. No evidence was presented that Flowers expressed an intent to kill to avoid arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-810\">\n   \u00b6 300. The Majority finds that this aggravating factor instruction is supported by two facts: Flowers knew his victims and Flowers disposed of evidence after the killings. The second can be disposed of easily because it bears no logical connection to the question at hand. Regardless of the reason someone commits murder, that person usually has an incentive to dispose of the evidence. Said differently, if Flowers killed his victims out of pure anger, he would have an incentive to cover up the killing by disposing of evidence. The same could be said if Flowers killed because the victims resisted the robbery. Showing that Flowers disposed of evidence after the killing makes it no more reasonable to conclude that he killed to avoid arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-811\">\n   \u00b6 301. Likewise, the Majority's reliance on the fact that Flowers knew his victims is misplaced. First, by the Majority's own statement, this rationale applies to one victim. The majority states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-812\">\n   The State's theory was that Flowers intended to kill Bertha Tardy because she fired him and withheld his pay and, in the process of doing so, he shot and killed the others. Flowers knew Carmen Rigby from working at the store, but there is no evidence that he knew Robert Johnson or Derrick Stewart, as the day of the murders was their first day to work at the store.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-813\">\n   This statement acknowledges that Flowers killed Tardy-not to avoid arrest-but for revenge. The Majority admits that Flowers did not know Johnson or Stewart. So at best, the Majority's reliance on this evidence relates to Rigby alone. But even there it cannot provide sufficient evidence\n   to grant the instruction. It is simply inaccurate to say that a reasonable juror could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Flowers killed Rigby to avoid arrest, simply because they had worked together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-814\">\n   \u00b6 302. True, this Court has supported an instruction on this aggravating factor in the past based solely on the fact that the victim knew the defendant and could identify him.\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11490925\" index=\"595\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/750/1193/#p1206\">\n    750 So.2d at 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But if we are to enforce the burden of proof required of the State, this was error. Allowing a jury to consider an aggravating factor based on nothing more than pure speculation cannot reach the level of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Because the State presented insufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could find this aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt, I would reverse Flowers's sentence of death and remand for a new sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-815\">\n   <strong>\n    KITCHENS, P.J., JOINS THIS OPINION.
