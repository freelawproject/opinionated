The Plaintiffs were injured in a car accident involving the City Marshal. On appeal, the Plaintiffs argue that the trial court should have granted their cross motion for summary judgment and held the State vicariously liable for the action of the City Marshal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The accident occurred on July 18, 2014. Sarah Barber was driving her car southbound on Louisiana Highway 107 in Pineville, Louisiana. Abbigail Turner, Racheal Spivey, and Dana Spivey were guest passengers in the vehicle. At the same time, Larry Jeane, who was in the course and scope of his employment as Marshal with the City of Pineville, was traveling northbound on Highway 107. Mr. Jeane crossed the centerline and hit the Barber vehicle. Mr. Jeane died because of the accident, and the occupants of the other vehicle sustained serious injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Suit was filed by and on behalf of the occupants of the Barber vehicle against the City of Pineville and its insurer, Louisiana Municipal Risk Management Agency Group Self-Insured Fund. Also named as defendants were the Estate of Larry Jeane and the uninsured/underinsured carrier for the Spiveys, Shelter Mutual Insurance Company. A supplemental and amending petition was filed adding additional defendants: The State of Louisiana; Republic Fire and Casualty Insurance Company, the insurer of Mr. Jeane; the Rapides Parish Police Jury; the City of Pineville City Marshal's Office and its unknown insurer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The State filed an exception of no cause of action seeking dismissal of the Plaintiffs' claims against it. The Rapides Parish Police Jury and the Pineville City Marshal also filed exceptions of no cause of action. The trial court denied the exception filed by the State but granted the exceptions filed by the Police Jury and the City Marshal. The State sought review of the trial court's ruling in this court. This court found no error in the trial court's ruling. The supreme court also denied the State's application for supervisory writs.\n   <em>\n    Barber v. La. Mun. Risk Mgmt.

At the time of the hearing on the cross motions for summary judgment, the State was the only remaining defendant concerning Mr. Jeane's employer. The hearing was held on June 12, 2017. The trial court denied the Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted the State's motion for summary judgment finding that the State was not the employer of Mr. Jeane as City Marshal and not liable for his actions in causing the accident. The State was dismissed from the case by judgment\n   signed on June 12, 2017. The Plaintiffs then filed the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Appellate courts review summary judgments\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , using the same criteria that govern the district court's consideration of whether summary judgment is appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Greemon v.

If the mover will not bear the burden of proof at trial on the matter at issue, however, his burden on the motion for summary judgment \"does not require him to negate all essential elements of the adverse party's claim, action, or defense, but rather to point out to the court the absence of factual support for one or more elements essential to the adverse party's claim, action, or defense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037252\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/65/1263/#p1267\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Specifically, \"[t]he burden is on the adverse party to produce factual support sufficient to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that the mover is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037252\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/65/1263/#p1267\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   All parties agree that the facts are not in dispute and that only a question of law is at issue: Is the State vicariously liable for the accident caused by Mr. Jeane when he was in the course and scope of his employment as the Pineville City Marshal? The Plaintiffs claim that the Marshal is commanded by the State Legislature to enforce the mandates of the Pineville City Court, which is a part of the judiciary branch of state government. Therefore, the Plaintiffs claim that the State is vicariously liable for the acts of the Marshal. The State argues that the Plaintiffs must establish a master/servant relationship between it and the Marshal under the traditional criteria of control, compensation, and course and scope as required by La.Civ.Code art. 2320 and La.R.S. 42:1441.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pursuant to La.Civ.Code art. 2320, \"[m]asters and employers are answerable for the damage occasioned by their servants and overseers, in the exercise of the functions in which they are employed.\" Louisiana Revised Statutes 42:1441 providing for the limitation of the vicarious liability of the State of Louisiana stated at the time of this accident\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A.

This is because La.R.S. 42:1441.1 provides that the State is not liable for the offenses and quasi offenses of any person who is not an employee of the State entitled to indemnification under La.R.S. 13:5108.2. The court held that the law clerk was not one of the covered individuals of the judicial branch for whom vicarious liability extends under La.R.S. 13:5108.1(E).

Furthermore, La.R.S. 13:5108.1(E)(3)(b) specifically provides that a \"covered individual\" for indemnification purposes does not include marshals, so that La.R.S. 42:1441.1 destroys any cause of action against the State for the offenses of a city marshal. Therefore, the State is not liable for the accident caused by Mr. Jeane as Pineville City Marshal as the legislature has deemed it immune for the actions of a city marshal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment in favor of the State of Louisiana is affirmed.
