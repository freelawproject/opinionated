See \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(15), Ala. Code 1975. During the penalty phase of the trial, the foreperson of the jury submitted to the court a verdict form reflecting that by a unanimous vote the jurors found that the State had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstance that Kirksey's capital offense was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\n   when compared to other capital offenses. See \u00a7 13A-5-49(8), Ala. Code 1975. The foreperson of the jury submitted to the court a verdict form reflecting that by a unanimous vote the jurors recommended that Kirksey be sentenced to death. The trial court ordered that a presentence investigation report be furnished to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The trial court sentenced Kirksey to death following its consideration of the evidence presented at the guilt and penalty phases of the trial, the presentence report, the aggravating and mitigating factors, the trial court's determination that the aggravating factor outweighed the mitigating factors, and the jury's advisory verdict.

In\n   <em>\n    Kirksey\n   </em>\n   , as evidenced by verdict forms, the jury did unanimously find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of one aggravating factor and did unanimously recommend that Kirksey be sentenced to death.

Rather, the [\n    <em>\n     Hurst\n    </em>\n    ] Court held that Florida's capital-sentencing scheme was unconstitutional to the extent that it specifically conditioned a capital defendant's eligibility for the death penalty on findings made by the trial court and not on findings made by the jury, which contravened the holding in\n    <em>\n     Ring [v. Arizona\n    </em>\n    , ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254507\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/584/\">\n     122 S.Ct. 2428\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254507\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/584/\">\n     153 L.Ed.2d 556\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2002)]. The Court emphasized several times in its opinion that Florida's capital-sentencing statutes did not make a capital defendant eligible for the death penalty until the trial court made certain findings.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <em>\n     State v.
