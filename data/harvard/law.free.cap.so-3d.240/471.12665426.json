Keith O'Brien filed a complaint to confirm and quiet title, set aside deed, or, in the alternative, reform deed, and for damages against Michael Rogers, Mary Ann Rogers, real-estate attorney Andy J. Alfonso III, Coldwell Banker Alfonso Realty Inc., and Cheryl O'Brien (collectively, the Defendants). Keith's complaint also included a claim of legal malpractice against Andy. After a trial, the Jackson County Chancery Court entered a judgment denying relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Keith now appeals the chancellor's judgment and argues that the chancellor erred in finding that Keith failed to prove that Andy committed legal malpractice in preparing an allegedly erroneous warranty deed conveying Keith's property. Finding error, we reverse and remand to the chancery court for a determination of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. In 1998, Keith and his then-wife, Cheryl, purchased 8.9 acres in Jackson County, Mississippi, and constructed a house on the property. The physical address for the house is 6331 Jim Ramsey Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. In January 2005, Keith and Cheryl decided to sell their house located at 6331 Jim Ramsey Road, along with 2.3 acres of land surrounding the house. Keith and Cheryl listed their house and the acreage with real-estate agent Shirley Willard of Coldwell Banker Alfonso Realty Inc. (Alfonso Realty). The property listing prepared by Shirley reflects a listing price of $198,500 for the 2,400 square foot, three bedroom, 2.5 bathroom house and the 2.3 acres of land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. After listing their house and the 2.3 acres for sale, Keith and Cheryl conveyed 1.23 acres of their remaining property to their daughter and son-in-law, Khristina and Scott Storm, via a quitclaim deed on May 17, 2005. The record shows that this 1.23-acre parcel of land was located in the middle of the 8.9 acres owned by Keith and Cheryl. In deeding the land to the Storms, Keith had the entire 8.9 acres surveyed and then divided into three parcels, each with a different address. For the 1.23-acre parcel of land he deeded to the Storms, Keith established an address of 6325 Jim Ramsey Road. Keith testified that he filed the quitclaim deed and survey in the land records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. The record also reflects that Keith and Cheryl intended to keep the remaining back parcel of land, which consisted of five acres, and build another house. Keith established the address of 6327 Jim Ramsey Road for the remaining five acres of land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Keith testified that about a month after he and Cheryl deeded the 1.23 acres to the Storms, he received a call from Shirley informing him that she had found a buyer for Keith and Cheryl's house and 2.3 acres. Keith and Cheryl eventually accepted an offer from Michael and Mary Ann Rogers. The record reflects that Mary Ann is Shirley's niece.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Alfonso Realty recommended that Keith retain Andy to prepare the real-estate contract and deed and execute the loan closing on the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Keith and\n   Andy both testified that they had never spoken to one another prior to the closing in July 2005. The record shows that Shirley communicated with Keith and Andy separately regarding the real-estate transaction. Keith testified that at the closing, he signed the papers provided to him, including the warranty deed prepared by Andy. Keith stated that when he was presented with the warranty deed to sign, no one explained to him what he was conveying through signing the deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. As we will discuss in length later in this opinion, Andy admitted that an attorney-client relationship existed between him and Keith and the Rogers family. Andy's trial testimony reflects that he failed to discover that Keith had previously deeded the 1.23-acre middle parcel to the Storms. At trial, Andy testified regarding his title search on Keith's property as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Q. When you did your title search, did it not pop up the fact that [Keith], prior to the loan closing, didn't actually own the entire 8.9 acres?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A. I'd have to go back, but there should have probably been a less and-well, not probably.\n   <strong>\n    There should have been a less and except for that one point something acres, the Storm property in the middle. That should have appeared on the deed.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q. But you didn't catch that and put that on the deed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. I'm not sure if I did or didn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q. You've ... still got the [w]arranty [d]eed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. I do. Yea[h].\n   <strong>\n    It's not in the deed. The less and except is not there.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 10. Keith testified at trial that at the end of 2006, the Rogers family contacted him and complained that they were paying higher-than-normal property taxes for the house and 2.3 acres located at 6331 Jim Ramsey Road. The Rogerses eventually discovered that due to a mistake in the deed, they were paying property taxes for the entire 8.9 acres of property. The record additionally shows that concurrent with the closing of the property, the Rogerses' first deed of trust and first mortgage had already attached to the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11. Keith testified that upon learning of the mistake in the deed, he went to the Jackson County land-records office where he was informed that the deed prepared by Andy conveyed all 8.9 acres to the Rogerses, rather than the 2.3 acres listed for sale. Keith immediately contacted Alfonso Realty and Andy about the error. Keith testified that Alfonso Realty confirmed to him that \"when they closed that deed, they closed it on the whole 8.9 [acres].\" Keith explained to Alfonso Realty that \"there is a chunk of land in the middle that [he] didn't own,\" referring to the 1.23 acres he deeded to the Storms prior to the real-estate transaction at issue. Keith testified that Alfonso Realty then told him, \"[Andy] had done a less and except ... so they just kind of subtracted the 1.23 acres of the Storms out of it and now closed it out with the two unconnected parcels.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12. Alfonso Realty and Andy assured Keith that they would correct the deed. However, the record reflects that once the Rogerses learned that they owned 8.9 acres, rather than 2.3, they obtained a second mortgage encumbering the entire 8.9 acres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13. Andy testified that after Keith alerted him to the incorrect deed, he prepared corrective instruments for Keith to sign. Andy testified that he also had several conversations with Cheryl, as well as the Rogerses, and \"none of them would come sign these corrective instruments.\" However, Keith disputed that Andy ever contacted\n   him to sign corrective instruments. Keith explained that the Rogers family had already encumbered the property with a mortgage upon closing and a second mortgage upon learning that the warranty deed conveyed the entire 8.9 acres, rather than the 2.3 acres intended to be sold. The record also shows that Keith stated that he could not force the Rogers family to convey the property back to him, particularly since the property was encumbered. The record reflects that at trial, the following exchange occurred during Andy's cross-examination of Keith:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q. You brought me the survey months later after all of this took place and you found out that, I guess, there was a clerical mistake with the deed that was prepared. And, actually, none of my secretaries were there that day. I was there myself. And we met. You brought the surveys to me, we took a look at them, and you asked me to prepare some corrective instruments that we needed to straighten it out. And you pointed out that middle acreage, you pointed out the back five acres, and you pointed out the front acres. After preparing those, I gave you a call to come sign the corrective instruments so we could get something on file down at the courthouse that would put everybody and their grandmother on notice that there was an issue, at least. Why didn't you come?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A. You never approached me about it. In fact, the conversation we had was that you said the Rogers[es] had backed out of signing it. I assure everybody in this courtroom, I would have climbed over brick walls and ran through fire to get down there to sign what you're talking about.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14. On June 6, 2008, Keith filed his complaint to confirm and quiet title, set aside the deed, or, in the alternative, reform the deed, and for damages against the Defendants in the Jackson County Chancery Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his complaint, Keith alleged that Alfonso Realty breached its contract with Keith and Cheryl by failing to protect their interests and causing them to execute the warranty deed selling all of their property, rather than just a portion, to the Rogerses. Keith also alleged that Andy was negligent in preparing the deed. Keith requested damages for emotional distress, depreciation in the value of his real estate, and inconvenience, as well as attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 15. On November 7, 2008, Keith requested that the chancery clerk enter an entry of default against the Rogerses as a result of their failure to appear, plead, or otherwise defend against Keith's complaint. The record reflects that the chancery court entered the entry of default on November 7, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 16. On December 19, 2008, the chancery court entered an order transferring\n   the case to circuit court, explaining that after reviewing the pleadings, \"the circuit court is the appropriate court to hear this matter.\" The chancellor stated that because Keith alleged breach of contract against Alfonso Realty and sought both actual and punitive damages, \"[t]his matter does not fall within the chancery court's jurisdiction over 'all matters in equity.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17. On April 20, 2010, Alfonso Realty filed its motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute or, in the alternative, for summary judgment in the circuit court. Alfonso Realty claimed that Keith \"ha[d] taken no steps to prosecute his claim over the twenty-two months this case ha[d] been pending.\" Alfonso Realty explained that Keith's claim against it was for damages only. Alfonso Realty also argued as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [A r]eview of the Listing Agreement and Contract for the Purchase of Sale of Real Estate evidenced no duty or contractual requirement that Alfonso [Realty] take responsibility for the drafting or review of the deed in this transaction. Even absent the Declaration of Acceptance[,] which specifically releases Alfonso [Realty], there would exist no material fact in dispute supporting [Keith's] claim of breach of contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 18. On October 27, 2010, the circuit court granted Alfonso Realty's motion for summary judgment. The circuit court then transferred the remaining claims back to the chancery court, explaining: \"Now that summary judgment has been granted with regard to the breach of contract and damages, [the] [c]ircuit [c]ourt does not have jurisdiction to hear the remaining equity claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 19. On November 30, 2011, the chancellor, on her own motion, entered an order dismissing the case without prejudice after finding that the case had \"been on the docket for twelve (12) terms or longer without any action being taken thereon.\" In response, Keith filed a motion to reinstate the case, which the chancellor granted on January 9, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20. The record reflects that over the next four years, this matter was set for trial and continued approximately six times. The chancellor held a bench trial on September 8, 2016. At trial, Keith presented three witnesses: himself, Andy, and Joyce Wilkerson, who had prepared an abstract of Keith and Cheryl's property. At the conclusion of the trial, Keith made an ore tenus motion for a default judgment against the Rogerses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 21. The chancellor denied Keith's claims for relief on November 17, 2016, and rendered a judgment in favor of the Defendants. The chancellor found that Keith failed to deraign title, file a lis pendens, and join all necessary parties as required by law, thus leaving the chancellor without jurisdiction to reform title to the property or enter a default judgment against the Rogerses. The chancellor thus denied Keith's request for a default judgment. The chancellor also held that Keith presented insufficient evidence to sustain his burden of proving that Andy was negligent in preparing the warranty deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22. Keith now appeals, arguing that the chancellor erred in finding that he failed to prove that Andy committed legal malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 23.

In her November 17, 2016 final judgment, the chancellor addressed Keith's legal-malpractice claim and found as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [Keith] alleged that [Andy] prepared a deed which included an erroneous description of real estate. [Keith] alleged that this act constituted negligence, and he requested damages. The elements of a negligence action are well[ ] settled in Mississippi.\n   <em>\n    Patterson v.

In this matter, the [c]ourt, having considered the testimony of the parties, the evidence presented, and the applicable law, finds that there was insufficient evidence presented by [Keith] to sustain [his] burden of proof. As such, the [c]ourt finds the negligence claim is DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 26. The Mississippi Supreme Court has distinguished between two types of legal-malpractice claims: \"[ (1) those] based on negligence (sometimes called a breach of the standard of care) and [ (2) ] those based on breach of fiduciary duty (sometimes called a breach of the standard of conduct).\"\n   <em>\n    Crist v. Loyacono\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7033157\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/65/837/#p842\">\n    65 So.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 842 (\u00b6 15) (Miss. 2011). On appeal, Keith alleges that Andy was both negligent and breached his fiduciary duty. Since the analysis is different for each claim, we will address them separately. In so doing, we find, as set forth in this opinion, that Keith\n   is barred from raising his claim of legal malpractice based on an allegation of breach of fiduciary duty. Therefore, only Keith's negligence-based legal-malpractice claim is properly before us in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Fiduciary Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 27. To prove legal malpractice based on an allegation of breach of fiduciary duty, the plaintiff must establish the following: \"(1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship; (2) the acts constituting a violation of the attorney's fiduciary duty; (3) that the breach proximately caused the injury; and (4) the fact and extent of the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7033157\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/65/837/#p842\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7033157\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/65/837/#p842\">\n    at 842-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 28. The supreme court has held that \"[i]f a complaint is intended to allege a breach of fiduciary duty, it would be necessary to state with particularity the facts which purportedly created the duty that was breached, so that the court could determine as a matter of law whether there was such a duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilbourn v. Stennett, Wilkinson &amp; Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7446460\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/687/1205/#p1216\">\n    687 So.2d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1216 (Miss. 1996). The supreme court clarified that \"merely mak[ing] the conclusory statement that a fiduciary duty was violated\" in the complaint \"is not sufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7446460\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/687/1205/#p1216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 29. Keith's complaint asserts a claim of legal malpractice based only on an allegation of negligence, and not a breach of fiduciary duty. In his complaint, Keith alleged that \"[t]he actions of [Andy] in preparing the deed which included an erroneous description of real estate constitutes negligence. As a result of said negligence, [Keith] has been damaged and ... is entitled to receive damages he has suffered.\" A review of the chancellor's November 17, 2016 final judgment also reflects that Keith's claim of legal malpractice based on negligence was the only malpractice claim before her. Other than on appeal, the only time Keith made an argument about Andy's alleged breach of fiduciary duty was during closing arguments at trial. During closing arguments, Keith's counsel asserted that as the closing attorney, Andy was acting in the capacity of a dual agent for Keith and the Rogerses. In his proposed findings of fact, Andy also admitted that he had an attorney-client relationship with Keith and the Rogerses. Keith's counsel submitted that as a result, Andy owed a fiduciary duty to both Keith and the Rogerses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 30. After reviewing the record, we find that Keith failed to \"state with particularity\" the facts creating the duty that Andy allegedly breached. Furthermore, the supreme court has held that an appellate court \"will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. LaVere\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6958071\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/136/404/#p410\">\n    136 So.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410 (\u00b6 6) (Miss. 2014). Since Keith failed to allege a breach of fiduciary duty in his complaint or raise the argument in the chancery court, Keith is barred from raising this argument for the first time on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Negligence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 31. To prove legal malpractice based on an allegation of negligence, or breach of the standard of care, the plaintiff must establish the following by a preponderance of the evidence: \"(1) an attorney-client relationship; (2) the attorney's negligence in handling the client's affairs; and (3) proximate cause of the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Great Am.

Keith submits that at trial, he provided evidence showing that prior to the loan closing and preparation of the warranty deed, Andy negligently failed to communicate with Keith regarding the property Keith intended to convey. Keith also asserts that Andy was negligent in failing to review any surveys of the property prior to drafting the deed, and as a result, Andy drafted a warranty deed with an incorrect legal description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 39. Keith also argues that as a layperson, he lacked the knowledge at the time of the closing to understand the legal description provided by Andy and that he relied on Andy, as his attorney, to provide the correct legal description. In support of his argument, Keith provides that he later learned, and the record shows, that the legal description provided by Andy in the warranty deed for 6331 Jim Ramsey Road also included both the five acres located at 6327 Jim Ramsey Road and the middle parcel (6325 Jim Ramsey Road) that Keith did not even own at the time of the closing because Keith had already deeded this 1.23 acres of land to the Storms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 40. Andy argues, however, that at the closing, he presented the warranty deed to Keith and the Rogerses, along with a map displaying a picture of the property to be conveyed, less the parcel previously conveyed to the Storms, and the legal description of the property to be conveyed. Andy also claims that at the closing, he discussed the property's boundary lines and acreage involved, and none of the parties nor Shirley objected to the property being conveyed at the closing. Andy maintains that his actions in preparing the deed and presenting the deed to Keith to execute failed to constitute negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 41. However, as previously acknowledged, Andy admitted that he possessed an attorney-client relationship with Keith.

The record shows that the contract for sale was admitted into evidence at trial. The contract for sale identified the house located at 6331 Jim Ramsey Road, as well as the 2.3 acres of land, as the property being sold by Keith and Cheryl. However, the legal description of the property provided by Andy in the warranty deed also included the properties located at both 6325 Jim Ramsey Road and 6327 Jim Ramsey Road. The warranty deed at issue herein states, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Keith A. O'Brien and Cheryl R. O'Brien do hereby sell, convey and warrant unto Michael Rogers and Mary Ann Rogers, as joint tenants with full right of survivorship and not as tenants in common, the land and property which is situated in the County of Jackson, State of Mississippi, described as follows, to wit:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   See Exhibit \"A\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Said parcel of property carries the County Parcel Number 02308100.017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Said parcel of property is the same recorded in Deed Book 1132, Page 869 Land Deed Records of Jackson County, Mississippi.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 43. The amount of acreage sold does not appear on the face of the warranty deed. However, the warranty deed references Exhibit A, which provides the legal description of the land. The legal description in Exhibit A reads, in pertinent part, as follows: \"Said parcel contains\n   <strong>\n    8.9 acres, more or less\n   </strong>\n   and intending to be that same land conveyed to [the O'Briens] by deed ... and recorded in ... the Land Deed Records of Jackson County, Mississippi.\" (Emphasis added). As stated, this legal description of the property prepared by Andy included two other addresses and related parcels beyond the 2.3 acres located at 6331 Jim Ramsey Road being sold by Keith and Cheryl at the closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 44. As previously acknowledged, Keith and Cheryl purchased the entire 8.9 acres in 1998 and subsequently had the property surveyed and divided into three parcels. Keith then established street addresses for each of the parcels. Our review of the record reflects that Andy failed to conduct a proper title search of Keith and Cheryl's property prior to preparing the warranty deed. Andy admitted at trial that he did perform a title search, but that he failed to discover that Keith had already deeded the 1.23-acre middle parcel located at 6325\n   Jim Ramsey Road to the Storms prior to entering the contract for sale with the Rogerses. Andy also testified that he should have included language in the deed that excepted this 1.23-acre parcel out of the legal description set forth in the deed, but that he failed to do so:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Q. When you did your title search, did it not pop up the fact that [Keith], prior to the loan closing, didn't actually own the entire 8.9 acres?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   A. I'd have to go back, but there should have probably been a less and-well, not probably. There should have been a less and except for that one point something acres, the Storm property in the middle. That should have appeared on the deed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Q. But you didn't catch that and put that on the deed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   A. I'm not sure if I did or didn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Q. You've ... still got the [w]arranty [d]eed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   A. I do. Yea[h]. It's not in the deed. The less and except is not there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 45. After our review of the record, we find that Andy was negligent in drafting the warranty deed, which contained an erroneous legal description of the property to be sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Proximate Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 46. Finally, Keith must show that Andy's negligence in preparing the warranty deed proximately caused the injuries for which Keith seeks damages. The supreme court has explained that \"a plaintiff in a negligence-based malpractice action must establish proximate cause by the so-called trial-within-a-trial test. That is to say, the client must show that, but for his attorney's negligence, he would have been successful in the prosecution or defense of the underlying action.\"\n   <em>\n    Crist\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7033157\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/65/837/#p842\">\n    65 So.3d at 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 14) (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

In his appellate brief, Keith admits that \"[g]iven the nature of the underlying transaction, [he] cannot show that he would have won the case within the case.\" However, Keith claims that if Andy had correctly described the property in the warranty deed, Keith would still have roughly five acres of land on which to live.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 48. In support of his claim for damages, Keith testified that he had an appraisal performed of the five acres that he intended to keep. The chancellor admitted a copy of the appraisal into evidence. Keith testified that the appraised value of the five acres was $35,000. Keith also testified that regarding damages, he \"really wanted [his] property back,\" but he would also \"take either\" a corrected deed or the amount of money the property is worth. Keith also testified as to the attorney's fees that he incurred in attempting to resolve this matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 49. The record reflects that the Rogerses obtained a mortgage on the property that attached at the time of the closing. The record also reflects that in 2006, once the Rogerses learned that they owned 8.9 acres, rather than 2.3, they obtained a second mortgage encumbering the entire 8.9 acres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 50. Andy, however, asserts that even if the chancellor had found that Andy's actions constituted legal malpractice, Keith\n   still could not recover title to the land due to his failure to deraign title, file a lis pendens, and join all necessary parties. However, as stated, return of the property to Keith is not a viable remedy since the Rogerses encumbered the property upon closing and then obtained a second mortgage in 2006. In her final judgment, the chancellor held that since Keith failed to deraign title, failed to file a lis pendens, and failed to join all necessary parties, the chancellor lacked jurisdiction to reform title to the property or enter a default judgment against the Rogerses. However, Keith failed to appeal the chancellor's denial of Keith's request to confirm and quiet title. The issue on appeal is whether Keith met his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Andy committed legal malpractice by negligently drafting a warranty deed containing an incorrect legal description of the property to be sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 51. Upon our review, we find that the record contains substantial credible evidence showing that Andy committed legal malpractice based on negligence. The record contains substantial credible evidence, including Andy's admission, showing that an attorney-client relationship existed between Andy and Keith; that Andy was negligent in preparing the deed containing an erroneous legal description of the property to be sold; and that Andy's negligence proximately caused Keith to incur damages. As discussed, Andy acknowledged that since Keith did not own the 1.23-acre middle parcel (6325 Jim Ramsey Road) at the time of the closing, Andy should have included \"less and except\" language in the deed. However, Andy admitted that he failed to include this language in the deed. While drafting the warranty deed and conducting a proper title search, Andy also should have discovered that the five-acre back parcel (6327 Jim Ramsey Road) was not connected to the property intended to be sold (6331 Jim Ramsey Road) as a result of the prior conveyance of the 1.23-acre middle parcel. However, Andy failed to make this discovery. The chancellor's finding that Keith failed to meet his burden of proof is not supported by the evidence in the record, and we therefore reverse the chancellor's judgment and remand this case to the chancellor for a determination of damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gibson v.

Alfonso testified that no one ever told him that the deed should convey less than the entire tract of land previously owned by O'Brien. Alfonso testified that he obtained the legal description of the property from the land records, i.e., from the prior deed conveying the property to O'Brien. In fact, Alfonso testified that he remained unsure what part of the property O'Brien intended to convey.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the evidence did tend to show (1) that O'Brien intended to convey only a 2.3-acre lot, not the entire 8.9-acre tract described in the deed that Alfonso prepared; and (2) that a proper title search and examination would have identified this issue because a previously recorded deed conveyed 1.23 of the 8.9 acres from O'Brien to his daughter and son-in-law. Alfonso claimed that he performed a title search, but the record does not include a title report or any other contemporaneous records or notes of Alfonso's, and Alfonso could not explain why he prepared a deed that failed to account for the 1.23 acres that O'Brien had already conveyed. A proper title search would have identified this discrepancy and, at a minimum, prompted further inquiry by Alfonso. Based on this evidence, O'Brien proved negligence. In addition, Alfonso admits an attorney-client relationship with O'Brien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 57. Nonetheless, I would affirm the judgment of the chancery court because the record contains facts from which the chancellor could have found that Alfonso's negligence was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a proximate cause of any damages. Indeed, this was the issue that Alfonso emphasized in his closing statement in the chancery court. O'Brien and his ex-wife signed a one-page warranty deed that clearly stated that the property being conveyed was described in an attached \"Exhibit 'A.' \" That one-page exhibit contained only a brief legal description of the land conveyed, which concluded as follows: \"Said parcel contains 8.9 acres, more or less and intending to be at same\n   land conveyed to Grantors by deed dated September 10, 1993 and recorded in ... the Land Deed Records of Jackson County, Mississippi.\" If O'Brien had read the warranty deed that he signed, he would have seen that it did not reflect his alleged intent. Therefore, the chancellor could have found that O'Brien's failure to read the deed was the sole proximate cause of any damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 58. Our Supreme Court has made the same basic point in the context of claims against insurance agents alleging negligent failure to procure coverage. The Court has held that an agent has a duty to exercise reasonable diligence and skill to obtain coverage requested by the insured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mladineo v. Schmidt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7043233\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/52/1154/#p1164\">\n    52 So.3d 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1164 (\u00b6 35) (Miss. 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    Robichaux v.

However, the insured also has a \"duty to read [his] policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Mladineo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7043233\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/52/1154/#p1164\">\n    52 So.3d at 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 38). If the terms of the policy presented to the insured \"plainly did not cover the things that the [insured] assumed [the policy] would cover,\" then the insured's own failure to read his policy-not the agent's breach of duty-is \"the proximate cause of [the insured's] damage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7043233\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/52/1154/#p1164\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (holding that a policy clearly excluded coverage for water damage; therefore, the insureds' failure to read their policy-not the agent's failure to procure the coverage-\"was the proximate cause of their damage\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

On the evidence in this case, the chancellor could have reached the same conclusion regarding O'Brien's failure to read his warranty deed. Had O'Brien read his deed, he would have seen that it purported to convey 8.9 acres, the entire tract he originally purchased years earlier. Had O'Brien read the deed, the legal description could have been corrected before he conveyed the property to Michael and Mary Ann Rogers, and he would not have suffered any damages. Because the legal description attached to the deed clearly purports to convey 8.9 acres, the chancellor could have found that O'Brien's own failure to read the deed-not Alfonso's negligence-was the proximate cause of any damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 60.

Thus, while\n   <em>\n    Berman\n   </em>\n   held, as a matter of law, that the attorney's negligence was not the proximate cause\n   <em>\n    in that case\n   </em>\n   , in many other cases the issue will be one for the fact-finder to decide at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paul v.

For similar reasons, the chancellor in this case could have found that O'Brien's own failure to read the warranty deed was the sole proximate cause of any damages. O'Brien was not under any disability, and nothing prevented him from reading the deed. The deed plainly purported to convey the entire 8.9-acre tract. If O'Brien had read the deed, he would have seen that and could have had it corrected before he suffered any damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 63. As the Georgia Court of Appeals held in\n   <em>\n    Berman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , a client's failure to read and understand a document will not always save the lawyer from liability for negligent drafting. If the legal import of an agreement's terms is not clear to a layperson, then the client's failure to read and understand may not be the proximate cause of his own damage. In some cases, this will be an issue for the trier of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547379\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/283/584/\">\n    642 S.E.2d at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the facts of this case, the chancellor, as the trier of fact, could have found that O'Brien's failure to read was the proximate cause of his\n   own damage.
