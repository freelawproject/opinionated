R.S. 40:966(C). The juvenile denied the allegations of the petition on that same date. On May 13, 2015, the hearing on the petition was continued without date, and the juvenile entered into the Diversion Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 24, 2016, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a petition in juvenile court alleging that the juvenile obstructed or interfered with members of the staff, faculty, or students of educational institutions in violation of La. R.S. 14:328(B) (petition \"A\"). On March 30, 2016, the State amended petition \"A\" to simple battery on a minor child in violation of La. R.S. 14:35, and the juvenile admitted the allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The disposition hearing for the simple battery adjudication was set for May 5, 2016. On May 5, 2016, the judge committed the juvenile to the Office of Juvenile Justice (hereinafter referred to as \"OJJ\") for six months or until his 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   birthday, whichever was sooner, suspended the sentence, and placed the juvenile on active and intensive probation for two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 18, 2017, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a petition in juvenile court alleging that the juvenile violated La. R.S. 14:95.8 by committing the offense of illegal possession of a handgun by a juvenile (counts one and two) (petitions \"C\" and \"D\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The juvenile denied the allegations of those petitions on that same date. On August 7, 2017, the juvenile filed omnibus motions, including a Motion to Suppress Evidence, Statement, and Identification. On August 16, 2017, the judge held the suppression and the adjudication hearings at the same time. Afterwards, on that same date, the judge denied the Motion to Suppress Evidence and Statement, finding that there was no illegal stop by the officer and that there was no statement taken by the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Deputy Galvin Livers of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office (\"JPSO\") testified at the suppression/adjudication hearing that on July 11, 2017, at nighttime, he and Deputy Andre Nelson were dispatched \"to a reported gunfire.\" Deputy Livers explained that an anonymous complainant advised them that he observed occupants of a four-door silver vehicle discharging firearms while the vehicle was in motion in the area of Bent Tree Boulevard and Leo Kerner Parkway. Deputy Livers also explained that he heard Deputy Nelson \"put out a traffic stop of a silver four-door vehicle,\" and that he responded to Deputy Nelson. He asserted that once he arrived on the scene, he removed the driver from the vehicle and spoke with him afterward. He further asserted that he advised the driver that they were there because gunshots were heard in the area and that the reporting person described the vehicle as a silver four-door vehicle, which matched the vehicle that he pulled over. Deputy Livers testified that he asked the driver for permission to search the vehicle for any contraband that would be associated with that crime and that he received verbal consent from the driver to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Deputy Livers noted that he subsequently conducted a search of the vehicle but did not locate anything in the front passenger compartment. He stated that upon going to the rear passenger compartment, he conducted a search of the floorboard but did not find anything. Deputy Livers testified that upon exiting the backseat of the vehicle on the rear passenger side, he noticed that the padding in the backseat was \"loose from the rest of the vehicle.\" He explained that he lifted it up and observed two firearms underneath the seat, one silver and one black. Deputy Livers asserted that the whole seat was removable and that it took very minimal force to lift it up. He stated that the seat was removed from the vehicle once they discovered the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Deputy Livers testified that he discovered a Bersa model .380 handgun when he lifted up the seat. He also testified that he discovered a Ruger model handgun under the backseat of the vehicle as well. Deputy Livers submitted that one of the firearms was located directly under the rear driver's-side seat and that the other firearm was located closer to the middle of the vehicle in the backseat. He noted that they\n   were approximately six inches from each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Deputy Livers testified that the entire seat was removable from the vehicle and that the padding and the fabric of the seat were removable from the metal underneath. He stated that the whole seat could be taken out and that there was a compartment underneath. Deputy Livers did not know if those firearms had ammunition in them when he found them. He maintained that he brought the firearms to Deputy Nelson and that Deputy Nelson handled them afterward. Deputy Livers noted that there was nothing else in the compartment. He testified that if there was weight on top of the firearms, they would not have been able to move if the car had turned sharply. He later testified that he would not describe the place he found the guns as a \"compartment\" or a storage space. He explained that the area where the guns were found was a flat surface with padding sitting on top of it. Deputy Livers stated that it was easy to tuck items underneath it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Deputy Livers positively identified the juvenile in court as one of the passengers in that vehicle. He did not know where the juvenile was sitting in that vehicle. Deputy Livers asserted that he was not there for the initial stop of the car. He testified that when he arrived on the scene, he asked the driver, Guy Robinson, to step out of the vehicle and that everybody else in the vehicle was also asked to step out. He said that there were four individuals in that vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Deputy Livers testified that neither he nor Deputy Nelson obtained a signed consent to search the car. He stated that he did not have a warrant to search the vehicle and that he did not observe any weapons in plain view. Deputy Livers maintained that there were no other officers present other than him and Deputy Nelson. He did not take photographs of the guns that he found. Deputy Livers asserted that he did not participate in taking any statements from the other two passengers or the driver. He explained that he searched the vehicle because it matched the description of the vehicle they were looking for. They also searched the vehicle because there were reported gunshots fired in the area, and there was the possibility of evidence being located in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   JPSO Deputy Andre Nelson Jr. testified at the suppression/adjudication hearing that on July 11, 2017, they received an anonymous call from an individual who heard multiple gunshots in the area \"between Ames and Barataria all the way to approximately East Ames and Ames\" in Jefferson Parish and that individual observed a four-door silver vehicle fleeing the area. Deputy Nelson asserted that after he received that report, he began to patrol the area for that vehicle. He stated that approximately one minute later, he observed a silver four-door vehicle leaving the intersection of Barataria Boulevard and Leo Kerner turning toward Ames. At that time, Deputy Nelson conducted an investigatory stop since it was nighttime and the only vehicle he saw on the road \"was that vehicle.\" He did not know the exact time but recalled that it was very dark, the streetlights were on, and it was \"almost close to morning hours.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Deputy Nelson stated that the vehicle turned into the Brother's Food Mart located at Barataria and Ames. He ordered the driver out of the vehicle and explained to the driver why he was stopped. Deputy Nelson noticed that there were three other occupants in the vehicle. He testified that when Deputy Livers arrived to assist, they asked the other occupants to exit the vehicle for officer safety. He explained that this was done since the investigatory stop\n   was based on gunshots and potential weapons in the vehicle. Deputy Nelson stated that during the stop, he observed a backseat passenger, who was later identified as the juvenile, leaning toward the floorboard of the vehicle. He further stated that the juvenile was in the backseat on the driver's side. Deputy Nelson explained that the juvenile's action of leaning toward the floorboard was enough to alert him that the juvenile might have something in his possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Deputy Nelson testified that after he got everyone out of the vehicle, he began to identify everyone. In the process of doing so, Deputy Livers came to assist him. They asked the driver if he would allow them to search the vehicle since they were investigating it for potential weapons. Deputy Nelson testified that the driver complied. He stated that after he spoke to the driver, he conducted a background check of each individual. Deputy Nelson asserted that Deputy Livers then conducted a search of the vehicle. He recalled that during the search, Deputy Livers came and informed him, so as not to alert anyone, that he had found two firearms in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Deputy Nelson testified that they subsequently handcuffed everyone, read everyone their rights, and placed them into the police vehicles. He recalled that he placed the juvenile and the other backseat occupant in the backseat of his vehicle and that Deputy Livers placed the driver in his vehicle. During the background checks, Deputy Nelson noticed that the driver and the other backseat passenger were on probation. Deputy Nelson testified that the other backseat occupant told him that he was on probation and that the firearms were not his. He stated that the juvenile then spontaneously told him that both of the \"hammers\" were his. Deputy Nelson stated that \"hammers\" was a street slang term used to identify firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Deputy Nelson explained that the juvenile was \"upset,\" \"irritated,\" and \"very angry\" because the investigation was not going fast enough and Deputy Nelson did not immediately believe his story. He testified that after several times of telling him that the firearms were his, the juvenile continued to ask why he was being arrested. Deputy Nelson told the juvenile to relax, and the juvenile told him that the other occupants were his relatives. He testified that he did not ask the juvenile to sign a waiver of his rights because he was not questioning the juvenile or asking him anything pertaining to the investigation until his parent could be present. However, Deputy Nelson stated that the juvenile never gave them any information regarding who his mother or guardian was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge then adjudicated the juvenile delinquent as to two counts of illegal possession of a handgun by a juvenile and ordered a pre-disposition investigation (PDI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 22, 2017, the probation officer filed a \"Motion to Modify Judgment of Disposition Revocation of Probation.\" On September 7, 2017, after a hearing, the judge committed the juvenile to the OJJ for six months each on the offenses in petitions \"C\" and \"D\" to run concurrently with each other and consecutively with the disposition in petition \"A.\" On that same date, after a hearing, the judge revoked the juvenile's probation, adjudicated the juvenile delinquent as charged, and imposed the previously suspended disposition of six months to the OJJ (petition \"A\"). On September 15, 2017, the juvenile filed a Motion for Appeal that was granted on September 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On appeal, the juvenile alleges: 1) there was insufficient evidence to support the\n   delinquency adjudication; 2) the stop and the search of the vehicle were illegal; 3) the juvenile court judge erred in failing to grant his motion to suppress statement; and 4) the juvenile court judge erred in revoking his probation based upon delinquency adjudications that are not supported by sufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The juvenile argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the delinquency adjudications. He asserts that the handgun must be on the juvenile's person in order to sustain an adjudication of delinquency for illegal possession of a firearm by a juvenile, but that in the instant case, the officer never observed the weapons on the juvenile's person. The juvenile notes that there was no registration check on the guns, no fingerprint or DNA testing done on the guns, and no testimony by either officer or anyone in the car that the juvenile was in actual possession of the guns. He also contends that a person may not be convicted on his uncorroborated statement and that the State failed to produce any corroborating evidence to show possession of the guns on T.L.'s person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The State responds that the judge properly adjudicated T.L. delinquent of two counts of illegal possession of a handgun by a juvenile. It further responds that the juvenile admitted that he owned the firearms and that the circumstantial evidence showed that the only way the firearms could have gotten into the car was on T.L.'s person. The State notes that the juvenile was seated on the cushion where the firearms were placed, concealed only by the foam padding. The State also notes that T.L. was observed furtively moving in an apparent attempt to hide the weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The record reflects that after hearing the testimony and considering the other evidence presented at the adjudication hearing, the juvenile court judge adjudicated the juvenile delinquent as to two counts of illegal possession of a firearm by a juvenile, stating in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   While this is a circumstantial case, it is very strong circumstantial case based on the facts of this situation. The deputy testified-in particular, Deputy Nelson testified-that within one minute or less of receiving the dispatch that shots had been fired in the exact area where he was, in the Barataria, Ames, Lafitte area, and that there was a four-door silver car fleeing the area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   And, again, within one minute or less, the deputies come upon the only car in the area, which is a four-door silver car. He sees four subjects in there. One of whom, the passenger driver's side person, makes a furtive move forward which caught his attention. Of course, in concern for officer safety based on the fact that this was a weapons call, weapons being fired from a vehicle, late at night, close to the morning hours, according to the testimony, I think he had every right in the world to pull that vehicle over for an investigatory stop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   And then we get to the part about removing the people from the vehicle. This defendant was behind the driver in the back seat driver's side. The seat, which is easily removed from the vehicle, reveals two weapons which have been placed into evidence. I've already ruled on their admissibility. And then we have the excited utterances of this defendant who not only once said that the hammers were his, but repeatedly told the officer in an irritated and angry way that the weapons were his and that he was annoyed that the officer was taking so long to complete his investigation\n   when, in fact, this defendant had already told him that the weapons were his.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The logical conclusion, even though possession of a firearm by a juvenile does require weapons to be on the person of the juvenile, the only logical conclusion is that this individual had the weapons in his possession when he got into the vehicle, when he moved them under the seat. And then, by his own admission, claiming that they were his. I find him guilty as charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In order for the court to adjudicate a child delinquent, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the child committed a delinquent act alleged in the petition. La. Ch.C. art. 883. The constitutional standard for testing the sufficiency of evidence in delinquency proceedings, as in criminal proceedings against an adult, requires that the evidence, direct or circumstantial, or a mixture of both, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact that all of the elements of the crime have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, in accord with\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

In a juvenile delinquency proceeding, the State's burden of proof is the same as in a criminal proceeding against an adult, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense alleged in the petition.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The rule as to circumstantial evidence is that \"assuming every fact to be proved that the evidence tends to prove, in order to convict, it must exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\" La.

The juvenile asserts that the driver, who allegedly gave his consent, did not testify, there was no written consent form offered into evidence, and the driver of the car was being detained in what appeared to be coercive circumstances. He also asserts that the judge ruled that the driver's statement to the officer allegedly giving consent was hearsay. The juvenile contends that jurisprudence supports his right to traverse the consent to search by the driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The State responds that jurisprudence has validated traffic stops based on anonymous tips which provided little more than the color and type of vehicle suspected of criminal activity, noting that in the instant case, the caller provided police with the color, type, number of car doors, and the car's expected location. It also responds that the circumstances suggested ongoing criminal activity and the threat of imminent harm to the public. The State contends that it is not required to produce the witnesses who consented to the search in order to show the consent was freely and voluntarily given and that the testimony of the officer alone was sufficient to prove the consent was valid. It further contends that police had cause to search the car without the owner's consent because they had reason to believe that the car contained firearms and/or evidence of a crime. The State asserts that the juvenile does not have standing to challenge the search because he has no proprietary interest in the backseat of Mr. Robinson's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On August 7, 2017, the juvenile filed omnibus motions, including a motion to suppress evidence. In that motion, the juvenile moved the court to suppress any and all evidence seized from him, his person, his vehicle, and/or place of residence by the police and sought to be used by the State at trial on the grounds that such evidence was unconstitutionally obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At the suppression/adjudication hearing, defense counsel argued that the guns should be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree because the search of the car was unconstitutional. The juvenile court judge denied that motion, finding that the stop was constitutional. He found that the juvenile did not have the right to complain about whether or not the driver gave consent to search the car.

The judge responded that those cases were not applicable, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   I do not consider this to have been an illegal stop based on the circumstances and the time frame of this officer responding to what he believed could have been less than one minute to the actual call, and it was the only vehicle in the area, and it met the description of a four-door silver vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The judge noted defense counsel's objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defense counsel then argued that the State did not present any non-hearsay evidence that there was actual consent to search the vehicle. She noted that the driver of the vehicle was not in court and that\n   there was no signed consent form. After hearing arguments of counsel, the judge denied the motion to suppress the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A trial court's denial of a motion to suppress is afforded great weight and will not be set aside unless the evidence clearly favors suppression.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Supreme Court noted that by reporting that she had been run off the road by a specific vehicle, the caller necessarily claimed an eyewitness basis of knowledge. It stated that the apparently short time between the reported incident and the 9-1-1 call suggested that the caller had little time to fabricate the report.

The officer did not obtain the names and addresses of the couple nor did he take down their license plate. The officer subsequently observed a truck that was straddling the double yellow center line of the highway and stopped it. The defendant was charged with DWI-third offense. The trial judge granted his motion to suppress evidence, and the court of appeal affirmed the trial court's ruling. However, the supreme court, citing\n   <em>\n    Navarre\n   </em>\n   , found that the totality of the circumstances established that the officer had reasonable suspicion to investigate information personally presented to him by concerned citizens who witnessed criminal conduct. It also found that the officer's reasonable suspicions were corroborated within minutes when, just outside his territorial jurisdiction, he personally observed the defendant's erratic driving. The supreme court also found that under these circumstances, the officer can be considered to have been in close pursuit under La. C.Cr.P. art. 213, and the subsequent detention of the defendant's vehicle was authorized.

C.Cr.P. art. 215.1. The supreme court asserted that the witnesses were clearly citizen informants providing information about a crime as it was happening and not anonymous tipsters.

Deputy Nelson testified that he located a vehicle that matched that description in that area within approximately one minute and that it was the only vehicle on the road. During the stop, Deputy Nelson observed the juvenile, the backseat passenger on the driver's side, leaning toward the floorboard of the vehicle, which alerted him that the juvenile might have something in his possession. As such, we find that the deputies were allowed to search the vehicle without a warrant because the vehicle was readily mobile and probable cause existed to believe it contained contraband, i.e., evidence of weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    Denial of Motion to Suppress Statement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The juvenile argues that the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress his statement. He points out that the officer testified that he was questioning the juvenile's older cousin when the juvenile made incriminating statements. The juvenile contends that it was not made clear at the hearing how the officer explained to the juvenile that the juvenile's cousin, and not the juvenile himself, was the object of the questioning. He further contends that T.L. was 15 years old at the time of his arrest, had not had much interaction with the judicial process, and only gave a statement after his cousin, also in custody, had denied the guns were his. The juvenile asserts that under the circumstances, the statement should have been suppressed because the presence of his cousin had the effect of coercing T.L.'s statement. Further, the juvenile contends that since the statement was the sole evidence of guilt, the error could not be found to be harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The State responds that the judge properly admitted T.L.'s statement that the firearms belonged to him. It further responds that because T.L. had been informed of his rights and was not being interrogated, his constitutional rights were not violated, noting that\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   was only applicable if the defendant was under express questioning or its functional equivalent. The State asserts that T.L.'s statements were spontaneous utterances and were not made in response to an inquiry directed at him. It also asserts that there is no evidence that the officer's interview of the other passenger was a pretext to extract a confession from T.L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   On August 7, 2017, the juvenile filed omnibus motions, including a motion to suppress the statement. In that motion, the juvenile moved the court to suppress and exclude any confessions or other inculpatory statements obtained from him pursuant to a custodial interrogation. The juvenile asserted that any such confession or inculpatory statement was not the product of a knowing, intelligent, and/or voluntary waiver of the right to remain silent and the\n   right against self-incrimination, and therefore, should be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   At the suppression/adjudication hearing, defense counsel argued with respect to the motion to suppress statement that the juvenile's statement was provided in connection with custodial interrogation and that there was no definitive proof that he was correctly advised of his rights and provided a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of those rights. Defense counsel contended that the juvenile was in custody at the time of the inculpatory statement as he was in handcuffs in the back of a police vehicle. She further contended that no juvenile rights form was endorsed. She argued that although the deputy claimed he was interviewing someone else when the juvenile made his statement, under the circumstances and given the way that a child views situations differently from adults, this was an interrogation. Defense counsel asserted that the juvenile felt pressured to make a statement acknowledging that the guns were his. The State responded that the deputy clearly stated that the statements were not made as a result of the interrogation of the juvenile and that he was not planning to interrogate the juvenile at all \"because the juvenile would not give information to allow his parents to be bought to the scene.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   After hearing arguments of counsel, the juvenile court judge found that no statement was actually ever taken by the police, and he was unsure that a motion to suppress was appropriate in this case since spontaneous utterances are not considered a confession or statement elicited as a result of questioning or interviewing by a police officer. The judge then denied the motion to suppress the statement, finding that the juvenile made spontaneous utterances which were admissible under the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Miranda v.

He recalled that they handcuffed everyone, read them their rights, and placed them into the police vehicles. Deputy Nelson testified that he placed T.L. and the other backseat occupant in the backseat of his vehicle. He explained that the other backseat occupant told him that he was on probation and that the firearms were not his. He further explained that T.L. then spontaneously told him that both of the \"hammers,\" which he stated was street slang for firearms, were his. Deputy Nelson noted that T.L. was \"upset,\" \"irritated,\" and \"very angry\" because the investigation was not going fast enough and because the deputy did not immediately believe his story. He asserted that T.L. told him several times that the firearms were his. Deputy Nelson testified that he did not ask T.L. to sign a waiver of rights form because he did not intend to question T.L. or ask him anything pertaining to the investigation until his parent could be present. But, he noted that T.L. never gave them information as to who his mother or guardian was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In light of the foregoing, we find that the judge did not err by denying the motion to suppress T.L.'s statement wherein he admitted that the firearms belonged to him. T.L.'s statement was spontaneous and voluntary and not made as a result of police interrogation or compelling influence. Spontaneous and voluntary statements, not given as a result of police interrogation or compelling influence, are admissible without\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings even where a defendant is in custody.\n   <em>\n    See Castillo,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9613216\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/389/1307/#p1310\">\n     supra.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Also, there is no evidence that the deputy's interview of the other backseat passenger caused T.L. to admit that the firearms belonged to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Revocation of Probation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The juvenile argues that the judge erred in revoking his probation based\n   upon delinquency adjudications that are not supported by sufficient evidence. He notes that at the revocation hearing, the testimony showed that since being placed on probation for the simple battery charge, his behavior had improved and he had no violations or disciplinary actions while in the Youth Challenge Program. He also notes that the judge indicated that the sole cause for the revocation was the delinquency adjudication for the gun allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The State responds that if the probation violation involves the illegal possession of a firearm, probation revocation is mandatory. It further responds that as discussed previously, the judge properly denied the motion to suppress, and the delinquency finding was based on sufficient evidence. The State notes that under the Children's Code, the judge could have revoked the juvenile's probation for any of the violations outlined in the probation officer's rule, including the juvenile's failure to abide by curfew, his use of drugs, and/or the refusal to keep his mother informed of his whereabouts. It contends that the judge's recommendation that the juvenile be placed in non-secure custody of the OJJ is the least restrictive disposition under the circumstances and that the disposition should be upheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   On September 7, 2017, a disposition/revocation of probation hearing was held. At that hearing, A'Tisha Robinson from \"probation\" testified that there was a \"staffing\" conducted on September 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   with OJJ who recommended a non-secure setting. She stated that probation concurred with that recommendation. Ms. Robinson indicated revocation and jail time were mandatory because the juvenile was on probation and convicted of possession of a handgun. Afterward, the juvenile court judge committed the juvenile on each of the \"C\" and \"D\" charges to six months at OJJ to run concurrently with each other and consecutively to the \"A\" charge of simple battery, for a total of one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As to the revocation, the judge found that the juvenile had been convicted of being in possession of a handgun, which was a mandatory condition for revocation of probation under the Children's Code. The judge stated that she was satisfied that all legalities had been met. She also found that reasonable efforts had been made to avoid having to place the juvenile in the custody of the State. The judge noted that the juvenile had been through the Diversion Program and the \"Informal FINS Program\" and had received services through both of those programs. She also noted that the juvenile had regular and intensive probation supervision by \"DJS\" and received services from both of those. The judge asserted that the juvenile had psychiatric evaluations by both Dr. Biswas and Dr. Chakraborti, GPS monitoring through the \"ATD program,\" successfully completed the Youth Challenge Program, and had \"bouts\" at Rivarde. Accordingly, the judge revoked her previously suspended sentence of six months but gave the juvenile credit for time served at Rivarde on the battery charge in connection with the revocation. She stated that she would not object to a non-secure placement for the juvenile, but it would be up to the department to determine where the juvenile would be placed. The judge also set the juvenile's case for review in six months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   La. Ch.C. art. 914(B) provides that if the probation violation is the illegal or unlawful possession of a firearm, probation revocation is mandatory, and the child shall be committed to the custody of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In the instant case, T.L. violated his probation by being adjudicated delinquent of two counts of illegal possession of a\n   firearm by a juvenile. As such, we find that the probation revocation was mandatory under La. Ch.C. art. 914(B). Although T.L. argues that the judge erred by revoking his probation because his delinquency adjudications were based on insufficient evidence, as previously discussed in this opinion, the evidence was sufficient to support those adjudications. Therefore, we find that the judge did not err in revoking T.L.'s probation on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    Errors Patent Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The record was reviewed for errors patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   La.
