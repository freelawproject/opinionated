Terry Pitchford was convicted of capital murder in February 2006 in the Grenada County Circuit Court and sentenced to death. This Court affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pitchford v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038451\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/45/216/\">\n    45 So.3d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2010). Pitchford thereafter filed a motion for leave to proceed in the trial court with a petition for post-conviction relief (PCR), arguing\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   he had not received a competency hearing in violation of Rule 9.06 of the Uniform Rules of Circuit and County Court Practice. This Court granted Pitchford's motion in part and ordered the trial court to conduct a retrospective competency hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Before the hearing was conducted, a plurality of this Court held that retrospective competency hearings do not satisfy the purpose of Rule 9.06.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996715\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/161/\">\n    127 So.3d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2013). Despite this ruling, Pitchford's retrospective competency hearing took place in May 2015. The trial court found that Pitchford was competent to stand trial in February 2006 and denied Pitchford's PCR motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Pitchford appeals that judgment, claiming the retrospective competency hearing was (1) an inadequate remedy for purposes of Rule 9.06, and (2) the State's experts did not apply the proper standard for competency to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. Finding no merit in Pitchford's claims, we affirm the judgment of the trial court denying Pitchford's PCR petition based on the trial court's finding that Pitchford was competent to stand trial in February 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. On the morning of November 7, 2004, Walter Davis and his son entered the Crossroads Grocery store in Grenada County, Mississippi, where they discovered the lifeless body of Reuben Britt. Davis contacted authorities, and investigators with the Grenada County Sheriff's Department responded to the scene. The investigation concluded Britt had been shot with two different types of firearms. Investigators also found missing from the store a cash register, cash, and a .38 caliber revolver belonging to Britt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Investigators received information that a vehicle owned by Pitchford matched the description of the vehicle used by Britt's assailants, and that Pitchford had been part of a previous robbery attempt at the store, days prior to Britt's killing. Based on this information, investigators went to Pitchford's residence, where they found a car matching the description they had received from sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Shirley Jackson, Pitchford's mother, gave officials permission to search the car. The search produced Britt's .38 caliber revolver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Pitchford later confessed that he and Eric Bullins had gone to the store to rob it. Pitchford said Bullins had shot Britt three times, and that he (Pitchford) had fired shots into the floor. Pitchford also told investigators that he had attempted to rob the store a week prior to Britt's killing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Pitchford was indicted in January 2005 for capital murder. In February 2005, counsel appointed to represent Pitchford filed a motion stating that \"defendant would show that he has a history of mental\n   problems and that this [c]ourt should appoint a ... psychologist or psychiatrist for the purpose of conducting a thorough mental examination.\" The motion also stated that the defendant \"intends to offer expert witness testimony in the field of psychiatry, on the issue of the defendant's competence to stand trial, and insanity at the time of the alleged offense. The defendant requests this [c]ourt appoint a competent psychiatrist to assist him in the defense of this matter.\" Pursuant to that motion and to agreement by the parties, the trial court ordered that Pitchford be evaluated at the Mississippi State Hospital to determine if he was competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Pitchford was evaluated and tested by doctors at the state hospital on January 11 and 25, 2006. The doctors (Reb McMichael, Criss Lott, and Gilbert Macvaugh) determined that Pitchford was competent to stand trial. They noted that testing and observation indicated Pitchford was attempting to malinger symptoms of mental illness. They unanimously concluded that Pitchford \"has the sufficient present ability to consult with an attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding in the preparation of his defense, and that he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the nature and object of the legal proceedings against him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. No formal competency hearing was held. The trial court, however, held a motions hearing on February 2, 2006, during which the court considered a motion to continue filed by the defense that same day. As part of that motion, defense counsel argued that a continuance was needed to seek an independent mental evaluation. Defense counsel claimed more time was needed to gather mitigating evidence with the assistance of a defense expert. Defense counsel told the court he had consulted with an expert and had reason to believe that further testing might reveal a neurological defect that could be helpful mitigation evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. After hearing argument from both parties and having reviewed the written report from the court-appointed experts, the trial court denied the defense's request for continuance. The trial court found that doctors from the state hospital had written a very thorough analysis and had conducted all the evaluations that were necessary. They came up with nothing that would indicate that Pitchford has \"any neurological problems, any psychological problems, any low I.Q., [or] anything that would justify another person coming in and evaluating Mr. Pitchford.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13. The case proceeded to trial on February 6, 2006. A jury found Pitchford guilty of capital murder and imposed a sentence of death. This Court affirmed Pitchford's conviction and death sentence on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    Pitchford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038451\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/45/216/\">\n    45 So.3d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14. Pitchford thereafter sought leave from this Court to proceed in the trial court with a PCR petition. Pitchford raised a number of claims, including the claim that he was denied a competency hearing prior to his trial for capital murder. This Court denied all claims except Pitchford's claim pertaining to a competency hearing. This Court ordered that the matter be remanded to the trial court for a hearing on whether Pitchford was competent to stand trial at the time the criminal trial took place in February 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15. The hearing was held on May 11 and 12, 2015. Pitchford called five witnesses on his behalf: Joseph Cornish (an inmate housed with Pitchford prior to trial in the Grenada County jail); Jonamath Thompson (an inmate also housed with Pitchford prior to trial); Shirley Jackson (Pitchford's mother); Dominique Hogan (Pitchford's former girlfriend and the mother of Pitchford's only child); and Dr. Rahn Bailey (a psychiatrist who had evaluated\n   Pitchford on February 4, 2006, just days prior to Pitchford's criminal trial). For the State, Drs. McMichael and Macvaugh testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court issued a bench ruling, followed by a written order, finding that Pitchford was competent to stand trial in February 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17. The trial court specifically found \"of no consequence\" Cornish's or Thompson's testimony. The trial court found their statements that Pitchford occasionally talked to himself or appeared at times to be depressed while in jail prior to trial to be of no import. The trial court added, however, that even if their testimony was true, it \"offers nothing that would suggest that Pitchford was not competent to stand trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18. The trial court noted that Jackson testified that Pitchford had claimed to have heard voices in his head as a child, and would occasionally \"slap himself upside the head,\" and that he may have attempted suicide when he was fifteen or sixteen years of age. But Jackson also testified that she did not take this claimed behavior seriously at the time. The court stated, \"her corresponding inaction confirms that she didn't find these alleged incidents of such a nature that she believed her son needed medical attention.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 19. The trial court noted that Hogan had testified she one time HAD heard Pitchford talking to himself while in the shower and another time when he appeared to be \"air boxing.\" But the court found that nothing to which Hogan testified offered any insight into Pitchford's competence to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 20. As to the respective expert witnesses, the trial court found the State's expert witnesses more credible than the defense's expert witness. According to the court, Dr. Bailey's report and testimony was \"long on conclusions and very short on facts to support his conclusions.\" Dr. Bailey's \"signed and unsigned reports contradicted each other, and portions of the reports contradicted other portions of the reports.\" Dr. Bailey's testimony \"was also very contradictory,\" and \"there was not a foundational basis for much of his testimony,\" and the court found most of it \"lacking in credibility and believability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 21. The trial court also noted that Pitchford was represented at trial by one of the leading capital defense lawyers in the state, \"if not the entire Southeastern portion of this country, that being Ray Charles Carter[,]\" who was assisted by Ray Baum, \"a long-time criminal defense attorney.\" At no time did defense counsel ever indicate to the court they were having trouble communicating with Pitchford. The court also found it \"telling\" that neither Carter nor Baum was called by Pitchford to testify at the retrospective competency hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 22. The trial court took into consideration the transcript from Pitchford's guilty-plea hearing, held in January 2006, less than a month prior to Pitchford's criminal trial. Pitchford had petitioned the trial court to enter a guilty plea. But after extensive colloquy with the court, Pitchford withdrew his guilty plea and elected to go to trial. The court found the transcript of that proceeding \"shows an individual that understood the legal process and was in full command of his mental faculties.\" Pitchford's defense attorney, Carter, also had signed an attorney's acknowledgment form that indicated he was satisfied that Pitchford had the mental capacity to enter a valid guilty plea at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 23. Based on the evidence before it, the trial court found that Pitchford had failed to prove by a preponderance of the\n   evidence that he was not competent to stand trial in February 2006. The court denied Pitchford's PCR claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 24. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be related as necessary throughout our discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 25. We address together Pitchford's claim that the retrospective competency hearing was an inadequate remedy for purposes of Rule 9.06, and that the State's experts did not apply the proper standard for competency to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 26. Relying on this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996715\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/161/\">\n    127 So.3d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Pitchford contends his capital-murder conviction should be reversed because the retrospective competency hearing failed to satisfy the purposes of Rule 9.06, which\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   held does not contemplate retrospective competency hearings. Pitchford argues that the inadequacies of such hearings led this Court to criticize and reject them in\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   . Pitchford contends the same inadequacies recognized in\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   permeated his May 2015 retrospective competency hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 27. The State argues that Pitchford's claim is self-defeating based on the plain language found in\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   , which expressly noted Pitchford's case and distinguished it by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, we note that the facts and circumstances presented in\n   <em>\n    Pitchford\n   </em>\n   were significantly different than those before us in the present case. In\n   <em>\n    Pitchford\n   </em>\n   , the trial court held a hearing, but defense counsel was not given notice that mental competency to stand trial was to be determined at that time.\n   <em>\n    Pitchford\n   </em>\n   , 2010-DR-01032-SCT (Order of February 14, 2013). Here, the trial court outright denied Coleman a hearing and determined that he somehow had waived his right to a competency hearing, despite repeated requests for such a proceeding both before and during trial. In\n   <em>\n    Pitchford\n   </em>\n   , the defendant's competence to stand trial was determined based on a written report from the Mississippi State Hospital; but here, the trial court based its determination of Coleman's competence to stand trial on a four-page summary report.\n   <em>\n    Pitchford\n   </em>\n   , 2010-DR-01032-SCT. We found that, under the facts in\n   <em>\n    Pitchford\n   </em>\n   , where the trial court held a mental competency hearing but did not give notice to defense counsel, a retrospective mental competency hearing was sufficient to guard the defendant's due process rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996715\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the other hand, under the facts in this case, when the trial court simply denied the defendant a hearing, we find that a retrospective mental competency determination does not adequately protect Coleman's due process rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996715\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/161/\">\n    127 So.3d at 167-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 28. The State further contends that Pitchford repeatedly attacks issues that arose prior to his criminal trial in February 2006-issues that should have been raised on direct appeal, such as lack of notice with regard to his competency hearing prior to trial, lack of opportunity to present witnesses and other evidence, and allegations that the trial court's pretrial competency determination was erroneous. The State submits these claims are procedurally barred and/or were nonetheless cured by the May 2015 retrospective competency hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 29. For reasons to be explained, we overrule\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   and those cases in agreement with it that a retrospective competency hearing does not adequately protect a defendant's due process rights. The great of weight of authority holds that such a hearing does not violate a defendant's\n   due process rights when the facts of the case allow for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Competence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 30. It is a violation of due process to try or convict a criminal defendant who is legally incompetent.\n   <em>\n    Pate v. Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171240\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/375/#p378\">\n    383 U.S. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 378,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171240\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/375/#p378\">\n    86 S.Ct. 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171240\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/375/#p378\">\n    15 L.Ed. 2d 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966).

In September 2005, based on an ore tenus motion of the parties, the trial court granted a request to appoint experts at the state hospital to examine Pitchford and \"determine his competency to stand trial and whether or not under the\n   <em>\n    M'Naghten\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   standard he is insane and\n   whether or not under the\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ruling he is [intellectually disabled].\" The order also instructed examination of Pitchford to determine \"any mitigating circumstances[.]\" Pitchford's examination was not conducted until January 11, 2006, due to a backlog of criminal cases assigned to the state hospital for evaluations.

On February 2, 2006, Pitchford's defense counsel filed a lengthy motion for a continuance, requesting additional time to conduct a more \"thorough mitigation investigation\" into Pitchford's \"life history,\" given that this was a death-penalty case.

In line with the requirement(s) recognized in\n   <em>\n    Jaquith\n   </em>\n   and in other similar opinions, we hold that a trial court's competency evaluation order does not in and of itself conclusively (or necessarily) establish, for purposes of Rule 9.06's mandates, or appellate-review purposes, that the trial court had reasonable grounds to believe the defendant was incompetent to stand trial. Such a determination must be made based on the facts and circumstances attending each particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 43. For our purposes here, however, whether reasonable grounds existed when the trial court ordered Pitchford's competency evaluation in 2006 is moot given this Court's 2013 order requiring the trial court to conduct a retrospective competency hearing.

We also find no merit in Pitchford's claim on appeal that the State's experts \"failed to apply the proper standard for competency.\" The 2006 competency evaluation report clearly found, as already mentioned, that: \"Pitchford has the sufficient present ability to consult with an attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding in the preparation of his defense, and that he has a rational as well as a factual understanding of the nature and object of the legal proceedings against him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 57.

For that reason, there is no need to consider, let alone to overrule, the well-established holdings of numerous cases and to overhaul Mississippi's law governing mental competency determinations in criminal cases under Uniform Rule of Circuit and County Court Practice 9.06, with the effect of rolling back protections previously afforded criminal defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   I do agree with the majority's conclusion that the trial court's mental competency determination was not clearly erroneous, and that the State's experts applied the proper standard for mental\n   competence.

Pitchford's challenge to this Court's prior order for a retrospective competency hearing is procedurally barred.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 61. This matter commenced when Pitchford filed, in this Court, his application for leave to proceed in the trial court with a motion for post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-27\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 99-39-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2015). Pitchford made four claims in that application, including (1) that his constitutional rights had been violated because he was not afforded a mental competency hearing; (2) that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial due to racial discrimination by the State during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   ; (3) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel; and (4) that he was denied a fair trial because a juror had concealed material facts that showed the juror's bias. In an order entered on February 14, 2013, this Court found that the second, third, and fourth issues lacked sufficient merit to warrant a hearing. But we found that Pitchford's application should be granted regarding the issue concerning the mental competency hearing. We set forth the following analysis of the issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   [T]he record indicates that the trial judge ordered that Pitchford be evaluated for competency to stand trial, and that an evaluation took place at the Mississippi State Hospital. Pitchford alleges that his counsel appeared before the trial court to argue several pending motions including defendant's motion for a continuance; and that-based upon a written report from the Mississippi State Hospital-the trial judge decided he was competent to stand trial. Pitchford further alleges that his counsel had no prior notice that his competency to stand trial would be adjudicated that day. The State does not dispute these allegations, and this Court finds no evidence in the record before us that notice was provided to the Defendant that his competency to stand trial would be adjudicated on the day of the hearing on pending motions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   This Court has held that, when a trial judge has ordered that a defendant be evaluated for competency to stand trial, Rule 9.06 of the Uniform Rules of Circuit and County Court Practice requires the trial judge to conduct a competency hearing. A Defendant is entitled to reasonable prior notice of the hearing at which competency to stand trial will be decided, so that the defendant will have the opportunity to subpoena witnesses and produce additional information for consideration by the trial judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    Pitchford v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 2010-DR-01032-SCT (Order of Feb. 14, 2013). In granting Pitchford's request for leave to proceed in the trial court on his mental competency issue, we remanded the matter to the Circuit Court of Grenada County for a hearing to determine retroactively whether Pitchford had been mentally competent to stand trial during his February 2006 capital murder trial. We denied his remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 62. Mississippi Code Section 97-39-27 provides that, in granting an application for leave to proceed in the trial court with a motion for post-conviction relief, this Court possesses discretion to \"grant or deny all relief requested in the attached motion.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-27\">\n    Miss.

The February 14, 2013, order reveals that the Court considered the merits of Pitchford's claim regarding the denial of a mental competency hearing and determined that the appropriate remedy under the particular facts presented was a retrospective competency hearing. All other relief requested by Pitchford was denied. In 2015, the retrospective competency hearing occurred, and the trial court entered an order finding that Pitchford had been mentally competent during his 2006 trial and denying the motion for post-conviction relief. Pitchford has appealed that order, and he now requests that this Court reconsider its prior order of a retrospective competency hearing. The problem with this request is that the question of the appropriate relief for the imperfect process in the trial court already has been resolved, and, absent an exception, it cannot be relitigated. When this Court granted Pitchford a retrospective mental competency hearing, we necessarily denied his claim that a new trial was the appropriate remedy for the deficiencies in the trial court proceedings. Under Section 99-39-27(9), claims that are denied are subject to a bar of successive pleadings. Thus, Pitchford cannot raise the issue anew, absent an exception to the procedural bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 64. Section 99-39-27(9) provides that \"excepted from [the bar of successive pleadings] are those cases in which the prisoner can demonstrate either that there has been an intervening decision of the Supreme Court of either the State of Mississippi or the United States that would have actually adversely affected the outcome of his conviction or sentence ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-27\">\n    Miss.

We found that, under the facts in\n   <em>\n    Pitchford\n   </em>\n   , where the trial court held a mental competency hearing but did not give notice to defense counsel, a retrospective mental competency hearing was sufficient to guard the defendant's due process rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996715\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the other hand, under the facts in this case, when the trial court simply denied the defendant a hearing, we find that a retrospective mental competency determination does not adequately protect Coleman's due process rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996715\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/161/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996715\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/161/\">\n    at 167-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 65.\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   clearly distinguished the facts in\n   <em>\n    Pitchford\n   </em>\n   , concluding that the due process concerns inherent in its decision to condemn retrospective mental competency hearings simply were not present in Pitchford's case, in which a hearing had occurred but the problem was lack of notice to the defense.

Op. at \u00b6 40. Thus, the majority jettisons the plain language of Rule 9.06 and simply would return us to the minimum federal constitutional standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Pate\n   </em>\n   , with absolutely no regard for the procedural rule that this Court thoughtfully and conscientiously promulgated to guarantee the constitutional rights of criminal defendants not to be tried while mentally incompetent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 78. The majority likewise pivots on retrospective competency hearings, finding that these hearings, once found to conflict with the requirements of Rule 9.06, now should be permitted \"where there is sufficient data to guarantee reliability\" and \"a meaningful inquiry into the defendant's competence can still be had.\" Maj. Op. at \u00b6 47. The majority bases this decision not on our governing case law, but on an opinion from the Mississippi Court of Appeals and on opinions from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that retrospective mental competency hearings do not offend due process provided certain requisites are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 79.

In its bid to return this Court to pre- Rule 9.06 federal-only constitutional standards, the majority not only ignores the plain language of Rule 9.06, but it neglects the fact that this Court is fully empowered to construe our state constitution and laws to provide greater protections for the rights of the citizenry than those afforded by the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Graves v.

This Court already has determined that, under the plain language of Rule 9.06, the trial court's order for a mental evaluation means that the trial court had reasonable ground to doubt the defendant's mental competence, triggering the requirement for a hearing. And the Court already has determined that retrospective mental competency hearings are inadequate to protect the defendant's due process rights and the procedural guarantees of Rule 9.06.\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996715\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/161/\">\n    127 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   162 ;\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , 149 So.3d at 1035. The Court has no principled reason to revert to prerule standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 80. Another consideration is that the majority's decision implicates the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   . That doctrine provides \"that prior applicable precedent usually must be followed even though the case, if considered anew, might be decided differently\n   by the current court.\" The trial bench and bar have a right to expect consistent decisions from this Court.\n   <em>\n    United Servs. Auto.

The majority makes no finding that our prior interpretation of Rule 9.06 has resulted in pernicious error or that legal reason and justice demand a reduction in the process due to potentially mentally incompetent criminal defendants. In my opinion, one could not so find, because our prior interpretation of Rule 9.06 assured that a criminal defendant whose mental competence has been placed in doubt, as evidenced by a trial court order for a mental evaluation, was afforded the competency hearing necessary to resolve the vital question of whether the defendant was mentally competent to stand trial. And certainly, a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   competency hearing, in which the parties must struggle to establish what the defendant's mental state was in the distant past, affords far less protection than a timely pretrial competency hearing. In my opinion, the majority's decision fails to meet the high burden required to dispense with our longstanding interpretation of Rule 9.06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    E. Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6 82. Pitchford's attempt to reargue the question of the appropriate remedy for the procedural deficiencies in his 2006 pretrial competency determination is procedurally barred because that issue was finally decided by this Court in its order of February 14, 2013, which remanded the case for a retrospective competency hearing. Because the issue is procedurally barred, there is no need to alter, or even to discuss, the law governing mental competency determinations under Rule 9.06, and to do so is both imprudent and harmful. Although I condemn the majority's attempt to overrule eight years of precedent governing mental competency determinations under Rule 9.06, I agree with its decision to affirm the outcome of Pitchford's retrospective competency hearing, but would do so by a different and less disruptive route.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   KING, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    Rule 9.06 has since been replaced by Rule 12 of the Mississippi Rules of Criminal Procedure (effective July 1, 2017).
