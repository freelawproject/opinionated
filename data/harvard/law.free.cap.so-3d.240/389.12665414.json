This appeal stems from the Hinds County Circuit Court's decision to dismiss the plaintiff's claims with prejudice. The circuit court entered its decision after finding that Appellant Victor May willfully concealed his past injuries and accidents, significantly prejudicing the defendants' ability to proceed with their case. After reviewing the circuit court's decision for an abuse of discretion, we find that the circuit court did not err in finding that the plaintiff committed numerous discovery violations which resulted in inordinate delay and increased costs to the defendants. As a result, we affirm the decision of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On April 19, 2011, the vehicles driven by Victor May and Kenneth Austin collided at the intersection of Northside Drive and Hanging Moss Road in Jackson, Mississippi. Claiming that the wreck produced injuries to his neck, lower back, and right shoulder, May filed suit in Hinds County Circuit Court, seeking damages for Austin's alleged negligence in causing the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Shortly after May filed his complaint, the parties engaged in discovery. A\n   year and a half later, the defendants filed a motion requesting that the court dismiss the matter with prejudice, due to May's inconsistent and deliberately false testimony throughout the discovery process. The defendants cited the plaintiff's interrogatory and production responses and compared them to the testimony provided at a later deposition. In these responses, May consistently denied having had any injuries or medical treatment to his neck, lower back, and right shoulder prior to the April 2011 collision. The defense also referenced medical records independently obtained via subpoena from the Kosciusko Medical Clinic, which indicated that the plaintiff not only previously suffered from significant, unrelated injuries to his neck and back, but that he was treated just four months prior to the accident for issues related to his right shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. The circuit court denied the defendants' motion. Noting first that the court held the matter under advisement until this Court ruled on the issues in\n   <em>\n    Kinzie v. Belk Department Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874482\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/974/\">\n    164 So.3d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2015), the trial court reasoned that, much like the decision in\n   <em>\n    Kinzie\n   </em>\n   , dismissal as a sanction for the discovery violations would not be warranted. Although the court found that \"the [p]laintiff's false and/or misleading discovery answers denying any prior injury to his neck or shoulder did constitute a violation of the discovery rules,\" it reasoned that such a violation was not indicative of a motive to engage in a pattern of deception. Rather, the court determined that the plaintiff's willingness to sign a medical release authorization, enabling the defendants to obtain the medical records which conflicted with the plaintiff's testimony, showed that any alleged deception was not intentional. As a result, the court allowed the defendants to move for lesser sanctions but decided that dismissal was not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Within a week, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's order denying their motion to dismiss. Therein, the defense claimed the court errantly based its decision on a misrepresentation by the plaintiff. Citing the court's order, the defendants suggested that the court's decision was largely based on the plaintiff's execution of a medical authorization, which the court determined was at least \"slightly indicative of a lack of motive to engage in a pattern of deception.\" However, the defendants contended that such an authorization was never signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Pointing to Austin's interrogatories, the defendants explained that when the plaintiff was asked to sign a release for his medical records, he blatantly objected to signing any sort of authorization and persistently denied any prior injuries or related medical conditions. The defendants alleged that at no time after this refusal did the plaintiff provide a medical authorization, and that such refusal created hardship and an inability to prepare an adequate defense. Consequently, Austin was forced to subpoena May's medical providers for the information. The defendants claimed that it was only after they obtained May's prior medical records that they learned of his earlier problems and injuries involving his neck, shoulder, and back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. On May 6, 2016, the trial court issued its order granting the defendant's motion for reconsideration. Before describing the time line as it related to the defendant's independent discovery of May's injuries, the trial court explained its understanding of the proposed violations.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   During discovery, the Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    unequivocally denied\n   </em>\n   having ever sustained injuries or having previously sought medical treatment regarding any of those body parts he claimed to be injured solely due to the subject car accident-specifically\n   his neck, lower back and right shoulder. The Defendants subpoenaed Plaintiff May's prior medical records and discovered that May had been untruthful about his medical history. Plaintiff May's lack of candor was clear both under oath in his deposition and in sworn written discovery responses. In addition, after Plaintiff May was caught, his litigation subterfuge continued. In a feeble attempt to excuse his earlier lack of candor in the deposition, Plaintiff May provided a sworn affidavit contradicting portions of his earlier sworn testimony without any explanation as to the inconsistencies, making it impossible for any party, or for this Court, to ascertain which sworn version to believe as true.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court then identified the two issues central to the motion for reconsideration: May's denial of any car accidents, neck injuries, or neck-related treatment prior to the collision with Austin, and the recently discovered medical records related to severe shoulder-pain treatment May had obtained just four months prior to the subject accident. After identifying these concerns, the court used a \"totality of the circumstances\" approach to granting dismissal. Noting first that the plaintiff took an inordinate amount of time to respond to the defendant's original motion to dismiss, the court acknowledged that the plaintiff's eventual response included an affidavit from Victor May. Therein, May swore that he \"voluntarily signed a medical authorization giving [d]efense counsel access to [his] prior records. [He] was not intending to hide or mislead anyone as to [his] prior medical condition.\" Basing its ruling on plaintiff's counsel's representation that May voluntarily had signed a medical authorization so the defendants could obtain his prior records with impunity, the court denied the initial motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8. The trial court noted that it initially found May's assurance that he voluntarily cooperated with the defendant's discovery requests by signing a blank medical authorization to be extremely relevant. May's alleged cooperation in providing this authorization became a deciding factor as to whether the discovery violations had been willful or grossly inadvertent. The court decided that, although May had committed unmistakable discovery violations regarding issues fundamental to the defendants' ability to defend the lawsuit, by providing the medical authorizations, he had demonstrated a lack of motive to engage in a pattern of deception. As a result, the court ruled initially that, if requested, lesser sanctions may be appropriate, but dismissal was not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. Prior to the hearing on the motion for reconsideration, the court considered its previous ruling and the parties' claims regarding the existence of the medical authorization. On August 3, 2015-more than a month prior to the motion's hearing-the court requested that \"the Plaintiff, within ten (10) days from today's date, [ ] submit copies of the medical authorization or authorizations executed by the Plaintiff ... [as] described in the Plaintiff's Response to the Defendant's Motion to Reconsider and at the previous hearing on the original motion [to dismiss].\" May failed to respond to the court's email or provide any additional documentation, as directed. Furthermore, at the hearing on September 28, 2015, plaintiff's counsel admitted that he did not have a copy of any medical authorization allegedly signed by the plaintiff and could not provide any proof that such authorization existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. The trial court noted that a plaintiff is not required to provide a defendant with a signed medical authorization when not specific to a medical provider; though it is routinely done to facilitate the discovery process. With that in mind, May's asserted\n   willingness to assist the defense in the discovery process was a deciding factor in the trial court's initial finding that he lacked intent to conceal any prior injuries or medical conditions from the defendants. After finding that May's \"lies and omissions during discovery ... compounded, rather than mitigated, the factual misrepresentation by the [p]laintiff and his counsel, which ha[ve] now been shown to be false,\" the court found that dismissal with prejudice was \"the only reasonable and sufficient sanction available under these circumstances to end this ongoing pattern of deceit and to deter others from similar, reprehensible conduct in litigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. May appeals the trial court's ruling, claiming that his discovery responses did not justify dismissal of the case, and that the court erred in finding that he lied about executing the medical release for the defendants. Accordingly, the sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court was justified in dismissing the case after making factual findings concerning May's repeated and unequivocal misrepresentations throughout discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12. This Court recognizes the trial court's inherent power to dismiss a case as a \"means necessary for orderly expedition of justice and the court's control of its own docket. Nevertheless, the trial court should dismiss a cause of action for failure to comply with discovery only under the most extreme circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierce v.

The Court reviews such discovery-violation dismissals under the abuse-of-discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/#p1388\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Abuse of discretion is the most deferential standard of review appellate courts employ.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashmore v.

Legal Standard: Discovery Violation Dismissals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14. A trial court's authority to sanction a party for discovery violations is provided for by Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 37. The rule empowers trial courts with the discretionary authority to \"impose upon any party or counsel such sanctions as may be just.\" M.R.C.P. 37. This Court has found that those justified sanctions include the \"death penalty\" of a civil action-dismissal with prejudice-\"when the deterrent value of Rule 37 cannot be achieved by the use of less drastic sanctions.\"\n   <em>\n    Scoggins v. Ellzey Beverages, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11562435\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/743/990/#p996\">\n    743 So.2d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 996 (Miss. 1999) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/#p1388\">\n    688 So.2d at 1389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15. This Court evaluated the application of Rule 37 and the appropriateness of dismissal as a sanction in\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   . There, the plaintiff sought damages from several defendants on the theories of negligence,\n   breach of warranty, and strict liability, after suffering injuries when a fan installed above her bed fell from the ceiling and landed on top of her.\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/#p1388\">\n    688 So.2d at 1387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Throughout discovery, Pierce maintained that she was alone when the fan fell from the ceiling, making her the only witness to the event. However, following a trial on the matter, and the trial court's decision to vacate the jury's verdict, the defense discovered that Pierce was not alone when the fan fell; rather, her male companion was identified as having witnessed the accident as well.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/#p1388\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/#p1388\">\n    at 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16. Pierce responded to the newly discovered information by acknowledging that she had given false testimony. She argued that she never had intended to deceive the court; instead, she intended only to shield her parents from the knowledge that their daughter had entertained an overnight guest that evening. The court reviewed this information and determined that Pierce's \"intentional presentation of false testimony warranted the sanction of dismissal with prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/#p1388\">\n    688 So.2d at 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17. On appeal, this Court adopted the Fifth Circuit's analysis of trial-court discovery violation dismissals. The standard requires that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   First, dismissal is authorized only when the failure to comply with the court's order results from wilfulness or bad faith, and not from the inability to comply. Dismissal is proper only in a situation where the deterrent value of Rule 37 cannot be substantially achieved by the use of less drastic sanctions. Another consideration is whether the other party's preparation for trial was substantially prejudiced. Finally, dismissal may be inappropriate when neglect is plainly attributable to an attorney rather than a blameless client, or when a party's simple negligence is grounded in confusion or sincere misunderstanding of the court's orders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/#p1388\">\n    688 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1389 (citing\n   <em>\n    Batson v.

In applying this analysis, the Court determined that Pierce's failure to comply was a result of willfulness and bad faith, which obstructed the progress of litigation. The Court agreed that less drastic sanctions in the form of fees or procedural mechanisms would not achieve the deterrent value of dismissal. Instead, it found that any sanction other than dismissal for such \"manifestly false\" representations would \"virtually allow the plaintiff to get away with lying under oath without meaningful penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/#p1388\">\n    688 So.2d at 1390-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Since the\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   decision, this Court and the Court of Appeals has applied the above analysis to affirm a myriad of discovery-violation dismissals. Notably, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Scoggins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ashmore\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   reviewed violations similar to those in this case and determined that the trial courts were justified in their decisions to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scoggins v.

While each of these matters concerned unique fact patterns and requests for the Court, their discovery violations embraced a common thread: each plaintiff engaged in a \"pattern of false testimony that struck to the core of the material issues in the lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashmore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922325\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/977/#p982\">\n    148 So.3d at 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20.

However, through medical records later obtained by the defendants, the court learned that Scoggins \"had been examined and/or treated for pain, numbness and/or arthritis in her left leg, back, hip and/or spine on thirty-five separate visits from October 5, 1976, through January 21, 1994.\"\n   <em>\n    Scoggins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11562435\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/743/990/#p996\">\n    743 So.2d at 990-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Likewise, we determined in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   that dismissal of a substituted party-plaintiff was warranted because the plaintiff had signed a false affidavit, committing perjury regarding a key issue. Ferguson claimed that he had no specific recollection of swearing out the affidavit.

Finding that the judge recognized that he was required to impose the least restrictive sanction, this Court determined that dismissal was appropriate in light of Ferguson's conduct and misrepresentation in the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6841396\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/179/1060/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6841396\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/179/1060/\">\n    at 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23. While the\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   factors have been applied to many cases affirming a trial court's dismissal, several have also reversed the trial court's judgment, remanding for the case to move forward. One such case is the recent ruling in\n   <em>\n    Kinzie v. Belk Department Stores, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874482\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/974/\">\n    164 So.3d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2015). There, this Court noted that \"where the discovery violation at issue is less extreme and open to potential truthful interpretations, this Court will not hesitate to reverse a trial court's Rule 37 dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    Kinzie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874482\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/974/\">\n    164 So.3d at 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mindful of this standard, the Court determined that the plaintiff's testimony that he was no longer \"able to enjoy tinkering with automobiles as the stooping, bending, and squatting are painful\" did not merit dismissal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874482\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/974/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court found that the defendant's video footage revealing Kenzie's daily activities of walking around town and working in his shed did not establish \"any\n   kind of pattern of misleading or false responses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874482\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/974/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874482\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/974/\">\n    at 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the Court found that, while \"Kinzie indisputably was injured,\" the \"activity observed by the defendant's undercover video did not ... encompass any of the specific activities that he stated he no longer could perform.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874482\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/974/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874482\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/974/\">\n    at 978-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the Court reversed the trial court's dismissal, noting that, although Kinzie's response was misleading, \"the perceived falsehood arose in an isolated incident, and it certainly has not been established that Kinzie's statements in discovery indicate any kind of pattern of misleading or false responses.\" Under the\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   standard, Kenzie's violation did not result from willfulness or bad faith, making the deterrent value of other sanctions under Rule 37 appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24. Through\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, this Court has advanced a clear and uncomplicated standard under which courts of this state may analyze sanctions for discovery violations. On appeal, we have articulated our standard of review through the cases above, encouraging trial courts to dismiss matters when parties deliberately attempt to subvert the judicial process.\n   <em>\n    Ashmore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922325\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/977/#p982\">\n    148 So.3d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court favors dismissal as a sanction of last resort, although, when a party's failure to comply with the trial court's orders results from willfulness or bad faith, we will not hesitate to affirm.\n   <em>\n    Scoggins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11562435\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/743/990/#p996\">\n    743 So.2d at 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When applying the\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   factors, we must \"stay true and honor the appropriate standard of review,\" allowing the discretionary decisions of a trial judge to stand.\n   <em>\n    Ashmore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922325\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/977/#p982\">\n    148 So.3d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If nothing in the trial record \"suggests an 'arbitrary' or 'clearly erroneous' ruling was made by the learned trial judge, or instills in this Court a 'definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment,' \" we must affirm the dismissal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922325\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/977/#p982\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922325\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/977/#p982\">\n    at 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Applying the Standards to the Dismissal Sanction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25. As detailed above, this Court consistently has held that a \"trial court should dismiss a cause of action for failure to comply with discovery only under the most extreme circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/#p1388\">\n    688 So.2d at 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reviewing a the circuit court's dismissal of May's claims, we find that the plaintiff engaged in a repeated course of misleading conduct by continuously providing false answers and failing to disclose relevant information. As detailed below, when the\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   factors are applied to these facts, we fail to find any error by the trial court in choosing to dismiss the matter for these extreme discovery violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 26. In its order granting dismissal, the trial court thoroughly applied the\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   factors and first asked whether May's discovery violations were the result of willfulness or bad faith. After analyzing various cases handed down by this Court and the Court of Appeals, the trial court found that the facts in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   were even more egregious that those in\n   <em>\n    Ashmore\n   </em>\n   or the recent Court of Appeals opinion,\n   <em>\n    Lockhart v. Stirling Properties, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867489\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/170/1235/\">\n    170 So.3d 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Throughout the interrogatories, requests for production, and deposition, May time and again\n   denied that he had any injuries or medical issues related to those injuries alleged in this suit. After the defense secured medical records from May's physicians, such denials were proved false. Along with other misleading testimony,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court considered this difficulty to provide the truth, particularly as it related to the medical waiver May alleged to have signed. Giving the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt, the court provided May's counsel with ample opportunity to submit the signed waiver to the court as proof of his compliance with the discovery requests. However, at the hearing on the motion for reconsideration, May's counsel explained to the court that he did not have a copy of the waiver, and that it was not his responsibility to keep up with the defendant's correspondence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 27. Without proof of the waiver, May's early refusal to submit a medical authorization and his apparently false affidavit attesting to his previous submission of the form amounted to willful deceit that the court found to be particularly egregious. Taking all of these facts into consideration, the trial court determined that whether the waiver was signed became a factual issue as to the credibility of the two parties. After examining the available testimony and discovery as a whole, the court determined that May's narrative was simply not reliable. We find that the trial court diligently analyzed the first\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   factor and properly determined that-under the facts of the case-May's repeated false answers and failure to disclose relevant information were willful discovery violations made in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28. Moving to the second factor, the trial court then asked whether the deterrent value of Rule 37 could be achieved by lesser sanctions. There, the court determined that the ongoing nature of the lies and omissions regarding the medical authorization by May and his counsel warranted more than a fine or the ability to cross-examine the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, any sanction less than dismissal would fail to discourage such bad-faith litigation conduct in the future. We agree and find that the court's \"decision was not arbitrary, but was based on the law we established.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashmore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922325\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/977/#p982\">\n    148 So.3d at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, under these circumstances, only a dismissal would serve the interest of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 29. Next, the court considered whether the wronged party had suffered prejudice as a result of the discovery violation. In\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that there is no requirement that the \"defendant be substantially prejudiced by the absence of evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/#p1388\">\n    688 So.2d at 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, the trial court squarely addressed the defendants' harm, finding that the defense had been \"significantly prejudiced by the plaintiff's costly refusal to cooperate with the Mississippi Rules of Court[,] namely through the inordinate delay cause[d] by the [p]laintiff's lack of candor and legal gymnastics required for the [d]efendants simply to get basic, crucial information to ably defend the lawsuit.\" While not required, the trial court thoroughly considered the prejudice sustained as a result of May's abuse of the judicial process. We find the court adequately considered prejudice as part of its decision to dismiss and properly assessed the defendants' harm due to May's discovery violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 30. Finally, the court reviewed whether the discovery abuse was attributable solely to trial counsel instead of \"a blameless client.\" While the judge took issue with plaintiff's counsel's role in the \"litigation subterfuge,\" he found May to be anything but blameless for his \"continuous cavalier lack of truthfulness.\" Although the trial court separately found that plaintiff's counsel made binding representations to the court about the medical authorizations signed by his client, we find that May's numerous and unequivocal ongoing lies and omissions about matters central to the litigation left the court and the defendants \"without knowing what they [could] believe.\" As a result, the trial court thoroughly reviewed the fourth\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   factor and properly addressed May's measure of fault in its entry of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 31. Having considered the trial court's application of the\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   factors, we find that the court properly analyzed May's discovery violations, applied appropriate weight to each misrepresentation, and arrived at a justifiable conclusion. As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Scoggins\n   </em>\n   , \"[w]hen this Court reviews a decision that is within the trial court's discretion, it first asks if the court below applied the correct legal standard. If the trial court applied the right legal standard, then this Court will affirm a trial court's decision unless there is a 'definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon weighing of relevant factors.' \"\n   <em>\n    Scoggins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11562435\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/743/990/#p996\">\n    743 So.2d at 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7441172\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/1385/#p1388\">\n    688 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1388 ). Here, the trial court's order granting dismissal labored over the relevant caselaw and the applicable standard, supporting its decision to dismiss. Although the court recognized dismissal with prejudice as a last resort, it discerned no other sanction that might properly deter May or other future plaintiffs from abusing the discovery process with such blatant misrepresentations. Because the trial court's dismissal achieved the appropriate deterrent effect, preventing parties from dodging a meaningful penalty for lying under oath, we affirm the trial court's decision as a reasonable and appropriate ruling under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 37.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashmore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922325\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/977/#p982\">\n    148 So.3d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 32. After determining that Plaintiff May committed various, egregious discovery violations, the trial court properly applied an available Rule 37 sanction and ordered this case dismissed with prejudice. We have held that \"[c]ourts, trial or appellate, should not condone lies or mollify penalties for lying or discourage trial judges from protecting our courts from those who would seek to abuse the judicial process in pursuit of lucre.
