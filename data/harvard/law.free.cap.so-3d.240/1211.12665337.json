Several members of the Collins family sued the City of Newton and several of its officials alleging wrongful termination, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, slander, and reckless disregard of property. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court denied. After a new judge was assigned to the case, the defendants filed a motion for relief or reconsideration of the denial of summary judgment under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 60 ; the trial court granted the Rule 60 relief. The Collinses appeal from the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Discerning no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. The plaintiffs are members of a firefighting family. William Donald Collins Sr. is the patriarch of the family. Mary Collins, Donald's wife, is the matriarch. Donald was a volunteer firefighter with the City of Newton Fire Department for more than thirty years. Mary never has had any type of employment relationship with the Fire Department. Donald and Mary have three adult sons, William Donald \"Donnie\" Collins II, Jay Collins, and Colt Collins. Donnie and Colt were full-time, paid firefighters with the Fire Department in 2012, when the events at issue occurred. Jay also was a full-time, paid, firefighter with the Fire Department and remains so. Colt is married to Lisa Collins, who was a volunteer firefighter with the Fire Department in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. The Collinses claim that problems began in 2009, when the firefighters voted that Donnie be their chief over the then-current Chief Bounds. The Board of Aldermen ratified the vote, and Mayor David Carr vetoed the ratification. The Board overturned Mayor Carr's veto. Mayor Carr obtained an ethics opinion regarding Donnie being his brothers' boss, and the Board then declined to accept Donnie as fire chief. Donnie was made assistant chief and Walter Gordon was hired as chief. After Chief Gordon left, sometime in early 2012, Clarence Parks was hired as chief. On June 20, 2012, Chief Parks distributed a letter to all Fire Department personnel, Mayor Carr, and the Board, declaring every rank, position, and title in the Fire Department vacant, effectively stripping all firefighters of their ranks. Shortly thereafter, around July 3, 2012, Joel Skinner was made interim chief. Skinner is Mary's brother's son; thus he is Donald's and Mary's nephew and first cousin to Donnie and Colt. Around July 5, 2012, after an argument with Skinner in a meeting, Donald was terminated from the Newton Fire Department. On about July 18, 2012, Donnie and Colt were terminated\n   from the Newton Fire Department, and Lisa was terminated about July 23, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. On July 21, 2012, Donald's and Mary's home was struck by lightning, caught fire, and burned. The home was a total loss. No one was injured. The Collinses claim that, during the fire, Interim Chief Skinner did several things incorrectly. Interim Chief Skinner allegedly did not have a sufficient number of firefighters to fight the fire adequately. Furthermore, the Collinses allege that the lack of commanding officers due to the elimination of all ranks led to inadequate firefighting, that Interim Chief Skinner sent firefighters away from the scene of the fire, that he fought the fire from the front when it should have been attacked from the back, that he lacked the experience to be interim chief, and that he ordered several of the Collinses to leave the scene instead of allowing them to help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. In July 2013, Donald and Mary, Donnie, Colt, and Lisa sent notices of claims to the City of Newton. On October 29, 2013, Donald and Mary filed a complaint against the City of Newton, Mayor Carr, former Fire Chief Parks, Former Fire Chief Skinner, three of the aldermen for the City of Newton, and several John Does. In their complaint, Donald and Mary alleged wrongful termination, infliction of emotional distress, slander, and failure to respond properly to the fire at their home. They alleged that, due to the personnel changes, the Fire Department was unable to respond properly to emergencies, thereby endangering the safety of the public and property of the City of Newton. On the same day, Donnie, Colt, and Lisa each filed separate complaints against the same defendants. Each alleged wrongful termination, infliction of emotional distress, and slander. The four cases eventually were consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. After discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment. The trial court, Judge Marcus Gordon presiding, denied the motion. The defendants moved to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59, and the trial court denied the motion. The defendants petitioned the Court for interlocutory appeal, and the Court declined to accept the appeal and remanded the case. Upon remand, Judge Gordon had left the bench. The case was assigned to Judge Vernon Cotten. The defendants then filed a motion for relief from order or reconsideration pursuant to Rule 60. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. The Collinses appeal, arguing that the court erred by revisiting the motion for summary judgment under Rule 60 and by inappropriately revisiting a prior order by another trial judge. They further argued that, even if it was appropriate to revisit the prior order, summary judgment was inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8. The Court reviews legal issues\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Caves v.

Thus, the Court reviews the Rule 60 argument and whether it was appropriate for a successor judge to revisit a prior order\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9. The Collinses argue that if the merits of summary judgment are reached, the Court should review the case under the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard for summary judgment, as the substance of the order is to grant the motion for summary judgment. The defendants argue that the Court should review the case under an abuse of discretion standard, as granting or denying relief under Rule 60 typically is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. Although the standard of review was not specifically discussed, cases with a similar procedural posture have been reviewed under the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   summary judgment standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holland v.

The substance of the order is that it grants the defendants' motion for summary judgment, thus the Court will review the merits under the summary judgment standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. The Court reviews a trial court's grant or denial of summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Crosthwait v. Southern Health Corp. of Houston, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7015684\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/94/1070/#p1073\">\n    94 So.3d 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1073 (Miss. 2012). Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact[.]\" Miss.

The Trial Court's Authority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12. The Collinses argue that Rule 60 applies only to final orders, and that the orders denying the motion for summary judgment were interlocutory in nature. As a result, they argue that it was inappropriate for the trial court to grant relief under Rule 60. They also argue that it was inappropriate for a successor trial judge to reverse the previous trial judge's rulings, citing\n   <em>\n    Amiker v. Drugs for Less, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476221\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/796/942/\">\n    796 So.2d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13. It is true that the Court has stated that Rule 60\"applies only where the judgment or order is final.\"\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8155853\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/3/94/\">\n    3 So.3d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rule 60 provides relief \"from a final judgment, order, or proceeding.\" Miss. R. Civ. P. 60(b). Here, the trial court's reliance on Rule 60 was misplaced. However, the Court has made clear that a trial judge does have authority to revise an order denying summary judgment under Rule 54.\n   <em>\n    Mauck v. Columbus Hotel Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11568530\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/741/259/#p268\">\n    741 So.2d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 268 (Miss. 1999) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8155853\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/3/94/\">\n    3 So.3d at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rule 54 provides that certain interlocutory orders are \"subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\" Miss. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Accordingly, the trial court had authority to revise the order denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8155853\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/3/94/\">\n    3 So.3d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tucker v.

Section 21-31-23 provides that firefighters in the classified civil service have certain procedural rights before they may be terminated in most situations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2021-31-23\">\n    Miss.

The City of Newton does not have a civil service commission and does not fall within the purview of the civil service laws, so the Collinses' argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16. Alternatively, the Collinses argue that the Newton Fire Department Standard Operating Guidelines provide an exception to the at-will employment doctrine. In\n   <em>\n    Bobbitt v. Orchard, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7478816\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/603/356/#p357\">\n    603 So.2d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357 (Miss. 1992), the Court recognized the following exception to the employment at will doctrine:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [W]hen an employer publishes and disseminates to its employees a manual setting forth the proceedings which will be followed in event of an employee's infraction of rules, and there is nothing in the employment contract to the contrary, then the employer will be required to follow its own manual in disciplining or discharging employees for infractions or misconduct specifically covered by the manual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17. The exception created by\n   <em>\n    Bobbitt\n   </em>\n   is a narrow one.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The question in this case is when an employer furnishes its employees a detailed manual stating its rules of employment, and setting forth procedures that will be followed in event of infraction of its rules of employment, can it completely ignore the manual in discharging an employee for an infraction clearly covered by the manual?

At the outset, we are unpersuaded that volunteer firefighters may maintain wrongful termination claims. Such a claim has not been recognized in our State. As to the actual employees, the City of Newton, Mississippi, Employee Policy Handbook unequivocally provided that employment with the City is at will. On the first page following the table of contents, under the heading, \"INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT,\" the Handbook provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   This policy guide is designed to acquaint you with the City of Newton policies and provide you with information about working conditions, employee benefits; and some of the policies affecting your employment. You should read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the handbook. It describes many of your responsibilities as an employee and outlines the programs developed by the City of Newton to benefit employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   No employee policy guide can anticipate every circumstance or question about policy. The need may arise and the City reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policies or portion of the handbook from time to time as it deems\n   appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion, and with or without notice to the employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   NO STATEMENT IN THIS POLICY GUIDE SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AS A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT BETWEEN YOU AND THE CITY OF NEWTON.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Neither the employee nor the City of Newton is bound to continue the employment relationship if either chooses, at its will, to end the relationship at any time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 19. Under the heading \"RESIGNATION AND DISCHARGE,\" the Handbook provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Employees of the City of Newton work at the will of the governing authorities of the City. Discretion to hire and fire is vested in the Department Heads, i.e. the City Clerk, Chief of Police, and Director of Public Works, subject to approval by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen. Since employment with the City of Newton is based on mutual consent, both the employee and the City have the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause, at any time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 20. The Handbook also contained a section titled \"EMPLOYEE CONDUCT AND WORK RULES,\" noting that it is not possible to list all the forms of behavior that are considered unacceptable in the workplace. However, a number of \"examples of infractions of rules of conduct that may result in disciplinary action, up to and including employment termination\" were identified. The section concluded with the following underlined provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Employment with the City of Newton is at the mutual consent of the City: and the employee, and either party may terminate that relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 21. The Guidelines, only portions of which are in the record on appeal, state that their purpose is \"[t]o establish Rules and Regulations for the personnel of the Newton Fire Department that are particular to the Fire Department and which are not included in the City of Newton Personnel Rules and Regulations, and federal or state regulations and statutes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 22. A federal district court, applying Mississippi law, recently addressed an issue similar to the one we face today. Former police officers filed a constitutional claim for deprivation of property without due process against the City of Shelby, Mississippi, following their termination, claiming that, due to the policies and procedures in effect during their employment, they could be discharged only for a legitimate cause and upon recommendation of the police chief.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The City of Shelby argued that the police officers did not have employment contracts with the City of Shelby and therefore their employment was at will.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The City of Shelby also argued that, even if the policies were in place at the time of the police officers' terminations, the police officers still would not have a property interest because the City of Shelby Employee Handbook stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   There is no contract of employment between the City and any one or all of its employees.

Because Donald and Mary do not allege that the actions fighting the fire endangered the safety\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   well-being of any person, their claim is subject to immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 41. Donald and Mary also allege in their complaint that certain fire department personnel decisions recklessly disregarded the safety and well-being of the public. While it may be true under some circumstances that personnel decisions could recklessly disregard the safety of the public, the allegation, without more, simply does not create a genuine issue of material fact that the defendants acted with reckless disregard under the high standard required. They do not demonstrate any facts that would create a genuine issue of material fact that the personnel decisions at issue went beyond alleged negligence and \"embrace[d] willful or wanton conduct which requires knowingly and intentionally doing a thing or wrongful act.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7058921\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/18/246/#p249\">\n    18 So.3d at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted).

The Collinses argue that the Newton Fire Department Standard Operating Guidelines (\"Guidelines\") provide an exception to the at-will employment doctrine. One exception to the at-will doctrine is where an employee manual creates a contractual obligation.\n   <em>\n    Bobbitt v. Orchard, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7478816\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/603/356/#p357\">\n    603 So.2d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 46. Donald Collins testified that he signed something stating he would follow the Guidelines, that he was familiar with some of the Guidelines, and that the standard procedure for terminating a firefighter, paid or volunteer, was to issue oral and written warnings first.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also testified that he had received Christmas bonuses, but did not receive regular compensation\n   or benefits. Lisa testified that the volunteers had a certain procedure that was followed to hire and terminate volunteers, and that procedure was not followed with her termination. She further testified that she had applied for permanent positions with the Fire Department and had been passed over for males, despite scoring higher than the males on both physical and written assessments. When she was terminated as a volunteer, she was in the process of obtaining her official certification as a volunteer firefighter with the Fire Academy, and was unable to continue that. She also testified that her plan was to be a full-time firefighter, and that \"you need to have experience as a volunteer to be high on a list of getting hired as a full-time employee with the Fire Department. The more experience you have as a volunteer, the better your chances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 47. Donnie testified that the Fire Department followed the disciplinary procedures in the Guidelines for terminating personnel and that it was communicated to the firefighters that these were the rules the Fire Department and its personnel abided by. Colt also testified that the procedure for termination included a verbal and then a written warning, then suspension, then termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 48. The City of Newton Employee Policy Handbook (\"Handbook\") provides that \"NO STATEMENT IN\n   <em>\n    THIS POLICY GUIDE\n   </em>\n   SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AS A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT BETWEEN YOU AND THE CITY OF NEWTON.\" (Emphasis added.) At least two other provisions provide that employment with the City is at-will, with one stating that employees \"work at the will of the governing authorities of the City. Discretion to hire and fire is vested in the Department Heads, i.e. the City Clerk, Chief of Police, and Director of Public Works, subject to approval by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 49. The Guidelines state that their purpose is \"To establish Rules and Regulations for the personnel of the Newton Fire Department that are particular to the Fire Department and which are not included in the City of Newton Personnel Rules and Regulations, and federal or state regulations and statutes.\" The Guidelines apply to all Fire Department personnel, with personnel including \"all persons, uniformed and non-uniformed, volunteers and employed by the City of Newton Fire Department.\" The Guidelines require all personnel to obey all laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, and orders, \"and any violations may be sufficient cause for\n   <em>\n    disciplinary action\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) They provide that non-compliance with the department rules and regulations \"will not be tolerated\" and that \"[t]hose personnel committing such infractions will be subject to\n   <em>\n    disciplinary actions\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) The Guidelines then outline \"Standardized Disciplinary Actions.\" For tardiness, uniform violation, safety violation, and all other general rules and regulations violations, \"to be issued for individual violations with no more than 12 during a career[,]\" the first offense receives a \"[d]ocumented verbal warning/coaching/counseling session.\" A second offense receives a \"[w]ritten reprimand.\" The third offense receives one \"shift suspension without pay.\" The fourth offense warrants suspension without pay for three shifts. The fifth offense receives termination. Other disciplinary procedures are outlined for fighting and DUI. Nothing in the provisions of the Guidelines placed in the record\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   contains an express disclaimer\n   that the Guidelines did not affect the employer's right to terminate the employee at will. Nor does the Handbook contain an express disclaimer that other policy documents outside the Handbook itself would not affect the employer's right to terminate the employee at will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 50. In\n   <em>\n    Bobbitt\n   </em>\n   , the Court emphasized that the employee manual containing the disciplinary procedures did not contain any \"express disclaimer or contractual provision that the manual did not affect the employer's right to terminate the employee at will[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Bobbitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7478816\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/603/356/#p357\">\n    603 So.2d at 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, nothing in the record indicates that the Guidelines expressly reserve the right to terminate the employee at will. Moreover, the Handbook only provides that nothing in that particular employee handbook affects the at-will nature of the employment. It did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   expressly state that any other department policies or guidelines would similarly not affect the at-will employment. In\n   <em>\n    Bobbitt\n   </em>\n   , the employer pointed to a sentence in the application for employment that stated \"I understand that the first three months of employment will be considered as a period of probation and that my employment and compensation may be terminated with or without notice at any time....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7478816\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/603/356/#p357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 362 n.1. The Court found that \"[t]his sentence, at the very best, creates for [the employer] an ambiguity from which it will argue at full trial that it applied to long time employment and not just the first ninety days. The ambiguity itself, however, removes this case from a summary judgment posture[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7478816\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/603/356/#p357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Senseney v.

Ct. App. 2005) (The exception did not apply to personnel guidelines regarding discipline where the employment application explicitly stated that \"I also understand and agree that nothing in this employment application, in the Company's policy statements, personnel guidelines or employee handbook is intended to create ... an employment contract between the Company and me. I understand and agree that employment with the Company will be on an at-will basis[.]\" The court noted the\n   <em>\n    express\n   </em>\n   disclaimer, with the application specifically referring to the personnel guidelines that contained the disciplinary procedures.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 51. \"[T]he general rule is that where a contract is ambiguous and uncertain, questions of fact are presented which are to be resolved by the trier of facts, and the granting of summary judgment is inappropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Shelton v. American Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11976512\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/507/894/#p896\">\n    507 So.2d 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 896 (Miss. 1987). The Handbook does not explicitly reserve the right to terminate employment at will with regard to the Fire Department Guidelines or any other documents outside of the handbook itself. And the provisions of the Guidelines placed into the record before this Court do not explicitly reserve the right to terminate at will. The Guidelines applied to all personnel, compensated and volunteer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the record before the Court, whether the Guidelines created a contract or whether the right to terminate at will was effectively reserved is ambiguous. It is likely that consideration of extrinsic evidence is necessary, and \"resolution of any uncertainties will be against the drafter of the contract[,]\" which in this case is the City.\n   <em>\n    Dalton v. Cellular South, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7059531\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/20/1227/#p1232\">\n    20 So.3d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1232 (Miss. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 52. A plaintiff need not prove his case to survive summary judgment; he need only create a genuine issue of material fact. Neither the Handbook nor the Guidelines specifically refer to one another. As such, when construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Collinses, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the Guidelines created a contract and thus whether Donnie, Colt, Donald, and Lisa had a right to the disciplinary procedures outlined in the Guidelines. Therefore, summary judgment on the wrongful termination claims was inappropriate, and I would reverse the trial court on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   KITCHENS, P.J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The defendants did ask Donald about some Fire Department \"Rules and Regulations\" that allegedly provide that volunteers can be terminated at any time. However, these rules and regulations are not in the record. The defendants also cite in their brief to a Guideline provision requiring that Fire Department personnel acquaint themselves with the City of Newton rules and regulations, yet, that Guideline provision is not in the record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    It appears that only portions of the Guidelines were placed in the record, rather than the complete Guidelines.
