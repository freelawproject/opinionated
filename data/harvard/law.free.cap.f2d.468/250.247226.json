Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b316-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b316-23\">This is an appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to vacate judgment and sentence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Antonio Prieto-Morejon, a federal prisoner. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-24\">The appellant was convicted upon trial by jury of conspiracy to unlawfully import narcotic drugs <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and of aiding and abetting the unlawful importation of narcotics.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was sentenced to serve two concurrent 10-year prison terms. On direct appeal the judgment was affirmed, sub nom. United States v. Gonzalez-Perez, 5th Cir. 1970, 426 F.2d 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-25\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion the appellant alleged generally that at his trial the District Court had erred in its instruction on possession of the narcotics. The district court denied relief on grounds that matters involving instructions should have been raised on the direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-26\">In his motion for rehearing, the applicant particularized his allegation. He contended therein that the District Court erred in instructing the jury as to the presumption contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 relative to the cocaine which was seized. This obviously is more than merely an allegation of improper jury instructions. See Turner v. United States, 1970, 396 U.S. 398, 90 S.Ct. 642, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>24 L.Ed.2d 610. The district court made no ruling on this specific contention, but granted leave to appeal <em>in forma pauper-is. </em>Appellant makes the same contention on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">As the Government\u2019s brief points out, the transcript of the jury instructions shows that the court did not in fact charge the jury concerning the presumption stated in \u00a7 174. The appellant apparently fell into error on this point due to his not having a copy of the transcript available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Our examination of the entire charge given to the jury has convinced us that the district court fully and fairly instructed the jury on the applicable law. The district court\u2019s denial of \u00a7 2255 relief to this appellant is due to be and is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-17\">.
