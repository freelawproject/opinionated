Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(b), (d). Since the plaintiff failed to file such a demand, the district court properly denied the motion for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-23\">The granting of a continuance is a matter which lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the district court\u2019s ruling on such motion will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion. Montgomery v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 367 F.2d 917 (9 Cir. 1966). The plaintiff sought a continuance to enable him to contact material witnesses, but the record reveals that he had neither interviewed nor subpoenaed any of these in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>dividuals. The record further indicates that plaintiff knew nothing of the testimony he expected to elicit from these witnesses, and under these circumstances it is manifestly clear that the district judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">District courts have \u201csound judicial discretion\u201d to dismiss an action for \u201cplaintiff\u2019s failure to prosecute it with reasonable diligence * * Timmons v. United States, 194 F.2d 357 (4 Cir. 1952). The plaintiff had ample opportunity to develop evidence in support of his case, but he neither interviewed not subpoenaed witnesses whose whereabouts he knew. Furthermore, the plaintiff himself declined to testify. The district court\u2019s dismissal of the action finds strong support in the record and was well within the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">The decision whether to grant or deny a new trial is also a discretionary matter with the trial court. Hopkins v. Coen, 431 F.2d 1055 (6 Cir. 1970); United States for Use and Benefit of Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Bucon Construction Company, 430 F.2d 420 (5 Cir. 1970). In his motion for a new trial the plaintiff asserted that he had discovered new evidence and that he had been prejudiced by reason of bias on the part of the trial judge. However, the plaintiff refused to disclose his newly discovered evidence to the court, implying that he feared such disclosure might result in intimidation of his material witnesses. This conduct on the part of the plaintiff made it impossible for the district court to appraise the alleged new evidence as a ground for granting a new trial. The plaintiff\u2019s contention that the trial court was biased finds no support whatever in the record. Accordingly, we find that the district court acted properly in denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">Finding no error in the challenged rulings, the action of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
