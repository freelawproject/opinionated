Until February 17, 1965, Supreme\u2019s 87% outstanding shares of stock were owned solely by R. D. Kellogg. On that date R. D. Kellogg sold to his attorneys, Thomas W. Leigh and Robert L. Curry, ten shares each of his Supreme stock at $250 per share. On February 22, 1965, Supreme redeemed 57% shares of stock from R. D. Kellogg, so that its remaining thirty shares of stock were equally divided among Kellogg, Curry, and Leigh. Then, on February 26, 1965, Supreme purchased from Robert L. Kellogg, the son of R. D. Kellogg, all the shares of CKS Corporation (CKS). CKS was a Louisiana corporation, originally incorporated in 1953, which, like Supreme, was domiciled and doing business in Ouachita Parish.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Supreme elected to liquidate CKS, its wholly owned subsidiary, on April 19, 1965. Certain assets of CKS, including a promissory note dated July 31, 1956, and drawn by Star Motel, Inc. (the predecessor of CKS) to the order of-CKS, were transferred under date of April 26, 1965 to Supreme in consideration for Supreme\u2019s surrender of its CKS stock and its assumption of certain liabilities due and owing by CKS. As part of this transaction, the taxpayer assumed a $125,000 note payable to R. D. Kellogg by his son, Robert Kellogg. CKS had been reporting its gain on the Star Motel note, which had a principal amount of $400,000 with 4 percent interest per annum until paid, on the installment method authorized by \u00a7 453 of the Internal Revenue Code, whereby the gain realized is recognized ratably over the period of collections upon the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">At the heart of this controversy is- a dispute over the basis Supreme should properly assign to the Star Motel installment obligation. Supreme determined its basis for the Star Motel note by reference to its allocable cost for the CKS stock, together with the liabilities which it assumed from CKS, arriving at a figure of $204,235.37. The Commissioner determined that, instead of using a cost basis, Supreme should have carried over the same basis for the note as it had in the hands of CKS. The basis of the note in the hands of CKS was $121,639.-80. Consequently the Commissioner assessed a deficiency against Supreme in the amount of $852 for its taxable fiscal year ending November 30, 1965, representing the tax allegedly due on amounts Supreme received in part payment of the Star Motel note plus interest. After its claim for a refund was denied, Supreme brought suit in district court. The district court held in favor of the Commissioner, concluding that Supreme should have used a carryover rather than a cost basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">On this appeal Supreme contends that it is compelled by \u00a7\u00a7 332,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 334(b)(2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>and 381 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Internal Revenue Code to determine its basis in the installment obligation by reference to its allocable cost for CKS stock. The Government counters by asserting that the transaction in question was nothing more than a tax avoidance scheme and that \u00a7 269 therefore requires Supreme to use the lower basis, regardless of the rules laid down in other sections of the Code. Tax avoidance would result from the fact that under \u00a7 453(d)(4), as then applicable,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> CKS would not recognize any gain on distribution of the installment obligation in liquidation. If Supreme were permitted to use its cost basis, $83,000 higher than CKS\u2019s basis, that $83,000 of income would ultimately escape taxation altogether. The Government stresses the attorney-client and fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ther-son relationships among the principals and the careful consideration given to tax consequences in structuring this transaction. The Government maintains that the principal purpose of the acquisition and liquidation of CKS was to obtain this tax benefit and that therefore \u00a7 269 operates to deny the claimed tax benefit. Even if \u00a7 269 does not apply, the Government further argues that the same result is mandated by \u00a7 1001(d) and by general principles of taxati\u00f3n. Supreme denies that the principal purpose of the transaction was tax avoidance, alleging instead that its principal purpose was to acquire a leasehold interest owned by CKS.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Supreme further argues that \u00a7 269 is inapplicable on its face, regardless of the purpose of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The district court held that \u00a7 269 was broad enough to apply to the facts of this case, and went on to find that Supreme\u2019s \u201cprincipal purpose\u201d in acquiring and liquidating CKS was tax avoidance. Since we hold that \u00a7 269 is inapplicable, we do not reach the district court\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The predecessor to \u00a7 269 was \u00a7 129 of the 1939 Code, enacted in the Revenue Act of 1943, 58 Stat. 47 (1934). Its prime aim was to discourage corporations with large excess profits from the practice of trading in loss corporations or corporations with excess profits tax credits as a means of tax avoidance. See 7 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 38.65 (1967); Rudick, Acquisitions to Avoid Income or Excess Profits Tax: Section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code, 58 Harv.L.Rev. 196 (1944); Peter Pan Seafoods, Inc. v. United States, 9 Cir.1969, 417 F.2d 670, 674; S.Rep. No. 627, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. 58 (1944), 1944 Cum.Bull. 1016; Zanesville Investment Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 6 Cir.1964, 335 F.2d 507, 509. Both its language and legislative history suggest that it was intended to reach a wide variety of tax avoidance schemes. Section 269 was not designed to enumerate any one particular type of tax avoidance device, but rather was intended to condemn such devices \u201cin whatever form they may appear.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 871, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943), 1944 Cum.Bull. 973, 1017. See Borge v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2d Cir.1968, 405 F.2d 673, 678, cert. denied sub nom. Danica Enterprises, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1969, 395 U.S. 933, 89 S.Ct. 1994, 23 L.Ed.2d 448. The Commissioner has taken a broad view of the section\u2019s scope. Thus the Regulations define \u201callowance\u201d under \u00a7 269 to include \u201canything in the internal revenue laws which has the effect of diminishing tax liability.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.269-1 (a) (1962). See also 7 Mertens \u00a7 38.66; James Realty Co. v. United States, 8 Cir.1960, 280 F.2d 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\"> In view of the apparently deliberate breadth of the language of \u00a7 269 we do not think that a mechanical reading of the section can resolve the issues before us. As this Court said in Bobsee Corp. v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 231, 234; \u201c[W] hat ever else may be said of this provision, its applicability or inapplicability is eertain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ly not revealed by a mere reading of the statutory language.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"> Our rejection of a mechanical, literal approach to \u00a7 269 does not mean that we think that \u00a7 269 is broad enough to reach the facts of this ease. Section 269 was not intended to condemn every acquisition resulting in a tax saving. Zanesville Investment Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 6 Cir. 1964, 335 F.2d 507, 510. We think that \u00a7 269 must be read in light of the other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which it was designed to supplement. The Senate Finance Committee Report accompanying \u00a7 129 of the 1939 Code made clear that the section was to be read with a view to Congressional policies embodied in specific deductions or exemptions. The test whether \u00a7 129 was applicable to a given transaction was that stated in Higgins v. Smith, 1940, 308 U.S. 473, 60 S.Ct. 355, 84 L.Ed. 406: \u201cwhether the transaction or a particular factor thereof \u2018distorts the liability of the particular taxpayer\u2019 when the \u2018essential nature\u2019 of the transaction or factor is examined in the light of the \u2018legislative plan\u2019 which the deduction or credit is intended to effectuate.\u201d S.Rep. No. 627, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943), 1944 Cum.Bull. 1016, 1017. A similar statement has been embodied in the Regulations. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.269-2(b) (1962). There is no tax avoidance, in other words, and no occasion for applying \u00a7 269, when a taxpayer determines its tax liability in accordance with the rules specified by Congress, and pays the tax Congress intended it should pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Thus \u00a7 269 has been held inapplicable to deny taxpayers certain tax benefits which Congress plainly intended that they should enjoy. The Commissioner ruled that creation of a \u201cWestern Hemisphere trade corporation\u201d under \u00a7 109 of the 1939 Code<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was not tax avoidance within the meaning of \u00a7 129 of the 1939 Code, even though done for the principal purpose of obtaining tax savings, since the tax benefit was consistent with the Congressional plan. I.T. 3757, 1945 Cum.Bull. 200. In A. P. Green Export Co. v. United States, 1960, 284 F.2d 383, 151 Ct.Cl. 628, the Court of Claims reaffirmed the Commissioner\u2019s ruling. In Alinco Life Ins. Co. v. United States, 1967, 373 F.2d 336, 178 Ct.Cl. 813, the Court of Claims doubted .that \u00a7 269 would be applicable to deny tax credits granted by \u00a7 801 of the Code to companies qualifying as life insurance compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>nies, finding a Congressional intent to confer the benefits regardless of the taxpayer\u2019s purpose. 373 F.2d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">We think that the web of statutory provisions governing this particular transaction prevents the Commissioner from using \u00a7 269 to make an exception to the cost basis rule of \u00a7 334(b)(2). Congress has given thorough and detailed attention to the problems encountered in distributions of installment obligations in corporate liquidations. Section 337 specifically includes installment obligations within the definition of the term \u201cproperty\u201d. Section 336 specifically excepts installment obligations from its general rules for determining gain or loss, referring to the special rules of \u00a7 453(d). At the time of the transaction in this case, \u00a7 453(d)(4) specifically exempted the distributing corporation\u2014 here CKS \u2014 from recognition of gain with respect to installment obligations. Congress drew careful lines which admit of no exceptions. See Bijou Park Properties, Inc., 1966, 47 T.C. 207, 214-215, acquiesced in, 1968-2 Cum.Bull. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">With respect to the receiving corporation, the position of Supreme in this case, the statutory rules are even clearer. The liquidation of CKS met all the requirements of \u00a7 334(b)(2). Section 334(b)(2) is a codification of principles derived from the decision in Kimbell-Diamond Milling Co., 1950, 14 T.C. 74, aff\u2019d per curiam, 5 Cir.1951, 187 F.2d 718, cert. denied, 1951, 342 U.S. 827, 72 S.Ct. 50, 96 L.Ed. 626. See S.Rep. No. 1622, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess. 257 (1954). The <em>Kimbell-Diamond </em>ease held that a purchase of a corporation\u2019s stock in order to obtain its assets should be treated as a direct purchase of the assets, with the consequence that the cost of the stock should serve as the basis for the assets. In codifying the <em>KimbellDiamond, </em>rule Congress made a major change: it substituted a series of objective tests in place of a determination of the taxpayer\u2019s subjective intent to obtain corporate assets. Section 334(b)(2) is therefore a mandatory rather than an elective provision, and it may apply even in cases where the taxpayer\u2019s intent is not to obtain the underlying assets of a corporation but to purchase and maintain the corporate structure. See Rev.Rul. 60-262, 1960-2 Cum.Bull. 114; Kansas Sand and Concrete Inc., 1971, 56 T.C. 522, 1971; United States v. M.O.J. Corp., 5 Cir.1960, 274 F.2d 713. The express requirements of \u00a7 334(b)(2) are, moreover, reinforced by \u00a7 381(a)(1), which explicitly denies to the receiving corporation in a \u00a7 334(b)(2) liquidation the use of certain carryovers, including the carryover basis on installment obligations otherwise permitted by \u00a7 381(e)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">We think that the mandatory and objective provisions of \u00a7 334(b)(2), buttressed by 381(a)(1), as applied to this case leave no room for the Commissioner to insert \u00a7 269 to require Supreme to use a carryover basis. To require Supreme to run the gantlet of \u00a7 269 would be to reintroduce into \u00a7 334(b)(2) the always troublesome and volatile element of subjective intent which Congress sought to eliminate. Our conclusion that Supreme correctly used its allocable cost for CKS stock as its basis is reinforced by the amendment to \u00a7 453(d)(4)(A), enacted by \u00a7 202(c) of the Foreign Investors Tax Act, P.L. 89-809, 80 Stat. 1539 (1966). Section 453(d)(4)(A) as amended provides that a corporation distributing an installment obligation in a \u00a7 332 liquidation will be entitled to nonrecognition only when the receiving corporation determines its basis under \u00a7 334(b)(1).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus gain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>would be recognized to the distributing corporation where, as here, the receiving corporation determines its basis under \u00a7 334(b)(2). It is significant that this amendment was made to operate only prospectively.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This is further evidence that Congress did not intend to disturb the tax benefit which Supreme obtained; had Congress intended to impose a tax on this transaction, it probably would have made the amendment retrospective. See Cherry v. United States, 1967, C.D. Cal., 264 F.Supp. 969, 980. Moreover, in foreclosing for the future any escape of installment obligations from taxation in \u00a7 332 liquidations, Congress imposed a tax on the liquidating subsidiary, rather than requiring the receiving parent corporation to use the subsidiary\u2019s basis. Had the liquidation of CKS occurred after the amendment to \u00a7 453(d) (4) (A), then, CKS, not Supreme, would have paid the tax which the Government here seeks to impose on Supreme. Supreme would still have been required to take a cost basis. Thus Congress carefully preserved intact the rules of \u00a7 334(b)(2) for determining basis. The Government in this case does not appear to have attempted to assess any tax against CKS for the distribution of the installment obligation. But it does not follow, in view of what we have said, that \u00a7 334(b) (2) should be ignored and Supreme required to pay the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Our decision is consistent with the holdings of other courts which have faced similar questions. In Cherry v. United States, 1967, C.D.Cal., 264 F.Supp. 969, the court, confronting essentially the same problem we confront here, held \u00a7 269 inapplicable since it found no principal purpose of tax avoidance. The court went on, however, in a lengthy dictum to suggest that \u00a7 269 would have been inapplicable regardless of purpose, reasoning that the terms \u201cdeduction, credit, or other allowance\u201d did not include nonrecognition <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that the stepup in basis was a benefit otherwise obtainable under the rule of Cromwell Corp., 1964, 43 T.C. 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">In Blueberry Land Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir.1966, 361 F.2d 93, we affirmed a Tax Court holding that two distributing corporations were taxable on the subsequent sale of installment obligations after liquidation. It was held there that the acquisition and liquidation were shams, and that these steps could therefore be disregarded and the whole transaction considered a sale by the distributing corporations. See Commissioner of Internal Revenue, v. Court Holding Co., 1945, 324 U.S. 331, 65 S.Ct. 707, 89 L.Ed. 981; Gregory v. Helvering, 1935, 293 U.S. 465, 55 S.Ct. 266, 79 L.Ed. 596. But <em>Blueberry </em>is distinguishable from the ease before us. There the intermediate parent corporation was a mere shell, with only $202 in capitalization, and negotiations for a sale of assets had been carried out well before the course of acquisition and liquidation was adopted. Thus in substance the transaction did not come within the provisions of \u00a7 332'. But, as this Court said in <em>Blueberry, </em>\u201ceach case must be decided on its own merits by examining the form and substance of the transaction and the purpose of the relevant tax provisions to determine whether recognition of the form of the transaction would defeat the statutory purpose.\u201d 361 F.2d at 101. Here no question is raised as to the viability of either Supreme or CKS, or as to the bona fides of any of the shareholders.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>think that there has been full compliance with \u00a7 332 and \u00a7 334(b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The Tax Court in Bijou Park Properties, Inc., 1966, 47 T.C. 207, acquiesced in, 1968-2 Cum.Bull. 1, held that the receiving parent corporation in that case was required to use the distributing corporation\u2019s basis. This holding was based on a finding that one of the shareholders of the parent corporation was not a bona fide shareholder. This resulted in the applicability of the attribution provisions of \u00a7 318(a). Consequently \u00a7 334(b)(3) came into play,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and \u00a7 334(b)(2) could not apply since therefore there was no \"purchase\u201d as required by \u00a7 334(b)(2)(B). Section 334(b)(3) cannot apply in the present case, however, since by stipulation the parties have agreed that all shareholders in fact owned the shares of stock they purported to own, and no argument is made that the attribution provisions of \u00a7 318(a) are otherwise applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The Government further argues that, despite Supreme\u2019s literal compliance with \u00a7 334(b)(2), Supreme is required to use a carryover basis even if \u00a7 269 is inapplicable. As support for this contention, the Government first advances the fundamental principle of taxation that whenever gain is not recognized on an exchange of property, the transferee must carry over the transfer- or\u2019s basis to prevent any gain from escaping tax. We do not think that this general rule can be permitted to override a specific statutory exception. It is true that a carryover basis is usually a concomitant of nonrecognition. See 3A Mertens \u00a7 21.02. But it is also true .that a transferee is only required to use the transferor\u2019s basis when the transaction falls squarely within a statutory provision requiring a carryover basis; otherwise the transferee may use its cost as a basis. See, e.g., Citizens Fidelity Bank and Trust Co., 1956 P.H Tax Ct.Mem.Dec. \u00b6 56,162, dismissed on stipulation, 6 Cir.1957, 245 F.2d 243. Moreover, while it may be a general rule that a carryover basis accompanies nonrecognition, it is by no means a universal rule. A taxpayer acquiring property from a decedent under \u00a7 1014 takes not the decedent\u2019s basis but, instead, a basis equal to the fair market value of the property at the time of death. Finally, we must remember that Congress, not the courts, bears the responsibility for establishing the rules of taxation. In deriving governing principles the courts must look to what Congress has done, as long as Congress has acted within its powers. We are not prepared to employ broad principles to frustrate specific statutory language. See Dorba Homes, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir.1968, 403 F.2d 502, 506. For similar reasons we are unpersuaded by the Government\u2019s further contention that permitting Supreme to use an allocable cost basis would subvert the general principles of installment accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">The Government also contended below that the provisions of \u00a7 1001(d) of the Code forbid application of \u00a7 334(b)(2) in this case. The district court did not reach this issue, since it disposed of the case under \u00a7 269. The Government renews this contention on appeal. We reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">Section 1001(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-13\">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent (in the case of prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>erty sold under contract providing for payment in installments) the taxation of that portion of any installment payment representing gain or profit in the year in which such payment is received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Section 1001(a) establishes the rules for computation of gain or loss on a \u201csale or other disposition\u201d of property. Gain is to be the amount realized less the adjusted basis provided in \u00a7 1011. For determining the adjusted basis \u00a7 1011 refers in turn to \u00a7 1012, which states that basis shall be cost \u201cexcept as otherwise provided in this subchapter or subchapter C.\u201d Supreme seeks to determine its adjusted basis by referring to \u00a7 334(b)(2) in subchapter C. The Government contends that the \u201cadjusted basis\u201d referred to in \u00a7 1001(a) cannot be determined by \u00a7 334(b)(2) through this chain of references, since to do this would be to read \u00a7 1001 in such a way as to prevent \u201cthe taxation of that portion of any installment payment representing gain or profit in the year in which such payment is received,\u201d in contravention of \u00a7 1001(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">On its face, however, \u00a7 1001(d) does not establish rules for the computation of basis, but rather makes an exception to the general rule of \u00a7 1001 that gain is taxable in the year of sale. See 2 Mertens \u00a7 15.01 &amp; n. 2. Nor do we find any warrant in the legislative history of \u00a7 1001(d) for reading it broadly to prohibit the application of \u00a7 334(b)(2) to this transaction. Section 1001(d) was originally adopted as \u00a7 202(f) of the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227. The purpose of this section was explained in the Conference Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">The amendment also provides that nothing in the section relating to the basis for determining gain or loss shall be construed to prevent (in the case of property sold under contract providing for payment in installments) the taxation of that portion of any installment payment representing profit in the year in which the payment is received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">H.Rep. No. 486, 67th Cong., 1st Sess. 18 (1924), 1939-1 Cum.Bull. (Part 2) 210. This may likewise be read to indicate a Congressional purpose simply to except installment obligations from the usual rule that gain, representing the excess of the amount realized over the adjusted basis, will be taxed in the year of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">This reading is supported by the legislative history of subsequent amendments to \u00a7 202 of the 1921 Act, which indicates that the principal purpose of that section was to accord recognition to the right to report income on the installment basis, a right not theretofore recognized by the tax laws. See S.Rep. No. 52, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. 19 (1925), 1939-1 Cum.Bull. (Part 2) 346-47; H.Rep. No. 356, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. 32 (1926), 1939-1 Cum.Bull. (Part 2) 363. Moreover, if the purpose of the predecessor of \u00a7 1001(d) was to ensure that all \u201cprofit\u201d on installment obligations would be taxed, Supreme arguably will have made no \u201cprofit\u201d on its installment obligation until it receives income in excess of its allocable cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">Finally, we think that the action of Congress in amending \u00a7 453(d)(4)(A) to tax the distributing corporation on installment obligations in a \u00a7 334(b)(2) liquidation prevents us from giving \u00a7 1001(d) the broad reading which the Government urges. If Congress had thought that \u00a7 1001(d) operated to impose a tax in every such case, it would have thought it unnecessary to amend \u00a7 453(d)(4)(A) to ensure that a tax was assessed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> If we read \u00a7 1001(d) as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Government suggests, in other words, the amendment to \u00a7 453(d)(4)(A) would be rendered redundant. Such a result would be contrary to the well-established principle of statutory construction that, where another interpretation is permissible, courts will not construe a statute to make it redundant, absent a clear legislative purpose to the contrary. See Singer v. United States, 1945, 323 U.S. 338, 65 S.Ct. 282, 89 L.Ed. 285. We therefore conclude that the slender statutory reed of \u00a7 1001(d) cannot bear the weight which the Government seeks to place on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In sum, we hold that the taxpayer, Supreme, could' use the cost of the CKS stock in determining its basis for the assets received upon liquidation of CKS, in accordance with Sections 332, 334(b) (2) and 381(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The judgment of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-13\">.

The leasehold interest was an asset of CKS. CKS was paying a rental of $700 a month on the property, which it was subleasing for a total rental of $1300 per month.

We are thus unpersuaded by Supreme\u2019s argument that \u00a7 269 on its face can apply only to deny allowances, credits or deductions which were somehow possessed by the acquired corporation and transferable to the acquiring corporation. Indeed, courts have frequently held that \u00a7 269 is applicable regardless of whether the deduction, credit or allowance producing the tax benefit was possessed by the acquiring corporation or the acquired corporation. See, e. g., F. C. Publication Liquidating Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 779; Thomas E. Snyder Sons Co. v. Commissioner, 7 Cir. 1961, 288 F.2d 36, cert. denied, 1961, 368 U.S. 823, 82 S.Ct. 41, 7 L.Ed.2d 28; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. British Motor Car Distributors, Ltd., 9 Cir. 1960, 278 F.2d 392. Nor are we impressed with Supreme\u2019s apparent attempt to deny that it obtained any tax benefit' whatever in this transaction, on the ground that it was merely using its own cost as a basis rather than any deduction, credit or allowance obtained from OKS. We think that the tax saving resulting from the combined benefits of nonrecognition to OKS and a stepped-up basis for Supreme may be considered as inuring to Supreme, the sole owner of CKS. See Bobsee Corp. v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 231, 234; Coastal Oil Storage Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 4 Cir. 1957, 242 F.2d 396, 399. The tax benefit in cases such as this is not necessarily commensurate with the difference between a stepped-up basis and a carryover basis. Allocation of cost to installment obligations means that there will be less cost to allocate to determine the basis of any other assets acquired. See Horn, Taxation of Installment and Deferred Payment Sales, 1960 Tulane Tax Inst. 618, 635. Here, however, the other assets of CKS were of slight value by comparison with the Star Motel note, and the decrease in their basis would thus not be significant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b442-12\">.
