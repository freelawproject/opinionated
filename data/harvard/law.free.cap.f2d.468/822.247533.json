BROWN, Chief Judge,\u2019with whom DYER and SIMPSON, Circuit Judges join,</author>\n<p id=\"AZC\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">I dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc. The practice of keeping the jury in the dark on the nontaxability of awards for lost income and future earning capacity should be reconsidered by the full Court. The jury\u2019s ignorance as to the effect of taxation produces verdicts which do not reflect realities of the financial injuries which a plaintiff, including this plaintiff, has endured.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">I do not mean to imply that plaintiff\u2019s verdicts in general \u2014 except insofar as they cause receipt of income which would have otherwise been diverted into the general coffers \u2014 are too large, nor that the plaintiff here was overcompensated for the other elements of damage. What I do protest is the court being a participant in an undertaking the rules of which compel it to remain silent, when silence almost necessarily becomes deceit. Indeed, it would be more characteristic of the law\u2019s quest for truth to ordain a substantive rule that the jury be openly and honestly instructed to award gross wages lost, but under a rule which supposes recovery of net losses it is most unseemly for a court of law to refuse to hear, see or speak the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">We should unmuzzle ourselves from our prior cases which make a trial judge and us a part of a charade. That would also put us in tune with the times <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 an awareness by the very young to the aged that federal income taxes are not only a certain fact of life, but they are, and most assuredly will be big, if not bigger.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-15\">. The jury below apparently increased plaintiffs award in order to compensate for taxation. Greco v. Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Co., 5 Cir., 1972, 464 F.2d 496.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-16\">. Indeed, it would put us in tune with the holding's of a number of other courts. The excellent opinion of Judge Aldisert for the Third Circuit in Domeracki v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., 3 Cir., 1971, 443 F.2d 1245 contains a catalog of authorities and learned commentary. We should heed his statement that \u201cwhat we know as men we should not ignore as judges\u201d, an observation I have voiced on several occasions, see, e. g., Hamer v. Campbell, 5 Cir., 1966, 358 F.2d 215, 220 and Brooks v. Beto, 5 Cir., 1966, 366 F.2d 1, 10, 12 (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
