Guaraldi appeals from a judgment convicting him of refusal to submit to induction into the armed forces [50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462]. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Appellant was classified I-A in late 1965. At the time he was a first-year student at San Jose State College, and he wrote to his board to inform it of this fact, although he did not submit a formal request for a student deferment until he was reminded by the board to do so. After receiving his deferment application (S.S. Form 104) and certification from the college of his enrollment (S.S. Form 109), the board, in August, 1966, reclassified him II-S. In its original certificates, the college certified that appellant\u2019s expected graduation date was June of 1969. However, at the beginning of the following school year, the college submitted a certificate which indicated that appellant would not graduate until January of 1970. After ascertaining that appellant had indeed fallen behind in credits and would not graduate within four years, the board thereupon reclassified him I-A. Appellant then declared his intention to appeal his classification, and, at the same time, sought a hardship (Class III-A) deferment. He stated on the Dependency Questionnaire (Form 118) that his weekly income from part-time work was $60, of which he contributed approximately half to his parents; that his father was disabled due to a heart condition; and that his parents\u2019 total income consisted of Social Security and Veterans Administration benefits of approximately $3,700 per annum. He noted, in addition, that \u201cMy father is dependent upon me because of his totally disabled condition. I do the work around the house that he is unable to do and my financial support aids in helping my family.\u201d Appellant personally appeared before the board and discussed both his student and hardship claims, but the board, on October 22, 1968, decided to retain him in Class I-A. Appellant\u2019s file was forwarded to the appeal board in June of 1969. The latter, in November, 1969, returned the file to the local board with instructions to issue appellant another Dependency Questionnaire, to obtain a complete financial statement, and to then return the file. Local board records show that the questionnaire was mailed to appellant on January 28, 1970, and that, when it was not returned, the file was then forwarded on April 17, 1970 to the appeal board. One month later, the appeal board retained appellant in Class I-A. The local board informed appellant of the appeal board\u2019s action on June 12, and one week later appellant was sent an order to report for induction on July 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">At the time he received his induction notice, appellant was attending summer classes at Fresno State College, and he requested a postponement of his induction, as he was scheduled to graduate from that college at the end of the summer term. The board notified appellant that it would transfer his induction to Fresno, and that the transfer would serve to postpone his induction and give him the time he needed to graduate. On July 28, appellant wrote to the board and told them that he was a conscientious objector, and requested the board to send him a Special Form for Conscientious Objectors (Form 150). The board mailed him the Form 150, which appellant returned in August. After reviewing his conscientious objector application, the board concluded that reopening of his classification was not warranted. This decision was reviewed by state and national Selective Service authorities, and on January 15, 1971, the board directed appellant to report for in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>duction. He reported but refused to submit.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">\n<em>The II-S Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(h)(1) provides that, \u201cA deferment granted to any person under [this provision] shall continue until such person completes the requirements for his baccalaureate degree, fails to pursue satisfactorily a full-time course of instruction, or attains the twenty-fourth anniversary of the date of his birth, whichever first occurs. * * \u201d Both this court and other Courts of Appeals have held that where the information supplied by the college shows that the student registrant has fallen behind in his credits and will graduate later than his originally anticipated graduation date, a local board has a basis in fact for terminating the registrant\u2019s student deferment. United States v. Jenson, 450 F.2d 1258 (9th Cir. 1971); United States v. Olson, 447 F.2d 1362 (9th Cir. 1971); Coleman v. Tolson, 435 F.2d 1062 (4th Cir. 1970); United States v. Brooks, 415 F.2d 502 (6th Cir. 1969). Appellant\u2019s file shows that the first enrollment certificates submitted by his college certified that he would graduate in 1969; however, in later certificates, the school certified that he would not graduate until 1970. Therefore the board had a basis in fact for concluding that appellant was not \u201csatisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction,\u201d and the II-S deferment was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">\n<em>The Hardship Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">Appellant urges that the local and appeal board\u2019s failure to state reasons for the denial of his requested hardship classification constitutes error under this court\u2019s decision in United States v. Haughton, 413 F.2d 736 (9th Cir. 1969). We disagree. <em>Haughton </em>involved a registrant who sought conscientious objector status, an area of selective service law which had been the subject of considerable litigation. We held that, in view of recently announced standards governing eligibility for conscientious objector status [see, e. g., United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965)], a board\u2019s denial of a C.O. application which stated a prima facie claim was required to be supported by the board\u2019s statement of reasons for the denial. \u201cOtherwise a court cannot determine whether a board\u2019s denial of a requested classification was based on a belief that the registrant\u2019s statements, even if true, did not entitle him to the classification, or on the reasonable disbelief of certain allegations necessary to the registrant\u2019s prima facie ease.\u201d 413 F.2d at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">In United States v. Kember, 437 F.2d 534 (9th Cir. 1970), this court held that <em>Haughton </em>\u201c. . . requires that the appeal board as well as the local board state its reasons for denial of a conscientious objector claim where the application therefor is prima facie sufficient, unless the appeal board\u2019s reasons can be determined from the agency record with reasonable certainty.\u201d 437 F.2d at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-16\">Here, applying <em>Haughton, </em>as amplified by <em>Kember, </em>we conclude that the reason for the appeal board\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s requested hardship classification can be ascertained from the administrative record \u201cwith reasonable certainty.\u201d Only a registrant whose induction would work \u201cextreme hardship to his ... parent . who is dependent upon him for support . . .\u2019\u2019is entitled to the III-A classification. 32 CFR \u00a7 1622.30. Each registrant is to be \u201cconsidered as eligible for military service until his eligibility for deferment is clearly established to the satisfaction of the local board.\u201d 32 CFR \u00a7 1622.1. Reviewing the record, we note that the appeal board, in November, 1969, returned appellant\u2019s file to the local board with instructions to send appellant another Dependency Questionnaire, to be returned \u201cwith a complete financial statement.\u201d The inference is plain from this directive that the appeal board concluded that appellant\u2019s showing was deficient. Appellant, although put on notice and requested to supply additional informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>tion, failed to avail himself of this opportunity. On this record, the board had a sufficient basis for denying the requested classification. The mere fact that a registrant contributes money to his parents does not establish that the parents are \u201cdependent upon him for support,\u201d or that they would suffer hardship in the event of his induction. Other than bare income figures and a doctor\u2019s letter referring to the father\u2019s health, appellant supplied the board only with conclusory statements in support of his application. This was not enough. We are satisfied that it was for this reason that the board denied the hardship classification, and its determination is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">\n<em>The Conscientious Objector Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\"> Where a conscientious objector claim is filed after the registrant has received his induction notice, the local board is not required to reopen the registrant\u2019s classification unless he provides evidence that his change in status is due to circumstances beyond his control. Ehlert v. United States, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971); United States v. Stock, 460 F.2d 480 (9th Cir. 1971); United States v. Lloyd, 460 F.2d 1052 (9th Cir. 1971). Appellant urges that his type of beliefs were not- administratively recognized as a form of conscientious objection prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970), and that the <em>Welsh </em>decision (which was decided four days before appellant\u2019s induction notice was issued, and which he discovered shortly after he received his notice) thus constituted \u201ccircumstances beyond his control\u201d which would require the board to consider his post-induction C.O. claim on the merits. This same contention was recently rejected by this court in United States v. Gerin, 464 F.2d 492 (9th Cir. 1972). That decision is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Appellant\u2019s remaining contentions are of insufficient merit to warrant extended discussion. His assertion of prejudice from the local board\u2019s delay in forwarding his file to the appeal board [see 32 CFR \u00a7 1626.14] is without merit. If his appeal,' filed in December, 1967, had been handled with reasonable dispatch, there is no possibility that appellant\u2019s C.O. claim, filed in July, 1970, could-have predated a valid induction order. His claim that the board may have relied on \u201chostile\u201d information in his file is utterly without foundation. And no showing has been made that appellant\u2019s selective service file was incomplete or inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
