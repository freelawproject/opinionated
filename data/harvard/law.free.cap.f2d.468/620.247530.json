They claim that the procedures under which a state agency<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> effected consolidation of these two units of local government denied the residents of the township, who were unwillingly absorbed into the city, their constitutional rights to equal protection and due process. Ruling that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint raised no substantial constitutional claim, the district court (Chief Judge Devitt) refused appellants\u2019 request to convene a three-judge court and dismissed the action for want of jurisdiction. Appellants brought this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-16\">We have reviewed the record on appeal, and it is apparent that appellants\u2019 claim of infringement of their constitutional rights is without merit as demonstrated by Judge Devitt\u2019s opinion published at 340 F.Supp. 841 (D.Minn. 1972). We affirm on the basis of that opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-18\">.
