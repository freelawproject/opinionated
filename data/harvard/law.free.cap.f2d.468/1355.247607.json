These statements were competent, not for the purpose of proving the truth of the matters asserted, but to permit the jury to infer the defendant\u2019s state of mind in consequence of the utterances. That defendant was aware of remarks by his companions relating to bank robbery was properly considered by the jury as bearing upon the essential element of defendant\u2019s intent to aid in the commission of the robbery. This is especially true in the fact context of this case, for it was defendant\u2019s contention that although present he was merely an innocent bystander. Since this sort of evidence is relevant as to state of mind and intention, without regard to the truth of the statements, the hearsay rule is clearly inapplicable. Frank v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>States, 220 F.2d 559 (10th Cir. 1955). Thus we need not consider whether, if hearsay, the evidence fell within recognized exceptions to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">Prior to the selection of the jury, .counsel for defendant requested that these questions be put to the panel on voir dire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1423-6\">29. Have you had any dealings or experiences with Negroes that might make it difficult for you to sit in impartial judgment on this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1423-7\">30. Do you promise to consider only the facts and evidence in this case and to completely disregard the defendant\u2019s race, creed and color?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1423-8\">The district judge failed and refused to propound these questions. We think that he should have asked them, but that on the facts of this case his failure to do so was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-9\">During oral argument counsel agreed that the defendant was black, that two of the government\u2019s witnesses were black, and that four members of the jury were black. Under these circumstances, we think the district judge\u2019s repeated inquiry of the jury, during the selection process, relating to the jurors\u2019 ability and willingness to render a fair and impartial verdict was enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-10\">In Aldridge v. United States, 283 U.S. 308, 51 S.Ct. 470, 75 L.Ed. 1054 (1931), the Supreme Court held that it was reversible error for the trial judge to refuse to ask on voir dire whether racial prejudice would prevent any juror from giving a fair and impartial verdict because the defendant was a Negro charged with the murder of a white policeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-11\">In United States v. Gore, 435 F.2d 1110 (4th Cir. 1970), we interpreted <em>Aldridge </em>as laying \u201cdown a broad rule that in any criminal case an accused has a right to inquire whether racial prejudice precludes any juror from reaching a fair and impartial verdict.\u201d 435 F.2d at 1111. We adhere to that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-12\">But in <em>Gore </em>we did not decide \u201cwhether every refusal of an accused\u2019s request for a voir dire examination on racial prejudice is such an impairment of the right to challenge jurors that it can never be harmless error.\u201d 435 F.2d at 1112. It was unnecessary to reach the question because prejudice to Gore was obvious on the face of the record: he was black, many of the government witnesses were white, and he was tried by an all-white jury. Rivers, on the contrary, was tried by a mixed jury, and the government\u2019s case rested heavily upon the testimony of members of the same race as Rivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-14\">We are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Rivers received a fair trial before an impartial jury, and that the exclusion of these appropriate questions was harmless error that contributed not at all to the conviction. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
