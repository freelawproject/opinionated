The plaintiff, a seaman, alleged that he was injured when he and two fellow deckhands were pulling up a wire cable which rested on the bottom of the Ohio River in order to attach some empty barges to it. Plaintiff contended that \u201cthe wire slipped, and it was released by the deckhands, giving plaintiff a big jerk and pulling him down, causing his back to be wrenched . . . .\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief at 3). He claimed this alleged in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>jury was thus attributable to defendant\u2019s negligence under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688 (1970), and unseaworthiness under the maritime common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Careful consideration of the record and the trial court\u2019s charge as a whole<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> discloses that the trial judge accurately and adequately charged the jury on negligence and unseaworthiness. In particular, the instructions sufficiently explained the need for a fit and adequately constructed barge and for proper and fit equipment, appliances, and personnel (N.T. 260-61).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Plaintiff contends that, because the trial judge\u2019s summary of both parties\u2019 arguments included the statement that the defendant \u201cmaintains that the method used to secure the empty barges to the shore was a safe and customary one,\u201d (Appendix II at 257), the trial judge should have given the instructions plaintiff requested on the issue of custom. However, plaintiff\u2019s requests were too brief and did not adequately explain the applicable law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, it is not clear that the defendant\u2019s evidence as to the use of similar cables at some places on the Ohio River to secure barges necessarily established the existence of a custom.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, we reject plaintiff\u2019s argument on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">We have carefully reviewed plaintiff\u2019s other contentions and have concluded that refusal to vacate, modify, or disturb the judgment is not \u201cinconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d See F.R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\">.

Although there was testimony that the captain maneuvered the tow so that plaintiff was forced to work off the outside gunnel, two members of the crew testified that they were working from the end deck, which was 26 feet by 10 to 12 feet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b646-10\">.

In order to establish that the defendant is conforming to the community\u2019s idea of reasonable behavior, there must be evidence and a finding of the usual and customary conduct of others under similar circumstances.
