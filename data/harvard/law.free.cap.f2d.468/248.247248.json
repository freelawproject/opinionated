We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-19\">The appellant was convicted upon his trial by jury of rape and was sentenced to ninety-nine years\u2019 imprisonment on March 22, 1968. The conviction was reversed by the Florida District Court of Appeal, Fourth District, on direct appeal and the case was remanded for a new trial. Stubbs v. State, Fla.App.1969, 222 So.2d 228. The state, having subsequently petitioned the Florida Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, was granted the writ of certiorari and the Florida Supreme Court quashed the District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision with instructions to further remand the case to the Circuit Court to reinstate that court\u2019s judgment and sentence. State v. Stubbs, Fla.1970, 239 So.2d 241. The appellant is now serving the ninety-nine year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-20\">The sole issue for determination here is whether the district court erred in holding that the violation of the appellant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation, where the introduction into evidence of two codefendants\u2019 statements containing inculpatory statements against the appellant was accompanied by the court\u2019s limiting instruction that those statements not be considered against the appellant, was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-21\">The Florida District Court of Appeal, Fourth District, based its reversal of the conviction on Bruton v. United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, concluding that the admission of the codefendants\u2019 statements deprived the appellant of his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. The Florida Court, in mandating reinstatement of the appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence, found that the appellant\u2019s case was distinguishable from <em>Bruton </em>because the appellant\u2019s own statement, which contained a free and voluntary confession, established the same material facts as revealed in the codefendants\u2019 statements and therefore rendered the codefendants\u2019 statements merely cumulative and the admission thereof not grounds for reversal. The district court well expressed the rationale of its ruling in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201cIn <em>Bruton </em>the petitioner and his co-defendant were tried jointly. At the trial the co-defendant\u2019s confession implicated the petitioner and was introduced into evidence with a cautionary instruction to the jury that it was to be considered by them as evidence only against the co-defendant. Neither the petitioner nor co-defendant testified and no incriminating statements of the petitioner were introduced into evidence. On those facts the Supreme Court concluded that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlB\">[Bjecause of the substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, looked to the incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining petitioner\u2019s guilt, admission of Evans\u2019 confession in this joint trial violated petitioner\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">\u201cIt is clear, therefore, that the underlying rationale of <em>Bruton </em>is that if a co-defendant does not testify and if his extra-judicial statement is introduced at a joint trial, constitutional error occurs because the hearsay evidence inculpating another contained in the extra-judicial statement, is not subject to cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">\u201cIt is also clear, however, that the occurrence of a <em>Bruton </em>error does not automatically require a reversal. In Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969) the Supreme Court reiterated the principle recognized in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), that a federal constitutional error can be held harmless if the reviewing court is able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In <em>Harrington, </em>the evidence against the defendant was circumstantial, but considerable. He made statements which fell short of a confession but which placed him at the scene of the crime. The evidence against Stubbs is perhaps even stronger than that against Harrington. Although neither the prosecutrix or her boyfriend could identify Stubbs, their testimony as to the facts surrounding the crime were completely supported and substantiated by the petitioner\u2019s own confession. The testimony of the girl and her boyfriend, corroborated by the confession of the defendant was sufficient to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond and to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt. The confessions of the petitioner\u2019s co-defendants, as in <em>Harrington, </em>were merely cumulative, containing essentially the same facts as Stubbs\u2019 confession and the testimony of the prosecutrix.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">After careful examination of the record and the recent cases on harmless error, Milton v. Wainwright, 407 U.S. 371, 92 S.Ct. 2174, 33 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972); Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.S. 427, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 31 L.Ed.2d 340 (1972); Hoover v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1972, 467 F.2d 516; we have concluded that the district court did not err in its disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b315-12\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING</p>\n<author id=\"ADA\">BY THE COURT:</author>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">It is ordered that Appellant\u2019s Motion for leave to file a petition for rehearing out of time in the above cause is hereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>granted; on consideration thereof the petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">It is further ordered that Appellant\u2019s alternative motion to recall and stay the Court\u2019s judgment issued as mandate pending disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari to be filed in the United States Supreme Court is hereby granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
