Oppewal, of Whitinsville, Massachusetts, deducted as a charitable contribution, the sum of nine hundred dollars they had paid that year to the Whitinsville Society for Christian Instruction (Society). The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed this to the extent of six hundred and forty dollars on the ground that this sum, representing the cost to the Society of educating taxpayers\u2019 two children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>that year, constituted a non-deductible personal expense under section 262 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\">On this ground the Commissioner declared a 1968 tax deficiency in the amount of $153.22. Taxpayers petitioned the Tax Court to redetermine the asserted deficiency. The Tax Court adhered to the Commissioner\u2019s determination, its findings of fact and opinion being reported at 30 T.C.M. 1177. Taxpayers appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">The controlling facts are not in dispute. The Society was organized in 1924 \u201c . . . for the purpose of advancing the cause of education . . .\u201d It was, during the taxable year 1968, an organization exempt from tax under section 501 of the Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501. The membership of the Society consisted of three hundred and twenty contributing individuals and families, some ninety of which had children attending the school. The Society solicited and received gifts from members, non-members, churches and other organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">Members who were parents with children in the Society\u2019s school were solicited in the same manner as were non-parents. Money received was not'fiut into donor or students accounts but was put into a general operating fund. No child obtained the opportunity to attend the Society\u2019s school by reason of any contribution made, nor was any child barred for lack of a contribution. Approximately forty percent of the total Society receipts was collected from the contributions of parents who had children in the school, though a record or tally was not kept. Funds were solicited on the basis of what a person could afford to give rather than on a per capita basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">Funds normally came to the Society on a regular established basis rather than as a result of a drive or newly-initiated program. Solicitations were made from time to time on a personal basis. The academic training received at the Society\u2019s school was no better or worse than that available at the public schools in taxpayers\u2019 community, consisting of about ten thousand people.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-14\">During the 1967 to 1968 school year, one hundred and ninety-three children attended the school operated by the Society. The cost of operating the school amounted to about three hundred and thirty-eight dollars per student. During the taxable year 1968, two of the taxpayers\u2019 children attended this school for a period of thirty-nine weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-15\">Section 170 of the Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 170, allows as a deduction any charitable contribution payment of which is made during the taxable year. Section 170(c) defines a \u201ccharitable contribution\u201d as including a \u201ccontribution or gift to or for the use of . [a] corporation or fund organized and operated exclusively for religious ... or educational purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-18\">The Tax Court, relying upon its decision in Harold DeJong, 86 T.C. 896 (1961), affirmed sub nom. DeJong v. C.I.R., 309 F.2d 373 (9th Cir. 1962), held that to the extent of six hundred and forty dollars, the taxpayers\u2019 payment to the Society was not a \u201ccontribution or gift\u201d to the Society, because it proceeded primarily from the incentive of anticipated benefit to the taxpayers \u201cbeyond the satisfaction which flows from the performance of a generous act . . . \u201d Said the Tax Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-20\">\u201c . . .we are persuaded that the contributions made by petitioner to the Society in 1968 were substantially induced by the benefits anticipated by him from the enrollment of his two children in the Society\u2019s school and were, to a substantial extent, in the nature of tuition.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 30 T.C.M. at 1178.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>In their brief in this court, taxpayers apparently accepted the subjective test applied by the Tax Court involving taxpayers\u2019 motive and intent in making the payment to the Society. However, they argued that, under the facts, it was not reasonable to conclude that the payment was induced by the educational benefits taxpayers expected to derive for their children. In oral argument taxpayers urged that objective rather than subjective standards should be applied. The objective test taxpayers would apply is whether there was certainty as to the beneficiaries of their payment. S. E. Thomason v. C.I.R., 2 T.C. 441 (1943). They assert that this test was not met because no part of the payment was earmarked for the education of taxpayers\u2019 children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">We have heretofore expressed our dissatisfaction with such subjective tests as the taxpayer\u2019s motives in making a purported charitable contribution. In Crosby Valve &amp; Gage Company v. C. I. R., 380 F.2d 146 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 976, 88 S.Ct. 477, 19 L.Ed.2d 468 (1967), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-6\">\u201cWhile agreeing with the holding of the Tax Court, we think it necessary to register our disagreement with the [Tax Court] majority\u2019s emphasis upon a purely charitable motive as a prerequisite for a deductible charitable contribution. Were the deductibility of a contribution under section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to depend on \u2018detached and disinterested generosity\u2019, an important area of tax law would become a mare\u2019s nest of uncertainty woven of judicial value judgments irrelevant to eleemosynary reality.\u201d 380 F.2d at 146.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">But while we believe it important to solve'this tax problem through the application of an objective test, we do not regard taxpayers\u2019 proposed objective inquiry \u2014 was the payment earmarked for the education of taxpayers\u2019 children\u2014 appropriate. Classification of a- payment as a gift, or as payment of family expenses, should depend upon something more fundamental than the particular bookkeeping methods used by the educational institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">The more fundamental objective test is \u2014 however the payment was designated, and whatever motives the taxpayers had in making it, was it, to any substantial extent, offset by the cost of services rendered to taxpayers in the nature of tuition? If so, the payment, to the extent of the offset, should be regarded as tuition for, in substance, it served the same function as tuition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">Applying that test here, the conclusion is inescapable that six hundred and forty dollars of taxpayers\u2019 payment to the Society was non-deductible tuition. The taxpayers\u2019 two children obtained a year of education in the Society\u2019s religiously-oriented school, as desired by taxpayers. The cost to the Society of providing that service was at least six hundred and forty dollars. In effect, if not in form or by design, taxpayers paid this cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">. Section 262 of the Code provides that \u201c(e)xeept as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, no deduction shall he allowed for personal, living, or family expenses.\u201d Tuition paid for the education of the children of a taxpayer is a family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>expense, not a charitable contribution to the educating institution. Channing v. United States, 4 F.Supp. 33 (D.Mass. 1933), aff\u2019d 67 F.2d 986 (1st Cir. 1933).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">. Under this test, the fact that the taxpayers might have made the payment even had their children not been enrolled in the Society\u2019s school, or that the Society would have enrolled the children even had no payment been made, or that taxpayers\u2019 children would have received an education of the same academic quality (although not religiously oriented) in a public school without additional expense to taxpayers, become irrelevant considerations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
