(NBC), a television station licensee, to abandon its policy of excluding from nonnews programs material presented for the purpose of fostering belief in astrology. Since NBC\u2019s policy in this particular is to adhere to the Television Code (the Code) of the National Association of Broadcasters (the NAB), petitioner also seeks review of the Commission\u2019s refusal to issue a declaratory ruling that Television Code Section IV-21<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and identical provision in the Radio Code may not be adopted by licensees as their own policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s involvement with NBC and the Commission stemmed from her efforts to gain publicity for her book, \u201cAstrology For The Aquarian Age\u201d, published by Simon &amp; Schuster, in July, 1970. Her theme is that \u201cAstrology is the science of time . . . the synchronization of astronomical time with biological time\u201d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or \u201cthe study of Nature\u2019s clock \u2014 a clock of such gigantic proportions that few people have the imagination to comprehend its scope.\u201d The thesis is that if one carefully constructs a \u201cnatal chart\u201d taking account of the time, date, and month -of birth as well as the other elements of astrological lore \u2014 the sun, moon, planets, divisions of the Zodiac, etc. \u2014 one may be able to \u201cpredict, with precision, those planetary correlations that act upon you at any moment of time.\u201d It offers help in making basic decisions in life. For example, \u201cAstrology can match people more successfully than the computer; moreover, it can teach two people how to avoid the inevitable pitfalls that often lead to divorce.\u201d The book, however, is critical of prophesies, precise predictions, and magazine horoscopes. The petitioner writes, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether or not I \u2018believe\u2019 in [astrology] \u2014 I <em>use </em>it and I have learned to use it successfully.\u201d She laments the fact that astrology today \u201cis considered by most people to be either an occult amusement or an exercise in character analysis\u201d, feels that it \u201cshould no longer have to live in the shadows of superstition, witchcraft, magic and fortunetelling\u201d, and calls for employing statistical methods on a control group of persons with exact natal charts to see what is indicated by the charts and what actually has happened to demonstrate any significant correlation.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Petitioner alleged that her agent\u2019s request that petitioner be invited to appear on NBC\u2019s <em>Tonight Show </em>was refused. A subsequent request for clarification of policy was answered by NBC which stated that program material on astrology was \u201cunacceptable when presented for the purpose of fostering belief in the subject\u201d. Subsequent unsuccessful efforts by petitioner culminated in the filing of the Complaint and Request for Declaratory Ruling. The complaint charged that a flat ban on the advocacy of astrology violated both the First Amendment and the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard of the Communications Act, relying principally on Business Executives\u2019 Move for Vietnam Peace v. F. C. C., 146 U.S.App.D.C. 181, 450 F.2d 642 (1971), cert. granted, 405 U.S. 953, 92 S.Ct. 1174, 31 L.Ed.2d 230 (1972) as \u201can extension\u201d of the reasoning in Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. F. C. C., 395 U.S. 367, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The Commission\u2019s response, echoed by the licensee, was that the record did not indicate that NBC acted unreasonably in refusing to invite petitioner to be a guest on any of its talk shows, and that the Commission lacked authority to require changes in the Code, or to affect a licensee\u2019s membership in a private association. The Commission noted that in any event there was no evidence that membership in the NAB had resulted in a violation of the First Amendment, the Communications Act, or any Commission rule or policy. NBC contended that its acts did not amount to \u201cstate action\u201d which would subject it to compliance with the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\"> Considering the lack of information before the Commission, it is difficult to understand its apparent certainty of belief that it is powerless to protect against possible abuses resulting from broadcaster involvement with the NAB. However, even if we should find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>in addition that the actions of the licensee are clothed with \u201cstate action\u201d, or for other reasons that the First Amendment applies to a broadcaster, nevertheless it cannot be seriously contended, in light of the limited number of broadcast frequencies available, that general guidelines reflecting programming priorities may not reasonably be adopted. The Communications Act\u2019s requirement that stations operate in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d furnishes the framework within which the First Amendment would apply, such that activities or policies of a broadcaster, if valid under the Act, would normally also meet the constitutional standard. National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 227, 63 S.Ct. 997, 87 L.Ed. 1344 (1943). We therefore view petitioner\u2019s allegations within the context of the Communications Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The claim that NBC\u2019s flat ban on programs which \u201care presented for the purpose of fostering belief\u201d in astrology is essentially one of overbreadth in a non-criminal context. Thus some sort of showing should be made that a refusal to consider programming which falls within the ban would contravene the \u201cpublic interest\u201d. Petitioner has failed to present even a prima facie case that the ban extends to such programming. Self-serving and undocumented statements, though both sincere and motivated by the party\u2019s concept of the public interest, cannot serve as valid indicia of the public interest, \u201c[the] great public concern . . . [or] representative [ness of] community views, <em>Red Lion, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 394, 89 S.Ct. at 1808, which allegedly inheres in the relevant subject matter at issue. While it may be good policy, and perhaps even required under the Communications Act, that a broadcaster articulate some rationale for its general policies, <em>see </em>Environmental Defense Fund v. Ruckelshaus, 142 U.S.App.D.C. 74, 439 F.2d 584, 597-598 (1971), even more so when there may be a question as to whether the licensee has exercised independent judgment in adopting restrictive policies in concert with others, we do not reach that question here since there is insufficient evidence to conclude that NBC\u2019s flat ban illegally precludes programming which falls within the \u201cpublic interest, convenience and necessity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">On the record before us, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-12\">. The relevant code section of \u201cIV. General Program Standards\u201d reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-13\">\u201c21. Program material pertaining to fortune-telling, occultism, astrology, phrenology, palm-reading, numerology, mind-reading, or character-reading, is unacceptable when presented for the purpose of fostering belief in these subjects.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b333-24\">. Other issues initially sought to be raised are not before us. A challenge to NBC\u2019s policy against accepting paid advertisements to foster belief in astrology has not been pressed, since no attempt was made to secure such advertising. Nor has petitioner sought review of the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>sion\u2019s refusal to find that a radio station illegally deleted some of her pre-recorded remarks from a talk show. Petitioner does not now contend that the refusal of NBC\u2019s <em>Today Show </em>to invite her on the program supports her claim, conceding that the producer could reasonably have deemed her appearance not newsworthy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b334-11\">. This and other quotations in the opinion are taken from petitioner\u2019s book which was made available to the Commission and the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
