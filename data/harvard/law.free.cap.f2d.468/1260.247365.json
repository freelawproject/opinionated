These rights are not vested and do not become vested until one has actually established his eligibility. Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960); King v. Finch, 428 F.2d 709 (5th Cir. 1970). Appellant having had no rights lost by those amendments has no right to challenge them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-24\">There was substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s finding that appellant was not disabled prior to December 31, 1972, the last date on which she met the necessary earnings requirements. This being the only question open to us on review (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405 (g), and Harmon v. Finch, 460 F.2d 1229 (9th Cir. 1972)), we affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
