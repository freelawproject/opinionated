A. Hormel &amp; Company, all Delaware corporations, manufacture a variety of sausage and other meat products. They join in an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief alleging a conflict of the Federal Wholesome Meat Act (Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1907, as amended), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 et seq. (1967) with the Michigan Comminuted Meat Law (M.S.A. 12.964(1) et seq.; M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.581 et seq.) (1952). The two laws will sometimes be designated the Federal Act and the Michigan Law. Appellees are the Director of the Department of Agriculture of the State of Michigan and the Acting Chief of the Food Inspection Division of the Michigan Department of Agriculture. The Attorney General of the State of Michigan is an intervening defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">The cause was submitted to the trial court on the complaint, answer, affidavits of officers of Armour and Hormel, a short stipulation, briefs, and oral argument. The trial court denied appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted the motion for summary judgment of the appellees. The meat manufacturers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">In their complaint appellants requested a declaration that \u201cthe marking, labeling, packaging, and ingredient provisions\u201d of the Michigan Law are \u201cin addition to, or different than\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> those imposed under the Federal Act and the regulations issued pursuant thereto and are, therefore, preempted by virtue of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 678 (1967) and Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution. Appellants also requested the trial court to enjoin appellees from enforcing the provisions of the Michigan Law against them as to \u201csausage manufactured or processed by plaintiffs which has passed federal inspection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">It is alleged in the complaint and appellees do not deny that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-16\">Since December 15, 1967, the effective date ... of Subchapter I of the Wholesome Meat Act, plaintiffs have prepared all of their sausage, transported and offered for sale in Michigan, at federally inspected establishments in accordance with the requirements of said Act, and of the regulations adopted pursuant thereto; . the Secretary of Agriculture has made or caused . . . inspections . . . to be made from time to time by experts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, both as to raw materials . . . and the finished products, as well as to the factories or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>plants where such sausage is manufactured, packed or prepared for market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\">[I]n June of 1968, a shipment into Michigan of Armour and Company\u2019s sausage, which had passed federal inspection, was cited by the Food Inspection Division of that state as not complying with the Michigan Law because of a protein content of less than twelve percent and, as a result, the criminal penalties of Section 10 . were invoked against said plaintiff; and that defendants . . . have indicated that they intend to continue . [such] . . . policy ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The 1968 prosecution ended with a plea of guilty and a fine. Subsequent to the filing of appellants\u2019 complaint on January 13, 1970, prosecutions under the Michigan Law had been commenced by appellees against Armour Dial, Inc., a subsidiary of Armour and Company, and Armour and Company. Both prosecutions are held in abeyance pending the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">In his opinion and order of November 12, 1971, D.C., 337 F.Supp. 938, the trial court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">The plaintiffs attack the Michigan Comminuted Meat Act on the basis of the Federal Wholesome Meat Act, claiming that the federal act entirely preempts the field of meat labeling and ingredient requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">Without specifically responding to plaintiffs\u2019 claim of preemption the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-13\">Plaintiffs . . . may adequately protect their federal rights in a defense to a state prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-15\">Concluding that appellants failed to prove irreparable injury and that they lacked equity or good conscience, the trial court denied appellants\u2019 request for injunctive relief. The court ruled further that \u201creasons which compel this court to deny injunctive relief likewise require denial of plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory relief.\u201d In support of this ruling the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-17\">Generally, the same considerations that require the withholding of injunctive relief will make declaratory relief equally inappropriate. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 63 S.Ct. 1070, 87 L.Ed. 1407 (1943); Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 91 S.Ct. 764, 27 L.Ed.2d 688 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-18\">Samuels v. Mackell, on which the trial court principally relies, is the second in the trilogy of decisions headed by Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), and followed by Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U.S. 82, 91 S. Ct. 674, 27 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). These decisions limit a district court\u2019s right to issue federal injunctions against enforcement of state criminal statutes. <em>Samuels, supra, </em>applies the <em>Younger </em>doctrine to a declaratory action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-19\">[T]he same equitable principles relevant to the propriety of an injunction must be taken into consideration by federal district courts in determining whether to issue a declaratory judgment, and that where an injunction would be impermissible under these principles, declaratory relief should ordinarily be denied as well. 401 U.S. 73, 91 S.Ct. 768.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-20\">Lake Carriers\u2019 Assn. v. MacMullan, 406 U.S. 498, 92 S.Ct. 1749, 32 L.Ed.2d 257 (1972) whose aid and guidance was not available to the trial court, confirms this limitation of <em>Younger </em>and <em>Samuels.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-21\">[Younger v. Harris and Samuels v. Mackell] were premised on considerations of equity practice and comity in our federal system that have little force in the absence of a pending state proceeding. In that circumstance exercise of federal court jurisdiction ordinarily is appropriate if the conditions for declaratory or injunctive relief are met. See generally Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U.S. 82, 93, 91 S.Ct. 674, 27 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971) (separate opinion). <em>Lake Carriers\u2019, </em>406 U.S. at 509-510, 92 S.Ct. at 1757.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Reasonably read, \u201ca pending state proceeding\u201d means a proceeding under state law that is pending when a complaint is filed in federal court seeking declaratory or injunctive relief from the application of that state law. <em>Samuels, </em>therefore, does not forbid declaratory relief in the present case. No state prosecution under the Michigan Law was pending against the appellants when they filed their present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\"><em>Lake Carriers\u2019 Assn., supra, </em>prescribes the conditions under which a justiciable controversy is presented when a declaratory action is brought to challenge a state law and no criminal prosecution pends thereunder. The Court observes at 406 U.S. 507, 92 S.Ct. at 1755 that since the appellants were obliged under the Michigan Watercraft Pollution Act of 1970 to install sewage storage devices this obligation \u201cin and of itself makes their attack on the validity of the law a live controversy, and not an attempt to obtain an advisory opinion.\u201d The Court recognizes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">f appellants are to avoid prosecution, they must be prepared, according to Michigan authorities, to retain all sewage on board as soon as pump-out facilities are available, which, in turn, means that they must promptly install sewage storage devices. In this circumstance, compliance is coerced by the threat of enforcement, and the controversy is both immediate and real. [Citations] 406 U.S. at 508, 92 S.Ct. at 1756.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In the present case the immediacy and reality of the controversy is plain. Enforcement of the Michigan Law against the appellants is not just a threat. Repetitive enforcement of the law\u2019s criminal sanctions is occurring and its continuing enforcement is promised. Applying the test of <em>Lake Carriers\u2019 Assn, </em>to these circumstances \u201ccompliance is coerced by enforcement\u201d and the attack of the meat manufacturers on the validity of the Michigan Law is \u201ca live controversy.\u201d Whether or not the Michigan Law is preempted by the Federal Wholesome Meat Act therefore presents a justiciable controversy that is matured. It requires resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">It is concluded, therefore, that the trial court erred in its determination of the inappropriateness of declaratory relief and in refraining from ruling on the appellants\u2019 claim of preemption. Because it is concluded that the issue is one of law and prompt adjudication would serve the interest of justice, the Court will proceed to a determination on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">The Michigan Comminuted Meat Law governs the sale of \u201cmeat that has been subjected to a process whereby it has been reduced to minute meat particles.\u201d Sausage, by definition, is a comminuted meat and any sausage \u201cwhich does not meet the specifications of grade 1 sausage\u201d is not permitted to be sold in Michigan. Similarly, the Michigan Law contains specific provisions governing the marking and labeling of sausage. Meat manufacturers or packers must be licensed; and criminal penalties are provided for violations of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">The Federal Act and the regulations issued pursuant thereto are applicable, <em>inter alia, </em>to meats and meat food products prepared for shipment in \u201ccommerce.\u201d Sausage, by definition, is a meat food product for which federal regulations provide marking, labeling, and ingredient requirements. The only meat food product involved in this case is sausage; and the claimed conflicts between the Michigan Law and the federal regulations regarding marking, labeling, and ingredient requirements (specifications) constitute the subject matter of this action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b145-16\">All of appellants\u2019 sausage products shipped into Michigan are subject to federal inspection under Subchapter I of the Federal Act. Subchapter I, among its provisions, incorporates the inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>tion and labeling provisions of the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1907, 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 601 et seq. The subchapters of the Wholesome Meat Act strengthen but also expand the Meat Inspection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Under Subchapter I, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 (n) (7) a meat food product is misbranded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">if it purports to be or is represented as a food for which a definition and standard of identity or composition has been prescribed by regulations of the Secretary under section 607 of this title unless (A) it conforms to such definition and standard, and (B) its label bears the name of the food specified in the definition and standard ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 607 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">The Secretary, whenever he determines such action is necessary for the protection of the public, may prescribe (2) definitions and standards of identity or composition for articles subject to this subchapter [Sub-chapter I] . . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The regulations promulgated by the Secretary must be \u201cnecessary for the protection of the public.\u201d The Secretary is further governed by one of the congressional findings that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">It is essential in the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that meat and meat food products distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 602.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Guided by this legislative policy the Secretary is authorized to prescribe standards of identity or composition for sausage, and such sausage is misbranded unless it conforms to such definition and standard and its label bears the name of the food specified in the definition and standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">In Federal Security Administrator v. Quaker Oats Co., 318 U.S. 218, 221-222, 63 S.Ct. 589, 87 L.Ed. 724 (1943), the Supreme Court upheld a regulation of the Administrator which established a \u201cdefinition and standard of identity\u201d for farina. Significantly, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provided that any food which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-13\">purports to be or is represented as a food for which a definition and standard of identity has been prescribed . is . misbranded unless (1) it conforms to such definition and standard, and (2) its label bears the name of the food specified in the definition and standard . . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axx\">Those provisions are, in substance and intent, the same as the provisions enacted in the Federal Wholesome Meat Act. The language is nearly identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-17\">Moreover, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 607(c) states \u201cdefinitions and standards of identity or composition for articles subject to this subchapter . . . not inconsistent with any such standards established under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act . . . .\u201d By directly referring to that Act, it is concluded that Congress intended to give to the phrase \u201cdefinitions and standards of identity or composition\u201d a meaning as broad as that given to the phrase \u201cdefinition and standard of identity\u201d as construed in <em>Quaker Oats, swpra. </em>Moreover, Congress has added to the phrase \u201cdefinition and standard of identity\u201d the words \u201cor composition.\u201d Giving ordinary meaning to the word \u201ccomposition,\u201d it means the resulting product of mixing or combining various elements or ingredients. With this construction, the statute gives the Secretary the authority to prescribe \u201cdefinitions and standards of <em>composition\u201d </em>for meat food products. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-20\">What the Supreme Court said in <em>Quaker Oats, supra, </em>230, 63 S.Ct. 596, of those provisions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is equally applicable to the like provisions in the Wholesome Meat Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-21\">But it was found that such a prohibition [false and misleading labeling] was inadequate to protect the consumer from \u201ceconomic adulteration\u201d, by which less expensive ingredients were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>substituted, or the proportion of more expensive ingredients diminished, so as to make the product, although not in itself deleterious, inferior to that which the consumer expected to receive when purchasing a product with the name under which it was sold. . The remedy chosen was not a requirement of informative labeling. Rather it was the purpose to authorize the Administrator to promulgate definitions and standards of identity \u201cunder which the integrity of food products can be effectively maintained\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Thus, it is concluded that one purpose of the Wholesome Meat Act is to empower the Secretary to adopt definitions and standards of identity or composition so that the \u201cintegrity\u201d of meat food products could be \u201ceffectively maintained.\u201d Indeed, Congress in a further finding declares that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded meat or meat food products impair the effective regulation of meat and meat food products in interstate or foreign <em>commerce </em>.... (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 602.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The remedy chosen is not merely to prevent false and misleading labeling but to set standards under which the integrity of meat food products would be assured. Under the statutory scheme then, it is essential that the Secretary establish standards of identity or composition. Without such standards it would be impossible to carry out the express congressional policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">As a further part of the statutory scheme the authority delegated to the Secretary to prescribe \u201cdefinitions and standards of identity or composition\u201d for meat food products includes the authority to prescribe their \u201cingredients.\u201d Prescribing the \u201cingredients\u201d is essential to determine the \u201cidentity\u201d of the finished product and to protect the consumer from \u201ceconomic adulteration.\u201d Moreover, in defining and standardizing the composition (ingredients) of the product the Secretary of necessity must regulate the product\u2019s nutritional value.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">It is concluded further that the phrase \u201cdefinitions and standards of identity or composition\u201d is the functional equivalent of the term \u201cingredient requirements\u201d contained in 21 U.S.C \u00a7 678. (See n. 1 <em>infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">It is stipulated that the Federal Act and the Michigan Law \u201chave a common purpose of protecting public health.\u201d However, the definitions and standards of identity or composition (ingredient requirements) established by the Secretary <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> conflict in many material instances with the \u201cspecifications\u201d (ingredient requirements) for Grade 1 sausage provided in the Michigan Law. While those conflicts are detailed in the Appendix, the major conflicts, in summary form, are now discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">Grade 1 sausage, to be legally saleable in Michigan, must consist only of striated muscle, including head and cheek meat (basically, skeletal meats) derived only from the carcass of any cattle, swine, or sheep, or a mixture of such meats. Sausage, as defined by the regulations, may be prepared from <em>any part </em>of cattle, sheep, swine, or goats capable of use as human food. Thus, sausage under the regulations may contain meat other than skeletal meat and may also contain goat meat.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">The regulations permit up to 15% of poultry meats or poultry products in \u201cCooked, Smoked Sausage,\u201d whereas under the Michigan Law neither ingredient is permissible in Grade 1 sausage. Likewise, under the regulations beef and/or pork fatty tissue not exceeding 15% are permitted ingredients in \u201cCooked, Smoked Sausage\u201d but neither is permitted under the Michigan Law. Cereal and soya binders or extenders and certain \u201cmilk\u201d additives permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>under the regulations are excluded ingredients under the Michigan Law. However, the \u201cmilk\u201d additives permitted under the Michigan Law may amount to 4% of the total ingredients, while under the regulations \u201cmilk\u201d additives may not exceed 3.5%. Additionally, the \u201ctrimmable fat\u201d content of specified sausages differs. (See Appendix.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Finally, under the Michigan Law a \u201cprotein content\u201d of 12% is required while under the regulations no percentage of protein content is specified. In effect, however, a \u201cprotein content\u201d of 11.2% is required. (See Appendix.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">An item-by-item comparison discloses that nearly all provisions in the Michigan Law conflict with the corresponding provisions in the Secretary\u2019s regulations. This conflict presents the preemption issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Appellees attempt to avoid preemption by earnestly arguing \u201csince Congress enacted only minimum standards, the states were free to enact higher standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Entered only for the purpose of plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the parties stipulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">The minimum nutritional requirements of the Michigan . . . Law are higher than the minimum nutritional requirements of the Federal Wholesome Meat Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">The trial court misinterpreted this stipulation when he found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">Plaintiffs have stipulated that the standards established under the Federal Wholesome Meat Act are minimum standards, not maximum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">The outer limits of the stipulation were set in a colloquy between court and counsel during oral argument. When the court asked counsel whether it was \u201cequitable . . . that the people of Michigan should have the quality of their meat reduced . . .\u201d counsel answered,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-15\">Now, if you want to get into that question, I think we should take proof on it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-16\">Counsel supplemented this by adding,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjP\">. . . if there is a question aside from higher nutritional requirements rather than have the court come to certain conclusions with respect to whether this is good or whether that is bad, that is a matter of scientific proof, and if the Court is going to consider that aspect of it, we would like the opportunity to present proof on that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-18\">Thus, appellants did not stipulate that the \u201cquality\u201d or \u201cwholesomeness\u201d of their sausage was inferior. They merely stipulated that the Michigan nutritional requirements, presumably the protein requirement, was higher than under the Federal Act. They isolated that fact so the court could determine whether this and other conflicting Michigan provisions were preempted by the Federal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-19\">Not as to other conflicts where the Federal regulations are more demanding, but as to Michigan\u2019s requirement of 12% protein content the trial court was correct when he stated \u201ccompliance with the Michigan Act is compliance with the Federal Act.\u201d Moreover, were there no other ingredient requirement in the regulations compliance with the Michigan 12% requirement would obviously comply with the 11.2% resulting federal requirement. However, the Secretary, by prescribing maximum percentages of other ingredients in sausage has, in effect, established that the percentage of protein may be less than 12% (actually 11.2%). The only way to achieve Michigan\u2019s 12% protein requirement is to diminish the permissible percentages of other ingredients. To do so, however, would allow Michigan or any other state to interfere with the permissible percentage of ingredients which the Secretary, under the Federal Act, is entitled to prescribe. That is the very situation which Congress sought to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-20\">The Michigan protein requirement may be from the consumer\u2019s point of view a beneficial and wholesome requirement. Nevertheless, in <em>Quaker Oats, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>pra, </em>318 U.S. 232, 63 S.Ct. 597, the Supreme Court expressly ruled that a federal regulation may exclude an ingredient from a food product even though beneficial and wholesome.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">We must reject at the outset the argument earnestly pressed upon us that the statute does not contemplate a regulation excluding a wholesome and beneficial ingredient from the definition and standard of identity of a food. The statutory purpose to fix a definition of identity of an article of food sold under its common or usual name would be defeated if producers [states] were free to add ingredients, however wholesome, which are not within the definition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Hence, the protein content implied in the regulations is valid and enforceable even though it has the effect o'f reducing an ingredient requirement that may result in higher nutritional value for a meat food product. It is equally true that the congressional purpose to standardize identity and composition of meat food products would be defeated if states were free to require ingredients, however wholesome, which are not within the Secretary\u2019s standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The Federal Act itself manifests a congressional intent to prescribe uniform standards of identity and composition. This intent is expressed in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 601(n)(7) which defines as misbranded a meat food product in \u201ccommerce\u201d which does not conform to the Secretary\u2019s standards of identity or composition. If the meat food product does not conform with the regulations then it is misbranded irrespective of where in \u201ccommerce\u201d it may be transported. Thus, appellee\u2019s contention \u201cthat Congress did not intend to establish uniform national standards of identity for meat food products\u201d is refuted by the express language of the Act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The keystone conclusion of the trial court that the Federal Act establishes only minimum requirements will now be tested by determining whether 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 678 is preemptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Thus, the ultimate issue is whether the marking, labeling, and ingredient provisions of the Michigan Law are in addition to, or different than the Secretary\u2019s regulations governing sausage and, whether the provisions of the Michigan Law can be enforced against meat food products (sausage) prepared by appellants for shipment in \u201ccommerce\u201d and their consequent sale in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">In considering the application of the Supremacy Clause, Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, Dir. Dept. of Agriculture of Calif., 373 U.S. 132, 142, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 1217, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963), specifies two preemption tests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">The principle to be derived from our decisions is that federal regulation of a field of commerce should not be deemed preemptive of state regulatory power in the absence of persuasive reasons \u2014 either that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion, or that the Congress has unmistakably so ordained. See, <em>e. g., </em>Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit [362 U.S. 440, 80 S.Ct. 813, 4 L.Ed.2d 852 (I960)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">The federal regulations concerning sausage cannot be separately tested against each corresponding ingredient requirement of the Michigan Law that fixes a higher standard. The Secretary\u2019s definitions and standards of identity or composition relate to finished products and are unitary. Each ingredient requirement is dependent upon the other requirements. The interdependent nature of these uniform national standards precludes applying the first preemption test. The second test of preemption does apply to these higher Michigan ingredient requirements. In 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 678 \u201cCongress has unmistakably so ordained\u201d federal regulation of a field of commerce. That section\u2019s preemptive language provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">Marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements in addition to, or different than, those made under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>this chapter may not be imposed by any State . . . with respect to articles prepared at any establishment under inspection in accordance with the requirements under subchapter I of this chapter ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">It is apparent that this language does not designate that the federal standards prescribed by the Secretary in fixing ingredient requirements shall only be minimum standards. On the contrary, under the clear wording of Section 678 \u201cmarking, labeling ... or ingredient requirements\u201d imposed by a state would be \u201cin addition to, or different than [those made by the Secretary]\u201d whether the state \u201cmarking, labeling or ingredient requirements\u201d are lower or higher than the corresponding requirements made by the Secretary under the Federal Act. Thus, by prohibiting a state\u2019s imposition of \u201cmarking, labeling ... or ingredient requirements\u201d which are \u201cin addition to, or different than [those made by the Secretary],\u201d Congress has \u201cunmistakably . . . ordained\u201d that the Federal Act fixes the sole standards. The Michigan Law\u2019s specifications of Grade 1 sausage are preempted by the federal regulations because they prescribe standards that are \u201cin addition to, or different than, those made\u201d by the Secretary under the regulations pertaining to sausage.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The remaining language of Section 678 corroborates that Congress has unmistakably ordained that \u201cmarking, labeling ... or ingredient requirements\u201d prescribed by the Secretary completely preempt this field of commerce. After banning a state\u2019s imposition of additional or different \u201crequirements,\u201d Section 678 continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">[B]ut any State . . . may, consistent with the requirements under this chapter, exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the Secretary over articles required to be inspected under said subchapter I, for the purpose of preventing the distribution for human food purposes of any such articles which are adulterated or misbranded and are outside of such an establishment ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The concurrent action of a state, permitted by this language, only applies to adulterated or misbranded articles. These words are necessarily used as defined in the Act. Under U.S.C. \u00a7 601(n)(7) a meat food product is misbranded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-12\">if it purports to be or is represented as a food for which a definition and standard of identity or composition has been prescribed by regulations of the Secretary under section 607 of this title unless (A) it conforms to such definition and standard</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">Permissible concurrent enforcement by a state under Section 678 would apply only to meat food products that satisfy this definition of misbranding. In its concurrent enforcement a state would not be permitted to prevent the distribution in commerce of any article that \u201cconforms\u201d to the \u201cdefinition and standard of identity or composition.\u201d Thus, Congress is ordaining uniform national ingredient requirements prescribed by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">The last sentence of Section 678 adds further corroboration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-15\">This chapter shall not preclude any State . . . from making requirement or taking other action, consistent with this chapter, with respect to any other matters regulated under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-17\">By permitting state action \u201cwith respect to any other matters regulated under this chapter,\u201d Congress is unmistakably ordaining that a state may not take action with reference to \u201cmarking, labeling, ... or ingredient requirements' in addition to, or different than, those made under this chapter . . . . \u201d State requirements must be \u201cconsistent\u201d with the Federal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-19\">Congressional debates are devoid of any discussion of Section 408 of the Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 678). However, in view of its unambiguous language, Section 408 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>reflects unequivocal legislative purpose to make the Federal Act preemptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">This assessment of congressional intent is reinforced by later congressional action in amending the Poultry Products Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 467e (1968). The amendment added the precise preemptive language of Section 678 of the Federal Wholesome Meat Act. It is significant that this occurred after the Second Circuit in Swift &amp; Co. v. Wickham, 364 F.2d 241 (2 Cir. 1966), cert. den. 385 U.S. 1036, 87 S.Ct. 776, 17 L.Ed.2d 683 (1967), held that the Poultry Products Inspection Act did not preclude the State of New York from imposing labeling requirements for turkey in addition to and different than those requirements by the Federal Act. Compare, Meat Trade Institute, Inc. v. McLaughlin, Comm\u2019r. (1971), 37 A.D.2d 456, 326 N.Y.S.2d 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">By the second preemption test of <em>Florida Avocado Growers, supra </em>the Michigan labeling requirements are preempted. Indeed, even under the first preemption test the labeling requirements are preempted; and the State of Michigan so concedes. Since the federal regulations make no provision for Grade 1 sausage, or for labeling sausage Grade 1, it is manifest that \u201cthe nature of the [federally] regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The congressional history preceding the passage of the Federal Act discloses that these debates principally involved Subchapter III, federal-state cooperation, a pioneer program instituted by the Act. There is a clear expression of congressional intent to limit federal action under Subchapter III (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 661 et seq.) to situations in which a state has failed to develop or is not enforcing \u201crequirements at least equal to those imposed under subchapter I and IV of this chapter.\u201d This limitation applies only to Subchapter III.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Moreover, congressional debates also make clear that if conditions warrant the Secretary may exercise authority under Subchapter III over the slaughter of animals that are prepared for use as human food solely for distribution within the state. Otherwise, the authority of the Secretary under the Act extends only to the described activities that are \u201cin commerce.\u201d Hence, under Subchapter III the State of Michigan may continue to enforce the Michigan Law as to meat food products prepared in Michigan solely for distribution in the State as long as its law and its enforcement imposes requirements at least equal to those imposed under Subchapters I and IV of the Federal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Michigan\u2019s desire to preserve from preemption its Comminuted Meat Law, a law that has protected consumers since its enactment in 1952, is understandable. Nevertheless, in view of the clear and complete preemption ordained by Congress, this Court must enforce the Supremacy Clause and declare that the Federal Act preempts certain provisions of the Michigan Law. It is determined and declared that as to the transportation and sale \u201cin commerce\u201d of meat food products described in regulations, 9 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 319.140; 319.141; 319.142; 319.143; 319.144; 319.180; and 319.181 the marking, labeling, and ingredient requirements of the federal regulations preempt the following provisions of the Michigan Law: Section 12.-964(2), Sec. 2(a)(1), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.-582(a)(1), except for the last two sentences (added by amendment in 1968); Sec. 2(a)(2); (Section 12.964(3), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.583; Section 12.964(4), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.584; Section 12.964(5), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.585; Section 12.964(7), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.587; Section 12.964(8), M.C.L. A. \u00a7 289.588; and Section 12.964(10), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.590.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">1. M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(2) (a), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.582(a), provides that \u201cGrade 1 sau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>sage shall consist only of skeletal fresh meat prepared from the animal carcass of cattle, swine or sheep or a mixture of such meats, or the striated muscle of chicken or turkey . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">2. Skeletal meat is defined as \u201cany clean edible part of striated muscle including head meat and cheek meat.\u201d M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(1)(i), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.-581 (i). Meat is defined as \u201cthe properly dressed, clean, sound flesh derived from cattle, swine or sheep . . . .\u201d M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(1) (h), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.-581(h). A carcass is \u201cthe commercially prepared or dressed body of any cattle, sheep or swine.\u201d M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(1) (g), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.581(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">3. A meat food product is \u201cany article capable of use as human food which is made wholly or in part from any meat or other portion of the carcass of any cattle, sheep, swine, or goats . . . .\u201d 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.2(vv). Carcass is defined as \u201call parts, including viscera, of any slaughtered livestock.\u201d 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.2(ss). However, 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 318.6 prohibits as ingredients in meat food products intestines and certain other named internal organs.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">4. Meat is defined as \u201cThe part of the muscle of any cattle, sheep, swine, or goats, which is skeletal or which is found in the tongue, in the diaphragm, in the heart, or in the esophagus . . . . It does not include the muscle found in the lips, snout or ears.\u201d 9 C. F.R. \u00a7 301.2(tt).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">5. A meat byproduct is \u201cAny part capable of use as human food, other than meat, which has been derived from one or more cattle, sheep, swine, or goats.\u201d 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.2 (vv).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">Thus, the Michigan Law requires, basically, skeletal-type meat in Grade 1 sausage whereas the regulations permit the use of internal organs, with specific exceptions, meat by-products and meat as ingredients in sausage.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">6. While the Michigan Law, M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(2)(a), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.582(a) permits the sale of Grade 1 sausage prepared only from the striated muscle of chicken or turkey, subsections (f), (g), and (h) do not permit chicken or turkey to be added as an ingredient to any other sausage. By contrast, however, the regulations defining Cooked, Smoked Sausage (9 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.180) permits frankfurters, bologna and similar sausages to contain \u201cpoultry products which, individually or in combination, are not in excess of 15 percent of the total ingredients excluding water, in the sausage.\u201d Poultry products include chicken or turkey meat, skin, fat, gizzard and the heart or liver of a chicken or turkey. Sec. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 81.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">7. The regulation governing Cooked, Smoked Sausage (9 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.180) permits the use of partially defatted beef and/or pork fatty tissue \u201cin an amount not exceeding 15 percent of the meat and meat byproduct ingredients.\u201d Partially defatted beef and pork fatty tissue are beef and pork by-products. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 319.1(e) and 319.29(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-18\">8. Because the Michigan Law defines Grade .1 sausage as consisting \u201conly of skeletal fresh meat\u201d the statute by definition precludes the use of beef and pork byproducts, poultry and poultry products, and goat meat and goat meat byproducts. However, under the regulations they are permissible ingredients.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-19\">The Michigan statute prohibits the use in Grade 1 sausage of: \u201cHeart, tongue, liver cracklings [cooked rind] or crackling meal, tripe [stomach], lungs, melts [spleen], eyes, stomachs, weasand meats [windpipe, esophagus, or throat], udder, lips, ears or snouts.\u201d M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(2) (a) (2), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.582 (a)(2). Because sausage is defined as a \u201cmeat food product\u201d prepared in part from \u201cmeat byproducts\u201d and because a \u201cmeat byproduct\u201d is defined as \u201cany part capable of use as human food, other than meat\u201d all of the above-mentioned articles would be, under the regulations, permissible ingredients in sausage.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>9. The Michigan Law permits the addition to Grade 1 sausage of water or ice, if not excessive. The amount is unspecified. M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(2) (a), M.C. L. A. \u00a7 289.582(a). However, the statute limits the overall moisture content in the finished product to 65%. M.S.A. \u00a7 12.-964(2) (a)(1), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.582(a) (1). The regulation also permits the addition of water or ice but limits the amount of such water or ice to \u201can amount not to exceed 3 percent of the total ingredients.\u201d 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.140. However, if the sausage is Cooked, Smoked Sausage (9 C.F.R. '\u00a7 319.180) it \u201cshall contain no more than 10 percent of added water.\u201d The Michigan Law requires a \u201cprotein content of 12 percent.\u201d M. S.A. \u00a7 12.964(2)(a)(1), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.582(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">There is no federal regulation governing overall moisture or protein content. Appellants and the United States Government, in an <em>amicus </em>brief, advance a formula, unchallenged by the appellees that permits computation of moisture and protein content. For Cooked, Smoked Sausage, 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.180, this section fixes a maximum of 30% fat, and 10% added water. Curative agents, condiments, and binders or extenders add 4%. This leaves 56% moisture and protein. Applying a ratio recognized by the Department of Agriculture of 4:1 moisture to protein, protein totals 11.2% and overall moisture totals 54.8%.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">If Cooked, Smoked Sausage is \u201call meat\u201d or \u201call species\u201d sausage then 9 C. F.R. \u00a7 319.180 allows a maximum of 30% fat, 10% added water, minimal amounts of condiments or curing agents but no binders or extenders. <em>Cf. </em>Federation of Homemakers v. Butz, 466 F.2d 462 (C.A.D.C.1972). Applying the same ratio, protein totals 12% and overall moisture 58%.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">10. The Michigan Law limits the amount of \u201cnon-fat. dry milk solids or dry whole milk\u201d to 4 pounds per 100 pounds of sausage. M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(2) (a)(1), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.582(a)(1). The regulations classify nonfat dry milk, calcium reduced skim milk and dried milk as binders or extenders. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.140. All sausage in which binders or extenders are permitted \u201cshall contain no more than 3.5 percent\u201d binders or extenders. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.140. Binders or extenders are permitted in Sausage Generally (9 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.140), Breakfast Sausage (9 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.143) and Cooked, Smoked Sausage (9 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.180).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">11. Under the Michigan Law, \u201ctrimmable fat\u201d permitted in pork, breakfast or roasted sausage may not exceed 45%. M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(2) (a) (1), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.582(a)(1). The regulations, however, permit Fresh Pork, Breakfast and Smoked Pork Sausage to contain \u201ctrimmable fat\u201d in an amount not to exceed 50%. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 319.141, 319.143 and 319.160.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">12. M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(2) (a), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.582(a), permits the addition of \u201csodium or potassium nitrate, sodium or potassium nitrite, ascorbic acid, or the salts thereof\u201d to Grade 1 sausage but in unspecified amounts. The regulations, while permitting the use of those chemical substances, limits the amount of such chemicals. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 318.7(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">13. The Michigan Law permits the addition of \u201ceggs or egg products, chives, tomatoes, parsley, peppers, onions, garlic, [and] celery\u201d to Grade 1 sausage. The regulations make no provision specifically allowing those substances to be added to any sausage. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 319.140-319.181. However, it seems to be conceded that chives, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic are flavoring agents and thus proper ingredients of sausage. Eggs or egg products, tomatoes and celery are not specified by the regulations as permissible ingredients in sausage. Even though the Michigan Law does not <em>require </em>their addition, a conflict exists to the extent that they are permitted ingredients.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">14. The Michigan Law provides that Pork, Breakfast and Roasted Sausage \u201cshall not contain added water or ice.\u201d The regulations, on the other hand, permit Pork and Breakfast Sausage to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tain water or ice not to exceed 3% of the total ingredients used. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 319.141 and 319.143.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">15. The Michigan Law prohibits the addition of artificial and vegetable coloring to sausage (M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(2) (a)(2), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.582(a)(2), while the regulations permit the use of coloring matter and dyes if approved by the Administrator. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.7(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">16. Under the Michigan Law \u201cNo product shall be sold as sausage . which is not graded . [Grade 1] and which does not meet the specifications for grade 1 sausage.\u201d M. S.A. \u00a7 12.964(3), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.583. By contrast, however, there is no regulation requiring or permitting a sausage product to be labeled Grade 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">17. M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(4), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.584, requires the name and address of the manufacturer to be plainly marked on each package. However, 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 317.2(c)(3) permits the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer or distributor. Alternately the phrase \u201cPrepared by\u201d or \u201cDistributed for\u201d may be used. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 317.-2(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">18. M.S.A. \u00a7 12.964(4), M.C.L.A. \u00a7 289.584, requires the name and address of the manufacturer to be affixed at least once per pound to smaller varieties of sausage. The regulations, however, permit the name and address of the manufacturer, packer or distributor to be affixed \u201con each 2 pounds of product.\u201d 9 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 316.10(b) and 317.-2(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">19.

[p]rovided [t]hat no such products shall be sold in colored natural casings.\u201d However, 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 319.7(c)(3) does permit coloring matter and dyes to be applied to natural casings, if approved by the Administrator in specific cases.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-11\">.
