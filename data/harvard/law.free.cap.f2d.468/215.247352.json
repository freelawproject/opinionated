In April 1972 she was notified of a 7V2% rent increase on her apartment, effective May 1, 1972. She refused to execute an amendment to her lease providing for the higher rent, and she was served with a notice to vacate her apartment. This was- followed by her present action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, in which she is seeking to enjoin collection of the rent increase as a violation of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 as amended<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Frankel denied appellant\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed her complaint. This appeal was taken from that judgment pursuant to \u00a7 211(e)(2) of the Economic Stabilization Act. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the decision of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-21\">The fundamental question presented by this case is whether the City of New York \u201ccontrols\u201d the rents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>in Pomonok Houses for the purposes of Price Commission Regulation 301.106 (b) (2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which establishes an exemption from the Price Commission\u2019s rent controls for residences which satisfy three criteria: (1) the federal, a state, or a local government must have provided financial assistance for the construction or purchase of the housing; (2) the assisting government must not own the housing; and (3) the monthly rent must be \u201cestablished or controlled\u201d by the assisting government. Appellant concedes that the first two criteria are satisfied here and therefore only the question of control is before this court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">It may be noted that neither the Congress nor the Price Commission has provided any express definition or guideline for the interpretation of the word \u201ccontrol\u201d as used in this regulation. In the context of another regulatory statute, the Communications Act of 1934, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">Congress did not imply artificial tests of control. This is an issue of fact to be determined by the special circumstances of each case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, 307 U.S. 125, 145, 59 S.Ct. 754, 764, 83 L.Ed. 1147 (1939). See also Gilbertville Trucking Co., Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 115, 83 S.Ct. 217, 9 L.Ed.2d 177 (1962); Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad Co. v. United States, 366 U.S. 745, 81 S.Ct. 1630, 6 L.Ed.2d 772 (1961). Therefore, absent a prescribed test for determining whether the City of New York \u201ccontrols\u201d the rents in Pomonok Houses, we look to the broad purpose of the exemption provided by Regulation 301.106(b)(2) and the overall relationship between the Housing Authority and the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">It is apparent that the purpose of the exemption is to avoid unnecessarily burdening the Price Commission in circumstances where rents are adequately supervised by some other government agency, federal, state or local. The Price Commission deliberately sought to avoid the creation of a two-tiered system of rent control where one tier already existed. As long as some government is protecting the tenants against rent increases violative of the purpose of the economic stabilization program, the Price Commission has chosen to defer to that government\u2019s specific form of control.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">Appellant Rykus contends that the power to control the rents in Pomonok Houses is absolutely vested in the Authority, and not in the City or any of its agencies, by virtue of New York Public Housing Law \u00a7 154, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-19\">Subject to the terms of any loan or subsidy contract with a government, the power to fix rents on a project shall rest exclusively with the authority ... .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The appellee, Housing Authority, on the other hand, contends that three factors modify \u00a7 154 in such a way that the power over rents, in the circumstances of the case, is removed from the Authority and rests in the hands of the City. The first of these is the power of the Mayor to appoint and remove the Chairman of the Authority at the Mayor\u2019s pleasure, and to appoint the other two members for five-year terms, though they are removable only for cause. While under these circumstances the Mayor may have a certain amount of moral and political suasion, it is not as conclusive as the Housing Authority asserts, and does not constitute a clear repository of the power to fix rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The second factor claimed by the Authority is that it is the agent of the City to carry out the clearing, replanning and reconstruction of areas where substandard housing exists. Administrative Code, City of New York, \u00a7 E46-3.0. But this is little more than a broad declaration of policy and is not enough to justify the conclusion that the provisions of \u00a7 154 are limited by a superior power in the City to fix rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The third factor, however, does provide a source of power in the City sufficient to support the holding of the trial court that under the circumstances the City had \u201ccontrol\u201d over the rents in Pomonok Houses for the purpose of Price Commission Regulation 301.-106(b)(2). This power stems from the provisions of the contract between the City and the Authority by which the City guaranteed the payment of the principal and interest on the bonds issued to finance the construction of the houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">The New York State Public Housing Law \u00a7 154, on which the appellant Rykus relies in her argument that the Authority has the exclusive power to fix rents, expressly provides that the Authority\u2019s power is \u201csubject to the terms of any loan or subsidy contract with a government . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">Under the contract in this case the Authority was required \u201cto maintain the Project as low rent housing for families of low income,\u201d and at the same time it was required by its terms \u201cto pay the principal of and interest upon the bonds that financed the project\u201d and the costs of its maintenance. \u00a7\u00a714 and 17.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also \u00a7 10 of the guaranty contract imposes upon the Authority the obligation to pay the principal and interest of the bonds that financed the project as they come due.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is clear that \u00a7 14(1) of the guaranty contract, when read in conjunction with \u00a7 10, imposes an absolute obligation on the Authority to keep rents at a sufficiently high level so that, with moneys derived from other sources, the Authority will be able to meet its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>obligations on the bonds and pay the operating expenses of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">As Judge Frankel said in his opinion, \u201c. . . the authoritative materials show that defendant Housing Authority is hedged about by City controls exerting pressure upon rents in two directions\u2014 so that costs to eligible tenants will be as low as possible, but also so that the Authority\u2019s rental income will be sufficient to meet its and the City\u2019s broad obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">It is undisputed that the Authority had not charged sufficient rent to meet the obligations under the contract and is currently suffering a deficit of millions of dollars in its housing programs. Therefore it is under an enforceable, legal obligation to the City to raise the rents in city-aided housing projects. As there is no allegation or evidence that the revenues from this <em>TVz% </em>rent increase will exceed those mandated by \u00a7\u00a7 14(1) (a) and (b), we need not consider appellant\u2019s contention that \u00a7 14(1) (d) gives the Authority unlimited power to raise rents even further. At least to the extent that the rents are raised no higher than is necessary to satisfy the Authority\u2019s absolute contractual obligations under \u00a7\u00a7 14(1) (a) and (b), the increase is under the control of the City for the purposes of Regulations 301.106(b)(2) and therefore exempt from Price Commission control. Certainly there is neither rule nor policy of the Price Commission which seeks to require the Authority or the City in such circumstances to operate the project at a loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The Authority operates 188 public housing projects of which 27 are city-aided, and the rest are either federal or state aided. The 7%% rent increase was imposed upon all of the projects\u2014 federal and state financed as well as those like Pomonok, which were City financed. The federal and state rent control bodies approved of the same 7%% rent increases. This tends to make somewhat academic the claim of the appellant that she is suffering because her rent increase was not approved by a governmental body of the City comparable to those which controlled rents in federal and state financed projects. All of these 188 projects were deficit operations and there is no claim that the rent increase was improper as imposed upon the federal and state financed projects; nor were there distinguishing characteristics of the 27 City financed developments which made the <em>TVz% </em>increase unfair and unreasonable as to them though fully justified in the cases of those financed by the federal or state governments. We agree with the trial court that it would be absurd to read the federal price regulations to exempt the 160 or so projects aided by federal and state funds while leaving the 27 city-aided projects subject to the rules governing uncontrolled private landlords, and that such a construction of the regulations should be avoided, if in fairness, it is possible to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">It is true that, unlike the Authority\u2019s contracts with the federal and state governments covering projects for which they provide financial assistance, the guaranty contracts for city-aided projects do not make specific provision for prior approval of proposed rent schedules by any designated official or agency.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, it appears that the City\u2019s only recourse in the event of its dissatisfaction with an Authority decision concerning rents, beyond the May- or\u2019s power to remove the Chairman of the Authority, is to bring a legal action against the Authority to enforce the guaranty contract. While we recognize that the Price Commission may have had in mind rent supervision along the lines provided for federal and state aided projects when it promulgated Regulation 301.106(b)(2), we conclude that the power of New York City to enforce this guaranty contract by a legal action is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>sufficient to place \u201ccontrol\u201d over rents in the hands of the City to the extent that the guaranty contract specifically regulates the rents that may be charged. It is conceivable that even if prior approval by a city rent board or official were required, the Authority might act without such approval or defy the ruling by the board or official. In that event the City\u2019s only recourse would be an action in the courts. This is the only method of enforcement available to any statutorily designated rent control agency. For example, even if we held that these apartments were under the control of the Price Commission,- the mandate of that body would be enforceable only by means of action in the courts. Therefore, for the purpose of deciding in a given set of circumstances whether or not \u201ccontrol\u201d within the meaning of Regulation 301.-106, exists, it does not make any real difference whether the underlying basis for the action derives from a contract or a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The City has a substantial and important role in the determination of the challenged increase, including the fulfillment of its duty to maintain the projects as low-income housing. The tenants of Pomonok Houses are as protected by this method of control as are the tenants of federal and state aided projects by the alternative system. The nature and extent of the control exercised by the City brings the case within those which the Price Commission intended to leave to the responsibility of the agencies or governmental bodies charged with fixing rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The appellant\u2019s remaining points require only brief comment. First, appellant has suggested that exempting Pomonok Houses from the federal rent controls would violate \u201cthe Equal Protection Acts [sic] of the United States Constitution\u201d because other tenants are protected by those controls. The Supreme Court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">A statutory classification in the area of social welfare is consistent with Equal Protection if it is \u2018rationally based and free from invidious discrimination.\u2019 Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 487, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 [1970].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S. 78, 81, 92 S.Ct. 254, 257, 30 L.Ed.2d 231 (1971). It is perfectly rational to exempt from Price Commission control, housing whose rents are controlled by another government or agency thereof.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">Finally, appellant claims that the district court erred in its failure to hold a full evidentiary hearing at which the question of the degree of consultation between the Authority and the City could have been more fully explored, but the appellant waived her right to a hearing in the trial court<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; and, she does not deny that consultations took place before the rent increase was put into effect. The thrust of her argument on this point is that such consultations are not mandated by statute or by the guaranty contract, and therefore should be given no legal effect. But this is an issue of law, not fact; consequently there was no reason to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">The judgment of the district court denying an injunction and dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-13\">.

In his oral argument before this Court, counsel for appellants interjected the offhand suggestion that New York City has not \u201cprovided financial assistance for the construction\u201d of Pomonok Houses. This point was not seriously pressed, but even if it had been, we would have no difficulty in holding that the City\u2019s guarantee of the bonds which financed the construction of Pomonok Houses constituted financial assistance for the purposes of this regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">.
