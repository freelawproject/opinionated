McCormick, 468 F.2d 68 (10th Cir. 1972). We find it controlling on the principal issues presented herein, and therefore affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-14\">Five alleged errors are herein charged:</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-15\">1. That the stopping of vehicles on a public highway so far from the Mexican border was a denial of the right of free passage on highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-17\">2. There existed a lack of probable cause for arrest without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-18\">3. Evidence obtained by the warrant-less search of defendant\u2019s vehicle was not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-19\">4. Border patrol agents have no authority to search without a warrant in an attempt to find marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-20\">5. The government failed to establish by competent evidence that the search occurred within 100 air miles from the international border with Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-21\">In considering this case, we are bound (as was the Court in <em>McCormick, supra), </em>to view the facts in the light most favorable to the government. United States v. Ireland, 456 F.2d 74 (10th Cir. 1972). This we do, and compare the facts herein to the facts of <em>McCormick, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-22\">I. <em>Facts in United States v. McCormick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-23\">The latter case reveals that on November 30, 1971, McCormick was a passenger in a G.M.C. \u201cvan\u201d driven by one Sanchez, which was stopped at a United States Immigration &amp; Naturalization Border Patrol check-point, near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, some 98 miles from the Republic of Mexico border, by border inspectors looking for aliens. Two inspectors approached the vehicle. One inspector saw a plaid bag and a large black tarpaulin within the car, and the other inspector \u201cdetected the odor of marijuana from within the vehicle.\u201d The vehicle was ordered to be taken to a siding for inspection. There an inspector entered the van to look under the tarpaulin. He saw \u201ca plastic bean bag type chair\u201d and when he attempted to move it, a \u201cpaper wrapped brick object\u201d fell out. When unwrapped, this object was found to be a brick of marijuana. Further search revealed 164 bricks, or 1,400 pounds of marijuana. Both McCormick and Sanchez were arrested, and a subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>search of an airline flight bag revealed another marijuana brick.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">II. <em>Facts in this case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">At 10:30 p. m., on December 10, 1971 (ten days after the McCormick arrest), defendant Anderson drove his vehicle (some kind of a \u201cvan\u201d) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> up to the stop sign which, with red \u201ccones\u201d, \u201cbarricaded\u201d the highway at a United States Immigration &amp; Naturalization Border Patrol check-point, three miles north of the city limits of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. (This check-point was described by the Border Patrol Inspectors \u2014and found by the trial judge \u2014 to be 98 air miles north of the Republic of Mexico border.) At this point, border inspectors were looking for aliens. The first inspector \u201csmelled what appeared to be the odor of marijuana.\u201d The vehicle was ordered to pull over to the side for further inspection. There a second inspector, having been told the first inspector had smelled marijuana, looked into the van from outside, with a flashlight, and saw an \u201cexpended marijuana cigarette\u201d \u2014 (a \u201croach\u201d) \u2014 in the ash tray of Anderson\u2019s van. The second inspector, familiar with the odor, also smelled marijuana \u201cwhen the window was rolled down.\u201d He also saw a foot locker with a part of a \u201cblack plastic garbage bag\u201d sticking out of it. This black bag is a \u201ccommon container\u201d used to transport marijuana in that area. A search of the van\u2019s contents for marijuana revealed marijuana in the foot locker, in a black suitcase, and in a white suitcase, with one package of marijuana open and spilled \u2014 some 50 pounds of marijuana in all.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-15\">III. <em>Stopping the vehicle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-16\">We consider the right of Immigration &amp; Naturalization Border Patrol officers to stop vehicles on the highway, and, without warrants, search them for aliens, is well established (both by statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and case law),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if \u201cwithin a reasonable distance\u201d of this country\u2019s external boundaries. United States v. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>468 F.2d at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-17\">Thus the <em>stopping </em>of appellant's vehicle was lawful if the check-point was within \u201ca reasonable distance\u201d from the Mexican border.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court (Roa-Rodriquez v. United States, 410 F.2d 1206 (10th Cir. 1969)), and other circuits, have held that within 100 miles is such a reasonable distance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-18\">IV. <em>The vehicle search.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-19\">The search for marijuana, though without a search warrant, under the circumstances herein existing, which created probable cause, was reasonable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1348-20\">\u201cIt is well settled that a valid search of a vehicle moving on a public highway may be had without a warrant, <em>if probable cause for the search exists, </em>i. e., facts sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense is being committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>Fernandez v. United States, <em>supra, </em>321 F.2d 283 at 286-287 (emphasis added) citing: Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925); Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949); Husty v. United States, 282 U.S. 694, 51 S.Ct. 240, 75 L.Ed. 629 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\"><em>Cf. </em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971) (quoted in <em>McCormick, supra, </em>468 F.2d at 72-74, and particularly at 73); Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970); Trusty v. Oklahoma, 360 F.2d 173 (10th Cir. 1966); Murray v. United States, 351 F.2d 330 (10th Cir. 1965) cert. denied 383 U.S. 949, 86 S.Ct. 1207, 16 L.Ed.2d 211 (1966); and Valenzuela-Garcia v. United States, 425 F.2d 1170 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-7\">The facts .of this case are even stronger than those in <em>McCormick, supra, </em>because here there existed not only the \u201cplain smell\u201d of marijuana, recognized as such by two <em>experienced </em>officers, but the seeing by one officer of the expended marijuana cigarette \u2014 the \u201croach\u201d \u2014 in the ash tray within the van prior to any search. Thus, the \u201cplain view\u201d of narcotics existed in addition to the \u201cplain smell\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-8\">We hold here, to paraphrase <em>McCormick, supra, </em>468 F.2d at 74:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1349-9\">\u201cWe hold that Agent Harrington had probable cause to conduct the warrantless search of the van based upon Agent Woolford\u2019s detecting of the odor of marijuana; Harrington\u2019s own plain view of the partially smoked marijuana roach; his own detection of the odor of marijuana; the \u2018rattled appearance\u2019 of McCormick when the search started; and Harrington\u2019s prior plain view of the black plastic garbage bag frequently used to carry marijuana in the New Mexico border area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1349-12\">The evidence produced by such search was therefore admissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1349-13\">V. <em>Check-point.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1349-14\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s charge that there was \u201cno proof\u201d that the established check-point was within 100 miles of the external boundaries of the United States, there was direct testimony of Agent Gomez (R.T. p. 97) that it had been measured by plane flights, and was 98 air miles from the border. While the trial judge, having tried several cases involving this particular check-point, was willing to take judicial notice of the distance involved, it was not necessary for him to do so, because of the foregoing <em>uncontradicted </em>testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-15\">One other point deserves comment. The defendant was charged with the possession of marijuana with intent to distribute it. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The defendant did not testify, nor was any evidence introduced on his behalf. The amount of marijuana discovered was approximately 50 pounds. There was testimony from the prosecution that such an amount of marijuana would enable a user thereof to roll approximately 1,000 cigarettes to the pound; a total here of 50,000 cigarettes. The implied inference that the amount of marijuana involved was not intended solely for the appellant\u2019s personal use \u2014 (if any was), was an inference which could be properly drawn by the trier of fact. Here it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-16\">Finding no error, the conviction of appellant is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1348-7\">. \u201cProbably\u201d a Chevrolet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1348-8\">. When booked, the appellant wore an overcoat, in the pocket of which there was found a ldastic bag containing a pipe and loose marijuana. The pipe scrapings were partially burned marijuana. The \u201croach\u201d found in the ashtray was later found to contain marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>1357 </em>authorizes an immigration officer, <em>without </em>warrant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS1F\">(2) to board and search for aliens . . . any . . . vehicle, .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1348-11\">.
