We reject that contention and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-17\">By an indictment returned on October 8, 1971, appellant was charged with having violated 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4704(a) and 4705(a), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174. The indictment alleged the violations occurred on April 29, 1971. Pursuant to a jury verdict, appellant was convicted on all three counts. He appealed and filed a pro se brief. Thereafter, this court, sua sponte, appointed Frederick C. Black-ledge, Esquire, of Des Moines, Iowa, to represent appellant. Mr. Blackledge has responsibly discharged his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-18\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention is that because Congress had repealed the statutes on which his conviction rests, and because the repeal became effective on May 1, 1971,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after the acts for which he was convicted but before he was indicted therefor, the indictment is null and void and therefore that the conviction must be reversed with directions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>At common law, the repeal of a statute would abate all incomplete prosecutions thereunder unless the repealer contained a savings clause. <em>See </em>United States v. Tynen, 78 U.S. [11 Wall.] 88, 20 L.Ed. 153 (1871). However, Congress has reversed that common law rule with the enactment of a general savings statute, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-4\">\u201cThe repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide, and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">The plain meaning of this statute is that \u201cpenalties accruing while a statute was in force may be prosecuted after its repeal, unless there is an express provision to the contrary in the repealing statute.\u201d United States v. Brown, 429 F.2d 566, 568 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">In an attempt to find in Pub. Law 91-513 an \u201cexpress provision\u201d for the abatement of prosecutions under the repealed statutes, appellant in both his pro se and appointed counsel briefs turns somewhat incongruously to the specific savings clause of the repealing statute. This clause, \u00a7 1103(a), Pub. Law 91-513, 84 Stat. 1294, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-7\">\u201cPending Proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-8\">Sec. 1103(a). Prosecutions for any violation of law occurring prior to the effective date of section 1101 shall not be affected by the repeals or amendments made by such section or section 1102, or abated by reason thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1456-9\">In contending this savings clause is somehow an \u201cexpress provision\u201d taking this repealer out of the general non-abatement rule of 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, appellant asserts (1) that since there is a general savings clause, this specific savings clause can have no purpose unless it differs from the general clause, and (2) that the specific clause differs from the general in that it applies to allow prosecutions only if the proceedings had commenced, i. e., indictment had issued, prior to the effective date of the repeal-er. Appellant contends this construction of \u00a7 1103(a) is inferred by its caption \u201cPending Proceedings\u201d and therefore that we should read \u00a7 1103(a) as referring only to \u201cProsecutions . occurring prior to the effective date of\u201d the repealer rather than \u201cany violation of law occurring prior\u201d thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-11\">We think, however, that the plain language of \u00a7 1103(a) refutes appellant\u2019s argument. <em>Accord, </em>United States v. Caldwell, 463 F.2d 590 (3rd Cir. 1972). <em>See </em>United States v. Bradley, 455 F.2d 1181, 1190-1191 (1st Cir.), cert. granted, 407 U.S. 908, 92 S.Ct. 2438, 32 L.Ed.2d 682 (1972). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1455-10\">. Sec. 1105(a) of the repealing statute, Pub.Law 91-513, 84 Stat. 1295, provides that \u201cthis title shall become effective on the first day of the seventh calendar month that begins after the day immediately preceding the date of enactment.\u201d Since the title was enacted on October 27, 1970, that date would be May 1, 1971.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
