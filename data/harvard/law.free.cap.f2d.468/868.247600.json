Expenses incurred by the Foundation in producing the plays were to be assigned to one of five specified categories: \u201cgeneral and administrative,\u201d \u201csubscription campaign,\u201d \u201cproduction,\u201d \u201ctheatre break-in,\u201d and \u201coperating.\u201d The contract specified maximum amounts to be paid under each of the five headings and established criteria for determining what types of expenses should be placed in each category.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-21\">In accordance with the procedure specified, at the end of the contract term the Foundation\u2019s accountants submitted for certification to Ford\u2019s accountants itemized lists of expenditures allegedly incurred under the contract. After examining this demand for payment, Ford\u2019s accountants determined that some of the expenditures did not fit within the definitions provided in the contract and advised Ford that it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>not pay them. The Foundation thereupon brought suit for the disputed expenses, alleging that under the contract its accountants <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were authorized to make a final and binding determination of what expenses were payable by Ford. Ford denied this, alleging that under the terms of the contract its accountants were given the power to determine what expenses were chargeable to what category and were to be paid by Ford. After receiving testimony on what the parties intended under the contract, the District Court decided that Ford\u2019s accountants were to have the power to make a final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">We hold that by the unambiguous terms of the contract neither the accountants of Ford nor those of the Foundation were intended to have the authority to make a final determination of what amounts were payble under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">A brief description of the contract\u2019s structure and contents is necessary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Paragraph 3 of the contract contains five subparagraphs \u2014 -one subparagraph each defining and establishing criteria for allocating expenses into the five categories. The first subparagraph deals with \u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d expenses, and states that these expenses are to be \u201cdefined in accordance with the accounting practice of [the Foundation\u2019s] accountants . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This language is omitted from the four remaining subparagraphs dealing with the other four categories of expenses, nor is there wording providing differently at this same place in the other four subparagraphs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Language at the beginning of paragraph 3 implies that payment under <em>any </em>of the five categories will be \u201cin the manner set forth in paragraph 5, after certification by [Ford\u2019s accountants] according to <em>recognized accounting principles </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">Paragraph 5 of the contract deals with the four categories of costs other than \u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d costs; <em>i.e., </em>the four categories that in paragraph three were not specifically described as to be \u201cdefined in accordance with the accounting practice of [the Foundation\u2019s] accountants . . . .\u201d With regard to each of these four categories, paragraph 5 states that \u201c[the Foundation] will submit for certification at the office of [Ford\u2019s] accountants <em>according to the </em>definition^] <em>set forth in paragraph 3 </em>and general accounting principles, a summary schedule [of expenses] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-17\">Pointing to the difference between what Ford\u2019s accountants are to do under paragraph 3 and what they are to do under paragraph 5, Ford makes the following analysis. Ford concedes, with apparent magnanimity, that under the language of paragraph 3 the Foundation\u2019s accountants are to have absolute discretion as to what expenditures will be allocated to the \u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d category.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The remaining four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>categories of expenses, however, are not to be \u201cdefined\u201d by the Foundation\u2019s accountants. Rather, they are to be determined and paid according to the provisions of paragraph 5, which states that Ford\u2019s accountants are to \u201cverify\u201d the expenditures \u201caccording to the definitions set forth in paragraph 3 . . . .\u201d Ford argues that this authority to \u201cverify\u201d the accounts according to the definitions of the four types of expenses means that Ford\u2019s accountants are to have the power to determine if payments are actually owing under the contract. In essence, Ford argues\u2019that its accountants\u2019 authority to \u201cverify\u201d the bills presented by the Foundation\u2019s accountants is synonymous with the power to act as a binding arbiter of what amounts are payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\"> Ford\u2019s analysis of the contract is correct in part. The language of paragraph 5 makes it crystal clear that the Foundation\u2019s accountants were <em>not </em>intended to be the final arbiters of what expenses must be paid by Ford.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It does not necessarily follow, however, that Ford\u2019s accountants are entitled to decide finally what expenses must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>paid under the four categories enumerated in paragraph 5. Paragraph 5 merely requires Ford to pay \u201cimmediately\u201d if the expenses submitted by the Foundation are \u201cverified\u201d by Ford\u2019s accountants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It does not say, however, that in the final analysis Ford will be excused from paying demands if they are not \u201cverified.\u201d Paragraph 5 no more makes Ford\u2019s accountants an arbiter of who must pay in conflicts between the parties than does paragraph 3 make the Foundation\u2019s accountants the arbiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">A rather decisive argument against making either set of accountants a final arbiter under either the first or the last four categories is that it sets up a theoretical and practical conflict within the corners of the contract. If the Foundation\u2019s accountants have the power to determine what <em>is </em>\u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d expenses under the first category, they have the power to determine what <em>is not </em>\u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d expense. By parity of reasoning, if Ford\u2019s interpretation is accepted, Ford\u2019s accountants would have the same power of classification, in or out, for the last four categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The practical \u2014 and completely unacceptable \u2014 result is illustrated here. Two of the several types of expenses rejected by Ford\u2019s accountants are salaries of ticket takers and ushers at Ford\u2019s Theatre in Washington. The Foundation\u2019s accountants have said these are <em>not </em>\u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d under category one (which appears to deal almost exclusively with expenses incurred at the Foundation office in New York City); Ford\u2019s accountants have said they do not fit within either of the last four categories, and have refused to \u201cverify\u201d them. There would appear to be nothing more obviously an expense of a theater production than ticket takers and ushers, yet the theory of accountants as final arbiters rules out its payment under <em>any </em>classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">The truth is that in this, as in virtually every other business contract, the parties did not intend to set up any <em>accountants </em>as being the <em>final arbiters </em>of whether disputed amounts are due. We find no statement or suggestion anywhere in the contract that the parties intended to grant such an extraordinary power to their respective accountants. Indeed, the language and structure of the contract compels the conclusion that the parties expected their accountants to perform the type of service that accountants ordinarily perform for businessmen. The Foundation\u2019s accountants were supposed to prepare a list of expenses that they believed payable under the definitions provided in paragraph 3. Ford\u2019s accountants under paragraph 5 were supposed to check these proposed lists of expenses and contest any of them that they did not believe were covered under the contract. This is exactly what the two sets of accountants did in this ease. Once an issue was raised by the accountants regarding whether an amount was due, it became a <em>legal </em>question whether the contested amount was actually due under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">This legal issue must be resolved by the District Court just as any other dispute under a contract is adjudicated. Upon remand the court should develop evidence, either before the court or by reference to a special master, on whether the contested expenses do in fact fit under any of the definitions given in paragraph 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">The decision of the District Court is vacated and the case is remanded for a determination of whether the disputed expenses are payable under the definitions provided in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-7\">. The Foundation\u2019s accountants were recognized specialists in accounting for the theatre industry, a fact upon which the Foundation relies heavily in its interpretation of the contract. Under the analysis we make here this fact is of no decisive import, except that it in some degree cuts against the other party\u2019s (Ford\u2019s) accountants being set up as a \u201cfinal arbiter\u201d as to what were legitimate expenses and as to which category they belonged in this theatre venture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b935-8\">.

Ford\u2019s graciousness in admitting that the Foundation\u2019s accountants were to be the final arbiters of what was payable under the \u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d category <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>is less than sheer generosity. Ford had already paid out the maximum amount payable under that category and could not have been called on to pay more, even if the Foundation\u2019s accountants \u201cdefined\u201d additional expenses as being \u201cgeneral and administrative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Ford\u2019s analysis that the Foundation\u2019s accountants would be the final arbiters of \u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d expenses bolsters its argument that Ford\u2019s accountants were to be the final arbiters of all other expenses. If it. is admitted that certain language in the contract provides that one set of accountants are the arbiters of \u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d expenses, there develops a certain superficial logic favoring the argument that the other set of accountants are to be the arbiters of all other expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">This logic is based on the assumption that, if some of the expenses are to be determined by accountants, then all of the expenses are to be determined by accountants. Since paragraph 5 makes it clear that the Foundation\u2019s accountants are not to determine expenses other than \u201cgeneral and administrative,\u201d it would follow that Ford\u2019s accountants must have been intended to determine them.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">It is unnecessary to decide whether the Foundation\u2019s accountants were intended to be the final arbiters of what were \u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d expenses since none of the payments under that section are being contested here. We believe, however, that the Foundation\u2019s accountants were not intended to be the final arbiters of what were \u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d expenses. Admittedly, paragraph 3 provided that the Foundation\u2019s accountants were to \u201cdefine\u201d the expenses payable under that subsection. This grant of authority was followed in the subparagraph, however, with a long description of <em>how </em>these expenses were to be defined. If the Foundation were to have had absolute discretion over what was to be paid under the \u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d heading, the precise definitions given under that subsection would have been unnecessary. It is more logical to conclude that the power granted the Foundation\u2019s accountants to \u201cdefine\u201d what were \u201cgeneral and administrative\u201d expenses was substantially similar to their duties under the other four categories of expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b936-12\">. The Foundation\u2019s argument that its accountants were to be the final arbiters of contract disputes was not actually based on the language of the contract. Rather, the Foundation\u2019s position rested on the testimony of various parties to the contract. They testified that their understanding had been that Ford\u2019s accountants were simply supposed to \u201ccheck the arithmetic\u201d of the expenditures submitted by the Foundation\u2019s accountants. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 27-32. This testimony is irrelevant, since we find that the contract was unambiguous on its face and that it clearly did not provide for the Foundation\u2019s accountants to be the final arbiters of contract disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">In any case, this testimony relied on by appellant is not inconsistent with our reading of the contract. It may well have been that one of the primary reasons Ford insisted on having its own accounting firm review the Foundation\u2019s bills was to \u201ccheck the arithmetic.\u201d This does not mean, however, that the contractors could not have granted an additional power to Ford\u2019s accountants, <em>i. e., </em>the power to \u201cverify\u201d the expenditures \u201caccording to the definitions set forth in paragraph 3 This additional power granted by paragraph 5 clearly indicates that Ford\u2019s accountants were not limited to checking arithmetic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b937-6\">.
