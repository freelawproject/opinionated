BYRNE, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b250-23\">As a result of a strip search of Herminia Gil de Avila (Herminia), two rubber prophylactics containing one and three quarters ounces of heroin were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>discovered as she \u201clowered her undergarments to her ankles.\u201d Despite this discovery, the district court granted Herminia\u2019s motion to suppress on the ground \u201cthat there were [no] facts to support the search of [Herminia].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">For purposes of the motion to suppress, the parties stipulated to the following: On August 22, 1971, a 1964 Chevrolet station wagon entered the United States from Mexico at the San Ysidro, California Port of Entry. Jose Avila was driving. Juana Avila was a front seat passenger. Regino Marquez and Herminia were the back seat passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Other than a loaf of bread, all four occupants of the car declared they brought nothing from Mexico. As he questioned the occupants, Customs Inspector Driscoll observed that Marquez\u2019 \u201ccarotid artery was pulsating and [that] he was sweating.\u201d At the same time, Driscoll noticed that Jose Avila \u201cwas getting nervous.\u201d When Jose complied with Driscoll\u2019s request to open the rear portion of the station wagon, his throat could be seen \u201cpulsating.\u201d Suspecting that \u201ccontraband was \u2022 hidden either in the vehicle or on the persons of the\u201d car\u2019s occupants, Driscoll directed Jose to drive to the secondary inspection area.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">At the secondary inspection area, the four went to the Customs office. There the men emptied their pockets and the women put their purses on the counter. \u25a0Jose\u2019s heart was pounding so hard that Driscoll felt it as he conducted a pat down search for weapons. According to the Customs Inspector, Marquez\u2019 heart beat so hard he could \u201csee the body motion against Marquez\u2019 shirt.\u201d Driscoll also noted needle marks on both of Marquez\u2019 arms. The inspector believed these \u201ctracks\u201d to be \u201ctwo or three days old.\u201d In light of these observations, Driscoll believed that Jose and Marquez were concealing contraband on their persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Although a search of Marquez proved negative, this suspect continued to manifest signs of nervousness. Jose displayed the same manifestations after a search of his person also proved negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Thereafter, Driscoll asked Juana Avila to hold out her arms. As she complied, her hands trembled and \u201cher demeanor reflected that she was quite nervous and frightened.\u201d Inspector Driscoll observed Herminia to be apprehensive. Suspecting that one or both of the women was concealing contraband, Driscoll requested an inspectress to search the suspects. He believed such a search was necessary because \u201cnarcotics addicts [often use] people accompanying them across the border to carry their contraband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">The matron\u2019s search of Juana proved negative. Although no contraband was discovered, Juana remained nervous as she answered questions listed on the personal search report. As Juana left the room, she was observed by the matron to be visibly nervous.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">When Herminia was brought to the search room, she refused to disrobe as requested. When the matron again asked that she disrobe, Herminia turned her back and began to undress. As Herminia undressed, the matron \u201cheard some paper rattling \u2014 like a paper towel being crumpled.\u201d The matron heard the same sound when Herminia \u201clowered her undergarments to her ankles.\u201d When Herminia refused to turn over the package, the matron \u201creached into the clothing and seized a coarsely weaved green paper towel containing\u201d the two rubber prophylactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">In Henderson v. United States, 390 F.2d 805, 808 (CA 9, 1967), this court stated that although probable cause was not required to institute a border search, more than \u201cmere suspicion\u201d was needed to justify initiating a strip search. In the court\u2019s view, a customs official needed to have \u201cat least a real suspicion, directed specifically to that person\u201d before such a search could be sustained. In United States v. Guadalupe-Garza, 421 F.2d 876 (CA 9, 1970), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Judge Hufstedler delineated the meaning of the words \u201creal suspicion\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">\u201c \u2018Real suspicion\u2019 justifying the initiation of a strip search is subjective suspicion supported by objective, articulable facts that would reasonably lead an experienced, prudent customs official to suspect that a particular person seeking to cross our border is concealing something on his body for the purpose of transporting it into the United States contrary to law.\u201d 421 F.2d at 879.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In applying this definition to the facts of <em>Guadalupe-Garza, </em>the court held that the following did not constitute \u201creal suspicion\u201d: The defendant entered the United States from Mexico at Calexico, California. He was stopped at the primary inspection area, answered routine questions and was sent on his way. A customs inspector at the secondary inspection point observed the defendant passing through the pedestrian inspection line. The defendant came within five feet of this inspector and then \u201ctilted his head\u201d and \u201cshied away from\u201d him. At the inspector\u2019s request, the defendant went to the customs office. There, the defendant appeared nervous as he answered routine questions. The inspector then ordered a strip search of the defendant. In the words of Judge Hufstedler:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201cThere was no evidence that appellant appeared to be under the influence of drugs when he attempted to cross the border. Customs officials had no information about him from anyone before he was searched. Observation of appellant\u2019s arms showing marks and appellant\u2019s evasive answers were not made and elicited until after appellant had been stripped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201cWe conclude that the objective facts did not warrant a real suspicion that appellant was concealing something on his person. Inspector Baker had a hunch about appellant based upon appellant\u2019s skittish demeanor as he was passing through customs.\u201d 421 F.2d at 879.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Pursuant to the definition announced in <em>Guadalupe-Garza, </em>a divided panel of this circuit has recently invalidated a strip search. In United States v. Johnson, 425 F.2d 630 (CA 9, 1970), a customs inspector with considerable experience in examining persons crossing the border with concealed narcotics, ordered a strip search of the defendant after talking with her and a companion as they entered the United States. The inspector ordered the search because he was \u201csuspicious.\u201d The divided court, in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion held there were no \u201c \u2018objective, articulable facts\u2019 in the record to support Inspector McCown\u2019s suspicion. If such facts existed, it was incumbent upon the government to prove them.\u201d 425 F.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">By contrast in United States v. Shields, 453 F.2d 1235, 1236 (CA 9, 1972), the court sustained a strip search at the border because the defendant\u2019s nervousness, the presence of needle marks on her arms as well as on the arms of her <em>companion </em>and the brevity of \u201ctheir visit\u201d were \u201c \u2018objective, articulable facts that would reasonably lead an experienced, prudent customs official to suspect\u2019 that she was concealing contraband on her body.\u201d Here, the trial court found that as to Herminia\u2019s companions \u201cthere were the necessary objective articulable facts supporting, the search\u201d of their persons, but that there were no such facts which specifically related to Herminia. Accordingly, it refused to sustain the strip search which resulted in the discovery of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\"> In our view, the strip search in question was clearly within the definition of \u201creal suspicion\u201d as formulated in <em>Guadalupe-Garza. </em>As indicated from <em>Shields, </em>evidence relating to the companions of the subject of the strip search can be considered in determining when such a search may be justified. Here, the extreme nervous manifestations of Herminia\u2019s three companions as well as the presence of needle marks on the arms of one of the men coupled with Herminia\u2019s uncontrolled expressions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>apprehension clearly are facts to be considered in determining the presence of \u201creal suspicion\u201d as to each member of the group including Herminia. The trial court erred in granting the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
