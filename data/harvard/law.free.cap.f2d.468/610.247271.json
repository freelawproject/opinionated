We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>1. The testimony of three government witnesses as to a financial statement was admissible under an exception to the best evidence rule, that is, that secondary evidence is admissible, within the discretion of the trial judge, where it appears that the original writing has been lost or destroyed, without any fault of the party offering the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">2. The four insufficient checks were admissible into evidence to prove intent, and no abuse of discretion of the trial judge was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">3. The trial judge was in the best position to determine possible prejudice from the prosecutor\u2019s reference to excluded evidence. He rebuffed the attorney at the time, and he did not abuse the broad discretion allowed the trial court in denying a motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">4. We perceive no error in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury concerning the proof of other similar offenses or acts to show fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
