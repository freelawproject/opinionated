CAMPBELL, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">The defendant Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) appeals from an order of the district court which granted the motion of the plaintiff, trustee in bankruptcy of the estate of Kritzer Radiant Coils, Inc. (Kritzer Radiant), for summary judgment. The district court held that a transfer of $23,370.60 from the bankrupt to Alcoa was a \u201cfraudulent transfer\u201d under \u00a7 67d(2)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d(2) (a). Alcoa raises three contentions on appeal: (1) that the transfer was not fraudulent inasmuch as there was no evidence that Alcoa participated in a scheme to defeat the other creditors of Kritzer Radiant or that the transaction involving the transfer of monies was lacking in good faith; (2) that summary judgment was improperly entered since the pleadings and affidavits raised genuine issues of material fact concerning the intentions and motives of Alcoa; and (3) that the district court erred in failing to hold Alcoa had a right under \u00a7 67d(6) of the Bankruptcy Act to retain the $23,370.60 as security for repayment of the actual consideration given by Alcoa.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">The facts as gleaned from the pleadings, affidavits and from defendant\u2019s answers to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories show that on December 1st, 1965, the date of the transfer in question, the bankrupt, Kritzer Radiant, was indebted to Alcoa in the amount of $46,741.20. As of that time 85% of the outstanding capital stock of Kritzer Radiant was owned by Bast\u00edan Morely Company, Inc. (Bast\u00edan Morely) and the remaining 15% of the stock was held by Henry Kritzer, Sr. Henry Kritzer at that time also owned 15% of the outstanding common stock of Bast\u00edan Morely and was a director of that Company. The $46,741.-20 debt of Kritzer Radiant, which had been personally guaranteed by Henry Kritzer, had been reduced to a judgment against Kritzer individually and in favor of Alcoa in the Circuit Court of Lake County, Illinois. For a period of time prior to December 1st, 1965, both Kritzer Radiant and Bast\u00edan Morely had dealt with Alcoa as a supplier of materials used in manufacturing their products. Bast\u00edan Morely was also indebted to Alcoa as of that date in the amount of $11,319.78.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">On the critical date of December 1, 1965 an agreement was entered into by and between Kritzer Radiant, Henry Kritzer, Bast\u00edan Morely and Alcoa. Pursuant to this agreement, Kritzer Radiant paid to Alcoa $23,370.60 in full satisfaction of the antecedent debt owed Alcoa in the amount of $46,741.-20. Additionally, Alcoa released Henry Kritzer from the judgment it had re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>covered against him in the state court. Finally, Bast\u00edan satisfied its debt to Alcoa in the amount of $11,319.78, and ordered from Alcoa additional materials for payment upon receipt. On the date the settlement agreement was executed, Kritzer Radiant was insolvent and there existed creditors of Kritzer Radiant with outstanding claims against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The pertinent portion of \u00a7 67d(2)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">\u201c(2) Every transfer made and every obligation incurred by a debtor within one year prior to the filing of a petition initiating a proceeding under this Act by or against him is fraudulent (a) as to creditors existing at the time of such transfer or obligation, if made or incurred without fair consideration by a debtor who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent, <em>without regard to his actual intent; </em>. . .\u201d (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d(2) (a) (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The definition of fair consideration is furnished in \u00a7 67d(l)(e) which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">\u201cConsideration given for the property or obligation of a debtor is \u2018fair\u2019 (1) when, in <em>good faith, </em>in exchange and as a fair equivalent therefor property is transferred or an antecedent debt is satisfied, . . . .\u201d (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d(l)(e). (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">As the district court indicated in its memorandum opinion, essentially four elements must be present for a transfer to be fraudulent under \u00a7 67d(2)(a) of the Act:</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">1. The transfer must occur within one year of the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings;</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">2. Creditors of the debtor must exist at the time of the transfer;</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">3. The debtor must be insolvent at the time of the transfer; and</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">4. There must be a failure of consideration for the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">The bankruptcy petition here was filed on November 22nd, 1966, clearly within one year of the date of the transfer in question. Creditors of Kritzer Radiant were in existence when the transfer was made. Also there is no serious dispute regarding the insolvency of Kritzer Radiant on the date of the transfer. Alcoa then possessed a financial statement of Kritzer Radiant which reflected a negative net worth. Also, some three weeks prior to the execution of the settlement agreement the defendant wrote its attorneys suggesting that certain precautions be undertaken \u201c. . . should either Bast\u00edan Morely or Kritzer Radiant Coils go into bankruptcy within four months of the transaction.\u201d While it is true that the defendant denied the allegation of insolvency in its answer, we agree with the district court that since Alcoa did not challenge plaintiff\u2019s assertion by counter-affidavit nor make any attempt to demonstrate the inaccessibility of information on this question, the issue of insolvency did not present a fact issue precluding the entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-19\">Thus, the question becomes, under the undisputed facts as set forth above, whether the transfer from Kritzer Radiant to Alcoa was for \u201cfair consideration.\u201d Where the transfer is made to extinguish an antecedent debt, the Bankruptcy Act provides that the consideration given must represent a \u201cfair equivalent\u201d for the antecedent debt and must be given in \u201cgood faith,\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 107d(1)(e), 107d(2)(a); see also 4 Collier On Bankruptcy \u00a7 67.33. As the defendant itself recognizes, a transfer lacking in good faith is fraudulent within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act even though fair equivalent may have been present. And the question of good faith depends under the circumstances on whether the \u201ctransaction carries the earmarks of an arms-length bargain.\u201d Holahan v. Henderson, D. C., 277 F.Supp. 890, aff\u2019d 394 F.2d 177 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-21\"> Considering all the facts that attended this transaction we agree with the district court that the transfer was fraudulent within the meaning of \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>67d(2) (a) of the Bankruptcy Act. We find most significant the relationship of the parties to the settlement agreement and the respective allocation of its benefits. Henry Kritzer, the President of the bankrupt as well as a director and stockholder of Bast\u00edan Morely, was released entirely and without any consideration on his part from a legally enforceable state court judgment against him. Moreover, Bast\u00edan Morely, the principal stockholder of the bankrupt, was permitted to retain its supplier and, for a consideration, extinguished its own antecedent debt to Alcoa. Finally, Alcoa acquired an advantage over the other creditors of the bankrupt at a time when Alcoa was certainly aware of the precarious financial position of Kritzer Radiant. Thus the primary and important benefits of this transaction ran to parties other than the bankrupt. Since transfers made to benefit third parties are not considered as made for \u201cfair\u201d consideration (see United Towing Company v. Phillips, 242 F.2d 627 (5th Cir. 1957), cert. den. 355 U.S. 861, 78 S.Ct. 93, 2 L.Ed.2d 68 (1957), we agree that on these facts, which are not disputed by the defendant, the transfer here was a fraudulent one within the meaning of \u00a7 67d(2) (a) of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Alcoa next contends that summary judgment was improper here since there was a fact question raised by the pleadings and affidavits as to the motives and intentions of Alcoa with respect to this transaction. In this regard Alcoa maintains that the transfer here could not have been fraudulent unless Alcoa participated in a scheme to defeat the other creditors of Kritzer Radiant or unless Alcoa acted on bad faith in valuing the properties exchanged. We have been unable to find any support, either statutory or in case law, for this argument. Indeed, the Act itself is to the contrary. A transfer made without \u201cfair consideration\u201d, such as the one involved here, represents but one of the several types of fraudulent transfers defined in \u00a7 67 of the Act. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d. A transfer is rendered fraudulent under \u00a7 67d(2)(a), the section here involved, when made or incurred without fair consideration by a debtor who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent, irrespective of the intent of the parties to the transaction. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d(2)(a); 4 Collier On Bankruptcy \u00a7 67.34. The situation that Alcoa refers to, where there is an actual intent to defraud, is specifically covered by \u00a7 67d(2)(d) of the Act. Thus, under the section of the Act on which the Trustee proceeded in this case, the motives and intentions of Alcoa are simply immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Lastly, Alcoa contends that under \u00a7 67d(6) of the Bankruptcy Act, it may retain the transferred funds as security for payment of its antecedent debt. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d(6). Under our long-standing rule that issues not presented to the district court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, we need not consider this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">For the reasons given the judgment of the district court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
