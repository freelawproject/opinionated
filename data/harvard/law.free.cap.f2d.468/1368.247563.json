Prior to appellant\u2019s refusal to answer the questions that were the subject of the contempt proceeding, appellant had been granted transactional immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-21\">Appellant, an indigent, had requested appointment of counsel to represent him in the civil contempt proceeding. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>district court denied the request on the ground that it had no authority to appoint counsel. We have been able to discover no authority specifically requiring appointment of counsel to represent an indigent in a civil contempt proceeding brought to compel a witness to answer questions before a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">We have concluded that an indigent witness is entitled to appointed counsel in such a proceeding. Threat of imprisonment is the coercion that makes a civil contempt proceeding effective. The civil label does not obscure its penal nature. <em>(Cf. </em>Harris v. United States (1965) 382 U.S. 162, 86 S.Ct. 352, 15 L.Ed.2d 240; United States v. Dinsio (9th Cir. 1972) 468 F.2d 1392.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-6\">It is unnecessary to reach the remaining questions presented on appeal, and we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-7\">The order is reversed with directions to appoint counsel for appellant if the contempt proceeding is resumed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
