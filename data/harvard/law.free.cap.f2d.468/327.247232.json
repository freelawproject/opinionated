Waller at first contended that since wilful false filing would suffice to carry the government\u2019s burden, the admission of proof of the full details of his long-continued, unusual fiscal and accounting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>practices was unduly prejudicial. In a supplemental brief with new counsel, Waller faults the government for failing to adduce evidence showing that he believed his returns were false. Additional trial errors are asserted relative to (1) the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of certain checks drawn on a nonexistent account as \u201chot checks\u201d, (2) an expert witness\u2019s statement of opinion that funds withdrawn from his controlled corporation amounted to a constructive dividend, (3) the admission of evidence of similar transactions in tax years not covered in the indictment, and (4) the cumulative impact of these errors. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The proof disclosed that Waller made a continuous practice over the course of several years of depositing instruments having every indicia of regular checks in the local bank account of his funeral home business. However, these \u201cchecks\u201d were drawn on a bank in which the drawer had no account. Under a regular practice, the drawee bank never handled these items in the regular course of business but, instead, held them in suspense until Waller redeemed such paper with cash or its equivalent. The proof further disclosed that funeral home employees were instructed to consistently omit certain funeral charges from bookkeeping records of the funeral home. Although some of this evidence related to dates and events outside the tax years covered by the indictment, all of it was admissible for the purpose which the court carefully instructed the jury to confine it to \u2014 proof of an intent to file a tax return which was known to be false. Counsel for Waller contends that this proof carried such slight probative weight for its intended purpose and such a high risk of unjustly casting Waller as a bad man in the jury\u2019s mind, that its allowance was an abuse of discretion. We do not agree. Waller\u2019s trial defense from its outset asserted that any omissions from his tax returns were due to inadvertence or careless business practices and sloppy accounting methods. The government could certainly meet this contention with the facts it showed. The portions of the proof touching events in other periods related to practices which were both current to the tax periods covered in the indictment and continuous. Such proof was probative and properly limited. We reject Waller\u2019s assertion that the government overproved its ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Having concluded that all of this evidence was admissible for the purpose of proving that Waller filed the subject returns wilfully and knowingly, believing them to be false, we are next met with the inconsistent contention that the government failed to carry its burden of establishing this guilty belief. However, the jury was entitled to infer that Waller\u2019s long-continued course of conduct, which was so far different from ordinary business practice and so deceptive in its accounting result, was done to purposefully and intentionally avoid detection of income and to support false filings. Thus, we likewise reject the contention that the government failed to carry its burden of adducing sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s allusion to the \u201ccheck\u201d documents as \u201chot checks\u201d, if indeed inaccurate at all, was not so clearly improper as to constitute error. More apt descriptions of these items as \u201cbogus\u201d or \u201cfictitious\u201d checks might have increased the possibility of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">The government expert, Henry, summarized his accounting findings relative to distributions made to Waller from two controlled corporations and characterized these payments as constructive dividends. Although Waller\u2019s counsel at one point indicated that he had no objection to the characterization if the court covered the point in its instructions, he did later insist that Henry\u2019s testimony in this regard was prejudicial error. We disagree. The opinions did not invade the province of the jury. Waller was on trial for knowingly filing false tax returns. Whether the omitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>items of income were constructive dividends or other types of payments was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Relying upon our decision in Baines v. United States, 426 F.2d 833 (5th Cir. 1970), Waller asserts that the proof of transactions in years other than those specifically covered by the indictment, was error which placed on him a duty to defend himself against charges for which he was not being tried. In <em>Baines </em>the court was careful to note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">Because of the closeness of the case the Court feels compelled to hold, as we held in Marcus v. United States, 5 Cir. 1970, 422 F.2d 752, \u201cthat the cumulative effect of the District Court\u2019s errors, which are discussed in detail below, when taken together, require that this case be reversed and remanded to the District Court for a new trial, even though no single error, when viewed in isolation, would necessarily require this disposition. See Getchell v. United States, 5 Cir., 1960, 282 F.2d 681, 691.\u201d We limit our' holding to the facts peculiar to this rare case involving the failure to pay federal cabaret excise taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The ease is distinguishable here. Although the proof in the case at bar might have suggested that returns for prior years were inaccurate, no contention was ever made that other false filings resulted. This case falls squarely under Jernigan v. United States, 411 F.2d 471 (5th Cir. 1969), which approved the procedure of proving repetitious practices extending into years other than those covered by the indictment to show intent and to negate innocent inadvertence.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">We have reviewed the asserted errors individually and collectively, and neither singly nor cumulatively was the trial court incorrect in entering its judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\">.
