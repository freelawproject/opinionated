Sharp, United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b669-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b669-20\">Appellant was convicted of failure to report for civilian work required of conscientious objectors in lieu of induction. 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-21\">Appellant sought a IV-D ministerial classification. He was classified I-O. He filed a late request for an appeal, explaining in some detail that his father\u2019s work had required the family to make-a number of unexpected changes in residence, and that the notice of classification, though forwarded, had been long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>delayed in reaching him. To support his statements he attached the envelope that had contained the notice, stamped with the dates upon which it had been forwarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Section 1626.2(d) provides that \u201cthe local board . . . may permit any person ... to appeal even though the period for taking an appeal has elapsed. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The file contains a minute entry by the clerk of the board reading, \u201cRegistrant files appeal \u2014 not timely.\u201d Appellant argues that this reflects a failure of the clerk to submit appellant\u2019s request for an appeal to the board. If so, reversal would be required. United States v. Harding, 461 F.2d 993 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The government contends, however, that the notation was merely a clerical entry showing the receipt of the request for a late appeal, and that rejection of the request by the board is to be implied from an entry of board action dated some six weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">This entry reads \u201creviewed \u2014 not reopened.\u201d In context, it reflects review by the board of an additional information questionnaire and supporting letter submitted by appellant, after his request for an appeal, and a decision by the board that the new information did not justify reopening under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2. The letter sent to appellant by the board the following day confirms this conclusion. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-9\">\u201cThis will acknowledge receipt of your communication relative to your selective service status. The information contained therein has been considered by this board and it is of the opinion that the facts presented do not warrant the reopening or reclassification of your case at this time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Neither the words of the entry nor the text of the board\u2019s letter informing him of its decision not to reopen offer any support whatsoever for an implication that the board\u2019s action included consideration and rejection of appellant\u2019s request for a late appeal, filed six weeks earlier. On the contrary, the words of the entry and letter are so clear, definite, and self-limiting as to strongly suggest that no such action occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">Since the only reasonable conclusion that may be drawn from the record as a whole is that appellant\u2019s request for a late appeal was not submitted to or acted upon by the local board, reversal is required by United States v. Harding, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
