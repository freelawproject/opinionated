Carter, .is presently incarcerated in the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-19\">Appellant invoked the jurisdiction of the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3). He sought a stay of state criminal proceedings arising out of his arrest of February 8, 1966, for forgery, counterfeiting, and conspiracy. In addition appellant sought the suppression and return of certain property seized by state authorities at the time of his arrest. Appellant\u2019s petition, however, contained no allegation that a prosecution had been commenced or threatened against him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-20\">This is not a proper case to bring into play the Federal court\u2019s equitable jurisdiction in order to enjoin a state prosecution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-21\">\u00ab * * a federal lawsuit to stop a prosecution in a state court is a serious matter. And persons having no fears of state prosecution except those that are imaginary or speculative, are not to be accepted as appropriate plaintiffs in such cases.\u201d Younger v.
