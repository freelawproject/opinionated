We deny enforcement and remand the case for further evidence because the record will not support the Board\u2019s assertion of statutory jurisdiction over the enterprise operated by the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-18\">At the outset, we are met with the contention that the proceedings before the trial examiner and the Board are of no effect because preceded by improper service of process on the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-19\">Some factual background is in order. Before September of 1969, one S. P. Robinson owned a nursing home in Ashville, Alabama. The home was operated by Mid-South Convalescent and Medicare Centers, Inc. as Robinson's lessee. Mid-South became embroiled in a dispute with the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, AFL-CIO. At the end of August 1969, Mid-South ceased to operate the Ashville facility and removed its patients. E. L. Clark bought the home some time in August and took physical possession of the premises about August 31, 1969. Clark employed respondent Jim H. Pierce as his \u201cadministrator\u201d (or manager) in accordance with Alabama law. Under Clark\u2019s ownership and Pierce\u2019s administration, the home did not employ any of the former employees of the home during Mid-South\u2019s tenure. The union attributed this failure to the union affiliation of many of the former employees. This failure to hire, allegedly on account of union affiliation, is the substantive conduct at the core of this labor dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-20\">After only a few months of operating the home as owner, and after the alleged commission of unfair labor practices, Clark leased the home to Pierce on January 1, 1970. The trial examiner found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASN\">\u201cIn September, 1969, Ashville-Whitney Nursing Home was a sole proprietorship of E. L. Clark, an individual with his place of business located at Ashville, Alabama. . . . Respondent Jim H. Pierce was the administrator of the nursing home for Mr. Clark. On January 1, 1970, Mr. Pierce leased the building and equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>ment from Mr. Clark and since that time has been the lessee-operator of the Ashville-Whitney Nursing Home. Mrs. Pierce became acting administrator until May 11, 1970, when she became the administrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\">. . . I further find, as is self-evident from the record, that on and after January 1, 1970, Respondent, Jim H. Pierce, as the lessee-operator of the Ashville-Whitney Nursing Home, was a successor of Respondent E. L. Clark. . . . \u25a0 Clark operated the Ashville-Whitney Nursing Home from September 22, 1969, to January 1, 1970, when the premises were leased to Pierce who then became the lessee-operator. ... I have also found that Respondent James [sic] H. Pierce operated the Ashville-Whitney Nursing Home on and after January I, 1970, as the successor of Respondent Clark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">On March 6, 1970, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the Board, naming the \u201cemployer against whom the charge is brought\u201d as \u201cAsh-ville and Whitney Nursing Home\u201d and \u201cthe employer representative to contact\u201d as \u201cMr. E. L. Clark, Owner\u201d and \u201cMr. Jim Pierce, Admn.\u201d The charge was addressed to \u201cAshville and Whitney Nursing Home, Route #2, Ashville, Alabama,\u201d and there received by Jim Pierce on March 6, 1970. As of March 6, Pierce had leased the home from Clark, but the only public record dealing with ownership and management of the home, the Alabama State license application to operate the home, continued to list Pierce as administrator and Clark as owner. The lease was not filed with the State Board of Licensure until May 11, 1970, two months after service of the charge. So far as the record reveals, neither Clark nor Pierce took any steps to notify the union or the Board of the change in the ownership of the enterprise after January 1, before or after the charge was received by Pierce on March 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">On June 10, 1970, the Board issued a complaint, naming \u201cAshville-Whitney Nursing Home\u201d as respondent and, in paragraph 2, stating that \u201cRespondent is and has been at all times material herein, a sole proprietorship of E. L. Clark.\u201d The complaint stated that Pierce \u201cis and has been at all times material herein, the administrator of Respondent\u2019s operations at Ashville, Alabama.\u201d Copies of the complaint were sent by registered mail to Ashville-Whitney Nursing Home and to Gerald Swann, attorney for Pierce. During the course of the hearing, the caption on the complaint was amended to read \u201cAshville-Whitney Nursing Home and J. H. Pierce, Lessee\u201d, with the consent of Swann on Pierce\u2019s behalf. The trial examiner found Clark and Pierce jointly liable for the restitutional remedies it imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">On the basis of these facts, the respondents argue that there was no proper service of the charge or the complaint on Clark or on any authorized agent for service of process on Clark. They argue that the charge was made against Clark but was served only on Pierce, at the home, and on Pierce\u2019s lawyer, Swann. Further, respondents argue that the complaint was not properly served on Clark through Pierce when the complaint was served at the home on June 10, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">These contentions were advanced before the Board. The Board held that \u201cfor the purposes of service [of process] Clark held Pierce out to be his apparent agent until May 11, 1970, so that the charge filed on March 5, 1970, and received by Pierce on March 6, 1970, constituted valid service on Clark.\u201d The Board reasoned that the lease agreement, though purportedly executed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>January 1, 1970, was not a matter of public record until May 11 of that same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Under Rule 4(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, service upon \u201can individual other than an infant or an incompetent person\u201d is proper if served \u201cin the manner prescribed by any statute of the United States.\u201d Rule 4(d)(7).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The NLRA provides, in section 10(b), that both the charge and the complaint must be served upon \u201cthe person against whom such charge is made.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 11(4) adds that \u201ccomplaints . and other process and papers of the Board . . . may be served . by registered mail or . by leaving a copy at the principal office or place of business of the person required to be served.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A Board charge constitutes \u201cother process and paper\u201d within the meaning of section 11(4). NLRB v. Columbus Marble Works, 5 Cir. 1956, 233 F.2d 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">In considering service of the charge on Clark, we must decide whether service was accomplished on the facts of this case \u201cby leaving a copy at the principal office or place of business\u201d of Clark. A threshold question is whether \u201cprincipal\u201d modifies \u201cplace of business\u201d as well as \u201coffice\u201d. For purposes of argument and no more, we assume that the correct reading is \u201cprincipal office or [principal] place of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\"> Even this reading of the statute does not imply, as the respondents suggest, that if process is to be served upon an employer engaged in several enterprises, the server must determine the employer's most important or \u201cprincipal\u201d site of financial endeavor. Such a determination would be exceedingly precarious and far more technical than fair notice requires. Rather, service is appropriate at the principal place of business of <em>that particular business </em>giving rise to the labor dispute with the person required to be served. We may assume respondent Clark to have been engaged in several enterprises. Still, for the purposes of section 11(4) he could be served at the principal place of business of his nursing home operation, provided that the process and papers sought to be served related to labor relations of the nursing home operation. Whatever Clark\u2019s other places of business, his principal place of business for the Ash-ville-Whitney Nursing Home operation was the home itself. Even assuming that section 11(4) requires service at the principal place of business, then, we have no trouble concluding that service on Clark would have been appropriate at the home until January 1,1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">Turning now to service on Clark at the home <em>after </em>January 1, 1970, we agree- with the Board that the undisclosed lease arrangement between Clark and Pierce did not invalidate the service of the charge on Clark at the home on March 6, 1970. The Board con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>eluded that Pierce was Clark\u2019s apparent agent at the time the charge was served. Section 11(4) of the NLRA makes no reference to service on agents, however, and accordingly we base our conclusion that service was properly effected under section 11(4) on different reasoning. Service of the charge on Clark at the home was valid because, to all possible outward appearances, the home on March 6 was still Clark\u2019s \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d within the meaning of section 11(4). This was, substantially, Clark\u2019s own doing. Not only did Pierce operate the home as the successor of Clark, as the trial examiner found, but there was also a total continuity between the Pierce and Clark operations. Pierce continued to manage the home, as he had in his former capacity as Clark\u2019s administrator. Clark continued to derive substantial rental income from the home. The Alabama state license application, the only available public record dealing with the home\u2019s ownership, still showed that Clark was the home\u2019s owner and that Pierce was \u201cAdministrator/Person in charge\u201d on March 6, though the lease was allegedly executed and the business was allegedly sold on January 1. The lease was not filed with the State Bureau of Licensure and Certification until May 11, and apparently no effort was ever made to change the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In attempting to serve Clark by mail the NLRB was justified in relying . on these outward appearances. We find no cases under section 11(4) dealing directly with the question in this case. But would-be process servers are not entirely at the mercy of elusive defendants. Courts have held that, where a defendant has in fact changed his residence but to all appearances is still occupying a former dwelling, substituted service at the former dwelling is proper under Rule 4(d)(1) or similar statutes. See Blackhawk Heating &amp; Plumbing Co. v. Turner, 1970, D.Ariz., 50 F.R.D. 144; Rich Products Corp. v. Diamond, Sup.Ct.1966, 51 Misc.2d 675, 273 N.Y.S.2d 687. See also Skidmore v. Green, 1940, S.D.N.Y., 33 F.Supp. 529. A defendant who beclouds his whereabouts should not be entitled to benefit from the process server\u2019s consequent confusion. See Blackhawk Heating &amp; Plumbing Co., 1970, D.Ariz., 50 F.R.D. 144; Pickford v. Kravetz, 1952, S.D.N.Y., 17 Fed.Rules Serv. 4d.l21, Case. 1. This ease is similar. Clark, by his own actions, created the appearance that the home remained his principal place of business. He is not entitled to benefit from this confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Our conclusion is not altered by the lack of evidence that Clark received actual notice of the action against him. The record also does not contain any statement by Clark denying that he received notice, and there is a strong inference from all the facts that he had notice. But in any event due process does not require receipt of actual notice in every case. Service upon Clark at the home was constitutionally adequate since it was \u201ca form of notice reasonably calculated to give [Clark] knowledge of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d NLRB v. O\u2019Keefe &amp; Merritt Mfg. Co., 9 Cir. 1949, 178 F.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Nor does the statute impose a more stringent standard. It is true that courts and commentators have often said that receipt of actual notice should be the test of sufficiency of substituted service under Rule 4. See, e. g.; 4 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1096, at 366-67 (1969); Nowell v. Nowell, 5 Cir. 1967, 384 F.2d 951; Karlsson v. Rabinowitz, 4 Cir. 1963, 318 F.2d 666. But actual notice has not been required in every case. See, e. g., Pickford v. Kravetz, 1952, S.D.N.Y., 17 Fed.Rules Serv. 4d.1221, Case 1. And this ease is exceptional. Section 11(4) should be read broadly to effectuate Congressional labor policies. See NLRB v. Strickland, 1962, W.D.Tenn., 220 F.Supp. 661. The evident Congressional purpose in enacting section 11(4) was to enable the NLRB to serve complaints and other papers by registered mail. Were we to hold that Clark has successfully evaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the process server we would defeat this policy. Potential defendants could easily insulate themselves from service by mail by carrying out secret alterations in the structure of their businesses and subsequently denying knowledge of the attempt at service, a contention difficult to disprove. To effectuate the congressional policy in favor of service by mail, it is necessary that the NLRB be able to judge the quality of its attempts at service by something other than the fortuity of whether a defendant can be shown to have had actual notice. The proper test in this ease is whether in the circumstances the procedure used would in all probability have informed the defendant of the proceedings against him. See Blackhawk Heating &amp; Plumbing Co. v. Turner, 1970, D.Ariz., 50 F.R.D. 144; 17 U.Kan.L.Rev. 125 (1968). The NLRB met this requirement by sending the charge to what, from all appearances, was Clark\u2019s principal place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Having concluded that the charge was properly served on Clark on March 6, 1970, we similarly hold that the complaint was properly served on Clark at the home on June 10, 1970. From the Board\u2019s vantage point nothing had changed since March 6, except that the lease had been filed with the Alabama Bureau of Licensure and Certification on May 11. But this lease nowhere indicated that Clark had sold the business to Pierce. Nor did Clark make any effort to change the state license application on file, which on June 10 still described him as owner of the home. Therefore the home continued to be Clark\u2019s apparent principal place of business on June 10. For the reasons already stated, then, service of the complaint on Clark at the home was appropriate under section 11(4) and Rule 4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Respondent Pierce argues that no charge against him was filed with the Board or served on him within the six month limitation period prescribed by section 10(b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b). Pierce contends that at the time the charge was served on him, on March 6, it failed to notify him that he was \u201cthe person against whom such charge [was] made.\u201d Later, Pierce says, when the complaint was amended to make clear that Pierce was a named respondent, six months had elapsed since the alleged unfair labor practice occurred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">Pierce\u2019s contentions are unsound because, like Clark\u2019s, they proceed from the mistaken assumption that one who possesses crucial information may conceal the information and then successfully capitalize on his own misleading behavior. Pierce admitted receiving the original charge on March 6, 1970. The charge named the home as employer, Pierce as administrator, and Clark as owner. In fact, as of January 1, 1970, Pierce knew these descriptions were inaccurate. No wonder, then, that the charge was never amended to name Pierce specifically as owner or lessee-operator within the six months limitation period. We conclude that, interpreted in light of Pierce\u2019s own, undisclosed knowledge, the charge adequately identified Pierce as a \u201cperson against whom the charge is made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">Respondents cite Darlington Mfg. Co., 139 NLRB 241, 259 (1962) in support of their contention that the March 6 charge was, as a matter of interpretation, directed against Clark and not against Pierce individually. The interpretation of the charge in <em>Darlington </em>is inapposite here. In that case, there was no showing of a change in ownership, not disclosed, providing what would have been certain grounds for a timely amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ment to a charge arguably inadequate to reach a particular party.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Because we hold that the charge sufficiently identified Pierce, the complaint issued on the basis of the charge complied with section 10(b) of the Act. Whatever defects appeared on the face of the complaint were attributable to Pierce\u2019s own silence. In addition, the record is clear that Pierce had adequate actual notice that the proceedings were directed against him as well as against Clark. The complaint was served by registered mail addressed to the home and to Swann, Pierce\u2019s attorney. Pierce appeared with attorney Swann before the trial examiner. At the hearing, Pierce\u2019s attorney consented to the addition by motion of Pierce\u2019s name to the caption and body of the complaint as a named respondent. The amendment conformed to Section 102.17 of the Board\u2019s Rules and Regulations, 29 CFR \u00a7 102.17.</p>\n<p id=\"Aok\">Hercules Powder Company v. NLRB, 5 Cir. 1961, 297 F.2d 424, 433, cited by respondents, holds that the Board cannot initiate unfair labor practice proceedings by complaint against a party until its machinery is set in motion by the filing of a charge against the offending party by another private party. Here, though, there is no reason for concern that the Board is trying to proceed against a party not designated, or intended to be designated, by the union. <em>Hercules Poioder </em>is consistent with our holding today that technical defects on the face of a charge can be modified to reflect the clear intent of the charging party when the conduct of the person plainly sought to be charged has given rise to the initial confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In short, we conclude that both Clark and Pierce were properly served with charge and complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The respondents\u2019 objections to subject matter jurisdiction on this record are more substantial. Annual gross revenues of the home exceeded the Board\u2019s $100,000 jurisdictional yardstick for nursing homes. See University Nursing Homes, Inc., 168 NLRB 263 (1967). The record also dislcoses that the home purchased $1700 in supplies during a year of operation from Ipco, a firm whose \u201cmain office\u201d is located in Atlanta, Georgia. The Board argues that the operations of the home had more than a minimal effect on interstate commerce because money paid by the home to Ipco \u201cinured to the benefit of that out-of-state corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The respondents contend that the record is far too thin to support the requisite finding of a greater than minimal effect on interstate commerce. Respondent Pierce testified that Ipco\u2019s \u201chead office\u201d is located in Atlanta, that a salesman located in Birmingham arranged shipments to Ashville, that the shipments arrived \u201cby Beeline truck . . . an Alabama concern\u201d, but that he had no knowledge of where Ipco\u2019s shipments originated from. Nothing in the record discloses whether amounts due were paid by the home to Ipco\u2019s salesmen or to Ipco directly. 'Nothing in the record indicates any of the details of Ipco\u2019s corporate structure, nor whether Ipco is a corporation domiciled outside of Alabama, nor for that matter whether Ipco is a corporation at all. In short, we know nothing more than that the home bought supplies from Ipco and Ipco had its \u201cmain office\u201d in Atlanta.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">In passing the National Labor Relations Act, Congress intended to provide the Board with the fullest jurisdictional power constitutionally permissible under the Commerce Clause. NLRB v. Reliance Fuel Oil Corp., 1963, 371 U.S. 224, 226, 83 S.Ct. 312, 9 L.Ed.2d 279; NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 1937, 301 U.S. 1, 31, 57 S.Ct. 615, 81 L.Ed.2d 893. If intrastate activity has more than a de minimis effect on interstate commerce, it affects commerce within the meaning of the Act. E. g., NLRB v. West Side Carpet Cleaning Co., 6 Cir. 1964, 329 F.2d 758, 760; NLRB v. Peyton Fritton Stores, 10 Cir. 1964, 336 F.2d 769, 770. Broad though the Board\u2019s jurisdiction be, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>not indeterminate, and must appear from the record; it cannot be presumed. In an enforcement proceeding, the burden of demonstrating jurisdiction is upon the Board. NLRB v. Ingram, 5 Cir. 1961, 273 F.2d 670; Birmingham Post Co. v. Brown, 5 Cir. 1954, 217 F.2d 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The present record is so ambiguous that it would require an act of faith for us to conclude that the home\u2019s purchases from Ipco \u201caffect commerce\u201d within the meaning of the Act. For all we know, Ipco may have an independent Alabama subsidiary. See NLRB v. Shawnee Milling Co., 10 Cir. 1950, 184 F.2d 57. It may even be an Alabama corporation. Revenues derived from Alabama sales of Ipco products may never leave Alabama, and there is admittedly no evidence proving interstate movement of Ipco products. If these possibilities are true, the effect on interstate commerce of the home\u2019s dealings with Ipco would be \u2014 at least on the surface \u2014 quite remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\"> However, we need not decide whether the effect on commerce, under these speculative circumstances, would be too remote to support the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. Neither the trial examiner\u2019s decision nor the Board\u2019s decision embraces the jurisdictional theory now advanced on appeal. The trial examiner concluded only that \u201cpurchases of supplies have been made from Ipco of Atlanta, Georgia,\u201d later referring to these as \u201cinterstate purchases.\u201d The Board affirmed without elaboration on this point. The trial examiner\u2019s language strongly suggests the direct purchase of goods from out-of-state. There is room for the interpretation now advanced by the Board, but nothing approaching a statement of the \u201cinterstate financial benefit\u201d theory. It is well settled that the reasons actually advanced by an administrative agency are the only reasons properly considered by a court in determining the legality of the agency\u2019s action. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., 1943, 318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626; Trailways of New England, Inc. v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 1 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 926. We therefore hold that the present record will not support a finding of statutory jurisdiction over the respondent\u2019s enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">In the interest of judicial economy, and in light of our remand order, we have considered respondents\u2019 further contentions that the trial examiner erred in allowing Pierce to be called as a witness under Rule 43(b). We have also considered certain evidentiary objections to rulings of the trial examiner raised by the respondents; and the respondents\u2019 objection to the trial examiner\u2019s decision, upheld by the Board to predicate liability on Pierce on a theory of successor-ship. We see no merit in respondents\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Because the present record will not support a finding of statutory jurisdiction over the respondents\u2019 enterprise, enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is Denied and the cause Remanded to the Board for additional evidence, findings of fact, and conclusions of law consistent with this opinion. See Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB, 1939, 305 U.S. 364, 59 S.Ct. 301, 83 L.Ed. 221.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-11\">.

I agree that the purported service upon Clark was not unconstitutional. But I disagree as to the statutory adequacy of service under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 161(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">There is no evidence that Clark received actual notice. There is no evidence, or even contention, that the Board relied upon, or even knew about, the records of the state licensing authority. What the Board did know about and did rely upon was that the nursing home, which formerly was owned by Clark, continued in operation with no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>outward change and with Pierce, who had been the administrator, continuing in charge.</p>\n<p id=\"Aly\">In the absence of a requirement of statute, the citizen has no duty to inform a govermental agency which subsequently may subject him to administrative action, or to inform the world at large, when he sells or leases his business or ceases to carry on business at the place that theretofore had been his principal place of business. The concept of an \u201capparent place of business\u201d is a new wrinkle. If Congress had meant \u201cwhat appears to be a principal place of business,\u201d it would have been easy to say so. There is enough confusion over whether an agent by estoppel is an agent for purposes of service of process, see 2 Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6\u00b6 4.12, at 1052, 1056-57, 4.22 [1], at 1116-19 (2d ed. 1970); 30 A.L.R. 176, without burdening the law with an \u201capparent place of business\u201d concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Cases holding that a former dwelling is a \u201cusual place of abode\u201d within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(1), which provides for service on an individual \u201cby leaving [the summons] at his dwelling house or usual place of abode,\u201d do not support the holding in this case. The transiency of some individuals occasionally persuades courts to impart elasticity into the term \u201cusual place of abode.\u201d See, e. g., Skidmore v. Green, 33 F.Supp. 529 (S.D.N.Y.1940). Businesses are not as transient as individuals, however, and there is no concomitant need to stretch \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d beyond its common import.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">Even without analysis of legislative policies underlying the \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d requirement, the majority\u2019s precedents are readily set apart from this ease by the force of their own facts. For example, in Blackhawk Heating &amp; Plumbing Co. v. Turner, 50 F.R.D. 144 (D.Ariz.1970), the court upheld service on an individual by service on his daughter at his alleged \u201cformer\u201d apartment, In support of its holding, the majority noted, inter alia, that at the time of service (1) defendant was paying rent for the apartment, (2) defendant had not notified the apartment manager that he had moved, (3) the apartment manager considered defendant his lessee, (4) defendant left the family automobiles at the apartment, and (5) defendant received his mail at the apartment. Additionally, the court relied heavily on the defendant\u2019s actual receipt of notice. \u201c[T]here is no claim of . prejudice by reason of the manner or time in which notice was received .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149. In this case, the Board did not establish a nexus between Ashville-Whitney and Clark at the time of the purported service even approximating the nexus established in <em>Blaekhaivk Heating, </em>nor, more importantly, did the Board establish actual notice to Clark.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
