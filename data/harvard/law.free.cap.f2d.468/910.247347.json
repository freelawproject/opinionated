Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b977-13\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">Terrell appeals from an adverse judgment entered in a non-jury trial in which he asserted that, in violation of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1981 and 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e et seq., the Company maintained a racially discriminatory promotional policy, refused to promote him to salesman, and discharged him when he sought the promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-16\">Two questions are presented for review: (1) did the district judge consider the proffered statistical evidence of class discrimination on the part of Feldstein; and (2) are the district court\u2019s findings of fact \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d ?</p>\n<p id=\"b977-17\"> Since the answers to the interrogatories propounded by Terrell to the Company, from which the statistical exhibits were abstracted, were admitted into evidence, Terrell\u2019s contention that the district court failed to consider this documentary evidence is without merit. Moreover, the district court\u2019s findings of fact more than pass muster under Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. Although statistical evidence of a pattern or practice of discrimination is of probative value in an individual discrimination case for the purpose of- showing motive, intent, or purpose, <em>cf. </em>Marquez v. Omaha District Sales Office, Ford Division of Ford Motor Co., 8 Cir. 1971, 440 F.2d 1157, it is not determinative of an employer\u2019s reason for the action taken against the individual grievant. The record contains ample evidence to support the conclusion that Terrell\u2019s non-promotion and subsequent discharge were for no other reason than just cause. In short, Terrell fails to carry his burden of showing, as the attacking party must, that the district court\u2019s fact findings were \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d United States of America v. Reddoch and Taylor et al., etc., 5 Cir. 1972, 467 F.2d 897; <em>see </em>Martin v. Mercantile Financial Corp., 5 Cir. 1968, 404 F.2d 886; Seaton v. Sills, 5 Cir. 1968, 403 F.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
