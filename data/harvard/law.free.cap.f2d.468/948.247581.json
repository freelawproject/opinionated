R. \u00a7 101.34(a), makes the task of judicial review more difficult, there is enough before us to demonstrate that the exemption was consistent with the standards designed to prevent \u201cgross inequities\u201d and \u201chardships\u201d set forth in \u00a7 203(b)(2) of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as amended, Pub.L. No. 92-210 (1971). In the future, however, the Cost of Living Council should make explicit the bases of its judgment that an exemption granted comes within the specific criteria established by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">Because of the creation of a valid exemption in this case, the appellants\u2019 point regarding the failure by either the Cost of Living Council or the Price Commission to hold a hearing under \u00a7 207(c) of the Act before an increase in rates was approved has become moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
