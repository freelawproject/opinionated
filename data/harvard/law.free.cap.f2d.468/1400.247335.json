The Customs Court held that the importations were other hand tools NSPF of brass, TSUS 651.49, and the Government does not now argue that that classification was inappropriate if the original classification was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-23\">We find that we have little to add to Judge Rosenstein\u2019s careful opinion below, familiarity with which is assumed. Item 750.15 is not an eo nomine provision encompassing <em>all </em>articles which look like combs or are known as combs; the word \u201ccombs\u201d used therein is defined in the headnote which is a limiting factor in this case. As counsel for appellee put it in his brief, \u201cFor the government representatives to argue that a tariff definition should be disregarded is so fraught with error as to warrant no further comment.\u201d The trial court\u2019s finding that the instant goods \u201cprocess\u201d the hair was a finding of fact which was fully supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>the evidence, and we will not disturb it here. Additionally, we agree with the trial court that, whatever bounds are eventually found for the word \u201cadjusting\u201d (which the record abundantly indicates is not commonly used in the trade), \u201cprocessing\u201d the hair is more than \u201cadjusting\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
