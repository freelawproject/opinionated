The district court held that appellants had an adequate remedy at law, ruling that \u201cif we have jurisdiction in this case, we decline to exercise it under the circumstances here involved on the state of the record as it exists today, and we shall, therefore, grant the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.\u201d \\</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">The Magaziner children are not adults: Robert Lee was born on January 8, 1955; Jonathan M., on June 19, 1958, and Diane, on February 6, 1960. The complaint stated that following certain trial and appellate proceedings brought by their parents over their custody, \u201c[t]hey [the children] retained as counsel, Lisa Aversa Richette, Esquire, who on December 22, 1970, entered her appearance on their behalf in the custody case pending in the Family Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.\u201d The entry of appearance was challenged, and following argument on the issue, the appearance was quashed by order on March 17, 1971. Appellants took no further action in the state court system, although the vacating of the appearance was a final and, therefore, appealable order under state law. At the time of the entry of the attorney\u2019s appearance the appellants were ages 15,12 and 10 respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Notwithstanding their tender years, they describe themselves in their complaint as \u201cmature children.\u201d Neither the children nor their self-styled \u201cnext friend\u201d and lawyer petitioned any state court for appointment of Mrs. Richette as guardian ad litem. They have alleged :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-11\">53. There is no statute, regulation, or court-promulgated rule in Pennsylvania providing for the representation of mature children by counsel of their own choosing and full due process hearing in contested custody cases and the common custom and usage of the Family Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas is to refuse to allow such representation and hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">We will affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">Initially, there exists a serious problem of mootness. Notwithstanding the general nature of the relief demanded, as couched in requests for injunctive and declaratory relief, the specific case or controversy before the court was the action of the defendant, Judge Montemuro, in vacating the appearance of the children\u2019s self-styled next friend, Mrs. Richette, as their lawyer. Mrs. Richette is no longer a practicing attorney. She is now serving as Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Pennsylvania Constitution provides that \u201cjudges shall devote full time to their judicial duties, and shall not engage in the practice of law. . . . \u201d Art. 5, \u00a7 17, P.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-15\">Under these circumstances, appellants\u2019 claim stands in the same posture of mootness as did Zwickler\u2019s claim in Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 89 S.Ct. 956, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969). That is, it is impossible for this court to order the requested relief because of Mrs. Richette\u2019s present inability to serve as counsel. Thus, even if a federal court reached the merits and were inclined to grant the requested relief, it would be impossible to effectuate the court\u2019s judgment. A comparison is invited to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>facts of Golden v. Zwickler, <em>supra, </em>the appeal following the remand to the district court ordered in Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967). Zwickler was a printer who had published certain handbills relating to the re-election campaign of Congressman Multer in the congressional elections of 1964. The complaint alleged that Multer would again be a candidate in 1966. At issue was the validity of a New York statute requiring that there be printed on political handbills the identity of those responsible for their publication. Subsequent to the original appeal in Zwickler v. Koota, Congressman Multer left the House, of Representatives and was elected to a fourteen-year term on the New York Supreme Court. The district court held that election to the judicial post did not seem \u201cto moot the controversy and thus to abort a declaration of constitutional invalidity,\u201d holding that at the time the action was filed a ripe controversy was presented. A unanimous Supreme Court reversed, holding that \u201cZwickler did not establish the existence at the time of the hearing on the remand of the elements governing the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\u201d 394 U.S. at 110, 89 S.Ct. at 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">The Court said: \u201c\u2018[T]he federal courts established pursuant to Article III of the Constitution do not render advisory opinions. For adjudication of constitutional issues, \u201cconcrete legal issues, presented in actual cases, not abstractions,\u201d are requisite. This is as true of declaratory judgments as any other field.\u2019 United Public Workers of America v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 89, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947).\u201d 394 U.S. at 108, 89 S.Ct. at 959.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Because Judge Richette lacks the capacity to participate in the requested relief as counsel, the matter <em>sub judice </em>becomes simply a request for an advisory opinion. \u201c[T]he oldest and most consistent thread in the federal law of justiciability is that the federal courts will not give advisory opinions.\u201d Wright, Federal Courts, \u00a7 12 at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">It may be contended that Judge Richette\u2019s present judicial status, although precluding her functioning as a lawyer, does not prevent her from serving as the next friend of the minors. Assuming that such activity is permitted by the restrictions of the Pennsylvania Constitution, this factor would not in itself alter our decision. The threshold issue still is one of state law which has not been fully presented to the state courts. Indeed, in our view, irrespective of the mootness question, there must be a resolution of preliminary state law questions by the state courts as a necessary prerequisite to acquisition of federal jurisdiction over the constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Although appellants argue that no Pennsylvania rule or statute permits the representation of \u201cmature children\u201d in a custody proceeding, they did not avail themselves of many provisions of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure governing minors and intervenors. Mrs. Richette entered an ex parte appearance as \u201cnext friend\u201d without utilizing the intervention provisions of Pa.R.Civ.P. 2326 et seq. 12 P.S.Appendix. Although Pa.R.Civ.P. 2031(a) provides that a minor plaintiff may select his guardian, \u201csuch selection shall not bar the court from removing the guardian for cause in accordance with these rules.\u201d See Haines v. Fitzgerald, 108 Pa.Super. 290, 165 A. 52 (1933). Indeed, Rule 2033(a) provides: \u201cA person who is entitled to apply for the appointment of a guardian for a minor may petition the court for a rule to show cause why the guardian representing the minor in an action should not be removed and another guardian be substituted.\u201d Rules 2031 and 2034 set forth the procedure for the selection and appointment of guardians and objections thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The ex parte appearance for the children also by-passed the detailed intervention procedure outlined in Pa.R.Civ. P. 2327(4), permitting intervention of persons not parties to an action when \u201cthe determination of such action may affect any legally enforceable interest of such person. . . . \u201d The Pennsylvania advisory committee\u2019s note to this rule states: \u201cThe interest justifying intervention must be a right or liability recognized and enforceable at law or in equity as distinguished from an economic motive or interest in seeing one litigant or another prevail in the proceedings\u201d [citing Pennsylvania cases]. Rule 2328 outlines the procedure for intervention and requires the filing of a petition and service; Rule 2329 provides for a hearing on the petition for intervention after notice. <em>Cf., </em>federal practice governing intervention, F.R.Civ.P. 24 and 5. Pennsylvania Rule 2326 provides that the intervention procedure applies to any \u201ccivil action or proceeding at law or in equity brought in or appealed to any court of record which is subject to these rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">The Divorce Code of Pennsylvania confers jurisdiction on the Municipal Court of Philadelphia over matters pertaining to \u201ccustody or visitation rights\u201d of children. 23 Pa.Stat.Anno. \u00a7 15, subd. 3(d). (The name of this court was changed to the County Court of Philadelphia in 1961. 17 Pa.Stat.Anno. \u00a7 705. The jurisdiction of that court has now been assumed by the Family Division of the Court of Common Pleas. Pa. Const. Art. 5, Schedule, \u00a7 16(q)(i).) It is provided by statute that Courts of Common Pleas may determine in one action the future care, custody, and visitation rights as to children of the marriage, and \u201c[a]ny other matters pertaining to such marriage and divorce or annulment authorized by law and which fairly and expeditiously may be determined and disposed of in such action.\u201d 23 Pa.Stat.Anno. \u00a7 15, subd. 1(b) &amp; (e). Furthermore, the rules governing divorce and annulment provide that any matters which by statute may be joined with an action for divorce and annulment may be set forth in the same complaint. Rule 1127. The Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, 1121-1137, govern the action of divorce, and provide that except as otherwise provided, the procedure in divorce actions \u201cshall be in accordance with the rules relating to the action of assumpsit.\u201d Rule 1121(b). A similar provision is contained in Equity Rule 1501.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">It is arguable, therefore, that the Pennsylvania rules for intervention are applicable to child custody proceedings, whether viewed as an action in law, to wit, as ancillary to divorce, Rules 1121 et seq., or as an action in equity, Rules 1501 et seq. In any event the initial determination of the applicability of the appropriate Pennsylvania procedural rules is properly a matter for the state\u2019s courts. Therefore, because appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>did not attempt to avail themselves. of the intervention procedure under Pa.R. Civ.P. 2326-2330, we are unwilling to accept their allegation that no Pennsylvania procedural avenue is open to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">In addition to recognizing that appellants failed to observe procedural rules of the state to achieve intervention and self-styled next friend or guardian status, we experience difficulty in accepting appellants\u2019 designation that the Magaziner children were \u201cmature children,\u201d and thereby entitled, without more, to select their guardian and next friend and their own counsel in a proceeding to which they are not parties. As we have previously noted, the children were ages 15, 12, and 10 at the time of the entry of appearance. We do not understand the legal connotations of the description \u201cmature children,\u201d nor is it necessary for us to do so in the present posture of this case. At the very least, if the status of \u201cmature children\u201d confers rights and privileges not possessed by ordinary minors under Pennsylvania law, determination of this issue is a subject for adjudication by that state\u2019s judiciary and not for initial determination by the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Recourse to Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s observations in Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 498, 61 S.Ct. 643, 644, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), is especially appropriate: \u201cThe complaint . . . undoubtedly tendered a substantial constitutional issue. It is more than substantial. It touches a sensitive area of social policy upon which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to its adjudication is open. Such constitutional adjudication plainly can be avoided if a definitive ruling on the state issue would terminate the controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">In its most recent pronouncement on abstention, Lake Carriers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. MacMullan, 406 U.S. 498, 92 S.Ct. 1749, 1759, 32 L.Ed.2d 257 (1972), the Supreme Court ordered a Pullman-type abstention (retaining jurisdiction until the state courts acted): \u201cThe paradigm case for abstention arises when the challenged state statute is susceptible of \u2018a construction by the state courts that would avoid or modify the [federal] constitutional question. Harrison v. NAACP, 360 U.S. 167 [79 S.Ct. 1025, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152.] Compare Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360 [84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377]. Zwickler v. Koota, <em>supra, </em>389 U.S. 241 at 249 [88 S.Ct. 391 at 396]. More fully, we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-10\">\u201c \u2018Where resolution of the federal constitutional question is dependent upon, or may be materially altered by, the determination of an uncertain issue of state law, abstention may be proper in order to avoid unnecessary friction in federal-state relations, interference with important state functions, tentative decisions on questions of state law, and premature constitutional adjudication. . . . The doctrine . contemplates that deference to state court adjudication only be made where the issue of state law is uncertain.\u2019 Harman v. Forssenius, 380 U.S. 528, 534 [85 S.Ct. 1177, 1182, 14 L.Ed.2d 50, 406 U.S. at 510-511, 92 S.Ct. at 1757] (1965).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">That is precisely the situation presented here. We have rehearsed in detail the procedural avenues which at least appear to provide courtroom access to the appellants, despite their allegations to the contrary. Moreover, Pennsylvania law also authorizes the use of the writ of habeas corpus to test child custody rights. Standard Pennsylvania Practice, \u00a7 50 Infants. In Commonwealth ex rel. Ebel v. King, 162 Pa.Super. 533, 58 A.2d 484 (1948), the court suggested that children could have status as petitioners and, therefore, as parties, in a child custody proceeding brought, not as here, under 23 Pa.Stat. Anno. \u00a7 15, subd. 3 (c), but under the Great Writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">We conclude, therefore, that the issues of state law are unresolved, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>these important preliminary issues must be decided by the state courts before a federal court can be hospitable to appellants\u2019 allegations that a single Pennsylvania state court judge deprived them of rights secured by the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Alternatively, if we approach the concept of abstention from the strictures of Zwickler v. Koota, <em>supra, </em>389 U.S. at 248, 88 S.Ct. 391, suggesting that the judge-made doctrine of abstention sanctions escape from immediate federal decision only in narrowly limited \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d we nevertheless find those circumstances present here \u2014 a state domestic relations case. Traditionally, it has been the policy of federal courts to avoid assumption of jurisdiction in this species of litigation. \u201cThe whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the states and not to the laws of the United States.\u201d In re Burrus, 136 U.S. 586, 593-594, 10 S.Ct. 850, 853, 34 L.Ed. 500 (1890).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, this court has explicitly held there is no federal diversity jurisdiction in a domestic relations case involving a child. Albanese v. Richter, 161 F.2d 688 (3d Cir. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">\u201cAs a matter of policy and comity, [child support cases are] local problems [which] should be decided in state courts. Domestic relations is a field peculiarly suited to state regulation and control, and peculiarly unsuited to control by federal courts.\u201d Buechold v. Ortiz, 401 F.2d 371, 373 (9th Cir. 1968). For other cases to the same effect, see 1 Barron and Holtzoff, (Wright Ed.) \u00a7 40.1 n.36.11. Thus, putting aside equal protection considerations, Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971), not present here, the federal courts, and especially this circuit, have steered a course away from domestic relations cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">In recent months, this court has invoked the doctrine of abstention even in a diversity case, because of deference to the expertise of the Orphans Court of Pennsylvania, recognizing \u201cthe special ability of the state court to decide those issues in view of its exclusive state jurisdiction over trusts and estates.\u201d Reichman v. Pittsburgh National Bank, 465 F.2d 16, 18 (3d Cir., 1972. Similarly, in Allegheny Airlines v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, 465 F.2d 237 (3d Cir., 1972), abstention was allowed, not only because of the teachings of Alabama Public Service Commission v. Southern R. Co., 341 U.S. 341, 71 S.Ct. 762, 95 L.Ed. 1002 (1951), and Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed 1424 (1943), but because we found the presence of significant state concerns and the absence of corresponding federal concerns. This consideration has been the philosophical underpinning of the reluctance of federal courts to intrude upon domestic relations problems, traditionally governed by the domestic policies of the several states. Professor Wright observes that the domestic relations and probate exceptions, see Reichman v. Pittsburgh National Bank, <em>supra, </em>to federal jurisdiction, may \u201crationally be defended on the ground that these are areas of the law in which the states have an especially strong interest and a well-developed competence for dealing with them.\u201d Wright, Federal Courts, \u00a7 25 at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Because of our finding of mootness, the unsettled state of Pennsylvania law in this area, and the re-affirmation of our policy of non-intrusion by federal courts in domestic relations problems, we agree that dismissal of the complaint was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-6\">. We take judicial notice that Lisa Aversa Richette has been serving as judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, since December 30, 1971.

The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">\u201cThe difference between an abstract question and a \u2018controversy\u2019 contemplated by the Declaratory Judgment Act is necessarily one of degree, and it would be difficult, if it would be possible, to fashion a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy. Basically, the question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\u201d Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 512, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akt\">We think that under all the circumstances of the case the fact that it was most unlikely that the Congressman would again be a candidate for Congress precluded a finding that there was \u201csufficient immediacy and reality\u201d here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJlY\">It was not enough to say, as did the District Court, that nevertheless Zwickler has a \u201cfurther and far broader right to a general adjudication of unconstitutionality . . .
