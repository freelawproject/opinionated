Except for the last point, we find no merit in defendants\u2019 appeal. Only a brief statement of the facts is necessary as a preface to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-21\">The claims describe a hydraulic pump used to operate a paint spray gun. Spray painting normally is an intermittent operation; frequently, instead of turning off the entire unit when spraying is discontinued, the pump continues to operate on \u201cstandby.\u201d The patented invention improves the efficiency of standby operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-22\">The apparatus contains one chamber housing the \u201cdriving fluid\u201d and another containing the paint, or \u201cpumped fluid.\u201d The standby operation is designed to permit the immediate resumption of spraying without permitting the continued operation of the power source in the driving fluid chamber to cause a substantial buildup of pressure or temperature when the gun is not spraying paint. In the prior art, overheating of the driv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ing fluid was avoided by recirculation of that fluid through bulky auxiliary equipment which included heat exchange apparatus such as a relatively large cooling tank. Much of that auxiliary equipment may be eliminated by the use of the patented invention which takes advantage of the cooling effect which occurs when liquid is evaporated. By creating a partial vacuum, or \u201ccavitation,\u201d in the driving liquid chamber, some of the liquid vaporizes and produces \u201ccavitation cooling.\u201d Some of the bulk and inefficiency of prior art pumps is thereby obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Schlosser and Drath, the two individual defendants, are former employees of the plaintiff. Schlosser conceived the patented invention and assigned it to plaintiff while still in plaintiff\u2019s employ. Subsequently, he, Drath, and a third party organized the defendant corporation and in due course developed the infringing models which are manufactured and sold by the corporate defendant. This simple history, stressed repeatedly during the trial, may explain plaintiff\u2019s unusual decision to demand a jury trial in a patent case.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Defendants challenge the manner in which the case was submitted to the jury. Defendants do not argue that it was error to submit either the entire case or any specific issue to the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The contention is not that the jury was permitted to decide questions of law; rather, it is argued that in view of the way the jury verdict was reached, it is impossible for a reviewing court to determine whether the three-step analysis required by Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545, was properly made.</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">As defendants phrase their argument, \u201cThe Legal Conclusion On Patent Validity Must Be Reversed For Failure To Give Verbal Expression To The Required Factual Determinations.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants argue that \u201cwithout such findings, there is no way for a reviewing court to determine whether the correct legal standard was applied.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ax0\">Unquestionably, the issue of validity is a question of law. Moreover, as this court squarely held after considering the matter <em>en banc, </em>the issue of obviousness is also a question of law. Armour &amp; Co. v. Wilson &amp; Co., 274 F.2d 143, 151-157 (7th Cir. 1960). But we also concluded in <em>Armour </em>that \u201cthe rules governing the trial of patent cases are no different than in other types of civil litigation, and further, that the scope of our review on appeal follows the same pattern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">In a patent case, as in any other case tried to a jury, questions of law are for the court and questions of fact are for the jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our rules do not contemplate that a jury may be asked to make the kind of detailed findings of fact which Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires of a judge who sits without a jury. Therefore, if defendants are, in effect, argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>ing that such findings must be made by a jury in a patent case, the argument is unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In the normal jury trial, allocation between judge and jury of their respective decisional responsibilities may be accomplished by the use of special interrogatories or special verdicts, or by the court\u2019s instructions to the jury before it returns a general verdict. Which method is appropriate in a particular case is a matter to be determined by the wise discretion of the trial court in the circumstances of the particular litigation before it. When only two or three narrow issues of fact, such as the date of invention or perhaps the date of first public sale, determine the issue of patent validity, it may be entirely appropriate to submit special interrogatories to the jury. But if, as in this ease, one party contends that as many as 32 separate fact questions must be resolved, the trial judge certainly may consider it inappropriate to use the special interrogatory procedure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In this case, the trial judge was not required, as a matter of law, to submit special interrogatories to the jury, and we hold that he did not abuse his discretion in refusing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">This holding does not mean, as defendants contend, that the legal conclusion on patent validity may not be reviewed under the <em>John Deere </em>guidelines whenever a jury returns a general verdiet. As in any other jury trial, the court\u2019s rulings on questions of law are subject to review. If the ultimate issue of validity depends on subsidiary fact questions, it is the court\u2019s duty to instruct the jury that it should return one verdict if the facts are found one way and a different verdict if the facts are found otherwise.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In such event, as in other cases tried to a jury, the reviewing court will presume that the disputed matters of fact have been resolved favorably to the prevailing party in accordance with the trial judge\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The task of giving error-free instructions in a patent case may indeed be extremely difficult.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But we are not asked in this case to consider whether the instructions to the jury were improper in any respect. We therefore have no occasion to express any opinion about the adequacy of the instructions as a whole, or any specific instruction which may have been given over the objection of the losing party.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">We therefore find no merit in the attack which appellants have made on the procedure followed by the trial judge in submitting this case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">Each of the infringed claims depends from a broader claim. Thus, claim 23 of the \u2019845 patent reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-15\">\u201c23. A fluid power transfer apparatus substantially as set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>claim 22, said prime mover being a pump, and said variable load material being a paint spray gun.\u2019-\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Claim 22, in turn, depends from claim 1 of the \u2019845 patent,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and claim 19 of the \u2019270 patent depends from claim 12.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is clear as defendants argue, that a product which did not infringe claim 22 of the \u2019845 patent could not infringe claim 23. Thus, if the court made a final adjudication of noninfringement of claims 1 and 22 of the \u2019845 patent and claim 12 of the \u2019270 patent, such an adjudication would foreclose recovery for infringement of the claims in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Defendants contend that the district court\u2019s direction of a verdict against plaintiff on all claims except 23 of \u2019845 and 19 of \u2019270 should be so construed. The record clearly establishes, however, that the trial judge merely intended to preclude recovery on any claim except insofar as it was incorporated by reference in claims 23 and 19. Thus, to the extent that infringement, of claims 1 and 22 of the '845 patent was an essential element of plaintiff\u2019s proof of infringement of claim 23, the judge\u2019s ruling was not intended to foreclose that element of plaintiff\u2019s case. We do not construe the judge\u2019s action, as explained in the colloquies which preceded his direction of a verdict on all claims except 23 and 19, portions of which are set forth in the margin, as an adjudication of noninfringement of the broader claims incorporated by reference in the infringed claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>If the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the court\u2019s directed verdict were correct, there would have been no occasion for defendants to spend an entire week of trial putting in their defense. They would have asked for and received a directed verdict on claims 23 and 19. That they did not lends support to our conclusion. We find no merit in defendants\u2019 argument on appeal that the judge\u2019s direction of a verdict on all claims except 23 and 19 should foreclose recovery for infringement of the two claims he obviously intended to preserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Defendants correctly point out that \u201ccavitation cooling\u201d is an element of the patented invention even though those words do not appear in the claims. Defendants adduced evidence indicating that the temperature of the fluid in their pump increases from about 68\u00b0 to 124\u00b0 during standby operation. Since the operation resulted in heating the fluid, it is argued either (a) that a patent which requires \u201ccooling\u201d cannot have been infringed, or (b) that if \u201cheating\u201d is construed as infringing the \u201ccooling claim,\u201d the claim is invalid for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-18\">We regard these arguments as little more than a play on words. As we understand the \u201ccooling\u201d concept, whether by cavitation or by circulation through a heat exchanger, it merely involves the removal of some heat that would otherwise cause a higher temperature. Conceivably, without cavitation cooling, the temperature of the liquid in defendants\u2019 pump during the standby operation would increase much more than it does; if so, the system tended to avoid overheating; we believe minimizing heating is \u201ccooling\u201d within the meaning of the patent specifications.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We find no merit in the contention that a cooling system must necessarily cause a temperature decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-19\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-20\">On June 14, 1967, plaintiff granted a license under the '845 patent to Lake Erie Machine Company (LEMCO). LEMCO is not a party to this litigation and the position it may occupy in any relevant market is not indicated by the record. The LEMCO license agreement contains the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-21\">\u201cA. During the life of this Agreement or any extension or continuation thereof, LEMCO agrees not to contest the validity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>PANTHER Patent Number 3,254,845 or any continuation, divisions or reissues thereof or any corresponding foreign patents, provided however that no royalties shall become payable under this Agreement on subject matter of claims after a finding of invalidity of such claims by any competent court of final Appellate Jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">In Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653, 89 S.Ct. 1902, 23 L.Ed.2d 610, decided in 1969, the Supreme Court held that a licensee is not estopped to challenge the validity of a patent; in view of that holding, the \u201cno contest\u201d provision in the LEMCO license is plainly unenforceable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Defendants would therefore have us conclude that such a provision in a license is a \u201cmisuse\u201d of the patent which forecloses recovery of damages for infringement by a non-licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">A fair evaluation of defendants\u2019 argument requires us to identify two different lines of authority. The first is \u201cthe series of decisions in which the Court has condemned attempts to broaden the physical or temporal scope of the patent monopoly.\u201d Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University Foundation, 402 U.S. 313, 343, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 1450, 28 L.Ed.2d 788. It is this line of cases in which the \u201cmisuse\u201d doctrine developed. \u201cA second group of authorities encourage authoritative testing of patent validity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344, 91 S.Ct. at 1451. Although the Court explained that the <em>Lear </em>opinion relied on both lines of authority, it expressly stated that its \u201cholding that licensee estoppel was no longer tenable was rooted in the second line of cases eliminating obstacles to suit by those disposed to challenge the validity of a patent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 91 S.Ct. at 1451. In our opinion neither of these two lines of cases justifies the application of the \u201cmisuse\u201d doctrine in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">We have recently recognized the force of the policy of encouraging authoritative testing of patent validity. Business Forms Finishing Service, Inc. v. Glowiak, 452 F.2d 70 (7th Cir. 1971). That policy, however, is not served by a rule which enables an infringer to escape liability without challenging the validity of a patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">The policy underlying the misuse doctrine is designed to prevent a patentee from projecting the <em>economic </em>effect of his admittedly valid grant beyond the limits of his legal monopoly.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Misuse of the patentee\u2019s economic monopoly no doubt would have made the \u201cno contest\u201d clause in the LEMCO license unenforceable even before <em>Lear </em>was decided, but the cases limiting the manner in which a patentee may exploit his monopoly contain no suggestion that the existence of such a clause should itself be considered a \u201cmisuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Although the Supreme Court has unequivocally condemned the use of a patent as a beachhead from which competition in unrelated lines of commerce may be assaulted, it has also recognized that a patentee has a right to a full monopoly return on the invention which he has discovered and disclosed to the public.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>It is his right to that return which provides the incentive for invention and disclosure which the entire patent system is designed to encourage. A fair appraisal of the policy considerations which underlie the patent system itself, in our view, makes it inappropriate to preclude enforcement of a valid patent against an infringing non-licensee simply because an unenforceable provision has been included in a patent license agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The case would, of course, present a different issue if either the license provision or the patentee\u2019s exploitation of his patent produced economic consequences raising serious questions under the antitrust laws. Such questions were present in United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174, 83 S.Ct. 1773, 10 L.Ed.2d 823,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and were raised in Bendix Corporation v. Balax, Inc.,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> 421 F.2d 809, 819-821 (7th Cir. 1970), but are not present here.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We hold that the \u201cno contest\u201d clause in the LEMCO license, though unenforceable under Lear, does not constitute the kind of \u201cmisuse\u201d of the patent which forecloses recovery of damages from an unlicensed infringer.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The jury assessed damages of $150,000 against the corporate defendant. Defendant contends that this award was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence indicated that its exclusive licensee paid a royalty of $75 per machine and that defendant sold 2,641 infringing machines. Plaintiff therefore argued that it should recover at least $198,000 ($75 x 2,641). The jury\u2019s award was about 75% of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Defendant argues that the $75 negotiated rate was for an exclusive license; that its machines sold for a much lower price than the licensee\u2019s; and that a reasonable royalty should not exceed 5%, whereas the $75 rate applied to its sales would amount to 22%. Plaintiff replies that the percentages are misleading because different levels of distribution may be involved and, in any event, the statute merely makes the reasonable royalty a minimum measure of damages.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">No question is raised about the form of the trial judge\u2019s instructions on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>damage issue. The question for us is not what the damage award should be, but rather whether the amount awarded by the jury is supported by the record. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The jury assessed damages of $5,000 against each of the individual defendants. All of the infringing pumps, however, were manufactured and sold by the corporate defendant. The individual defendants participated in the infringement in their capacity as officers and agents of the corporation. There is no suggestion in the record that the corporation is not financially responsible or that the individuals derived any direct benefit from the infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The individual liability of managing officers of a corporation for acts of infringement committed by the corporation under their general direction was considered in depth in Dangler v. Imperial Machine Co., 11 F.2d 945, 946-948 (7th Cir. 1926).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">\u201cRespecting the liability of officers of a corporation for its infringements of letters patent, the authorities are not in accord. The weight of authority, it seems, denies such liability in the ordinary case. That is to say, if the officers act merely as officers, they are not liable jointly with the corporation. It is only when the officers act outside the scope of their official duties that they become liable. * * * There are, however, numerous authorities that hold the managing officers liable for damages committed by the corporation in case of infringements. The enforcement of this liability is seldom sought, except in case of insolvency of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">\u201cThese latter holdings are on the theory that the corporation commits the tort only under the direction of the managing officers, and therefore these officers, including the directors who authorize the manufacture and sale of the infringing devices, are liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">* -X- * 41 # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\">\u201cThe latter view seems to have the support of the text writers. Robinson on Patents, \u00a7 912; Walker on Patents, \u00a7\u00a7 410-412. This court has heretofore taken the position first announced, namely, that the officers are not liable unless they act outside the scope of their official duties. Cazier v. Mackie-Lovejoy Mfg. Co., 138 F. 654, 71 C.C.A. 104; Reed v. Cropp Concrete Mach. Co., 225 F. 764, 141 C.C.A. 90.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-13\">* -X- * * * *'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-14\">\u201cAfter due consideration of the various authorities, as well as the reasons back of the two positions, we adhere to the Cazier v. Mackie-Lovejoy Mfg. Co. decision, and hold that, in the absence of some special showing, the managing officers of a corporation are not liable for the infringements of such corporation, though committed under their general direction. The uncertainty surrounding the questions of validity and infringement make any other rule unduly harsh and oppressive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-15\">\u201cIt is when the officer acts willfully and knowingly \u2014 that is, when he personally participates in the manufacture or sale of the infringing article (acts other than as an officer), or when he uses the corporation as an instrument to carry out his own willful and deliberate infringements, or when he knowingly uses an irresponsible corporation with the purpose of avoiding personal liability \u2014 that officers are held jointly with the company. * -X- * <em>\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">We adhere to <em>Dangler </em>and find no \u201cspecial showing\u201d in this record to support an award of damages against the individual defendants. The damage recovery against the corporate defendant will adequately compensate the plaintiff for the acts of infringement shown by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The judgment against the individual defendants is reversed; the judgment against the corporate defendant is affirmed.

Defendants rely heavily on the footnote in Mr. Justice White\u2019s concurring opinion, 374 U.S. at 200, 83 S.Ct. 1773, as indicating that the subsequent decision in <em>Lear </em>should have been anticipated by plaintiff when the LEMCO license was executed. That argument, assuming its validity, does not affect our analysis of the misuse issue. In the <em>Singer </em>case, the court found a violation of the Sherman Act involving an agreement between competitors to exclude Japanese machines from the American market and to assist each other in a collective endeavor to obtain the broadest possible patent monopoly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">.

Defendants argue that the clause exceeds the limit of the monopoly grant because it precludes a challenge to \u201cany continuation, divisions or reissues,\u201d as well as to the \u2019845 patent itself. But the license granted to LEMCO also broadly covered \u201cpatent extensions, reissues, and renewals and any patents issuing thereon . . . and the no contest commitment terminated with the expiration of the license.
