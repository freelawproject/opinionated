Finding appellant\u2019s allegations of error to be without merit, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-24\"> First, appellant questions the sufficiency of the evidence. Secondly, appellant asserts that the trial court erroneously permitted the Government to impeach its own witness, Holt, by means of testimony of another Government witness, Lockwood, there being no proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>that Holt\u2019s testimony surprised the Government and damaged its case. While appellant\u2019s court-appointed trial counsel,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> said nothing about the Government\u2019s use of the testimony to impeach Holt, he did object to its admission on grounds of hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Thirdly, appellant claims that, in addition to the limiting instruction in the court\u2019s charge, he was entitled to an instruction contemporaneous to Lockwood\u2019s testimony limiting it to its impeachment value.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">After a very careful study of the record and consideration of the very able and vigorous presentation made to us by counsel in his oral argument and brief, we are unable to say that error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-15\">. Appellant is represented by different court-appointed counsel on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
