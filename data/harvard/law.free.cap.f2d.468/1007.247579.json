A federal court jury found him guilty of possessing an unregistered sawed-off shotgun, in violation of 26 U. S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) (1970), and he was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-23\">Preston\u2019s appeal is directed to the District Judge\u2019s denial of his motion- to suppress evidence, i. e., the sawed-off shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-24\">On August 1, 1971, at 6:45 p. m. two police cars responded to the scene of an altercation outside of a beer garden in Nashville, Tennessee. The responding officers found a man lying fatally wounded on the ground. Twenty or thirty people were standing nearby. Another man was brandishing a pistol. A by-stander told Hager, one of the police officers, \u201cCheck the blue Mercury . . . there are guns in it.\u201d A Mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>cury automobile was standing 15 feet away from where the victim was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Three officers thereupon went over to the Mercury and searched it. Hager described the search as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-5\">\u201cA. One officer found a pistol under the front seat passenger side. Another officer found a loaded shotgun laying on the back seat. And at that time, after the first two guns were taken, I looked under the rear seat and found a sawed-off shotgun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">Officer Hager testified as to his reasons for the search. Immediately on arrival at the scene he went to the victim lying on the ground and saw that he had been shot. His testimony continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-7\">\u201cQ. Was he dead at the time or still living?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-8\">A. He was dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-9\">Q. And where was this in proximity to the automobile ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-10\">A. Approximately 15 feet from the automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-11\">Q. And you say Mr. Hazelwood, you later found out it was Mr. Hazel- . wood told you to look in the Mercury and you would find some guns in the Mercury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-12\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-13\">Q. Did he tell you who put the guns in the Mercury ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-14\">A. Not at that time, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-15\">Q. And at the time he mentioned this to you, this all occurred within a period of just a few minutes, did it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-16\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-17\">Q. Did you consider the situation to be an emergency-type situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-18\">A. Yes, sir, I did. One man was already shot and I was anxious to find the other weapon before somebody else got hurt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-19\">. The District Judge\u2019s order of January 27, 1971, denying the motion to suppress was founded upon the \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-21\">Though Officer Hager testified that he did not at that time know that the auto belonged to the defendant and that he had no knowledge as to the reliability of the individual who suggested he look in the car, he stated that he considered the situation to be an emergency and that he wished to find \u201cother weapons\u201d before someone else got hurt. Considering the exigent nature of the situation in which Officer Hager found himself, coupled with the fact that the automobile in question was only some fifteen feet from the body of the murder victim, this Court is of the opinion that the presence of a shotgun \u201claying\u201d on the rear seat made further search of the vehicle proper. When such further search turned up a concealed handgun, a thorough search of the remainder of the vehicle was reasonable, including removal of the rear seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-22\">It should be remembered that the Constitutional prohibition under which defendant would suppress the testimony herein in question is one against \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches and seizures. In the context of the case at bar, this Court cannot say that Officer Hager\u2019s actions were \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is DENIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1074-23\">It should be noted that this case does not offer the difficulty of possible police perjury present in Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972) (Decided June 12, 1972). <em>(See </em>Judge Friendly\u2019s opinion below, Williams v. Adams, 436 F.2d 30, 35 (2d Cir. 1970)). Although Officer Hager did not recognize the person who told him that there were guns in the blue Mercury, he subsequently identified him to the. court at the hearing on the motion to suppress and the informant, Hazelwood, was a witness at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-24\">Like the District Judge, we view the fact situation which Officer Hager and his fellow officers faced as a real emer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>gency. The presence of the victim, of his assailant, and probably of friends of both lends much weight to his answer as to whether he considered that he faced \u201can emergency-type situation.\u201d Hager\u2019s response was, \u201cYes, sir, I did. One man was already shot and I was anxious to find the other weapon before somebody else got hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">This case differs from many Fourth Amendment cases in that recourse to search warrant procedures was clearly impractical. If there were to be more shooting, it would be likely to happen long before a warrant could be procured. The police forces on the scene were certainly not such as to make it feasible to stakeout the car and send a detail for a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">As is frequently true in Fourth Amendment cases, we find no directly controlling precedent to guide this court on this appeal. The Supreme Court and this court have, of course, repeatedly distinguished between searches of dwelling places and searches of automobiles on the basis of the vital interest in privacy of the former, and the mobility of the latter. Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925); Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970); United States v. Baxter, 361 F.2d 116 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 834, 87 S.Ct. 79, 17 L.Ed.2d 69 (1966); United States v. Nelson, 459 F.2d 884 (6th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">The Supreme Court has also recognized \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d which warranted exceptions to the general requirement of a judicially issued search warrant as a predicate for a search. Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967); Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">The courts have also recognized \u201cemergency\u201d as a compelling reason for deviation from the warrant requirement, although frequently such recognition has been in dicta. McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 454, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153 (1948); United States v. Barone, 330 F.2d 543, 545 (2d Cir. 1964); Root v. Gauper, 438 F.2d 361, 364-365 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-10\">The closest case to our current problem appears to us to be Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). There the Supreme Court upheld a limited search for weapons in a situation felt to be life threatening to the police officer concerned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0A\">If this case involved police conduct subject to the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment, we would have to ascertain whether \u201cprobable cause\u201d existed to justify the search and seizure which took place. However, that is not the case. We do not retreat from our holdings that the police must, whenever practicable, obtain advance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure, see, <em>e. g., </em>Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967); Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 96, 85 S.Ct. 223, 228, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964); Chapman v. United States, 365 U.S. 610, 81 S.Ct. 776, 5 L.Ed.2d 828 (1961), or that in most instances failure to comply with the warrant requirement can only be excused by exigent circumstances, see, <em>e. g., </em>Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967) (hot pursuit); cf. Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364, 367-368, 84 S.Ct. 881, 884, 11 L.Ed.2d 777 (1964). But we deal here with an entire rubric of police conduct \u2014 necessarily swift action predicated upon the on-the-spot observations of the officer on the beat \u2014which historically has not been, and as a practical matter could not be, subjected to the warrant procedure. Instead, the conduct involved in this case must be tested by the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>Amendment\u2019s general proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-4\">Nonetheless, the notions which underlie both the warrant procedure and the requirement of probable cause remain fully relevant in this context. In order to assess the reasonableness of Officer MeFadden\u2019s conduct as a general proposition, it is necessary \u201cfirst to focus upon the governmental interest which allegedly justifies official intrusion upon the constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen,\u201d for there is \u201cno ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search [or seize] against the invasion which the search [or seizure] entails.\u201d Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 534-535, 536-537, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1735, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967). Terry v. Ohio, <em>supra </em>at 20, 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1879.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APt\">The governmental interest in the instant case was the officer\u2019s concern for the safety of members of the public present at the scene, either involved or uninvolved in the altercation. Additionally, there was a concern for his own safety and that of his fellow, officers on the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">The privacy invasion was not that of a home or person. And the search of the car was not a general search or one aimed at producing evidence for prosecution. It was a search designed to defuse a potentially explosive situation by seizure of the firearms before that explosion occurred. It was limited specifically to firearms and terminated when they were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">We conclude, as did the District Judge, that the search which uncovered the sawed-off shotgun was \u201creasonable\u201d in a constitutional sense under the standards articulated in Terry v. Ohio, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">Other issues briefed before this court were withdrawn at oral argument. We agree they should have been, since we find them without merit on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
