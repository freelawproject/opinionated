Finding that the trial judge made remarks to the defendant that to a significant degree could have inhibited defendant\u2019s right both to demand a jury trial and to testify on his own behalf, we reverse and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-19\">Defendant-appellant, Forrest Anderson, was charged under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d), 5861 (i), and 5871 with illegally-possessing an unregistered sawed-off shotgun that was not identified by the required serial numbers. During a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, appellant testified concerning the circumstances of his arrest and the seizure of the shotgun. The version of those events related by appellant and another person arrested at the same time differed markedly from the version told by the several police officers who had effectuated the arrests and seizure. At the conclusion of the hearing, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-20\">THE COURT: \u201cIt is plainly apparent this was a legal search and seizure . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-21\">\u201cWe believe the officers instead of the defendant insofar as the manner in which [the events occurred]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-22\">\u201cWe recommend that counsel for the defendant talk with his client about the possibility of the man having committed perjury before this court at this hearing, and possibly being convicted for possession of the gun and also additional perjury at the trial before the jury, if he gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the same testimony that he gave here today. So he is faced with two perjury counts if he goes to trial, namely, sentences up to five years imprisonment each, and also the substantive count involved in this indictment \u2014 two counts in the indictment .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">\u201cWhat is the maximum penalty on each of these counts?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">MR. PERKINS [one of the attorneys] : \u201cA fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment of not more than ten years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">THE COURT: \u201cYou are looking at possible maximum penalties of thirty years plus the fines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Appellant thereafter withdrew his previous plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty. The trial judge carefully admonished appellant regarding a defendant\u2019s rights when pleading guilty, inquired into the voluntary character of the plea and appellant\u2019s knowledge of his rights, and accepted the plea. A judgment of conviction and sentence was entered and appellant subsequently filed a motion for new trial or alternatively to reduce sentence. The motion was filed in contemplation of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 on the ground that the. guilty plea was unconstitutionally coerced by the judge\u2019s remarks at the earlier hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From the denial of that motion appellant brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> The sole question necessary for the disposition of this appeal is whether the judge\u2019s remarks as a matter of fact or as a matter of law coerced appellant\u2019s guilty plea. We have studied the transcript of the trial court\u2019s cautious inquiries into the circumstances of the plea, which led the trial court to find that the plea \u201chad been entered freely and voluntarily, with full knowledge and understanding of the possible consequences of the plea.\u201d We recognize the great weight that normally should be given to the trial judge\u2019s determination of the voluntariness of a plea;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nevertheless, we think it obvious that the only interpretation appellant could draw from the trial judge\u2019s remarks was that if he elected to stand trial and if he repeated his prior testimony, he would be convicted of perjury. In plain and simple fact, appellant was told by the judge hearing his trial that he was \u201clooking at\u201d an additional maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment \u201cif he goes to trial\u201d and \u201cif he gives the same testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\"> We find as a matter of law that these particular statements constituted an improper influence that prejudiced appellant\u2019s unqualified right to elect to stand trial on a plea of not guilty. Although warning a criminal defendant about the consequences of perjury may sometimes be acceptable or even desirable, to threaten a perjury conviction <em>if </em>the defendant stands trial and <em>if </em>the defendant takes the stand and testifies consistent with his prior statements is to deprive the plea thus \u201cinduced\u201d of any element of voluntariness. A voluntary plea must be free of intimidatory implications. Rule 11, Fed.R.Crim.P., requires more than mere ritualistic forensics and commands an inquiry leading to a determination that the guilty plea is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>not hyphenated by extrinsically coercive factors. Although Rule 11 was <em>apparently </em>complied with here, we hold that the earlier remarks of the trial judge constituted an insurmountable element of coercion. An involuntary guilty plea is void, <em>see </em>Machibroda v. United States, 1962, 368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473, therefore this judgment must be vacated, appellant must be allowed to enter a new plea, and thus a new trial must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\">. Appellant alleged in support of the motion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">\u201cThe Court erred in instructing the Defendant, Forrest Anderson, that unless he plead guilty to the charges filed against him, the Court would see that the Defendant was charged with the criminal offense of perjury. Defendant Forrest Anderson was placed in such a state of emotional pressure that he in effect was coerced by the Trial Court to enter his plea of guilty. Defendant, Forrest Anderson, would show that had such statements not been made by the Trial Judge, he would not have entered a plea of guilty but would have stayed with his original plea of not guilty and gone to trial on the merits of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-15\">. When constitutional rights are in issue, formalistic recitations regarding the voluntariness of a guilty plea will not prevent an appellate court from inquiring into the totality of circumstances surrounding the plea. <em>See, e. g. </em>Gallegos v. United States, 5 Cir. 1972, 466 F.2d 740.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
