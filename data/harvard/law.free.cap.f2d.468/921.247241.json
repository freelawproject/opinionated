We affirm the summary judgment for the reasons expressed in the opinion of the district court, United States v. Reeves, 349 F.Supp. 1321, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-16\">Hitchinrail\u2019s assertions that the district court erred in vacating SBA\u2019s default on its counterclaim, and that it was denied notice and opportunity to be heard on SBA\u2019s motion for summary judgment, are without merit. Jefferson v. Asplund, 9 Cir., 1972, 467 F.2d 199 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-17\">Finally, Hitchinrail claims that it was entitled to reimbursement under Alaska Stat. \u00a7 29.10.501, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-18\">\u201cIf the court vacates or sets aside a judgment of foreclosure, the court shall determine the value of the improvements placed on the property by the city or by a purchaser from the city, and shall give judgment for that amount and collect it from the claimant before putting him in possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayq\">This argument also fails. No judgment of foreclosure was set aside by the summary judgment against Hitchinrail.</p>\n<p id=\"A6-\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
