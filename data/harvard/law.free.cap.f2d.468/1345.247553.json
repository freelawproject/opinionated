The company claimed that McDaniel was a supervisor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at the time of his discharge and was therefore not protected by \u00a7 8 of the Act which applies only to \"employees\u201d ; that the term \u201cemployees\u201d excludes \u201cany individual employed as a supervisor.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before this court, the company claims that the Board unlawfully relitigated the question of McDaniel\u2019s status subsequent to a determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>nation by a Regional Director at a representation hearing that assistant foremen were supervisors; and, that if the Board lawfully undertook to relitigate McDaniel\u2019s status, it acted arbitrarily and capriciously in crediting McDaniel\u2019s testimony as to his lack of supervisory powers in light of the inconsistencies therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-4\">The company is engaged in the business of manufacturing furniture at High Point, North Carolina. McDaniel had worked in the welding department on the first shift from January 30, 1970, until his discharge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the first three days on the first shift he worked as an ordinary welder and thereafter filled the position which the company characterizes as that of \u201cassistant foreman.\u201d McDaniel himself referred to the position as that of a \u201cjig set-up man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">The parties agree that McDaniel\u2019s duties consisted of supplying to the separate booths, in which the welders worked, the proper pieces to be welded into a finished product, together with a \u201cjig,\u201d which is a device for holding the parts in the proper relation to each other while the welder worked on them. He was to make sure that the welders always had work to do and had a list from which to select the next item to be completed. He also had responsibility to check the finished products and to return them to the welder if he found them to be faulty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is conflicting testimony as to any discretion which McDaniel had to vary the work schedule or to exercise any of the controls, exercised by or delegated to those in supervisory positions, over the welders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-11\">McDaniel consistently maintained that he had no control over the work assignments but merely chose the welding job \u201cat the top of the list\u201d given him by his supervisor, David Twisdale, the foreman of the welding department, and could only depart from the list if a \u201crush job\u201d were requested, and he would then be directed to do so by foreman Twisdale. The plant superintendent, Robert Craven, testified that as an assistant foreman, McDaniel had the authority to report rule infractions and recommend hiring and firing, time off and raises in pay. McDaniel denied that he possessed such authority and had never been told that he had it. Uncontroverted evidence shows that McDaniel never exercised any of these powers when working on the first shift.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-12\">The company correctly argues that it is not the exercise of authority, but the delegation of authority, which is indicative of the attributes of a supervisor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, we think it may fairly be added that an employee must be informed of such delegation of authority to act in a manner reserved to those in supervisory positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-13\">We find no evidence in the record to indicate even a suggestion to McDaniel by the company that such supervisory status had been delegated to him until Friday, April 10, 1970, when McDaniel was invited for the first and only time to attend a meeting of supervisors. At that meeting, the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>did not inform McDaniel of the specific duties and powers which they contend had been granted him upon his promotion to an \u201cassistant foreman,\u201d but merely read the definition of a supervisor as contained in the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11), and informed him that they considered his position to fit within that definition. The company further informed McDaniel that anyone in a supervisory position who acted in furtherance of union organizational efforts, was subject to discharge. Upon McDaniel's stated refusal on the following Monday to discontinue his organizational efforts, he was discharged. The determination whether McDaniel was a \u201cleadman,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as asserted by the General Counsel, or a supervisor is a question of fact to be decided by the Board in the exercise of its expertise<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, although this court might have reached a different result as an original matter,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it is bound by the Board's decision if supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and we find that the decision here is so supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">The company urges this court to overturn the finding of credibility as to McDaniel\u2019s testimony in relation to his duties. There were conflicts in McDaniel\u2019s testimony on two occasions. When asked if he had ever heard the term \u201cassistant foreman\u201d used in the plant, McDaniel testified that he had not; yet upon cross-examination he admitted asking the person with whom he worked, William Little, if Little\u2019s title was that of \u201cassistant foreman.\u201d However, a reasonable interpretation of McDaniel\u2019s statement was that he had not heard the term used by others, only the one time when he raised the question himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-16\">When questioned about the contents of his affidavit filed with the Board, and whether he was familiar with it, McDaniel was unsure in his reply and several times changed his answer during repeated questioning by counsel for the company. The company characterizes this episode as evincing contrived testimony, showing that he was giving answers which he considered most beneficial to his interests and that the trial examiner\u2019s resolution of credibility in the face of it was \u201castounding.\u201d In support of its position the company cites N. L. R. B. v. Smoky Mountain Stages, 447 F.2d 925 (4 Cir. 1971), in which this court reversed the Board\u2019s resolution of credibility in favor of the discharged employee and refused to enforce the Board\u2019s order of reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-17\">In <em>Smoky Mountain Stages, </em>the employee\u2019s testimony was shown to be false in almost every instance by objective evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For the Board to find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>in that case that a proven consistent liar was telling the truth on a crucial issue when he had a paramount personal interest in the outcome, was held to be arbitrary and capricious. The company has here failed to meet the test stated in <em>Smoky Mountain Stages </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-4\">\u201cIn this case we do not think that the Board can make an honest witness of Wells who was so thoroughly discredited and who so tenaciously disregarded his sworn duty and obligation to testify truthfully.\u201d (447 F.2d at 929:)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1415-5\">Committed to the Board are the right and duty to resolve questions of credibility of witnesses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Justification for overturning such a finding requires far more objective evidence than a stammering and forgetful witness. We see no reason to disturb this credibility resolution of the Board in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-6\">The company also contends that it was error for the Board to hold a hearing on the issue of McDaniel\u2019s status because his status had been previously determined in a representation hearing. Subsequent to McDaniel\u2019s discharge, the Board delegated its authority to a Regional Director<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to hold a representation hearing and determine an appropriate unit. At that hearing McDaniel was presented by the union as a witness, obviously to show that he had not been informed that he was clothed with supervisory powers; also, that he in fact performed no supervisory functions, all of which would support an inference that assistant foremen, as a class, were not supervisors. However, as shown immediately below, McDaniel\u2019s testimony, which was essentially the same as that which he gave at the unfair labor practice hearing, was discredited by the Regional Director:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-14\">\u201cI do not give any weight to McDaniel\u2019s description of his duties as it bears on the issue of the supervisory status of assistant foreman [sic], as it does not appear from the record that McDaniel was either classified or worked as an assistant foreman until just before leaving the employ of the Employer. I also give no weight to McDaniel\u2019s testimony that he had not known assistant foremen to attend supervisory meetings or to make recommendations concerning employees, as it is clear from the record that occasions for his observation of these matters were limited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1415-15\">No review of the Regional Director\u2019s decision to exclude assistant foremen from the unit was sought. The company contends, therefore, that relitigation of the issue of McDaniel\u2019s status in the unfair labor practice proceeding is expressly barred by the regulation of the Board, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.67(f) which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1415-16\">\u201cThe <em>parties </em>may, at any time, waive their right to request review. Failure to request review shall preclude such <em>parties </em>from relitigating, in any related subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding, any issue which was, or could have been, raised in the representation proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>However, McDaniel was not a \u201cparty\u201d at the representation hearing within the purview of the regulation as he had been discharged a month prior thereto. It is true that in the interval between his discharge and the representation hearing the union had filed a charge of an unfair labor practice with respect to McDaniel\u2019s discharge but the complaint was not filed by the General Counsel until some months after the representation hearing and one month following the Regional Director's decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">The company asks this court to infer, from the negative language of the Regional Director\u2019s findings, a positive finding that McDaniel\u2019s status was that of assistant foreman.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, the Regional Director never addressed himself clearly to the question as to whether McDaniel was in fact an assistant foreman. The Director\u2019s statement can be construed only as a rejection of McDaniel\u2019s qualifications to testify concerning the supervisory powers of assistant foremen.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">Upon consideration of the record as a whole we conclude that the order of the Board should be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-6\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1412-6\">. \u00a7 2(11) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11), defines \u201csupervisor\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1412-7\">. any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, <em>or effectively to recommend such action, </em>if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.
