In order that a record may be made as to the errors which we have considered on the appeal of these two cases, we consider it appropriate to list them here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-16\">Lack of fairness in the proceedings, including inordinate participation by the trial court in the conduct of the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-17\">Failure of the trial court to grant defense motions for a continuance and for psychiatric examination of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-18\">The introduction of evidence of the commission of unrelated offenses \u2014 offenses which occurred following the arraignment of the appellant on the first of these two cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-19\">The failure of the government to prove the existence of the bond in the bond-jumping case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB2S\">Failure of the government to prove the wilfulness of Lynott\u2019s failure to appear at the time he was charged with jumping the bond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af30\">The refusal of the trial court to exclude Deputy Clerk Griffiths as a witness after he had sat through the trial in the courtroom, in which he was later called to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIs\">A general criticism of the court\u2019s permitting Deputy Clerk Griffiths to testify because of the \u201cundue influence\u201d his testimony would have on the jury. The failure of the trial court to rule out evidence of other unrelated offenses because of the apparent prejudice that would result to the defendant, claimed to outweigh the need to permit the government to prove wilfulness in this manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ_\">The failure of the government to prove that the automobile was ever stolen.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
