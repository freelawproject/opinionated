Appellant specifically was convicted of conspiracy to smuggle and traffic in cocaine, contrary to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 173, 174, and was sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment and a |20,000 fine. Appellant\u2019s alleged role in the conspiracy was as a major customer of the Hernandez brothers, who were the initial American purchasers of the smuggled cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-20\">Appellant\u2019s principal point is that the trial court erred in permitting an in-court voice identification of him by New York City Detective Frank Cruet, who was monitoring defendant Enrique Hernandez\u2019 telephone pursuant to a state court order. Appellant also urges that it was error to permit the detective to give his interpretation of the argot used in the Hernandez-Gernie telephone conversations; that there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to establish appellant as a member of the conspiracy; and that the trial court erred in reserving decision on a motion for judgment of acquittal until the day of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-21\">We take up the telephone tap question first. The three conversations in question were on September 28, October 13, and October 29, 1970. At the time of these calls Detective Cruet had not met appellant. He claimed on a voir dire examination, however, to have heard Gernie\u2019s voice in \u201c [subsequent conversations, other conversations.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>also met appellant, although it was after the three telephone conversations in question; while we do not know the circumstances of the meeting, it is a little difficult to imagine how two people can meet with one not talking. Cruet recalled specifically one telephone call placed by Enrique Hernandez to a club in Manhattan in which \u201che asks for the person, Joe Gernie, and Joe Gernie gets on the phone.\u201d The court overruled appellant\u2019s objections that no foundation for the voice identification had been laid and specifically asked Detective Cruet, \u201cDo you recognize the defendant Joe Gernie\u2019s voice as the voice that you have marked \u2018Joe\u2019 or \u2018Joe Gernie\u2019 on [Government Exhibit] 18 for identification,\u201d to which an affirmative reply was received. The court left it to the jury to determine the witness\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">While the foundation was weak, a voice can be identified through subsequent acquaintanceship with it, which Cruet professed to have through a \u201cmeeting\u201d and other tapped calls, including one specifically asking for Gernie by name.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Weighing the testimony was a job for the jury. <em>See generally </em>NLRB v. Carpet, etc. Layers Local 419, 213 F.2d 49, 52 (10th Cir. 1954).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">It was proper to permit Detective Cruet to testify concerning the narcotics vernacular <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> used in the- telephone conversations. The objection was not that the officer was unqualified by lack of experience or objectivity to give an opinion, but that opinion testimony should not be received on the meaning of words used in the conversations. This objection is unavailing. <em>See </em>People v. Bateman, 57 Cal.App.2d 585, 135 P.2d 192 (1943) (\u201cthe testimony of a duly qualified expert ... is admissible to explain the significance of cryptic letters and figures which appear upon papers, books, and paraphernalia customarily used by bookmakers\u201d); Dwares v. Clifton Yarn Mills, 65 R.I. 471, 16 A.2d 501, 505 (1940); 7 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1955 (3rd ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">With the conversations in evidence and the interpretation of them by the narcotics detective admissible, there is sufficient evidence of Gernie\u2019s participation in the smuggling of November 5-6, as a purchaser from Enrique Hernandez, to justify his conviction, without detailing the conversations under which news of the \u201cMaipo\u2019s\u201d pending arrival with the contraband was related to Gernie, whom Enrique Hernandez told was \u201cthe first one\u201d that he would call.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\"> Finally, Gernie contends that the trial judge improperly reserved decision on Gernie\u2019s various motions for judgment of acquittal. The first of these was made at the end of the Government\u2019s case. While ruling on the motion promptly would have been the \u201cbetter practice,\u201d the judge\u2019s failure to do so was not reversible error in view of Ger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>nie\u2019s subsequent introduction of evidence. <em>See </em>United States v. Brown, 456 F.2d 293 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 407 U.S. 910, 92 S.Ct. 2436, 32 L.Ed.2d 684 (1972). <em>But see </em>Sullivan v. United States, 414 F.2d 714, 715 (9th Cir. 1969). As to the motions made at the close of all the evidence and after verdict, the judge was plainly entitled to reserve decision under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(b) and (c). What this court suggested was bad procedure in United States v. Fincke, 437 F.2d 856, 862 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 995, 91 S.Ct. 2170, 29 L.Ed.2d 160 (1971), was withholding decision until after summation and then granting the motion as to one defendant, in view of the possibility that had the motion been granted before argument the summations of the other defendants might have been different. Here there was clearly no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-15\">. The appeal of appellant Borrone-Iglar was dismissed on motion; as to the other appellants tlie judgments were affirmed in open court, 462 F.2d 574.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-12\">. At argument the court was .furnished copies of the transcript of tapped conversations in evidence, but this call was not one of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b487-13\">. Even if there were error in the original admission of the in-court voice identification, however, it could be argued that the error was cured by subsequent evidence at trial. In the questioned conversation of October 29, 1970, Enrique Hernandez asked the person whom Cruet testified he recognized as Gernie to get Enrique Hernandez\u2019 nephew a job, and Gernie said, \u201cAlright [sic]. We\u2019ll work on it this week.\u201d The defense subsequently called the nephew, who verified that Gernie had obtained a job for him, seeking thereby to establish the telephone conversation as innocent but substantiating its authenticity and the accuracy of Cruet\u2019s identification. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Volkell, 251 F.2d 333, 337 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 962, 78 S.Ct. 1000, 2 L.Ed.2d 1068 (1958); Skiskowski v. United States, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 158 F.2d 177, 180-182 (1946), cert. denied, 330 U.S. 822, 67 S.Ct. 767, 91 L.Ed. 1273 (1947). <em>But cf. </em>United States v. Modern Reed &amp; Rattan Co., 159 F.2d 656 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 331 U.S. 831, 67 S.Ct. 1510, 91 L.Ed. 1845 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b487-16\">. <em>E. g., </em>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to have twenty, twenty cents coming off,\u201d means, according to Detective Cruet, that the speaker (Enrique Hernandez) was supposed to be getting 20 kilos of narcotics.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
