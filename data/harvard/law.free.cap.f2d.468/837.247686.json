The district court granted the motion and dismissed with prejudice. Subsequently, on May 11, 1970, appellant moved to reopen the judgment. The motion was denied and we affirmed. Gambocz v. Ellmyer, 438 F.2d 915 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 919, 91 S.Ct. 2232, 29 L.Ed.2d 697 (1971), reh. denied, 404 U.S. 875, 92 S.Ct. 30, 30 L.Ed.2d 121 (1972). Two and one half weeks after affirmance of the denial of his motion to reopen, but before denial of his petition for rehearing en banc and'denial of his petition for a writ of certiorari, appellant filed the complaint in the present case. Certain irrelevant changes of a de minimis nature were made in this complaint as compared to his previous complaint. Anthony Yelencsics, Joseph Ferenczi, and the Township of Edison, New Jersey, were added as defendants. However, the operative facts of the two suits are identical.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number> Dismissal with prejudice constitutes an adjudication of the merits as fully and completely as if the order had been entered after trial. Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp., 349 U.S. 322, 327, 75 S.Ct. 865, 99 L.Ed.2d 1122 (1955). Therefore <em>res judicata </em>bars re-litigation of the claims dismissed in the prior suit against the defendants John Ellmyer, Lillian Apel, Louis La Plaga and Marie Keller. Fiumara v. Sinclair Refining Co., 385 F.2d 395 (3d Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">As to the defendants Yelencsics, Ferenczi, and the township,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> none of whom were parties to the first action, we must consider the application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>of the doctrine first enunciated by this court in Bruszewski v. United States, 181 F.2d 419 (3d Cir. 1950). There we held that <em>res judicata </em>may be invoked against a plaintiff who has previously asserted essentially the same claim against different defendants where there is a close or significant relationship between successive defendants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In construing Bruszewski, Judge Hastie, the author of that opinion, has stated, \u201cIt was our view in <em>Bruszewski . . . </em>that . a party who as plaintiff had asserted a claim and had lost should not be heard again on the merits of that claim even in a second suit which he thereafter has instituted against a stranger to the original claim.\u201d Nickerson v. Kutschera, 419 F.2d 983, 985 (3d Cir. 1969) (Hastie, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">In the application of <em>the.Bruszewski </em>doctrine, however, it is important that we be governed by the principle of the law rather than by the nomenclature affixed to it. Thus, the doctrine is sometimes called \u201ccollateral estoppel,\u201d see Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., 411 F.2d 88, 92 (3d Cir. 1969), because the plaintiff is indeed estopped from proceeding on the same cause of action against the new defendants. Use of the adjective \u201ccollateral\u201d to characterize this form of estoppel grows out of the fdci that the bar of the prior adjudication is not interposed directly, by parties to the prior suit, but indirectly, by new defendants, strangers to the earlier action. However, the conceptual basis of such an estoppel is closer to that of pure <em>res judicata </em>than pure \u201ccollateral\" estoppel,\u201d because the bar is interposed on the theory that the second action is but an attempt to relitigate the <em>same cause of action, </em>although the names of the defendants may be different. The distinction between this form of estoppel, <em>res judicata, </em>and \u201cpure\u201d collateral estoppel has been frequently emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-9\">Thus, under the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>a judgment \u201con the merits\u201d in a prior suit involving the same parties or their privies bars a second suit based on the same <em>cause of action. </em>Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, on the other hand, such a judgment precludes relitigation of <em>issues actually </em>litigated and determined in the prior suit, regardless of whether it was based on the same cause of action as the second suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp., <em>supra, </em>349 U.S. at 326, 75 S.Ct. at 867 (emphasis supplied). See also Judge Goodrich\u2019s opinion in <em>Lawlor, </em>before this court, 211 F.2d 934, 935 (3d Cir. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">The above distinction becomes important in this case. The cause of action was terminated in the first proceedings, and, therefore, the principle of <em>res judicata </em>would apply in favor of the original defendants and those new defendants encompassed by the <em>Bruszewski </em>rule. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>the other hand, the orthodox doctrine of collateral estoppel described by Chief Justice Warren in <em>Lawlor </em>is inapplicable here because the first \u201cjudgment was unaccompanied by findings and hence did not bind the parties on any issue.\u201d Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp., <em>supra, </em>349 U.S. at 327, 75 S.Ct. at 868; United States v. International Building Co., 345 U.S. 502, 505, 73 S.Ct. 807, 97 L.Ed. 1182 (1953). Only if the second suit relates to the same cause of action as the first, <em>Bruszewski, </em>as distinguished from merely presenting an identity of certain issues, United States v. International Building Co., <em>supra, </em>can it be said that \u201cthe [first] judgment dismissing the previous suit \u2018with prejudice\u2019 bars a later suit on the same cause of action.\u201d Lawlor v. National Screen Corp., <em>supra, </em>349 U.S. at 327, 75 S.Ct. at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">We previously determined that the essential allegations of the second complaint parallel those of the first. Moreover, what was averred in the original action was a conspiracy participated in by named individuals, and the sole material change in the later suit was the addition of certain defendants, some of whom had been named in the original complaint as participating in the conspiracy but had not been named as parties defendant at that time. We conclude that the relationship of the additional parties to the second complaint was so close to parties to the first that the second complaint was merely a repetition of the first cause of action and, therefore, it is barred by application of the <em>Bruszewski </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The court below granted appellee's request for a permanent injunction restraining appellant from instituting proceedings against appellees and their privies based upon the operative facts alleged in the complaint. Injunctive relief was a proper remedy under the circumstances of this case. See Root v. Woolworth, 150 U.S. 401, 14 S.Ct. 136, 37 L.Ed. 1123 (1893).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-13\">. Gambocz is an insurance broker or agent; Apel is court clerk for Edison Municipal Court; Ellmyer and La Plaga are police officers. Gambocz had given Keller a check which was returned for insufficient funds. Thereafter Keller signed a criminal complaint against Gambocz alleging the worthless check. Yelencsics was Gambocz\u2019s political opponent in a mayoralty contest in Edison, New Jersey. Ferenozi was his campaign manager. The gravamen of Gambocz\u2019s complaint is that all the defendants conspired against him to bring the worthless check charge for the purpose of harming him \u201cin his standing in the community, in business relations, [and] opportunity to run for political office.\u201d An action for abuse of process, brought in the state court system, was resolved in defendants\u2019 favor.

Ellmyer, 438 F.2d 915 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 919, 91 S.Ct. 2232, 29 L.Ed.2d 697 (1971), reh. denied, 404 U.S. 875, 92 S.Ct. 30, 30 L.Ed.2d 121 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-15\">.

On or about the 30th day of August, 1965, the Defendant, Louis La Plaga did meet and confer with the Defendant, Marie Keller, who was a private citizen and widow of one Leroy Keller, the latter being a deceased close friend of the Plaintiff and holder of an unpaid $55.00 check written in May of 1964 for a past consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-18\">10. As a result of said meeting, the Defendants, Anthony M. Yelencsics, John W.
