In their action in the district court they sought to reverse the determination by the Commission that their positions were properly classifiable as General Investigators, GS-11, and to recover lost wages because of the Commission\u2019s refusal to reclassify them as GS-12. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-17\">After appellants sought reclassification to the GS-12 level, an audit was made by the Civil Service Commission. Some complainants were upgraded and the three appellants were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-18\">Congress has given the Commission a broad charter to lay down standards for classifying the various federal positions in the appropriate grade (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5105), has directed the agencies to act in obedience to the rules that the Commission has promulgated (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107), and has empowered the Commission to investigate on its own motion to insure compliance by the agencies (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5110-5113). Finally, Congress has vested the Commission with full power to hear employees\u2019 complaints of non-compliance with the Classification Act and the standards promulgated thereunder, to investigate such complaints and to make a binding adjudication thereon (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5112(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-19\">Consistent administrative interpretation of statutes, if reasonable and not contrary to the express intent of Congress, is entitled to conclusive weight in court. Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); Ganse v. United States, 376 F.2d 900, 180 Ct.Cl. 183 (1967). This is especially true where the agency possesses expertise in a specialized field such as position classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>Appellants allege that the statute under which the Region must operate (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5101(1) (A)) specifically provides that Civil Service employees must receive \u201cequal pay for substantially equal work.\u201d They assert that the Region\u2019s decision flies in the face of this standard. We think it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">The Commission evaluated the appellants\u2019 duties and responsibilities by desk audit, by reference to the official position description and the Commission\u2019s determination that the appellants were not doing Grade 12 work. They were, therefore, not entitled to pay equal to that of Grade 12 investigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">Appellants have failed to show that the actions of the Commission were arbitrary. The decision not to reclassify was based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-7\">We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
