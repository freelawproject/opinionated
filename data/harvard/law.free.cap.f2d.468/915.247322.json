In urging reversal, he advances two contentions. The first relates to the District Court\u2019s alleged error in refusing a\u2019 jury instruction tendered by Gorostiza. The contention has no merit whatsoever. Nor does Gorosti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>za\u2019s second argument, urging that the District Court should have sustained his objection to a portion of the argument made by the prosecutor in closing summ\u00e1tion. The thrust of the prosecution\u2019s argument was that the defense had taken a \u201cPerry Mason\u201d-like approach. In closing arguments, both defense attorneys and prosecution attorneys are allowed reasonably wide latitude. They may strike \u201chard blows,\u201d based upon the testimony and its inferences, although they may not, of course, employ argument which could fairly be characterized as foul or unfair. In this case, we do not believe that the prosecutor exceeded his legitimate bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
