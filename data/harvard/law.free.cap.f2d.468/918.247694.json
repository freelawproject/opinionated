In a related claim, he contends that the trial court\u2019s instructing the jury on the inference of possession that arises from the unexplained presence of property on premises under a defendant\u2019s dominion and control, was improper in this case because it allowed the jury to convict him of removal or concealment upon mere proof of possession. Thirdly, appellant claims that the court\u2019s charge erroneously failed to present to the jury his theory of the case: that he did not have dominion, and control over the premises in question. Finding no error under the facts and circumstances of this case, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-21\">As to appellant\u2019s first point, we believe that the Government presented sufficient evidence of removal or concealment to justify a conviction for the offense charged in the indictment. As to his second contention, the record shows that the trial judge defined \u201cremoval\u201d and \u201cconcealment\u201d for the jury, and charged them that a verdict of guilty in this case would require their finding, not only that the untaxed liquor was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>covered on premises under appellant\u2019s dominion and control, but also that appellant in fact removed or concealed the whiskey. Reading the charge as a whole, therefore, we cannot accept appellant\u2019s contention that the jury was authorized to base a conviction for removal or concealment solely upon a finding of possession. Finally, since the jury was required to answer the question whether the premises were under appellant\u2019s dominion and control, appellant\u2019s third allegation of error finds no support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
