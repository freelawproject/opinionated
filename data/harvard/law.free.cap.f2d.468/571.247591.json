However, from our examination of the excerpted portions of the trial testimony which have been furnished us on appeal the bed under which the perverted acts were alleged to have occurred was not identified as Wallace\u2019s bed or that of any other particular inmate. On rebuttal the Government introduced the testimony of Lt. Donald Pegelow, a correctional officer at the reformatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>with several years\u2019 service, who testified that, from an examination recently made and measurements taken, some of the beds in the dormitory are quite low while other beds are high enough to permit the assault which Glenn described.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Wallace now asserts that the admission of Lt. Pegelow\u2019s testimony was error. We cannot agree. This testimony was proper rebuttal testimony and was relevant to the issue which the Government sought to prove, i. e., that there are beds in the dormitory high enough to permit the alleged perverted activity engaged in by Wallace and Glenn. United States v. Glaziou, 402 F.2d 8, 16 (2 Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Accordingly, finding no reversible error, we dispense with oral argument and affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
