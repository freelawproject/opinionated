His sentences were made to run concurrently on the three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-25\">The evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s determination that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>appellant knowingly and willfully presented and received payment for forged checks in one state drawn on a bank in another state and that he caused the checks to move in interstate commerce as his acts were done with knowledge that the use of the mails would follow in the ordinary course of business. United States v. Kenofskey, 243 U.S. 440, 37 S.Ct. 438, 61 L.Ed. 836 (1917); United States v. Sheridan, 329 U.S. 379, 67 S.Ct. 332, 91 L.Ed. 359 (1946); United States v. Masters, 456 F.2d 1060 (C.A.9, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">The short answer to appellant\u2019s . argument that he was sentenced on three counts when he was actually convicted of one offense, is that his sentences are to run concurrently and that his conviction on one count is sufficient to sustain the sentence.
