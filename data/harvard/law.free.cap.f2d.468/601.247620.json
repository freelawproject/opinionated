The' Court concluded that the case should be remanded to the Secretary for further administrative procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">The Trial Judge, however, prescribed the method by which additional vocational testimony on remand must be received. He directed that on remand the testimony of the vocational expert be based upon the expert\u2019s observation of the claimant at the hearing, on further testimony that the claimant may be called upon to give, and on examination of the exhibits and prior record in this case, \u201crather th\u00e1n upon a hypothetical question posed by the hearing examiner.\u201d The Trial Judge also directed that \u201cthe testimony of the vocational expert should be elicited free from any cross-examination on the part of the hearing examiner.\u201d The Secretary does not object to the remand of these proceedings but enters strenuous opposition to the restricted method of receiving the vocational expert\u2019s testimony, and asks that we nullify them by reversing the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">We believe the Secretary\u2019s position to be correct and that the restrictions imposed by the District Court relative to the expert\u2019s testimony are contrary to law and must be set aside. We are familiar with the Secretary\u2019s method of utilizing vocational experts, <em>see </em>Gardner v. Gunter, 5 Cir., 1965, 354 F.2d 755; King v. Finch, 5 Cir., 1970, 428 F.2d 709, and we see no impropriety in the hearing examiner inquiring fully into the basis of the vocational expert\u2019s conclusions relative to employment available to the claimant. The District Court may not circumscribe the hearing examiner\u2019s authority to examine witnesses, including the vocational expert. <em>See 42 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b). The regulations which the Secretary has adopted provide for the conduct of the hearing and examination of witnesses, <em>see 20 </em>C.F.R. 404.927 and 404.929, and these regulations are established under authority of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a). Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 400, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1426, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The regulations do not contemplate the restrictions attempted to be imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the restrictions imposed by the District Judge were improper and contrary to law and that his findings in this regard must be reversed so that the hearing examiner\u2019s role in these proceedings may not be impaired and the purposes of the Act be finally accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
