That initiative on its face purports to reinstate all of California provisions for the imposition of the death penalty that were in effect on February 17, 1972.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> February 17th is the date the California Supreme Court declared all such provisions violative of the California Constitution. People v. Anderson, 6 Cal.3d 628, 100 Cal.Rptr. 152, 493 P.2d 880 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-17\">White\u2019s basic claim is that Proposition 17 would violate the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as applied by the United States Supreme Court in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), and Moore v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786, 92 S.Ct. 2562, 33 L.Ed.2d 706 (1972). In our view, White lacks standing to assert this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-18\">According to White, the mere possibility of Proposition 17\u2019s passage, regardless of the election\u2019s actual result, will cause him the requisite injury in fact. <em>See, e. g., </em>Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972); Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). White is presently charged with the crime of first degree murder arising out of acts allegedly committed on or about J une 24,1972, approximately four months after the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in People v. Anderson, <em>supra. </em>Prior to <em>Anderson, </em>section 190 of the California Penal Code had authorized discretionary death sentencing in cases of first degree murder. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>White argues that the mere possibility of Proposition 17\u2019s passage and subsequent interpretation to reinstate section 190\u2019s death penalty and apply it retroactively to him is encouraging him and other criminal defendants similarly situated to waive various federal constitutional rights and even plead guilty now rather than risk the death penalty by stretching out their trials past the initiative\u2019s probable effective date. Such encouragement, asserts White, is analogous to that held impermissible in United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570, 88 S.Ct. 1209, 20 L.Ed.2d 138 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">There is no substance to White\u2019s fear that passage of Proposition 17 might subject him to the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Proposition 17 does not apply to White\u2019s case. By its own terms, it speaks only in the present tense: \u201cAll statutes in effect on February 17, 1972, requiring, authorizing, imposing, or relating to the death penalty <em>are </em>in full force and effect . . . \u201d (emphasis added). Even though retroactive application would arguably be insulated from attack on <em>state </em>constitutional grounds,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> there is no basis for asserting such application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">If Proposition 17 <em>were </em>interpreted to apply to White\u2019s alleged June 24th commission of first degree murder, the proposition would constitute a patent violation of article I, section 10, clause 1 of the <em>United States </em>Constitution: \u201cNo State shall . . . pass any . ex post facto Law . . ..\u201d Since the California Supreme Court had on February 17th voided section 190 of the California Penal Code to the extent it authorized imposition of the death penalty for White\u2019s alleged crime, the maximum penalty provided for that crime on the date of its alleged commission was life imprisonment. According to Justice Field, an ex post facto law is \u201cone which imposes a punishment for an act which was not punishable at the time it was committed; <em>or imposes additional punishment to that then prescribed </em>. . ..\u201d Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, 325-326, 18 L.Ed. 356 (1867) (emphasis added); <em>see </em>Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333, 377-378, 18 L.Ed. 366 (1867). Or, in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, it is a law \u201cwhich renders an act punishable in a manner in which it was not punishable when it was committed.\u201d Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch.) 87, 137, 3 L.Ed. 162 (1810). There is simply no possibility that California could now sentence White to death consistently with the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">Finally, the representative of the Attorney General of the State of California has represented to this court, both orally and in writing, that it is the official position of the State of California that Proposition 17, if enacted, will not revive the death penalty with respect to violations of section 187 of the California Penal Code, under which White is charged; that to so apply it would contravene both the federal and state Constitutions; and, accordingly, that White may not be sentenced to death for the offense with which he is charged even if the initiative is enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">Since we find that White\u2019s assertion of standing was frivolous, we need not reach the issue of whether a dismissal for want of standing could otherwise be made only by the three-judge district court requested by White. <em>See </em>Scott v. Hill, 449 F.2d 634, 635-637 (6th Cir. 1971), cert. denied 405 U.S. 928, 92 S.Ct. 979, 30 L.Ed.2d 801 (1972). The judgment of dismissal is accordingly affirmed. This court\u2019s mandate shall is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>sue forthwith, and no petition for rehearing will be entertained. <em>See </em>Rule 2, F.R.App.Proe.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-13\">. \u201cThe undersigned hereby propose that the Constitution of the State of California be amended by adding Section 27 to Article 1 thereof, permitting the death penalty as a form of punishment for criminal offenses, and petition the Secretary of State to submit this proposal to the electors of California for adoption. The text of the proposed measure is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-14\">\u201c \u2018Section 27 is added to Article 1, to read:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-15\">\u201c \u2018Sec. 27. All statutes of this state in effect on February 17, 1972, requiring, authorizing, imposing or relating to the death penalty are in full force and effect, subject to legislative amendment or repeal by statute, initiative, or referendum. The death penalty provided for under those statutes shall not be deemed to be, or to constitute, the infliction of cruel or unusual punishments within the meaning of Article 1, Section 6, nor shall such punishment for such offenses be deemed to contravene any other provision of this Constitution.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-20\">Brief for Appellant at 38 (App. a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-17\">. Although California constitutional and statutory law (Cal.Const., art. I, \u00a7 16; Pen.Code, \u00a7 3) prohibits any enactment that increases criminal penalties for conduct occurring prior to the enactment\u2019s effective date, the initiative provides that its reinstatement of the death penalty \u201cshall not be deemed ... to contravene any other provision of this Constitution.\u201d <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
