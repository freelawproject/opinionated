Code, \u00a7 25249.5 et seq. ), adopted a regulation setting a \"maximum allowable dose level\" or MADL for lead as a reproductive toxicant. ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 27, \u00a7 25805, subd. (b).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2015, appellant Mateel Environmental Justice Foundation (Mateel) sued OEHHA, seeking a writ of mandate ( Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085 ) and other relief to compel OEHHA to repeal that part of Regulations section 25805 setting a MADL for lead as a reproductive toxicant, seeking to invalidate the regulatory \"safe harbor\" level for lead of 0.5 microgram per day (\"\u03bcg/day\"). The trial court denied Mateel's motion for judgment on the pleadings for declaratory relief and/or writ of mandate and entered judgment in favor of OEHHA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mateel argues that OEHHA failed to comply with the Proposition 65 mandate that the MADL be based on an exposure having \"no observable effect\" when it utilized a \"surrogate\" \"no observable effect level\" (NOEL) derived from the \"permissible exposure limit\" (PEL) for lead set by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Mateel further argues that even if the blood lead level OSHA determined should be maintained for men and women who wished to plan pregnancies were appropriate to consider as a NOEL, the OSHA PEL was not set at a\n   level to achieve this target, that OEHHA failed to make a downward adjustment to account for this disconnect between the PEL and the target NOEL, and nothing in the record indicates OEHHA considered this issue in setting the MADL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We shall affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STATUTORY BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1986, Californians adopted Proposition 65 through the voter initiative process. \"Proposition 65 requires that, at least once per year, the Governor shall cause to be published 'a list of those chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity within the meaning of this chapter.' (\u00a7 25249.8, subd. (a).) The listing of a chemical triggers two requirements.

The Agency determined the MADL for lead, setting the regulatory safe harbor level for\n   reproductive toxicity at 0.5 micrograms per day. (Regs., \u00a7 25805, subd. (b).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its \"Final Statement of Reasons\" (FSOR),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Agency explained the need for adoption of these regulations. \"The Act [Proposition 65] exempts discharges, releases and exposures which, making certain assumptions, pose no significant risk of cancer or would produce no observable reproductive effect. The Act specifies that any claim of exemption under Health and Safety Code section 25249.10, subsection (c) must be based upon evidence and standards of comparable scientific validity to the evidence and standards which form the scientific basis for the listing of the substance as a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. However, ... the Act does not specify levels of exposure to reproductive toxins which have no observable effect, and provides no methods for determining those levels.\" (FSOR, pp. 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Agency recognized that \"[t]here is no fixed way to perform the steps necessary to specifically determine ... no observable effect. The methods used may vary depending upon the data available, and the objectives of the risk assessor or risk manager. The purpose of these regulations is to provide some 'safe harbor' levels and methodologies, and criteria for exposure assessment, which will assist persons in making certain that their discharges, releases or exposures pose no significant risk or would have no observable effect within the meaning of the Act.\" (FSOR, p. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Agency also recognized that lead had been included on the Governor's initial listing of chemicals known to cause reproductive toxicity because it had been identified by OSHA as a known human reproductive toxicant based upon evidence of its effects on humans (FSOR, p. 77) and the Agency relied on OSHA's PEL of 50 micrograms per cubic meter to establish the reproductive safe harbor level. \"OSHA multiplied the OSHA PEL of 50 micrograms per cubic meter by 10 cubic meters (the amount OSHA determined workers breathed over an eight-hour period) to\n   yield a value of 500 micrograms, which [the Agency] then divided by 1,000 to arrive at the 0.5 microgram-per-day standard.\" (\n   <em>\n    Beech-Nut, supra,\n   </em>\n   235 Cal.App.4th at pp. 313-314,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20189\">\n    185 Cal.Rptr.3d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) \"The\n   reproductive safe harbor level presumes that one can be exposed to 1,000 times the safe harbor level without suffering any adverse reproductive effects.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 317,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20189\">\n    185 Cal.Rptr.3d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In setting the MADL, the Agency acknowledged the difficulties in setting a NOEL for reproductive toxicants: \"The difficulty in identifying a NOEL for reproductive toxicants when the effects of concern are based upon human experience rather than animal bioassays is that there is often no precise data predicting what levels will produce no observable effect. However, there is experience derived from the occupational setting which suggests that exposure to certain regulated levels does not produce the reproductive effect of concern. Hence, the Agency has utilized certain limits for occupational exposures as surrogates for the NOEL in the workplace. The levels set forth in subsection (b) represent one one-thousandth of the occupational exposure limits. This approach is consistent with the purposes of the Act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FSOR, p. 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When the regulation setting the 0.5 micrograms per day MADL for lead was promulgated, several commentators provided extensive reviews of animal studies, urging that a higher MADL be adopted. At the time, no one argued for a lower MADL. (FSOR, pp. 78-81.) In its FSOR, the Agency explained its refusal to rely on the available animal studies, which would have resulted in an MADL of 35 micrograms per day, an exposure of 35,000 micrograms per day, and anticipated blood levels of 2800 micrograms per100 grams \"which not only would produce observable effects, but would likely be incompatible with human existence.\" (FSOR, pp. 79-80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Responding to comments that tthe 0.5 microgram per day (0.5 micrograms/day) level was too high, the Agency quoted from OSHA's regulations: \" 'Prevention of adverse health effects for most workers from exposure to lead throughout a working lifetime requires that worker blood lead (PbB) levels be maintained at or below forty micrograms per one hundred grams of whole blood (40 micrograms/100 grams). The blood lead levels of workers (both male and female workers)\n   <em>\n    who intend to have children should be maintained below 30 micrograms/100 grams to minimize adverse reproductive health effects to the parents and the developing fetus.\n   </em>\n   ' ( [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201910.1025\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 44 Fed.Reg. 60982 ].)\" (FSOR, p. 79, italics added.) The Agency concluded: \"Hence, considering\n   <em>\n    30 micrograms/100 grams to be a functional equivalent reproductive NOEL\n   </em>\n   , OSHA identifies that level to be 75 percent of the blood limit targeted by the permissible exposure limit (PEL).\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.,\n   </em>\n   italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Mateel filed a petition for writ of ordinary mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. \"In determining whether to grant a petition for traditional mandamus, we review for an abuse of discretion.

Mateel argues the court should not have deferred to OEHHA where the agency's interpretation contradicted the underlying statute as to the meaning of \"no observable effect.\" However, both Mateel and OEHHA recognized that as used in the statute and implemented in the regulations, the term \"no observable effect\" means \"no observable reproductive effect.\" (Regs., \u00a7 25801, subd. (c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mateel urges that the OSHA's purpose in setting a PEL is different from Proposition 65's purpose in establishing a MADL, with differing standards and requirements. OEHHA agrees. We recognize, however, that although the purposes of the PEL lead standard under OSHA and the MADL for lead under Proposition 65 differ in significant respects, the overarching purpose of both is the safety of human beings who come into contact with chemicals\n   that are known to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In setting standards for toxic substances, OSHA is required to give due regard to the question of feasibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Feasibility is not a consideration under Proposition 65's warning requirement, as OEHHA recognized in setting the standard, when it responded to comments that few businesses could comply with the 0.5 microgram per day \"safe harbor\" level: \"The purpose in setting this level, however, is to establish a level of exposure which the Agency can be certain is in fact safe within the meaning of the Act. The fact that some businesses may not be able to comply with the level does not appear to conflict with this purpose.\" (FSOR, p. 78.) Given the differing purposes and standards of the statutory and regulatory schemes within which OSHA and OEHHA operated in setting lead exposure levels, the question remains whether OEHHA abused its discretion in utilizing OSHA's analysis and data in adopting the 0.5 microgram per day MADL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   OEHHA maintains that in adopting the MADL, it was \"well aware that exposure to 500 \u03bcg/100g of lead\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   would result in blood lead levels\n   <em>\n    well below the\n   </em>\n   30 \u03bcg/100g level that was protective of the fetus and that commenters viewed it as overly conservative in relying on the PEL to set the MADL.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Setting the NOEL Blood Lead Level at 30 Micrograms per 100 Grams\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Mateel argues that the Agency violated the statute and the regulations in considering 30 micrograms/100g to be a \"functional equivalent reproductive NOEL,\" based on OSHA's determination that blood lead levels of prospective parents \"should be maintained below 30 micrograms/100 grams to minimize adverse reproductive health effects to the parents and the developing fetus.\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201910.1025\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 44 Fed.Reg. 60982.) Contending that OEHHA's use of a \"surrogate\" for a NOEL contravenes the statutory mandate that requires a \"safe harbor\" be based on a NOEL, Mateel maintains the OSHA studies did not support OEHHA's conclusion that the PEL could be used as a legally valid \"no observable effect\" level under Proposition 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Mateel does not dispute the trial court's finding that \"the studies reviewed by OSHA in connection with its establishment of its PEL were of high scientific caliber.\" Rather, Mateel argues that under section 25249.10, subdivision (c), the science must clearly show the necessary conclusion that there is \"no observable reproductive effect\" at the level set and posits that the data and studies before OSHA established that there in fact were reproductive effects below the 30 micrograms/100g.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Mateel concedes OEHHA could have relied upon the OSHA PEL to set the MADL if OEHHA found the PEL was \"an assessment by an agency of a state or federal government that is the substantial equivalent of the assessment described in subsection (a) of section 25803 and establishes a maximum allowable does level in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(1) of\n   Section 25801 ....\" (Regs., 25805, subd. (c).) Arguing OEHHA failed to so find, Mateel asserts that OSHA did not conduct a quantitative risk assessment that is the \"substantial equivalent\" of what is required under Proposition 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   OEHHA counters, and Mateel apparently does not dispute, that the evidence for the MADL was not only of\n   <em>\n    comparable\n   </em>\n   scientific validity to the evidence forming the basis for the listing, but was the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   evidence. The listing for lead as a reproductive toxicant under Proposition 65 was based on the Hazard Communications Standard set forth in title 29 Code of Federal Regulations section 1910.1200, which incorporated the OSHA PEL for lead. (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201910.1025\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. (m).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Moreover, Mateel's description of the scientific assessment that must be conducted is unduly rigid. In 2011, OEHHA amended Regulations section 25803 with \"corrections of terminology and revisions of phrasing to more clearly express the intent of the regulation\" to allow for alternatives to the experimental NOEL. (FSOR for 2011 Amendment to Regs., \u00a7 25803, at p. 3.) The 2011 FSOR explains: \"The procedures specified in [Regulations] Section 25803 have always explicitly been defaults that permitted the use of principles or assumptions scientifically more appropriate based upon the available data.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3.) \"An alternative NOEL may be used if it is more scientifically appropriate than a default. For example, if data are available for individuals in a study, a statistical model could determine a benchmark dose as the NOEL.

These effects occur at blood lead levels below 30 \u03bcg/100 ml, but generally are manifest at 50 \u03bcg/100 ml.\" OSHA concluded that \"[i]n general, 30 \u03bcg/100g appears to be reasonably protective ... and should minimize neurological damage.\" However, OSHA could not \"guarantee that 30 \u03bcg/100g is a 'no effect' level but it would provide marked protection to the fetus and therefore to the reproductive capacity of the worker.\" ( 43 Fed.Reg. 54422 ) Mateel argues that OEHHA could not equate a level that \"should minimize neurological damage\" with one at which there are \"no observable reproductive effects.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   OEHHA responds that the risk assessor may use something other than a NOEL derived from an animal study, if it is scientifically more appropriate to do so, as it contends was the case here. According to OEHHA, the claim that OSHA found \"conclusive evidence of adverse reproductive effects\" at the blood lead level of 30 micrograms/100g is simply not true. OEHHA contends Mateel misreads the OSHA administrative record and misunderstands the science.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   OEHHA asserts the issues presented here involve only reproductive toxicity under Proposition 65 (harm to female or male reproductive function) and developmental toxicity (harm to the developing fetus). Mateel does not appear to challenge this assertion. Because Proposition 65 considers developmental toxicity to be the result only of prenatal exposures to a chemical, postnatal exposures that affect the child are not considered developmental\n   toxicity for purposes of Proposition 65.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Mateel's assertion that OSHA's comments and findings establish that there is\n   evidence of reproductive harm from blood lead levels below 30 micrograms/100g, ignores that the actual studies upon which OSHA relied showing neurological effects below that level involve postnatal exposure, not prenatal exposure and are therefore not relevant to Proposition 65, which, as currently interpreted, \"precludes listing on the basis of developmental effects resulting solely from postnatal exposures.\" OEHHA argues the two studies underlying OSHA's comments and cited by Mateel at trial involved postnatal exposure and not prenatal exposure. In sum, the studies upon which OSHA relied did not conclude there were adverse effects from\n   <em>\n    prenatal\n   </em>\n   lead exposures below 30 micrograms/100g. OSHA did not distinguish between developmental effects caused by prenatal and postnatal exposures, because the distinction was not material to setting a PEL. Under Proposition 65, only prenatal effects are material to setting a MADL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Mateel asserts that the adoption of 30 micrograms/100g as a \"no observable effects level\" is inconsistent with OSHA's statement that keeping maternal blood levels below 30 micrograms/100g will \"\n   <em>\n    minimize\n   </em>\n   enzyme inhibition (ALAD and FEP [free erythrocyte-protoporphyrin] ) in the heme biosynthetic pathway and should\n   <em>\n    minimize\n   </em>\n   neurological damage.\" ( 43 Fed.Reg. 54422, italics added.) Recognizing that the \"science here is complex,\" OEHHA counters that OSHA noted the relevant studies concerning enzyme inhibition at low lead exposures did not report any observed biological significance with respect to the heme biosynthetic pathway at blood lead levels below 30 micrograms/100g. The only scientific data on prenatal effects concerned lower activity of the enzyme ALA-D at blood lead levels of 10-20 micrograms/100g, but there was no evidence to demonstrate ALA-D inhibition at such low blood levels would result in lower production of hemes. OSHA observed: \"At such low levels of lead exposure the biological significance of this inhibition is unclear ....\" ( 43 Fed.Reg. 54396.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Pointing to OSHA's statements that blood lead level of 30 micrograms/100g will \"minimize adverse reproductive health effects to the parents and the developing fetus\" and would be \"reasonably protective\" of the fetus, Mateel argues these statements cannot be construed to mean \"no observable effect\" at that level. However, as OEHHA explains, the concept of\n   \"no observable effect\" is not the same as \"no effect.\" The no observable effect level is defined according to what scientists are able to observe from a particular study. Whether determined by an experimental NOEL, or by another accepted methodology, it \"does not represent a biological threshold and cannot establish that the lower exposure levels are necessarily without risk.\" (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Benchmark Dose Technical Guidance (June 2012) pp. 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because a NOEL is not conclusive evidence that the exposure will have no effect, which might have been detected in a more sensitive study, it is not surprising that OSHA, was unable to \"guarantee that 30 \u03bcg/100g is a 'no effect' level but [found] it would provide marked protection to the fetus and therefore to the reproductive capacity of the worker.\" Therefore, OSHA's conclusions that such blood levels would \"minimize\" adverse reproductive health effects and be \"reasonably protective\" of the fetus are not inconsistent with a conclusion that 30 micrograms/100g will have no observable reproductive effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Mateel has failed to show OEHHA's determination that 30 micrograms/100g blood lead level will have \"no observable effect\" was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Setting the MADL at Exposure to 0.5 \u03bcg of Lead per Day\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Mateel argues that even if OEHHA could use the 30 micrograms per day OSHA blood level target for reproductive toxicity as a \"surrogate\" NOEL, the lead MADL was not set to achieve that level. The OSHA PEL of 500 micrograms per day was not set to achieve the blood lead level of 30 micrograms/100g. OSHA found its PEL would result in mean blood lead levels for workers that would be 35 micrograms/dL and that 30 percent of workers would have blood lead levels greater than 40 micrograms/dL. ( 43 Fed.Reg. 54423.) OEHHA does not dispute that it derived the 0.5 microgram per day \"safe harbor\" MADL from the OSHA PEL without any downward adjustment to account for that difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The trial court accepted OEHHA's explanation that \"the blood level science in play in the PEL proceedings included factors that defy direct comparison with 'an exposure level [that] will have no observable effect' in the Proposition 65 setting, because the overall blood lead level includes lead that is already present before the additional exposure, whether from air in the workplace or from a consumer product, i.e., 'previous body burden.' \" As OEHHA explains, OSHA relied on a model predicting blood lead levels based on exposure to the PEL of 500 micrograms per day, combined with the lead already in workers' bodies, which was the result of other significant\n   sources of lead. The model looked at all sources of lead exposure, and took into account that workers at that time started with a significant \"lead body burden,\" even before the occupational exposure at issue. (See 43 Fed.Reg. 54401-54402, 54427.) OSHA was concerned with total blood levels in workers and it set its PEL accordingly, taking into account workers' existing lead body burdens. In contrast, Proposition 65 is concerned only with the blood lead level that results from the isolated exposure caused by a particular business. It does not consider background levels of lead from other sources. \"For purposes of the Act, 'level in question' means the chemical concentration of a listed chemical for the exposure in question. The exposure in question includes the exposure for which the person in the course of doing business is responsible, and does not include exposure to a listed chemical from any other source or product.\" (Regs., \u00a7 25821, subd. (a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Mateel argues that there is no evidence in the record that OEHHA actually considered the OSHA analysis or that it based its determination of the MADL on a determination that in view of the \"lead body burden,\" that exposure to 500 micrograms per day would result in lead blood levels at less than 30 micrograms per day. However, during the public comment period for the MADL, commenters pointed out that lead levels considered in setting the OSHA PEL were the sum of all occupational and non-occupational exposures from other sources and that there were high background levels of blood lead in the population such that the actual exposure needed to result in a lead blood level of 30 micrograms per day would be 30 percent higher than the PEL or over 653 micrograms per day. In its FSOR, OEHHA responded to comments that the level set was far too low, quoting from the OSHA document discussion of the reproductive effects of chronic over-exposure to lead. Certainly OEHHA was aware of the \"lead body burden\" issue and that the OSHA PEL was set with this in mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We cannot say that in adopting a MADL of 0.5 micrograms per day the Agency acted in a manner that was \" ' \"arbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary\n   support.\" ' \" (\n   <em>\n    Exxon,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20580\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3957629\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/169/1264/#p1277\">\n    169 Cal.App.4th 1264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1277,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20580\">\n    87 Cal.Rptr.3d 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Listing Cases Do Not Advance Mateel's Argument\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Mateel relies upon\n   <em>\n    Styrene Information &amp; Research Center v.

Even if the federal criteria for listing of toxic chemicals by the EPA were less demanding than that for Proposition 65, OEHHA could find that a particular chemical had been formally identified by the EPA as causing reproductive toxicity by determining whether the reasons for the EPA placement met the criteria of section 25249.8 of causing reproductive toxicity.

In listing a chemical, the agency does not exercise independent scientific judgment. When listings are based on evaluations and identifications made by entities designated as \"authoritative bodies,\" such as the federal Food and Drug Administration, OSHA, and the EPA, the lead agency is limited to reviewing the administrative record before the authoritative body to determine whether the findings of that body meet the Proposition 65 criteria for listing-that is, a sufficient showing that the chemicals at issue \"in fact cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Styrene, supra,\n   </em>\n   210 Cal.App.4th at p. 1101,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20776\">\n    148 Cal.Rptr.3d 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

Mateel contends that had OEHHA actually relied upon OSHA studies and testing or on other scientific documents, under those Government Code sections it would have identified those documents in its ISOR or FSOR. Specifically, Mateel contends the agency failed to comply with Government Code sections 11346.2, subdivision (b)(3) and 11346.9, subdivision (a)(1) requiring it to identify in its ISOR or its FSOR and to make available for public review, data or any \"technical, theoretical, and empirical study, report or similar document\" the agency relies upon in proposing the regulation and with Government Code section 11347.3, requiring it to maintain a file of each rulemaking, which must include \"[a]ll data and other factual information, technical, theoretical, and empirical studies or reports, if any, on which the agency is relying in the adoption ... of a regulation ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   subd.

(See \u00a7 25249.12.) He urges that Proposition 65 prescribes minimum exemption levels for its warnings and that if the lead MADL is invalidated, there is full authority for OEHHA to adopt a replacement MADL based on current best science. In response, OEHHA agrees it has discretion to adopt or revise the regulatory warning threshold for any listed chemical, but argues that it has no legal duty to do so, unlike the statutory requirement that it annually update the list of chemicals covered under Proposition 65.

OSHA believes that the fetus would be at least as susceptible to neurological damage and heme inhibition as would older children and therefore data on children is relevant to the fetus. [\u00b6] ...

Given the severity of neurological disease and the evidence indicating effects at low lead levels this conclusion raised particularly difficult issues when establishing this final standard. OSHA recognizes that a PbB level is not a measure of body burden, that the fetus would only be exposed during the period of gestation, and given the independent hematopoietic system of the fetus that maternal-cord blood leads may not be an accurate reflection of blood lead level in the fetus. However, even if these considerations may suggest a lessening of risk to the fetus, OSHA believes that blood lead levels of pregnant women should be maintained below 30 \u03bcg/100 ml in order to protect the fetus. [\u00b6] In general, OSHA believes that the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the blood lead levels of both male and female workers who wish to plan pregnancies should be maintained below 30 \u03bcg/100 in order to prevent adverse effects from lead on the workers' reproductive abilities. To do this would minimize the risk of genetic damage ....
