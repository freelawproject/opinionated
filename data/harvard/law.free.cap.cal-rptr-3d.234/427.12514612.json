SHORE, Judge, Appellate Division\n   Appeal from the June 27, 2017 judgment of conviction after court trial, finding defendant Tony Diaz guilty of violating San\n   Diego Municipal Code section 86.0137(f)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , entered by the Superior Court, San Diego County, Corinne Miesfeld, Commissioner. Following argument on May 17, 2018, this matter was taken under submission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On September 21, 2016, San Diego Police Department Officer Colin Governski went to Bonita Cove to investigate persons living out of their cars. The officer recognized Mr. Diaz' truck-it had a camper shell missing a rear window that was partially covered with a blanket. The officer also observed his bicycle behind the truck and saw Diaz sleeping in the bed of the truck. The officer could hear him snoring. The officer retrieved his camera from his patrol car and also activated his body camera.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The officer testified he had given Diaz three prior warnings and three prior citations. During each of the seven total contacts with Diaz, the officer offered a number of resources, including food and shelter, provided by the Homeless Outreach Team (HOT), but each time he declined. The officer testified that during the June 10, 2016 contact, Diaz explained that, although he had never used the HOT services, he declined to use them because he believes his medication would be taken away and also stated that he couldn't live at his sister's house because she has a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shortly after 6 p.m. on the date in question, the officer called out to Diaz and eventually awakened him. He informed him that the police were receiving complaints, but Diaz again declined the offer of HOT services. The officer issued the instant citation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Diaz testified the law was so vague that all he had to do was have a camper shell full of camping equipment and, to the officer, that would be habitation. He said he takes a lot of medication and gets tired, so he has to lie down. He testified the officer would tell him he would go to jail or be ticketed, and he didn't understand how he could be punished for doing all he could and using what he had \"to live and get by\" and to make himself \"well and sheltered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal, Diaz asserts that San Diego Municipal Code section 86.0137(f) violates due process because it is unconstitutionally vague. Appellant also argues that the ordinance violates equal protection by impermissibly infringing on Appellant's \"fundamental right\" to travel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.\n     <em>\n      Vagueness\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With regard to the vagueness claim, a facial challenge to the constitutional\n   validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself, not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual. To support a determination of facial unconstitutionality, voiding the statute as a whole, Appellant cannot prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular application of the statute. Rather, Appellant must demonstrate that the law's provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional provisions. (\n   <em>\n    Tobe v.
