He received a seven-year sentence that included four one-year enhancements under Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each enhancement was based on a prior felony conviction and its associated prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Warren argues that one of the enhancements was imposed erroneously because the prior offense on which it was based had been reclassified as a misdemeanor pursuant to Proposition 47 before sentencing, and therefore no longer qualified as the basis of an enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b). We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The other three enhancements were based on prior felonies that have not been reclassified. Warren argues that these should be reversed as well. He contends that the so-called washout provision of section 667.5, subdivision (b), applies because still other prior felonies were reduced to misdemeanors under Proposition 47, with the result that there was a period exceeding five years following the unreclassified felonies during which he was free of felony convictions. The People argue that the washout provision does not apply because prior offenses wash out only if there is an unbroken five-year period during which the defendant was free of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   felony offenses\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   time in prison. The People maintain that the reclassifications of Warren's priors as\n   misdemeanors did not erase the prison terms he served for those priors, and as a result the requirements of the washout provision were not satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We agree with Warren on this point as well. As we will explain, an intent of Proposition 47 is to relieve defendants of the burdens of both felony convictions and felony sentences. Interpreting the washout provision to allow prison terms for reclassified priors to be disregarded honors this intent while still upholding the intent of section 667.5, subdivision (b). It does not appear to us that any other interpretation allows the two statutes to be harmonized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In supplemental briefing, Warren informs us that he has been released on post-release community supervision\n   (PRCS). He argues that if we strike enhancements and remand for resentencing, the trial court should be instructed to order a reduction in his PRCS time equal to any excess of his custody credits over the length of the new sentence. The People concede this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We will order the four one-year enhancements stricken and remand for resentencing, with instructions to take account of excess custody credits for purposes of determining the PRCS term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As there was no trial, we draw the facts from the probation officer's report. On June 17, 2015, deputies responded to a report of someone brandishing a firearm. They met the victim, Elizabeth V., outside an apartment building. Elizabeth V. told the deputies she had gone to one of the apartments to collect her belongings. While she was there, she was confronted by another witness, Delores R., who argued with her. The argument developed into a physical fight. While Delores and Elizabeth were fighting, Warren came out of a bedroom, produced a handgun from his waistband, and pointed it at Elizabeth. Elizabeth stopped fighting with Delores, took one of her possessions, and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 19, 2015, the district attorney filed a complaint charging Warren with three counts: (1) being a felon in possession of a firearm (\u00a7 29800, subd. (a)(1) ); (2) being a felon in possession of ammunition (\u00a7 30305, subd. (a) ); and (3) drawing or exhibiting a firearm in a rude, angry or threatening manner in the presence of another person (\u00a7 417, subd. (a)(2) ). The complaint alleged nine prior convictions: (1) first degree burglary (\u00a7 459, subd. (a) ) in 1986; (2) grand theft of a vehicle (former \u00a7 487h, subd. (a) ) in 1991; (3) being a felon in possession of a firearm (former \u00a7 12021, subd. (a) ) in 1993; (4) second degree burglary (\u00a7 460, subd. (b) ) in 1995; (5) petty theft with a prior theft (\u00a7 666) in 1997; (6) unlawfully taking a vehicle ( \u00a7 10851,\n   subd. (a) ) in 2002; (7) petty theft with a prior theft (\u00a7 666) in 2005; (8) second degree burglary (\u00a7 460, subd. (b) ) in 2008; and (9) second degree burglary (\u00a7 460, subd. (b) ) in 2012. All the priors were alleged for purposes of the one-year enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b). The 1986 first degree burglary was also alleged as a prior strike (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (c)-(j); 1170.12, subds. (a)-(e) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For the 2012 burglary (prior allegation No. 9), Warren had received a prison sentence of six years. Prior to the commission of the current offenses, while Warren was still serving that burglary sentence, he obtained an order pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (a) (Proposition 47). The order reduced the offense to a misdemeanor, resentenced Warren to 180 days with credit for time served, and directed his release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While the current charges were pending, Warren filed a second Proposition 47 petition, this time pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivision (f), seeking reclassification as misdemeanors of the 1997 petty theft with a prior (allegation No. 5), the 2005 petty theft with a prior (allegation No. 7), and the 2008 burglary (allegation No. 8). The petition was granted on July 15, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Warren pleaded no contest to all counts and all prior conviction allegations on September 30, 2015. He represented himself in the plea proceeding. The plea was without conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While still self-represented, on October 13, 2015, Warren filed a motion to strike all the prior conviction allegations. Defense counsel filed a similar motion on January 20, 2016. Both motions argued that allegation\n   Nos. 5, 7, 8, and 9 could not support enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (b), because they had been reduced to misdemeanors under Proposition 47. The motions further argued that allegation Nos. 1 through 6 should be stricken under the washout provision, because, in light of the Proposition 47 reductions, these offenses were separated from the next felonies (the current offenses) by a period of five years or more. The motion filed by counsel also asked the court to strike the prior strike (the 1986 burglary) under\n   <em>\n    People v. Superior Court (Romero )\n   </em>\n   (1996)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1965926\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/13/497/\">\n    13 Cal.4th 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20789\">\n    53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=917%20P.2d%20628\">\n    917 P.2d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court took up the motions to strike at the sentencing hearing. It rejected Warren's Proposition 47 arguments. In the court's view, a felony committed before the passage of Proposition 47 and reduced afterwards was still a felony for the purpose of imposing sentence enhancements, despite the statutory mandate that any such offense \"shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes.\" (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court granted Warren's\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   request and struck allegation No. 1, the 1986 burglary. Next, the court accepted the probation officer's finding that\n   allegation Nos. 2 and 3 involved concurrent prison terms and therefore could not support separate enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (b). It struck allegation No. 2 as invalid for this reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court imposed one-year enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (b) for four allegations: Nos. 3, 4, 6, and 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It stated that the enhancements for the remaining allegations were \"stayed ... in the interest of justice\" under section 1385.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For count 1, the court selected the upper term of three years. It added the four one-year enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (b), for a total sentence of seven years. The court imposed the upper term of three years on count 2, and stayed it pursuant to section 654. On count 3, the court imposed a concurrent term of 180 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The table below summarizes the nine enhancements alleged in the complaint, the dates Warren was released from prison for each offense as shown in the probation report, the rulings on the Proposition 47 petitions, the rulings on the motions to strike, and the enhancements applied.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-25\"><strong>Prior</strong> <strong>Conviction</strong> <strong>Sentence</strong> <strong>Release</strong> <strong>Rulings on</strong> <strong>Rulings on</strong> <strong>Enhancement</strong> <strong>offense</strong> <strong>date</strong> <strong>date</strong> <strong>Prop. 47</strong> <strong>motions to</strong> <strong>petitions</strong> <strong>strike</strong> <strong>(1)</strong> First 11/21/86 2 years 12/1/87 Granted None degree prison (<em>Romero</em>) burglary (\u00a7 460, subd.

(\u00a7 1170.18, subds. (f)-(g).) Where the petitioner is currently serving the sentence for a felony, the court considers whether resentencing would present an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety (as defined), and, if not, imposes a misdemeanor sentence in place of the felony sentence.

Abdallah was convicted of several felonies. At the time of his conviction of these offenses, he had two prior felony convictions.

After his conviction on the current offenses but before sentencing, the 2011 prior was reduced to a misdemeanor pursuant to a Proposition 47 petition, with the result that he had no felony convictions or prison terms for more than five years after his release from prison on the 2002 conviction.

A section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement\n   is imposed only for a prior offense that (1) is a felony, and (2) was committed under circumstances and in a manner that warranted a prison term.

The class is identified by the presence of an associated prison term, but it is the existence of a prior felony in that class that is the predicate of the enhancement-not the existence of the prison term viewed as an independent fact. The Supreme Court's view thus defeats the People's argument in this case that the enhancement based on allegation No. 9 is \"based on the existence of a prior prison term\" rather than the existence of a prior felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In their brief, the People attempted to support their position by citing\n   <em>\n    People v.

The defendant in that case was found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol. He had three prior felony convictions, for each of which he served a prison term. One of these was for felony drunk driving. Applying a section of the Vehicle Code, the trial court used the prior drunk driving felony to elevate the current offense to a felony.

This is so, he says, because: (1) he was released from incarceration for the offense in allegation No. 6 on April 1, 2004; (2) all the subsequent felonies alleged in the complaint-those in allegation Nos. 7, 8, and 9-were reduced to misdemeanors under Proposition 47; and (3) he did not commit another felony until the current offenses in 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The People, however, point out that Warren served prison terms for the offenses in allegation Nos. 7, 8, and 9. When these terms and their release dates are taken into account, as shown in the table above, it is apparent that between his release on April 1, 2004, and the date of commission of the current offenses, Warren had no unbroken five-year period during which he was free of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   felony offenses and incarceration in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The People are correct that the literal terms of the washout provision-requiring five years free of both felony offenses and incarceration in prison-are not satisfied by the facts in this case, even though the offenses in question can no longer be treated as felonies. Warren still served the prison terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We think this is one of those instances, however, in which literal construction should not prevail because it is not consistent with legislative intent.

As we will explain, the intents manifested in section 667.5 and in Proposition 47 can be harmonized only by rejecting the literal interpretation of the washout provision urged by the People.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   From the key features of section 1170.18, it is evident that a goal of Proposition 47 is not only to relieve defendants of\n   the burden of having felony convictions on their records for offenses no longer deemed serious enough for felony status, but also to relieve them of felony sentences for these offenses. For section 1170.18 does not only mandate that reclassified felonies be treated as misdemeanors for all purposes. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k).) It also calls for felony\n   <em>\n    sentences\n   </em>\n   to be recalled and replaced with misdemeanor sentences, in cases in which the defendant is still serving a felony sentence, except where the court finds that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. (\u00a7 1170.18, subds. (a)-(b).) When the sentence has already been completed, the law requires the offense simply to be reclassified. (\u00a7 1170.18, subds. (f)-(g).) From these provisions, we infer that the voters intended successful Proposition 47 petitioners to be relieved of the effects of their former felony convictions, including the effects of the sentences imposed for those convictions. The voters' legislative judgment was that, for the offenses identified in a successful Proposition 47 petition, neither felony status nor felony punishment is appropriate.\n   That intent conflicts with the literal terms of section 667.5, subdivision (b), since those terms literally construed bar application of the washout provision to those who served prison time during the five-year washout period, even though the associated felony convictions must be considered as misdemeanors. Yet construing the washout provision nonliterally, to conform to the intent of Proposition 47, would not undermine the intent of the washout provision. The manifest purpose of the reference to being free of incarceration during the washout period is to cause the washout period to begin to run from the prisoner's release date, not the conviction date, in those instances in which the prior felony resulted in a prison term. This in turn is intended to ensure that a defendant convicted\n   <em>\n    of a felony\n   </em>\n   does not commit another felony for five years after being\n   <em>\n    released\n   </em>\n   , as opposed to five years after being convicted. There is no reason to suppose the Legislature wanted to cover the contingency of a free-floating prison term with no associated felony-the anomaly to which Proposition 47 gives rise, but which presumably was unthought of when section 667.5 was enacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Lest our approach raise jurisprudential eyebrows by seeming to handle statutory language too roughly, we cite\n   <em>\n    People v.

Like Proposition 47, Proposition 36 provides a procedure by which certain prisoners can apply to the superior court for a sentence reduction in accordance with the new law adopted by the voters. (\u00a7\u00a7 1170.126, subds. (a), (b), 1170.18, subds. (a), (b).) Also like Proposition 47, Proposition 36 gives the superior court discretion to deny resentencing if it \"determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk to public safety.\" (\u00a7\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (f), 1170.18, subd. (b).) The two statutes employ these same words. Proposition 47, however, adds this:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    As used throughout this code\n   </em>\n   , 'unreasonable risk of danger to public safety' means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of [\u00a7 667, subd.

Section\n   667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) contains a list of specified offenses, those known as super strikes. Surely it follows that courts applying Proposition 36 will now be required to limit their consideration to whether a prisoner poses an unreasonable risk of committing a super strike, just like courts applying Proposition 47? No! The Supreme Court held, among other things, that it would be unreasonable to believe voters casting ballots on Proposition 47-which involves low-level offenders whose crimes are now deemed misdemeanors-understood they would be easing the release\n   of third strikers serving life sentences. This was held to be so despite the normal presumption that voters are aware of existing law.

(2) Despite its literal terms, section 667.5, subdivision (b), manifests no intent inconsistent with this goal of Proposition 47. (3) Therefore, the washout provision of section 667.5, subdivision (b), should be construed to allow a prior felony to wash out provided it is followed by a five-year period free of felony convictions and incarceration in prison or in county jail pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (h), except that such incarceration shall not prevent the prior felony from washing out if it was imposed for an offense that has been designated a misdemeanor or resentenced as a misdemeanor pursuant to a petition filed under section 1170.18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For these reasons, it is appropriate to view the prior felonies in allegation Nos. 3, 4, and 6 as being followed by the necessary five-year washout period.

The question on appeal\n   was whether the excess credits should be used to reduce his time on PRCS.

The principal thesis of the dissenting portion of the opinion is that the literal application of the washout provision in this case would present no conflict with the mandate in section 1170.18 to treat reclassified felonies as misdemeanors for all purposes. This is well and good, however, questions of intent and conflict often present thorny problems of interpretation, and so it is here. We can do little else but emphasize that our goal is \"to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent\" (\n   <em>\n    Woodhead, supra\n   </em>\n   , 43 Cal.3d at p. 1007,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=239%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20656\">\n    239 Cal.Rptr. 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=741%20P.2d%20154\">\n    741 P.2d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), whether that of the voters or the Legislature, and urge the view that our interpretation does the better job of this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On a secondary point, we believe the dissent is mistaken in a more concrete way. There is no sense in which our interpretation \"could amount to the effective reclassification, for purposes of prior prison term enhancements, of felony convictions that do not qualify for misdemeanor status under section 1170.18.\" (Conc. &amp; diss. opn,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , at p. 753.) The washout provision of section 667.5, subdivision (b), is the only sentencing provision affected by our holding. We are aware of no other provision of the Penal Code similar to it, other than the washout provision in section 667.5, subdivision (a) (which applies to violent crimes unaffected by Proposition 47). Our holding has no bearing whatsoever on other recidivist sentencing provisions. It could not cause the \"effective reclassification\" of a prior strike as a misdemeanor for purposes of the three strikes law, for example. While under section 667.5, subdivision (b), prior felonies can wash out under the washout provision regardless of their seriousness, this has always been the case. Moving forward from the effective date of Proposition 47, it is, of course, impossible under any interpretation for a new misdemeanor offense to block future application of the washout provision, even if the offense would have been a felony and led to a prison term had Proposition 47 not been passed. It would be arbitrary to treat\n   defendants differently who committed the same prior offenses before the effective date of Proposition 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The point of the washout provision of section 667.5, subdivision (b), is to relieve defendants of the enhancements created by that subdivision in those cases in which defendants have been free of committing offenses society has deemed felonies, and receiving punishments based on such offenses, for a given period of time after being released from a prison term. Our holding gives effect to this point and has no impact on any other sentencing scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISPOSITION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   All of the one-year enhancements applied to appellant's sentence, including those that were stayed, are stricken, the sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded to the trial court for resentencing.

If they do, the trial court shall\n   make an order stating that Warren's maximum time on PRCS is reduced by the amount of the excess. The trial court is further directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment, which shall reflect any reduction in the PRCS time, and forward it to the appropriate correctional authorities.

It does not appear that the washout rule was modified or amended by Proposition 47 or section 1170.18. Based on the language of section 1170.18, if a petitioner has sought relief after completing a prison term, the court may only reclassify his felony conviction to a misdemeanor. Under these circumstances, the petitioner's completed term of imprisonment is still a fact that may be proved by the prosecution for imposition of section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancement-avoiding application of the washout rule-even though the petitioner's prior felony conviction was reclassified as a misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Statutory intent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The majority acknowledges section 1170.18 established two separate methods for a petitioner to seek relief under Proposition 47, one of which does not\n   vest the court with discretion to recall and resentence the petitioner. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 739.) The majority further acknowledges \"the literal terms\" of the washout provision \"are not satisfied by the facts in this case\" since the defendant still served the prison terms for the offenses that were later reclassified as misdemeanors. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 744-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   It has been noted that when either type of petition is granted, the \"felony conviction\" shall be considered \"a misdemeanor for all purposes,\" except for specific firearm prohibitions. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k).) Even though the defendant's prior prison terms were not recalled, the majority opinion concludes that \"this is one of those instances ... in which literal construction should not prevail because it is not consistent with legislative intent.\" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 744.) The majority opinion finds \"the voters intended successful Proposition 47 petitioners to be relieved of the effects of their former felony convictions, including\n   the effects of the sentences imposed for those convictions[ ]\" and, despite the literal terms of the two statutes, there is \"no reason to suppose the Legislature wanted to cover a free-floating prison term with no associated felony-the anomaly to which Proposition 47 gives rise, but which presumably was unthought of when section 667.5 was enacted.\" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 745.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The majority's conclusions are based on the premise that Proposition 47 was enacted with a particular \"intent\" in mind, and that intent should govern over the literal terms of section 1170.18.

I do not believe such an outcome is consistent with the intent behind Proposition 47.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Application to defendant's case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Defendant argues that since his prior felony convictions for allegation Nos. 7, 8, and 9 have been reclassified as misdemeanors, the washout rule applies to the enhancements based on allegation Nos. 3, 4, and 6, even though the felony convictions for the latter three allegations have not been reclassified to misdemeanors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   I would find the washout rule would apply for allegation No. 9, but not for allegation Nos. 7 and 8 since defendant completed prison terms for those two offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As explained in the majority opinion, allegation No. 9 was based on defendant's felony conviction for second degree burglary on May 30, 2012. He was sentenced to six years in prison. On February 11, 2015, while defendant was serving this prison term, the court granted his petition for relief under Proposition 47. His felony conviction was reclassified to a misdemeanor, and he was resentenced accordingly. On February 20, 2015, defendant was released from custody. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 738-39.) I would find the washout rule applies to allegation No. 9 since defendant filed a petition for relief while he was serving the term in that case, the court reclassified his conviction to a misdemeanor, resentenced him, and he was released from custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Allegation No. 7 was based on defendant's felony conviction for petty theft with a prior theft-related conviction in 2005. He was sentenced to 32 months in prison, and released on September 12, 2006. On July 15, 2015, defendant's petition for relief under Proposition 47 was granted, and his felony conviction was reclassified as a misdemeanor. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 738-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Allegation No. 8 was based on defendant's felony conviction for second degree burglary in June 2008. He was sentenced to 28 months in state prison. The appellate record does not state when he was released from prison. However, on July 15, 2015, the superior court granted defendant's petition for relief for this burglary conviction and reduced it to a misdemeanor. The record suggests that defendant was not in custody when the court reclassified this burglary conviction, since there is no indication that he was resentenced or released from custody at that time. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 738-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   I would find the washout rule would not apply to allegation Nos. 7 and 8 since defendant had already completed the prison terms in those cases when he obtained relief under Proposition 47. The court reduced the felony convictions to misdemeanors, but it did not have the power to resentence him or otherwise expunge the prison terms he had already served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As to allegation No. 8, however, the record is silent as to when defendant was released from prison. He was convicted in June 2008, and was sentenced to 28 months in state prison. He may or may not have still been in prison custody for that prior conviction as of September 30, 2010. Defendant was convicted of committing the current offenses when he entered his plea on September 30, 2015. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at pp. 735-36.) There is thus the possibility that the defendant was free from both prison custody\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the commission of a new felony for a five-year period following his release from serving the prison term for his prior burglary conviction in allegation No. 8 and his conviction in this case. If\n   so, the washout rule would apply based on the timing of his custodial status, but not because the court had reclassified the prior felony in allegation No. 8 to a misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   I would thus find the washout rule does not apply to allegation No. 7 but remand the matter for the court to determine defendant's custodial status as to allegation No. 8, compared to his conviction for the current offenses, to determine if the washout rule would apply based on that time frame.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The probation officer's report recommended striking allegation No. 3, but the court expressly imposed an enhancement on allegation No. 3, while not mentioning allegation No. 2 by name and staying all the allegations on which it did not impose enhancements. So allegation No. 2 must have been the one it declined to apply on the ground that the associated sentence was concurrent with the sentence for another offense.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The court actually referenced No. 8, not No. 9, in both its oral remarks and its minute order. At the same time, however, the court made it clear that it intended to apply the enhancement to allegation No. 9, by commenting that it \"specifically picked\" the allegation involving the offense for which Warren was released in 2015.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    From the probation report, it appears that Warren was released on January 12, 1993, but committed the offense in allegation No. 3 while still on parole, and was then returned to prison to serve a new sentence deemed concurrent with that from which he had been paroled.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    In a letter filed on April 19, 2018, Warren calls our attention to this court's opinion in\n    <em>\n     People v.

We denied rehearing but modified the opinion to reflect the concession.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Warren again cites\n    <em>\n     Abdallah,\n    </em>\n    but on this issue that case is distinguishable. The Court of Appeal there did hold that an enhancement for one of the defendant's prior felonies washed out because, once a subsequent offense was removed from consideration because it had become a misdemeanor under Proposition 47, the defendant had the necessary offense-free five-year period. Unlike in this case, however, the defendant there served no prison time for that subsequent offense. (He got probation.) So for him-unlike for Warren-the conversion of a prior offense to a misdemeanor did indeed create a five-year period during which there was neither a felony offense nor any incarceration in prison.
