In considering the same the trial court had the benefit of the evidence which was before the jury. In the absence of the evidence, this court must presume that the action of the trial judge was justified by the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-22\">By inadvertence the judgment of conviction was omitted from the minutes of the court in which the trial took place, but upon the motion of the State the judgment of conviction was; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>entered by a nunc pro tunc order. Objection was interposed by the appellant to the entry of the judgment by a nunc pro tunc order in obedience to the motion of the attorney for the State, the contention being that the judgment was not binding upon the appellant. Many precedents supporting the validity of the procedure mentioned will be found collated in Tex. Jur., Vol. 12, p. 713, sec. 352, and notes. See, also, Art. 772, Vernon\u2019s Ann. C. C.
