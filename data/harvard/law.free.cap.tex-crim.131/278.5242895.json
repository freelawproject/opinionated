It is also set up in the application that request had been made of the various judges of Tarrant County for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus herein, which had been categorically denied by said judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">As far as this court is informed and knows there is no offense against the laws of the State of Texas, within the jurisdiction of any justice of the peace, such as is described and referred to in relator\u2019s application. The jurisdiction of the justice of peace court extends only to misdemeanor cases, and in no event is a prosecution in the justice court by information.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">It being clear that the offense, if any, attempted to be charged in the affidavit for information was not one of which the justice court had jurisdiction, the writ is granted, and the court below is held to be without authority to issue the warrant in question, and hence the detention of relator thereunder is illegal. The discharge of the relator is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\n<em>Relator, discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
