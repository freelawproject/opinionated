None of same manifests any error. The-facts are such as to furnish a sad commentary upon the question of drunkenness upon public highways. Without any controversy at all they demonstrate that appellant was driving an automobile upon a highway between San Marcos and Seguin, at a point in Hays County, both he and the man in the car with him being intoxicated, and that they met a car containing Miss Louise Smith and her friend Mr. Conley; Miss Smith said before she died that they saw the car driven by appellant coming on the highway wabbling from side to side, and that they pulled as far off the pavement as possible, but appellant\u2019s car drove into them. Appellant\u2019s companion Daily was killed, as was also both Miss Smith and Mr. Conley. Further than this recital of the facts there appears no need for discussing them in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b670-13\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b670-14\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AYel\">\u2014 In his motion for rehearing appellant insists that the court below committed error in denying his application for continuance. The record shows that the offense was committed in September, 1933. The case was called for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>trial on the present occasion in March, 1936. The application shows upon its face to be the third continuance sought by appellant. The names of only two witnesses were mentioned in the application, but it was set out therein that the names of four others then unknown to appellant could be ascertained from the two named witnesses if they were present. The residence of the two named witnesses was averred to be in Oklahoma, but they were thought then to be somewhere in Texas. The residence of the four unknown witnesses was not stated. As near as appellant ever came to stating what he expected to prove by the absent witnesses was that he averred they were traveling in a truck and were behind appellant\u2019s car at the time of the accident and that appellant \u201cknows that said witnesses can give the entire proceedings of the accident because they saw the accident.\u201d This court can not assume that if the witnesses could relate the \u201cproceedings of the accident\u201d it would be favorable to. appellant. In view of the provisions of Article 543 and 544, C. C. P., regarding applications by a defendant for continuance the court\u2019s action in denying said third application seems justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Appellant also complains because his motion for new trial predicated on alleged misconduct of the jury was overruled. The motion was not sworn to either by appellant or his attorney. It has always been held that a motion for new trial setting up misconduct of the jury must be verified. See Elder v. State, 97 S. W. (2d) 203 and authorities therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
