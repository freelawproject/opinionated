The case was submitted on October 14, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Relator sets up that on the 13th of August, 1936, an \u201cAffidavit for information\u201d was filed in the Justice Court of Precinct No. 1 of Tarrant County, Texas, charging that relator \u201cDid then and there unlawfully keep and was intereested in keeping premises for the purpose of being used as a place to bet, wager and gamble on dog races,\u201d and that upon the same day a warrant was issued, and that on the 15th of August, 1936, relator was arrested and placed in the custody of the sheriff of Tarrant County. No copy of any affidavit for information accompanies this petition, nor is there a copy of any warrant. The allegations in the petition for writ of habeas corpus are not evidence, although sworn to, and do not prove themselves. See authorities cited by Mr. Branch in Sec. 237 of his Annotated P. C. There being nothing to show that this relator was in fact arrested, or that he is in custody, we have no authority to act further in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The petition will be denied and the cause dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">\n<em>Petition denied and cause dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
