According to the appellant\u2019s confession, introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>in evidence by the State, a cow belonging to the injured party came on to his premises. He killed her, dressed the carcass, and attempt to dispose of the meat by selling it. He hid the hide and head and certain other parts. As a result of this confession, the hide and head were found and identified. The injured party testified that the property or cow was taken without her consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Appellant did not testify as a witness in his own behalf. It was his defensive theory that he should be acquitted because after the cow had been stolen he had made restitution to the injured party by paying her therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The motion to quash the indictment because it used the term, \u201cone head of cattle\u201d was properly overruled.
