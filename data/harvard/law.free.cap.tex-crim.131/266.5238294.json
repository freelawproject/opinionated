See Art. 760, C. C. P., subd. 1, as amended by Acts, 1931, 42nd Legislature, 1st Called Session, p. 75, Chap. 34, sec. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In paragraph 2 of its charge, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\u201cAny person shall be regarded as practicing medicine within the meaning of the law, who shall treat, or offer to treat, any disease or disorder, mental or physical, or any physical deformity or injury, by any system or method or to effect cures thereof, and to charge therefor, directly or indirectly, money or other compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Appellant objected to the foregoing instruction upon the ground that it was in the disjunctive instead of the conjunctive as was done in the information. We do not think that in said instruction it was required to use the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d because said paragraph No. 2 was but a definition of what constitutes the practice of medicine as defined by Section 2 of Article 741, P. C., 1925. If appellant did either of the acts defined in said article in the disjunctive he would be guilty of practicing medicine. The definition, as given by the court in his charge to the jury, followed the statute, and was a guide for the jury by which they might determine whether the proof showed that apellant did either all or any one of the acts specified as an act of practicing medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Paragraph 3 is not subject to the objection urged to it inasmuch as it is an instruction to the jury that if appellant did treat or offer to treat any disease, disorder, deformity or injury, by the application of his hands to the person named in the information, or by the use of any other system or method, treat or offer to treat the person named in the information for any disease, disorder, deformity or injury and charge therefor, he would be guilty of practicing medicine within the meaning of the statute. We admit our inability to discover any error in the charge of the court which transcended the law or imping-ed upon the appellant\u2019s legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
