Such opinion on our part could have value only as suggesting to the Legislature amendments and corrections to said statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">Finding no testimony in this record supporting the conviction for the horrible crime, if any, committed by the appellant, save and except the testimony of a willing and admittedly participating accomplice, the judgment must be reversed for the lack of sufficient testimony, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
