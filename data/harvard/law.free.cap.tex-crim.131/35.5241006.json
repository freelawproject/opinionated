Also, would good behavior affect the time of either of those sentences ?\u201d The note was received by the trial judge in chambers in the presence of counsel for appellant. Appellant was in jail at the time and was not brought to the courtroom. However, appellant\u2019s counsel agreed that the trial judge might reply to the request as follows: \u201cIn answer to the above question the court can not answer this question.\u201d The holding in Heald v. State, 92 S. W. (2d) 1042, militates against the conclusion that reversible error is reflected. The court undertook to give no additional instructions, but merely replied that he could not answer the question. However, the procedure provided by the statute should have been followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">As qualified, bill of exception No. 2 fails to reflect error. We quote the qualification, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">\u201cThe court does not certify the facts as stated are true. The affidavit of insanity was filed on November 13th, 1935, by the Hon. John White, one of the attorneys of the defendant. The Hon. David Weinstein having theretofore been representing the defendant by appointment of the court. On the. same day the affidavit was filed, the defendant\u2019s attorneys in open court in the presence of the defendant and defendant\u2019s father, asked the court to allow them to withdraw the affidavit of insanity and to pass the case for trial on its merits and the attorneys stated that they had decided that they wanted to try all issues of insanity and fact at one trial, which motion was by the court granted and the cause was passed to November 25th, 1935, to give the defendant and his attorneys more time in which to prepare their defense and also to prepare to present the issue of insanity at the same time, and later a motion was filed requesting the same action on the court\u2019s part but it had already been granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ARg\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
