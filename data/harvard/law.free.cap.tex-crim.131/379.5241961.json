Beer is defined in Sec. 1 of Article II of Chapter 467, General and Special Laws, Forty-Fourth Legislature \u2014 Second Called Session, 1935, as a beverage which contains one-half of one per centum of alcohol by volume and no more than four per centum by weight. Unless it contained such an amount of alcohol it would not come within the definition of beer as above defined and would not be subject to a beer tax. We are of the opinion that the testimony is not sufficient to meet the allegations in the informaton and justify his conviction. The other questions presented need not be discussed in view of the disposition that we are making of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">Believing the testimony to be insufficient, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
