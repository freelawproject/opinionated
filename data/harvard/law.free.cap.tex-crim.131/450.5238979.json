It is recited therein that appellant stands charged with driving an automobile while intoxicated, and that he has been convicted of the offense of driving an automobile while intoxicated. We have no statute forbidding one, in terms, from operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. In order to come within the prohibition of the statute, the accused must drive or operate such motor vehicle upon a street or alley or other place within the limits of an incorporated city, town, or village, or upon a public road or highway within the State.
