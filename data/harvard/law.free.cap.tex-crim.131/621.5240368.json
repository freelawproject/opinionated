There is no averment, either in the information or complaint, that appellant was engaged in the business of selling or offering for sale malt or vinous liquors to be consumed on the premises where sold. In M. J. Gremillion v. The State, Opinion No. 18,628, delivered December 16, 1936 (page 492 of this volume), we held that a complaint and information under subsection (c) of section 3, supra, to be sufficient, must embrace an averment to the effect that the accused was engaged in the business of selling or offering for sale malt or vinous liquors to be consumed on the premises where sold. We quote from the opinion in said case, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">\u201cIn the instant case there is no averment in the information that appellant was engaged in the business of selling or offering for sale any malt or vinous liquors to be consumed on the premises where sold. All that is charged in the information is that he, meaning the appellant, had a license or permit to do so. This, we think, is insufficient to charge an offense under the law above quoted for the reason that, in our opinion, the Legislature did not intend to punish a person who had obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>a license authorizing him to engage in the sale of beer and wine at a designated place, but who at no time had sought to exercise the privilege thus granted,' although he may have had a bottle of whisky at the designated place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\n<em>Reversed and prosecution ordered dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
