Appellant called to him to wait in order that he might return the five pennies to him, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>negro kept on running. Appellant denied that he had a pistol or took any money out of the negro\u2019s watch pocket. When appellant and Green were arrested neither of them had a pistol on their person or in their car.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Appellant\u2019s main contention is that the court failed in his charge to the jury to instruct them on his affirmative defense. An examination of the. court\u2019s charge leads us to the conclusion that appellant\u2019s position is well taken. The testimony raised the issue of a practical joke with no intent to take any money from the negro boy and this issue should have been submitted to the jury in an affirmative manner. The failure of the court to do so was error. See Barnes v. State, 272 S. W., 188; Caskey v. State, 254 S. W., 996; Barton v. State, 227 S. W., 317. A defendant in a criminal case is entitled to an affirmative instruction on the defensive issues raised, whether raised by the testimony of the State or that of the defendant. See Jones v. State, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 371; Caldwell v. State, 118 Texas Crim. Rep., 401. The failure on the part of the court to instruct the jury on said theory might have led the jury to the conclusion that although appellant made no assault with a pistol and was merely playing a practical joke, yet if by reason thereof the negro became frightened and threw the five pennies in the car, appellant would be guilty of robbery whatever his intent may have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Appellant also objected to the prosecuting attorney\u2019s closing argument in which he referred to the criminal career of Clyde Barrow and compared appellant\u2019s acts and conduct with that of Barrow and his criminal career. There is nothing in this record to show that Clyde Barrow had any connection with the offense for which appellant was on trial and his criminal career should not be used as a vehicle upon which to convey the appellant to the penitentiary. Appellant is responsible only for his own acts and conduct and those with whom he is acting in the commission of the alleged offense, but not for the acts and . conduct of some other party who had no connection with the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">For the error herein above pointed out, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\n<em>Reversed cmd remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
