The indictment was filed October 29, 1935. The verdict was rendered November 13, 1935. Sentence was pronounced and the judgment became final December 12, 1935. The motion for new trial was filed November 15, 1935, but the record is silent as to the court\u2019s action thereon. Six bills of exception are found in the record. They were filed March 16, 1936. The statement of facts was filed on the same date. The transcript fails to show when the court commenced, although the caption states that the court adjourned January 11, 1936. The bills of exception were filed too late for consideration as the thirty days allowed by law from the adjournment of court expired February 11, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">Upon the record as now presented, we are constrained to withdraw the original opinion, to set aside the reversal and to order an affirmance of the judgment, which is accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">\n<em>Affirmed,.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b555-16\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b555-17\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A6f\">The opinion affirming the judgment was rendered on December 2, 1936. On December 28, 1936, the Clerk of this court received from appellant\u2019s attorney a motion for rehearing. It reached the Clerk eleven days too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>late. The reasons set forth in the motion attempting to excuse the delay are not regarded as sufficient, and even if they were, the facts stated in the motion are in no way verified. We further observe that appellant\u2019s motion for new trial setting up new evidence which was not available to appellant upon the trial was not sworn to. This has always been held necessary. See Denning v. State, 48 S. W. (2d) 643, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
