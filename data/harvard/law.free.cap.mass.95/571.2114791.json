On cross-examination, he testified that his name was spelled <em>Malay </em>or <em>Maley, </em>but never <em>Mealy ; </em>and that he was called Maley; but never <em>Mealy. </em>This was all the testimony offered as to the name of the person from whom the larceny was committed. The defendant asked the court to rule \u201c that if they should find his name to be <em>Malay </em>or <em>Maley, </em>and not <em>Mealy, </em>then they should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>acquit the defendant.\u201d The judge declined so to rule,, but left it to the jury to say whether the name proved was <em>idem sonans </em>with the one in this indictment, and whether he was known by and answered to the name of John Mealy as well as to the name of John Malay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b580-6\"><em>E.

Sherman, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALt\"><em>Mealy </em>is not the same name with <em>Malay </em>or <em>Maley, </em>nor <em>idem sonans. </em>The averment of the name of the person from whom the property was stolen must be proved as laid. The whole testimony on this point is reported. A specific instruction was asked for, that if the jury should find the name to be different from that alleged, they should acquit the defendant. This instruction should have been given. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mehan, </em>11 Gray, 321. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shearman,, 11 </em>Cush. 546.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b580-7\"><em>Reed, </em>A.
