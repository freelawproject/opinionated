Jackson, </em>for the three children.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An9\">The gift of the income of the testator\u2019s estate was for the support of his family, comprising his widow, his daughters while unmarried, and his sons while under age. The maintenance which the unmarried daughters may claim must cease when all the sons become of age. The division of the estate takes place when the youngest child becomes twenty-one years of age. <em>Hazard </em>v. <em>Little, </em>9 Allen, 260. If the bequest were of the income to the widow for life, or so long as the daughters remain single, that bequest is controlled by the subsequent direction to divide the estate when the youngest child becomes twenty-one.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>G. S. Hale, </em>for the widow.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq0v\">The testator, by clear terms, gave to his wife the improvement of the whole estate, so long as she should remain his widow. The subsequent direction to divide the estate is to take effect only in case she should cease to be his widow. This construction reconciles and gives meaning to the whole language of the will, and is just and right in itself. Any other construction would simply impose a burden upon her. She therefore asks that the executors may be instructed that she is entitled to the possession and enjoyment of all the testator\u2019s property; certainly all except stocks and money. See 1 Jarman on Wills, 403, 407; 2 Ib. 126; 1 Redfield on Wills, 443, 446; <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>4 Gray, 248; <em>Covenhoven </em>v. <em>Shuler, </em>2 Paige, 122; <em>Ley </em>v. <em>Ley, </em>2 Man. &amp; Gr. 780; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>1 Clark &amp; Fin. 20.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b126-5\">Chapman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agq\">The first clause of the will of Daniel Jackson gives to Mercy B. Jackson, his widow, the improvement of his real and personal estate during her widowhood. The next three clauses relate to the disposition of the estate after the expiration of the term of her widowhood, whether by death or by marriage. The clause which gives the executors full power to sell and dispose of the whole or any part of the estate, either personal or real, has the effect to modify the first clause, because upon the execution of this power the widow can no longer improve the estate. The language authorizes them to execute the power during her widowhood as well as afterwards at their discretion. They are to regard the interests of all the parties concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">But in order to retain the power to make \"such sales, it is necessary for them to retain the stocks in their own hands, and not transfer them to the widow. She is therefore entitled to the dividends, but' not to have the stocks transferred to her. A decree is to be entered in conformity with this construction of the will</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
