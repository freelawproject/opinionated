The loss of a permanent home was not such natural and necessary result. In an action of this nature, love and affection are essential to each element of damage, except those involving personal feeling, and those capable of being definitively meas ured by a pecuniary standard. And the jury should have been instructed to consider the question of damages in connection with the existence of feelings of affection on the part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-7\"><em>G.
