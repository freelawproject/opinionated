Paine, as special master who submitted to the court a report, of which the following are the material portions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-14\">The master <em>\u201c </em>was requested to ascertain \u2018 the amount of the fund which in law and justice should be in the hands of the ministers and deacons of the Old South Church in Boston, to be applied by them to the use of the poor of the church; \u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>this is the only matter pertinent to the issues raised by the bill and answers, to which his attention has been directed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-5\">. \u201c The evidence introduced consisted principally of records and account books of the Old South Church, some of which dated back to the early part of the last century. The first statement of the fund claimed as a poor fund appears in one of these books, entitled, <em>\u2018 </em>South Church Booke, Sacramental Contrabutions, 1708.\u2019 This statement is found under date of 1761, and is headed \u2018 Stock belonging to South Church in Boston at interest.\u2019 A fuller and more exact statement is, however, given in the same book, under date of January 1, 1766, and as after this, though an account of the fund, as a whole, has been regularly kept down to the present day, there is no other authentic statement of the fund, distinguishing the several sources from which it arose, or the relative proportions belonging to each division, it becomes important to examine this statement carefully.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\"

The history of this stock may be traced back to the year 1708. The opening entry in the aforesaid book is as follows: 1 July 12, 1708. By the last account for the balance brought from the old book, folio 23; viz: \u00a395 8s. <em>5d\u2019 </em>This amount was in old tenor. This account is continued regularly from July 12,1708, down to the year 1789. The other credits in this account are sacramental contributions, sums received for the use of the palls, and sums bequeathed for the use of the poor and not required to be put at interest. Of the sacramental contributions, it appeared that, from time to time, certain portions, at the time of their contribution, were specially designated to be for the poor, or for some poor person named; but the great mass was made without any special appropriation. On the other side are debited moneys expended for the communion service; expenses incurred by delegates to ordinations and councils; moneys paid to procure and keep in repair the palls; moneys paid for the expenses of conventions of ministers of the neighborhood at the pastor\u2019s; and moneys disbursed to the poor. Much the larger portion of the receipts was from the sacramental contributions, or moneys taken up on communion Sundays, and much the larger part of rhe disbursements was for the use of the poor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-7\">\u201c The balance of this account gradually increased till 1761, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>when the larger part of it was invested in a treasury note for \u00bf\u00a3134 lawful money.

At a meeting of church and congregation, 11th May, 1800, it was voted that the ministers and deacons deliver from the money of the church and congregation, to the committee empowered to erect the stores, such sums as might be necessary for the purpose. This last sum, when reduced to specie value, amounted to $5,221.40, (sold afterwards for $5,245.00,) and was then considered to be the property of the church and congregation, leaving the bank shares to belong to the church. By another part of the report of that committee of 3d April, made May 11, 1800, it might seem that the whole $5,221.00 (or $5,245.00) grew out of certain donations from particular persons. That, however, does not appear to have been the fact; but, on the contrary, arose from the four last items, as stated in that report, amounting to \u00a3378 8s. 8&lt;7. lawful money. This statement is founded on that of the committee of 3d April, 1800, on the state of the funds. The society will therefore consider whether the ministers and deacons had the disposal of the interest of that part, as was then supposed in said vote. The standing committee are unanimously of opinion they had not that right. If the society concur in the same opinion, it would seem that the $5,221.40 ($5,245) vested in the stores, as well as the income that has since arisen on the same, was the property of the church and congregation, and entirely at their disposal. If so, the vote or votes, passed May 11,1800, as respects the control of the interest by the trustees, should be reconsidered.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-5\">\u201c This report was accepted; but no further action was had thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-6\">\u201c The master has not been able to trace any connection between the \u00a3378 8s. <em>8d., </em>the sum of the last four items in the statement of 1766, and the sum of $5,245 invested in the stores.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-7\">\u201c The account of the fund now claimed as a poor fund was kept by the treasurer with the South Church, and the general statements of the fund were entered in the books under the head of Church Stock down to 1813, when the money had been advanced for the building of the two parsonage houses. After that time, no general statement of the fund appears; but the account of what remained thereof was kept as before by the treasurer with the South Church.

From the facts he infers that these contributions were originally made with the understanding that any surplus remaining, after defraying certain special church expenses, should be applied to the benefit of the poor. If this was not the clear understanding and intention of the contributors, the balances were so mingled with moneys held expressly in trust for the use of the poor, that it is not practicable now to separate them, and assign to each its due proportion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-4\">\u201c The item in the statement of 1766, called \u2018 Interest received on the above,\u2019 is evidently interest on all the preceding items.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">\u201c The master is of opinion that the sum of \u00bf6874 14s. <em>3d., </em>appearing at the foot of the statement of 1766, is to be regarded as the poor fund at that date, excepting items 11 and 12, which he presumes afterwards became a part thereof, as before stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">\u201c After 1766, a separate and regular account was kept of all the income received from, and of all disbursements out of, this fttnd. This account shows that between that date and the 18th April, 1800, this fund increased largely, so that at the latter date ;t'.\u00bfmounted to the sum of $16,062.71, taking the stocks in which it was invested at their par value. At their market value the sum would be somewhat larger. This increase arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>principally from the rise in the value of the stocks and notes in which the fund was in zested, and from accumulations of income, but in part from legacies, one of which was expressly required \u2018 to be let out at interest, and the interest applied to the use of the poor;\u2019 and from small balances transferred almost every year from the sacramental account. During this period, the payments charged in this account were mainly for the poor. After the discontinuance of the separate sacramental account in 1789, a few charges are made of sacramental expenses; and in one case, of expenses of a delegate to an installation. This charge .is as follows : \u00a3 30th July, 1789. By cash supplied John Sweetser, Jr., Esq., expenses of journey to New Concord for installment of the Rev. Mr. Evans, as per memorandum. N. B.

The poor fund, as reported by the master, is too large, and includes sums that form no part of it. This fund was called the \u201c church stock\u201d till after 1800, and was a fund where all the moneys belonging to the church were kept. This appears from various facts recited in the master\u2019s report. In 1800, an attempt was made to ascertain from what source the church funds had arisen and the intention of the donors; clearly showing tho+ they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>not then been appropriated exclusively to the poor.

After a thorough scrutiny, in the light of the elaborate arguments of counsel, of the evidence detailed in the full and careful report of the master, we are unable to concur in his conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The gift of Dr. Sewall, and the various bequests for the poor of the town, or of the parish or church, were clearly public charities, and to be applied by the ministers and deacons according to the intentions of the donors. Tudor on Charitable Trusts, (2d ed.) 6. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>St. </em>Matthew\u2019s, Burr. Sett. Cas. 574. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Clifton, </em>Ib. 697. <em>Saltonstall </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>11 Allen, 455-461, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">But the sacramental contributions are not shown to have been so exclusively and absolutely devoted to the poor as to be impressed with the character of a public charity. <em>County Attorney </em>v. <em>May, </em>5 Cush. 357, 358. The appropriations from time to time, out of such contributions, for the expenses of administering the sacrament, and the expenses of delegates of the church, were according to the common usages of religious societies in this state. These payments, as well as those for lighting the church and other incidental expenses, and that towards the salary of ministers in 1747, (which does not appear to have .ever been refunded,) tend to show that those contributions were not considered or treated as having been devoted exclusively to the reliei of the poor. The reasons assigned by the deacons in 1849 for discontinuing such collections show no more than that the sums so collected had been usually given to the poor. It is to be presumed that the small portions of them, specially designated at the time of their contribution as intended for the poor, were immediately so applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The mingling of the fund for the poor with the other fund of the church did not entitle the poor to the whole of the church fund. This is not the case of an individual mingling his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>private moneys undistinguishably with funds held by him in trust; but of the officers of a religious society intermingling funds neld by them upon distinct trusts, some of which are charitable, and others, although not strictly charitable, are in the nature of religious uses, the property belonging to which is not to be-forfeited by the neglect of the trustees to keep it separate from other trust funds. And there is evidence by which the amount of each fund can be approximately ascertained. It becomes necessary therefore to determine, with as much accuracy as the antiquity of the sources and the imperfection of the evidence will admit, what portion of the funds in question was impressed with the charitable use of relieving the poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The earliest piece of evidence upon this question is the statement in the church books in 1766 of \u201c the church stock,\u201d which is copied in the master\u2019s report. Assuming, as most favorable to the claim of the attorney general, that the \u201c pious and charitable fund,\u201d and the fund for the support of' the widows and fatherless children of ministers of the church, are to be included in the fund for the poor, derived from charitable bequest and gift, that statement shows that at that time the charity was entitled to the sum of \u00a3568.0.1\u00bf; that the \u201c sacramental stock \u201d of \u00bf\u00a3186.19.5\u00bf, and the interest accrued thereon of \u00a3119.14.8j, (which is carried out in the statement as part of the \u201c sacramental stock,\u201d and there is nothing in the master\u2019s report to show that any interest had previously accrued on the other funds,) amounted to the sum- of \u00a3306.14.1\u00a7; and the whole \u201cchurch stock\u201d to \u00a3874.4.13. This last sum was therefore to be divided between the two funds in the proportion which these sums (\u00a3568.0.1\u00bf, and \u00a3306.14.1|) bear to one another, being very nearly thirteen twentieths to the charity, and a little over seven twentieths to the church. The only addition to the charitable fund which is proved to have been made before 1800 is of \u00a350 by Thomas Hubbard\u2019s bequest in 1773.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In 1800 the whole church stock, estimated at the par value of the securities in which it was invested, amounted to the sum of $16,062.71, and at the market value of these securities to somewhat more. Even if we assume its whole value in 1809 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>to h\u00e1ve been $18,000, the proportion of it belonging to the char&lt;' ity would not have exceeded $11,700, and, even adding Hubbard\u2019s legacy of \u00bf650, in lawful money of the Province at six shillings to the dollar, or $166.67, and the further sum of $650 received from the Thursday Evening Charitable Society in 1808, would amount to but $12,516.67. The poor\u2019s fund therefore appears to have received all that belonged to it by the sum of $12,783.75 invested in building two parsonage houses on land of the society in Milk Street under the agreement of the ministers and deacons with the society in December of that year. If we more particularly follow the transactions between 1800 and 1809, the result is substantially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">On the 3d of April 1800, a committee of the society recommended the erection of five brick stores on their land on Washington Street, and the borrowing of money of the society for the purpose, the committee being of opinion that, after paying the same interest upon the sum borrowed as it was then producing, there would be a surplus of rents which might be applied towards the support of an additional minister, \u201c in doing which,\u201d it was the opinion of the committee, \u201c the views of the donor not only of the land, but those who have left legacies from time to time, will be fully answered, as the poor of said society will have as much as they now receive, and the other will be laid out in pious uses for the support of public worship.\u201d Another committee, appointed at the same meeting to examine into the funds of the church and congregation, their sources, and the intentions of the donors, made a report showing the amount of legacies and gifts for the poor as \u00bf6435.10.2, or about \u00bf665 less than in 1766; the fund for ministers\u2019 widows and children, apparently including the \u201c pious and charitable fund,\u201d at the same amount as those two funds in 1766, \u00bf666.19.2 ; the balance arising from sacramental collections, as in 1766, at \u00bf6186.19.5; and three other sums, supposed to belong to the church or congregation, at \u00bf6191.2.3; (omitting any mention of interest on sacramental collections, which had probably been expended since 1766;) showing the whole amount at \u00bf6880.11.0; of which, according to the classification above applied to the church stock of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>1766, \u00a3502.9.4 belonged to the charity, and \u00a3378.1.8 to the church. As this statement is less favorable to the charity than that of 1766, we have assumed the earlier one as the basis of apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">On the 11th of May 1800 the. society voted that the minister and deacons be requested and authorized to pay out of the moneys of the church and congregation the sums necessary to build the stores ; and be entitled to receive annually out of the rents thereof six per cent, upon the amount so invested, to be appropriated by them \u201c in like manner as the interest of said moneys has heretofore been appropriated according to the pious intentions of the donors thereof.\u201d Pursuant to this vote, there was paid to the society out of the fund the sum of $14,000, of which $8,755 was soon afterwards reimbursed. As the whole amount of the church stock was then estimated at about $16,000, of which the charity was not entitled to more than thirteen twentieths, or $10,400, it is evident that the whole $14,000 borrowed from the church stock did not come from that part of it which belonged to the charity. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it may be presumed that the $14,000 so invested, and the surplus of $2,061.71, each belonged proportionally to the charity and to the remaining funds of the church. The charity then would be entitled to thirteen twentieths of the $14,000 invested in the stores, or $9,100, being very little more than the $8,755 which was immediately reimbursed; and nearly the whole of the $5,245, which was not reimbursed, would belong to the church absolutely. The vote of 1807 recognizing this sum of $5,245 as \u201c due to the church and congregation fund for the poor,\u201d so far as it expressed the right of the poor to this amount, was therefore erroneous, as the society appear in 1809 to have discovered. In May 1809 the fund appropriated to the use of the poor is stated to consist of bank shares of the par value o\u00ed $9,000, (which substantially corresponds with the proportion contributed by the charity towards the building of the stores, and with the sum reimbursed immediately after they had been built,) and really worth $11,250. Adding to this sum thirteen twen-. tieths of the surplus of $2,062.71, which had not before been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>invested in land, or \u00a71,340.76, and the sum of \u00a7650 received from the Thursday Evening Charitable Society in 1808, would malee \u00a713,240.76, a sum not exceeding by five hundred dollars the sum of \u00a712,783.75 invested in the parsonage houses under the agreement of 1809.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The court is therefore unanimously of opinion that this sum of \u00a712,783.75 may fairly be taken as the principal sum belonging to the charity and invested in real estate at that time; and the remaining question is of the amount of interest and income thereof with which the defendants should be charged. The agreement of 1809, under which this principal sum was paid by the minister and deacons to the society, recited that \u201cin times past there have been legacies, bequests and donations made to the Old South Church, to be placed at interest for the benefit of the poor of said church, and of the church and congregation,\u201d (that is, one part for the poor of the church, and another for the poor of the. church and congregation, as appears by the terms of the original gifts,) and the interest arising thereon to be distributed among them according to the directions of the minister and deacons of said church, trustees for the purpose; \u201d and also recited the votes, passed in May and Tune 1809, for building the two parsonage houses, and obtaining from such trustees so much of the capital stock as might be required for that purpose, \u201c upon condition that the interest be punctually paid and the buildings be insured to secure the said payment.\u201d Instead of the interest on the sum so appropriated and invested, the rent of the easterly parsonage house, from the time of its completion until 1845, was annually paid by the society and received by the minister and deacons, for the use of the poor. In 1845 the society passed a by-law to pay annually to the deacons, for the use of the poor, the sum of \u00a7600, which has been regularly paid ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The length of time for which a court of chancery will require the trustees of a charity to account for income which has not been applied according to the intentions of the donors is much affected by the particular circumstances of each case. An arrangement made in good faith and acted upon for many years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>will not be lightly disturbed. But the statute of limitations affords no absolute bar or limit; and when trustees, with lcnowl edge of the charitable use, and no reasonable excuse for mistake, have misappropriated the whole or part of the income, they will be held to account for it during the whole period of misappropriation, unless grave inconvenience or hardship would be caused by so doing. Tudor on Charitable Trusts, 341, 342, and cases cited. <em>Man </em>v. Ballet, 1 Vern. 44. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp;c. of </em>Stafford, Barnard. Ch. 36. <em>Attorney General </em>v. Mayor, <em>&amp;c. of Newbury, </em>3 Myl. &amp; K. 647. Applying these principles to this case, we are of opinion that the rent of one of the two houses built with the aid of money of the charity on land of the society, which rent was paid and received annually for a period of more than thirty years ending in 1845, instead of interest upon that money, although for the greater part of that period less than such interest at the common rate would have been, yet must, in the absence of any evidence of bad faith oi unreasonableness in an arrangement which was acted upon so long and terminated more than twenty years ago, be deemed a substitution for and satisfaction of such interest during the same period; but that since 1845, when the payment and receipt of such rent ceased, to the time of the filing of this information in 1859, and since, the charity is entitled to interest at the rate of six per cent, annually, deducting therefrom the yearly payments of $600 made by the society to the deacons for the use of the poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The principal sum of $12,783.75, with so much of the interest thereon since 1845 as thus remains unpaid, together with the further principal sum of $1,947.50, belonging to the charity, which is admitted to have been in the hands of the treasurer of the society in January 1861, with interest on that sum also from that time to the date of the decree, will constitute the amount due to the charity. The defendants\u2019 exceptions to the master\u2019s report are therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">A decree may be entered for the payment of that amount by he society to the ministers and deacons of the church to be neld by them for the use of the poor, according to the intention* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>of the donors. The ministers and deacons being a corporation established by law, with' authority to receive the fund for this purpose, it is not necessary or usual to prescribe a scheme for its application, before ordering it to t\u2014\u25a0 paid to them.

Gladstone, 1 Phillips R. 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">As the intermingling by the defendants of the fund of the charity with other funds has aEorded ground for this information, and the information is sustained in part, the costs incurred in support of it, taxed as between counsel and client, are to be paid out of the charity fund ; and the defendants will bear their own costs. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Brewers\u2019 Co. </em>1 P.
