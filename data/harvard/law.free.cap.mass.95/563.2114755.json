Sts. <em>c. </em>87, \u00a7 6, charging him with keeping and maintaining a tenement used by him for the illegal sale and illegal keeping of intoxicating liquors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-10\">The defendant, by his attorneys, filed a special plea in bar, alleging that the defendant had a license granted under the internal revenue laws of the United States, and had paid a tax to the United States upon the liquors, and that the statute in question is unconstitutional, as requiring excessive bail, imposing excessive fines, and inflicting cruel and unusual punishments, and he moved, in the superior court, that the district attorney be required to answer this plea; but Brigham, J. refused so to order, and directed the defendant to be tried by the jury upon the plea of not guilty, pleaded by him after the special plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-11\">At the trial, which was in Essex county, John G. Brown, a witness for the Commonwealth, having testified on cross-examination that he looked at a memorandum made by him of the facts to which he testified, before leaving Boston on the morning of the trial, for the purpose of refreshing his memory, and that the memorandum was in Boston at the time of his testifying, the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to require the witness to produce the memorandum, and to suspend the trial in order to allow the witness to go to Boston and get it; but the jud$&gt; \u00ed efused to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-12\">The defendant, having testified in his own behalf that he sold out all his irierest in the place to James Dougherty, was asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>on cross-examination if Dougherty continued selling. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to this on the ground that his answer would criminate him, as the defendant was the owner of the building; but. the judge directed the defendant to answer the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-5\">Dougherty, having testified in behalf of the defendant that he purchased the place and was the owner and keeper thereof during all the time covered by the indictment, was asked on cross-examination if he sold liquors there. He declined to answer on the ground that it would tend to criminate him, and the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to his being compelled to answer; but the judge directed him to answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-6\">The defendant requested the court to instruct the jury that by the laws of the United States all liquors are subject to a United States revenue tax; that the United States laws punish the non-payment of such tax by any persons manufacturing or selling the same; that the presumption of the law is that such tax has been paid upon the liquors charged to have been kept and sold in this case; that such payment would be a good defence to this indictment; and that, the district attorney not having traversed or demurred to or in any way answered the special plea in bar, the same should be taken as true, and as a good defence to this indictment; but the judge declined to give these instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-7\">The district attorney, in his argument to the jury, was allowed, against the defendant\u2019s objection, to read and comment on the defendant\u2019s plea in bar, it not having been read to them, before, and to insist that the same was an admission by the de fendant of all the facts stated therein ; and the judge instructed the jury that the statements therein might be considered by them as evidence in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-8\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-9\">The <em>second </em>case was an indictment against Peter Flood, and the <em>third </em>case was an indictment against George W. Hamblett, under the same statute. In each case, the defendant filed a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>plea in bar, like that mentioned in <em>Lannan\u2019s </em>case, and made a similar motion ; but <em>Brigham, </em>J. overruled the motions and directed the defendants severally to be tried by the jury upon their pleas of not guilty, pleaded by them respectively after the special pleas. At the trials, the defendants severally requested instructions like those requested in <em>Lannan\u2019s </em>case, but the judge declined to give them. The jury in each case returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendants severally alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">The <em>fourth </em>case was an indictment against Samuel Hamer, under the same statute, and only differed from the cases of <em>Flood </em>and <em>Hamblett </em>in this respect: that Hamer refused to plead further, after his plea in bar, and <em>Morton, </em>J. accordingly ordered a plea of not guilty to be entered by the clerk, and the defendant was tried upon that plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-6\">The <em>fifth </em>case was an indictment against Joseph B. Shute, and the <em>sixth </em>case was a complaint, made to the police court of Newburyport, against George W. Hamblett, under the same statute. Shute pleaded not guilty in the superior court, and Hamblett pleaded\" not guilty in the police court, and was found guilty, and appealed to the superior court; and thereafter each defendant moved for leave to file the special plea; and in other respects the cases were like the cases of <em>Flood </em>and <em>Hamblett, </em>above recited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-7\">The <em>seventh </em>case was an indictment against Joseph B. Morris, under the same statute, and was in all respects like the case of <em>Flood, </em>with this addition : that the district attorney was allowed, in his argument to the jury, to read and comment on the plea in bar, as in <em>Lannan\u2019s </em>case, and similar instructions on this point were given to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-8\">The <em>eighth </em>case was a complaint, made in the police court of Salem, against Lawrence Miller, charging him with a single sale of intoxicating liquor. In the police court, the defendan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>\u2018 waived an examination, admitting that he was guilty,\u201d whereupon he was found guilty and appealed. The proceedings in the superior court were like those in the <em>sixth </em>case, being the second case of <em>Hamblett.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-5\">These cases were all argued together in January 1867.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-6\"><em>N.

In <em>Lannaris </em>case, the rulings on points of evidence were correct. See <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Lapham, 20 </em>Pick. 473, as to the production of the memorandum; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>4 Cush. 594, and <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>11 Cush. 439, as to requiring the witnesses to testify.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b575-8\">Hoar, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azq\">These cases have been argued together, and most of the exceptions taken in them are without foundation. The case of Lannan presents the largest number of questions; and the decision in that will dispose of nearly all the other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Each of the defendants filed or offered to file a special plea in bar, which was rejected by the presiding judge, who ruled that the attorney for the Commonwealth was not required to reply or demur to it, and directed the trial to proceed upon a plea of not guilty. In the cases of Shute, Morris, Miller, and the second of Hamblett\u2019s, this plea was tendered after a plea of not guilty, and of course could not be filed without leave of the court. 1 Chit. Crim. L. 436. In the case of Hamer, who refused to make any further plea than the special plea in bar, the court ordered a plea of not guilty to be entered. In the other cases the defendants pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>1. The first point in <em>Lannan\u2019s </em>case is, that the defendant should not have been required to go to trial on the plea of not guilty until his plea in bar had been disposed of upon demurrer or issue. On examining it, we find that it was wholly insufficient as an answer to the charge in the indictment, and that an issue framed upon it would have been immaterial. The court so regarded and disposed of it. The attorney for the Commonwealth objected that he was not bound to answer it, and the objection was sustained. This amounted to a demurrer <em>ore </em>terms, and the defendant has had all the advantage that he would have had on a demurrer in writing. He has therefore had no prejudice, and has no ground of exception. There was nothing in the plea in bar which, if of any validity, would not have been available to him under the plea of not guilty. It was not a plea which he was entitled to make, and upon his answering over, in compliance with the order of the court, the trial proceeded regularly, and in a legal and proper manner. It is not every paper which a party may choose to tender that will be accepted as a plea to an indictment. It should at least purport to contain a full answer to the charge. \u201c A prisoner is said to stand mute,\u201d says Black stone, \u201c when, being arraigned for treason or felony, he either, 1, makes no answer at all; .or, 2, answers foreign to the purpose, or with such matter as is not allowable; and will not answer otherwise.\u201d 4 Bl. Com. 324. The distinction between the case at bar and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>8 Allen, 545, is, that in that case there was a plea in bar, sufficient in form, of a former conviction; and that there was no issue taken upon that plea by which it could be disposed of. It was held that to be required to give his evidence of a former conviction at the same time that he was tried on a plea of not guilty might prejudice his defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The order of the court to enter the plea of not guilty for Hamer, who refused to plead further, was authorized by Gen. Sts. c. 171, \u00a7 29. His first plea having been overruled and rejected, there was no plea made by him on which he could be tried</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">2. It obviously follows from the decision that the plea in bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>was rightly overruled and rejected, that its statements could not be considered as admitted by the district attorney who refused to answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">3. Requiring a witness to produce a memorandum which is not in court, and which he has not been summoned to produce, is a matter within the discretion of the court; and the refusal to require it is no cause of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">4. The defendant by offering himself as a witness waives his right to object to any question pertinent to the issue, on the ground that the answer may tend to criminate him. He is not required to testify, and may protect himself by omitting to dc so. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Price, 10 Gray, 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\"><em>5. </em>It does not appear by the bill of exceptions what answer the witness Dougherty made to the question asked him, which he objected to answering because it might tend to criminate him; and it does not therefore appear that the defendant was prejudiced by the order requiring him to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">6. The remaining exception is to the ruling of the court, permitting the district attorney to read to the jury the special plea in bar, and instructing them that they might consider the statements contained in it as evidence against the defendant. This we think was erroneous. The plea was drawn by the defendant\u2019s attorneys, and signed by them on his behalf; and was rejected by the court. Under these circumstances it is not to be regarded as a confession or admission which can be used against him. In civil cases, it is expressly provided by statute that the pleadings shall not be used as evidence. Gen. Sts. c. 129, \u00a7 72. So on a demurrer by the defendant in a case of felony, though the demurrer admits the truth of the facts charged in the indictment, yet he may plead not guilty after the demurrer is adjudged against him, for it is said \u201c that where he unwarily discloses to the court the facts of his case, and demands their advice whether they amount to felony, they will not record or notice the confession; \u201d and that a demurrer stands upon the same analogy. 1 Chit. Crim. L. 429, 442. And if, on. arraignment for a misdemeanor, judgment of <em>respondeas ouster </em>is given upon demurrer, it would avail him little to plead not guilty, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>his former plea were to be used in evidence as his confession. Another analogy, which leads to the same conclusion, is to be found in the rule which excludes a prisoner\u2019s confession when it has been made under any inducement or hope of advantage. These considerations, which apply to a plea made by the defendant himself, have still more force when applied to pleadings drawn by counsel for a specific purpose which they are not found to answer. They can in .no just sense be regarded as confessions by which his rights should be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The verdict in Lannan\u2019s case, therefore, and in the case \"of Morris, in which the same exception was taken, must be set aside and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The other exceptions taken have not been argued or relied on by counsel, and are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Against all the defendants except Lannan and Morris,</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
