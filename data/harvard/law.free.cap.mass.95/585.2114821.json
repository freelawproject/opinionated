Sts. <em>c. </em>86, \u00a7 37, alleging that the defendant, on a day named, conveyed a certain quantity of intoxicating liquor from a car of the Boston and Worcester Railroad Corporation standing near tke passenger depot of said corporation in Natick to another place named, having reasonable cause to believe that the same were intended to be sold in violation' of Gen.

For the purpose of proving that the defendant had reasonable cause to believe that these liquors were intended to be sold in violation of Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>86, evidence was admitted, against his objection, tending to prove that, on four different days within a month before this time, the defendant received and removed from the cars at the same station one keg of liquor on each of the days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-4\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-5\"><em>C.

The other evidence in the case not being reported, it is to be presumed that it was sufficient, in connection with the evidence excepted to, to justify the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
