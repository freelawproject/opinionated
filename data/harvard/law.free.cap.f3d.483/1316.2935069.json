Following her son\u2019s death in a traffic accident, Mrs. Amber-Messick submitted a claim to the Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of Justice Assistance (\u201cBJA\u201d) seeking death benefits under the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits Act of 1976 (\u201cPSOBA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d), Pub.L. No. 94-430, 90 Stat. 1346 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3796-3796c (2000)). After BJA denied her claim based on the conclusion that Christopher was not a \u201cfirefighter\u201d under PSOBA, Mrs. Amber-Messick brought suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims. The parties then cross-moved for judgment based upon the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">The Court of Federal Claims granted judgment on the administrative record in favor of Mrs. Amber-Messick. The court ruled that B JA\u2019s denial of benefits was an arbitrary exercise of its authority and held that Mrs. Amber-Messick could recover under PSOBA because Christopher was a \u201cfirefighter\u201d who had died \u201cin the line of duty\u201d within the meaning of the statute and implementing regulations. <em>Messick v. United States, </em>70 Fed.Cl. 319, 332 (2006). Accordingly, the court entered judgment, awarding Mrs. Amber-Messick the sum of $250,000, adjusted in accordance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">The United States has appealed the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 decision. Because we conclude that the court erred in failing to defer to BJA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cfirefighter,\u201d the judgment in favor of Mrs. Amber-Messick is reversed. The case is remanded to the Court of Federal Claims with the instructions that it enter judgment in favor of the United States and dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">PSOBA provides a one-time cash payment to survivors of public safety officers who die in the line of duty. The program is administered by BJA. In relevant part, section 3796(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-14\">In any case in which the Bureau of Justice Assistance ... determines, under regulations issued pursuant to this part that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, the Bureau shall pay a benefit of $ 250,000 ... as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-15\">(1) if there is no surviving child of such officer, to the surviving spouse of such officer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-16\">(2) if there is a surviving child or children and a surviving spouse, one-half to the surviving child or children of such officer in equal shares and one-half to the surviving spouse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>(3) if there is no surviving spouse, to the child or children of such officer in equal shares;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-5\">(4) if there is no surviving spouse or surviving child, to the individual designated by such officer as beneficiary under such officer\u2019s most recently executed life insurance policy, provided that such individual survived such officer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-6\">(5) if none of the above, to the parent or parents of such officer in equal shares.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796(a) (2000) (amended 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">For a survivor or survivors to be entitled to payment, the public safety officer must have suffered a - \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of the Act, the injury must have been suffered \u201cin the line of duty,\u201d and the death must have been \u201cthe direct and proximate result\u201d of the personal injury. <em>Id.; see also Cassella v. United States, </em>469 F.3d 1376, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2006); <em>Yanco v. United States, </em>258 F.3d 1356, 1359 (Fed.Cir.2001). The 2000 version of the Act, applicable here, defined \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d as \u201can individual serving a public agency in an official capacity, with or without compensation, as a law enforcement officer, as a firefighter, as a chaplain, or as a member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796b(8) (2000) (current version at 42 U.S.C. 3796b(9) (2006)). The Act additionally defined \u201cfirefighter\u201d as \u201cincluding] an individual serving as an officially recognized or designated member of a legally organized volunteer fire department.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796b(4) (2000 &amp; Supp. II 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">The Act also sets forth specific restrictions upon entitlement. Section 3796a states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-10\">No benefit shall be paid under this sub-chapter\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-11\">(1) if the death or catastrophic injury was caused by the intentional misconduct of the public safety officer or by such officer\u2019s intention to bring about his death or catastrophic injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-13\">(3) if the public safety officer was performing his duties in a grossly negligent manner at the time of his death or catastrophic injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796a (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-16\">Christopher Rangas was a fourteen-year-old \u201capprentice firefighter\u201d with the Brookhaven Fire Department. <em>Messick, </em>70 Fed.Cl. at 321. The Brookhaven Fire Department authorized fourteen- and fifteen-year old apprentice firefighters to participate in training activities; to provide first aid care to victims at emergency scenes; to engage in canteen (food service) activities; to participate in a support capacity in connection with search and rescue operations, wild fires, hazardous materials incidents, and water supply operations; and to assist with clean-up activities, such as rolling hoses, putting away portable tools, and removing debris outside of fire buildings and collapse zones. Christopher, who had been an apprentice firefighter since May 15, 2001, was issued official firefighting equipment and had completed 58.5 hours of in-house training in a variety of areas related to firefighting. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-17\">On May 4, 2002, an automobile struck Christopher at an intersection. At the time of the accident, Christopher was riding his bicycle from his house to the Brookhaven fire station in response to a fire alarm. <em>Id. </em>at 321-22. As a result of the accident, Christopher sustained serious injuries and died. <em>Id. </em>at 322. According to the November 20, 2002 report of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (\u201cNIOSH\u201d), Christopher was not wearing a helmet and crossed the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>tersection without stopping at the stop sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">On May 28, 2002, Mrs. Amber-Messick filed a claim with BJA for PSOBA death benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 321. On September 11, 2002, BJA issued an initial determination denying the claim. <em>Id. </em>BJA determined that Christopher \u201cwas a trainee but did not possess authority to act as an official firefighter\u201d and thus was not a \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d pursuant to PSOBA. <em>Id. </em>BJA noted that Christopher was only permitted to participate in training activities, to provide first aid care, to assist with clean-up activities, to support canteen activities, and to participate in a support capacity for operations such as searches and rescues. BJA also noted that Christopher \u201cwas not permitted to operate equipment or assist with fire suppression at fire scenes or enter hazardous atmospheres.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">On March 4, 2003, Mrs. Amber-Messick sought reconsideration of the initial denial of benefits. <em>Id. </em>In accordance with BJA regulations, the matter was referred to a Hearing Officer, who received evidence and held a hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his April 26, 2004 decision, the Hearing Officer sustained the initial denial of benefits based on his conclusion that Christopher was not a \u201cfirefighter\u201d under PSOBA. <em>Id. </em>at 322. The Hearing Officer acknowledged that PSO-BA did not define \u201cfirefighter\u201d as one \u201cengaged in the suppression of fires,\u201d but concluded that Congress intended the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d to mean an individual \u201cauthorized to actively engage in the suppression of fires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Hearing Officer based his conclusion on the plain meaning of the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as his interpretation of legislative intent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the Hearing Officer cited to the definition of \u201cline of duty\u201d in BJA\u2019s implementing regulations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to support his conclusion that one must be authorized to fight or suppress fires to be a \u201cfirefighter\u201d under the statute. <em>Id. </em>The Hearing Officer also noted that under Pennsylvania law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> fourteen- and fifteen-year old junior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>firefighters are prohibited from being directly involved in the suppression of fires. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">On June 29, 2004, in accordance with 28 C.F.R. 32.24(i)(l)(i), Mrs. Amber-Messick requested that BJA reconsider the Hearing Officer\u2019s denial of death benefits. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.24(i)(l) (2002) (\u201cA claimant determined ineligible by a hearing officer ... may, within 30 days after notification of the hearing officer\u2019s determination: (i) request the BJA Director to review the record and the hearing officer\u2019s determination ....\u201d) (current version at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.46 (2006)). On April 28, 2005, the Director of BJA, in the Final Agency Decision, affirmed the Hearing Officer\u2019s denial of benefits based on the conclusion that Christopher was not a \u201cfirefighter\u201d or \u201cpublic safety officer\u201d within the meaning of PSOBA. <em>Id. </em>at 323. The Director additionally concluded that \u201c[e]ven if Christopher were a \u2018firefighter\u2019 within the meaning of the PSOB Act (which he was not), his tragic death did not occur in the line of duty, as defined in the PSOB regulations, because Pennsylvania law ... did not obligate or authorize him to engage in firefighting or fire-suppression activity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">On June 27, 2005, Mrs. Amber-Messick filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims to challenge BJA\u2019s denial of her claim under PSOBA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As noted above, the parties, in due course, cross-moved for judgment based upon the administrative record. The court concluded that BJA\u2019s denial of death benefits was \u201carbitrary and capricious and founded on an unreasonably restrictive reading of the words of PSOBA and implementing regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331. The court found that Christopher was a \u201cfirefighter\u201d who died in the \u201cline of duty\u201d because Christopher\u2019s \u201c \u2018primary function\u2019 was to be a part of the team that engaged in \u2018the suppression of fires.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The court therefore granted Mrs. Amber-Messick\u2019s motion for judgment on the administrative record and denied the government\u2019s cross-motion. <em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">The United States timely appealed the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims to this court on May 26, 2006. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">Our review of BJA\u2019s denial of a claim for death benefits is limited to three inquiries: (1) whether there has been substantial compliance with statutory requirements and provisions of implementing regulations; (2) whether there has been any arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the government officials involved; and (3) whether substantial evidence supports the decision denying the claim. <em>Yanco, </em>258 F.3d at 1362; <em>Chacon v. United States, </em>48 F.3d 508, 511 (Fed.Cir.1995). We review the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims de novo, applying this deferential standard anew. <em>Greeley v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1009, 1010-11 (Fed.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">The government argues on appeal that we should defer to BJA\u2019s permissible con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>struction of \u201cfirefighter\u201d in line with <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). The government contends that because the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d is ambiguous with respect to whether it covers a minor apprentice firefighter, we must inquire, under step two of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, whether BJA\u2019s conclusion that Christopher was not a firefighter because he was not authorized to fight fires was reasonable. According to the government, BJA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cfirefighter\u201d was permissible in light of Pennsylvania state law; the ordinary, common meaning of the term; and the legislative history of PSOBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Additionally, the government makes two alternative arguments. First, the government argues that even if Christopher was a \u201cfirefighter\u201d pursuant to PSOBA, BJA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cline of duty\u201d is reasonable and therefore we should uphold its determination that Christopher did not die in the \u201cline of duty.\u201d Second, the government contends that even if Christopher was a \u201cfirefighter\u201d who died in the \u201cline of duty,\u201d the government is entitled to a remand of the case for a determination by BJA as to whether the circumstances of Christopher\u2019s death \u2014 his failure to wear a helmet and to stop before entering the intersection \u2014 constituted intentional misconduct or gross negligence so as to preclude the payment of a benefit under the statute. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796a.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">In response to the government\u2019s arguments, Mrs. Amber-Messick argues that PSOBA is clear and unambiguous in its broad definition of \u201cfirefighter.\u201d Further, she contends that even if the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d is ambiguous, BJA\u2019s interpretation of the term is arbitrary and capricious, given that the statute and regulations are easily understood without adding duty-specific limitations. Mrs. Amber-Messick also directs our attention to the fact that she received benefits under the Pennsylvania Emergency Law Enforcement Personnel Death Benefits Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 891, as support for her argument that she should have received benefits under PSOBA. Specifically, Mrs. Amber-Mes-sick argues that 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.5<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requires BJA to give \u201csubstantial weight\u201d to state and local agencies\u2019 findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">With respect to the government\u2019s \u201cline of duty\u201d alternative argument, Mrs. Amber-Messick contends that because Christopher\u2019s primary function was to be a part of a team that engaged in the \u201csuppression of fires,\u201d Christopher died in the \u201cline of duty.\u201d Finally, Mrs. Amber-Messick urges that there are three reasons why we should reject the government\u2019s request for a remand. First, she notes that, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(2),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the lower court\u2019s decision whether to remand is discretionary. Second, she contends that the record contains insufficient evidence to support a determination of intentional misconduct or gross negligence, given that the NIOSH report is the only item in the record that mentions Christopher\u2019s failure to wear a helmet and to stop at the stop sign. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>Third, Mrs. Amber-Messick argues that the failure to wear a helmet and to stop at the stop sign does not rise to the level of intentional misconduct or gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">We hold that the Court of Federal Claims erred in granting judgment on the administrative record in favor of Mrs. Amber-Messick and in denying judgment on the administrative record in favor of the United States. We agree with the government\u2019s argument that BJA\u2019s construction of the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">In <em>United States v. Mead Corp., </em>the Supreme Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"acc-dedup-0\">[A]dministrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for <em>Chevron </em>deference when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority. Delegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of ways, as by an agency\u2019s power to engage in adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemak-ing, or by some other indication of a comparable congressional intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">533 U.S. 218, 226, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001). The Supreme Court further noted, \u201cWe have recognized a very good indicator of delegation meriting <em>Chevron </em>treatment in express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 121 S.Ct. 2164. Here, because Congress expressly authorized BJA to issue regulations interpreting PSOBA and to make determinations as to eligibility for benefits, we conclude that Congress intended for a BJA pronouncement to have the \u201cforce of law.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796c (\u201cThe Bureau is authorized to establish such rules, regulations, and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.\u201d). We therefore will defer to BJA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cfirefighter,\u201d so long as it is reasonable in accordance with <em>Chevron.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">When <em>Chevron </em>deference applies, the court must undertake a two-step inquiry. First, the court must determine \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. \u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If, however, \u201cthe statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">Here, the \u201cprecise question at issue\u201d is whether the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796b(4) covers a minor prohibited by law from engaging in certain firefighting activities. In that regard, we are not persuaded by Mrs. Amber-Mes-sick\u2019s argument that PSOBA is clear and unambiguous in its broad definition of \u201cfirefighter.\u201d Mrs. Amber-Messick argues that neither the statute nor the regulations supply age or duty requirements or add other limitations to the definition of \u201cfirefighter.\u201d We think, however, that this argument indicates Congress has not directly spoken to the precise question of whether the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d covers a minor apprentice firefighter. We also think Mrs. Amber-Messick\u2019s argument that the drafters of PSOBA chose to use \u201cincludes\u201d rather than \u201cmeans\u201d or \u201cis defined\u201d in the definition of \u201cfirefighter,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796b(4),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> because they intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>for PSOBA to have a broader interpretation fails. In our view, Congress used the word \u201cincludes\u201d in order to ensure that the Act covered volunteer firefighters as well as professional firefighters. H.R.Rep. No. 94-1031, at 4 (1976) (\u201cThe bill defines \u2018firemen\u2019 to include volunteer as well as professional firemen.\u201d). If Congress had defined \u201cfirefighter\u201d to \u201cmean an individual serving as an officially recognized or designated member of a legally organized volunteer fire department,\u201d professional firefighters would have been excluded from statutory coverage. Accordingly, we conclude that Congress has not \u201cdirectly spoken\u201d to the question of whether the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796b(4) covers a minor apprentice firefighter prohibited by law from engaging in certain firefighting activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">Under the second prong of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, we must determine whether BJA\u2019s decision to exclude from the definition of \u201cfirefighter\u201d a minor apprentice firefighter not authorized to fight fires represents \u201ca permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. We conclude that BJA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cfirefighter\u201d as one who is \u201cauthorized to actively engage in the suppression of fires\u201d is permissible based on the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d as well as the legislative history of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The ordinary, common meaning of the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d as \u201ca person who fights fires\u201d is consistent with BJA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cfirefighter.\u201d <em>See Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>(10th ed.2002); <em>see also The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary </em>(1993) (\u201ca person whose task is to extinguish fires\u201d); <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>(1981) (\u201cone who fights fires\u201d). We agree with the government\u2019s argument that there is no indication in the Act itself of any legislative intent to depart from this ordinary meaning. The legislative history, moreover, supports BJA\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d in accordance with its ordinary meaning. The House Judiciary Committee Report No. 94-1031 contains the following statement: \u201cSince fire fighting has been determined to be one of the most hazardous professions, the Committee is of the opinion that coverage should extend to all activities performed by firemen when they are actually and directly engaged in fighting fires.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 94-1031, at 4 (1976). We thus conclude that BJA\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d as one who is \u201cauthorized to actively engage in the suppression of fires\u201d is a \u201cpermissible construction of the statute,\u201d and is not, as argued by Mrs. Amber-Messick, arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Based on our conclusion that BJA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cfirefighter\u201d is permissible, the only remaining question is whether BJA\u2019s decision that Christopher is not \u201cauthorized to actively engage in the suppression of fires\u201d and therefore not a \u201cfirefighter\u201d pursuant to PSOBA is reasonable. According to Pennsylvania state law, as a minor under sixteen years of age, Christopher\u2019s activities were expressly limited to: (1) training, (2) first aid, (3) clean-up, and (4) providing coffee wagon and food services. 43 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 48.3(c). The authorization to engage in these limited activities does not equate to the authorization \u201cto actively engage in the suppression of fires.\u201d Further, given that Pennsylvania state law prohibits minors under the age of sixteen from operating high pressure hose lines except during training, from ascending ladders except during training, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>entering a burning structure, 43 Pa. Stat. \u00a7 48.3(c), and from riding an official vehicle to the scene of a fire and participating in any fire fighting activities, 34 Pa.Code \u00a7 11.67(a)(5), we conclude that BJA\u2019s decision that Christopher was not \u201cauthorized to engage in the suppression of fires\u201d was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Additionally, we find unpersuasive Mrs. Amber-Messick\u2019s contention that the fact she received benefits under the Pennsylvania Emergency Law Enforcement Personnel Death Benefits Act supports her claim under PSOBA.. BJA\u2019s implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.5, only applies to findings of fact and does not apply to the ultimate conclusion of whether a claimant is entitled to a benefit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Demutiis v. United, States, </em>291 F.3d 1373, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2002). BJA was not required to give \u201csubstantial weight\u201d to the state agency\u2019s legal conclusion that Mrs. Amber-Messick was entitled to receive death benefits under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">In sum, we hold that BJA\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d as one who is \u201cauthorized to actively engage in the suppression of fires\u201d is permissible in light of the ordinary, common meaning of the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d and the legislative history of PSOBA. We also hold that BJA did not err in its determination that Christopher was not a \u201cfirefighter\u201d under PSOBA, given that Pennsylvania state law does not authorize him to participate in firefighting activities and, instead, expressly limits his activities to non-firefighting activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Finally, in view of our disposition of the appeal based upon our holding that Christopher was not a \u201cfirefighter\u201d pursuant to PSOBA, we do not need to reach the government\u2019s two alternative arguments noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims in favor of Mrs. Amber-Messick is reversed. The case is remanded to the Court of Federal Claims, which is instructed to enter judgment in favor of the United States and to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\"><em>REVERSED </em>and <em>REMANDED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-6\">. <em>\u201cA </em>claimant may, within thirty (30) days after notification of ineligibility by the Bureau, request the Bureau to reconsider its finding of ineligibility.

He was killed in an accident on his bicycle while responding to a fire call. His family requested the statutory compensation that is granted, in accordance with the Public Safety Officers\u2019 Benefits Act (PSOBA), to families of firefighters and other public safety officers who die in the line of duty. The family also sought to recognize his memory by inscription on the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation\u2019s Honor Roll of firefighters who die in service; this recognition was denied after the government denied firefighter benefits under the PSOBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-18\">The PSOBA definition states: \u201c \u2018Firefighter\u2019 includes an individual serving as an officially recognized or designated member of a legally organized fire department. ...\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3796b(4). Volunteer firefighters, serving as needed and without compensation, are included. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3796b(8)(A) (a \u201c \u2018public safety officer\u2019 means ... an individual serving a public agency in an official capacity, with or without compensation, as a law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>officer, as a firefighter, as a chaplain, or as a member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">The PSOBA is administered by the Department of Justice through its Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). The BJA held that Kangas was not a \u201cfirefighter\u201d because as a junior firefighter under the age of 16 he could not, in accordance with Pennsylvania law, engage in certain firefighting activities. Firefighters under the age of sixteen are prohibited, in Pennsylvania, from entering burning buildings and from climbing ladders or operating high-pressure hose lines other than during training.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The Court of Federal Claims, reviewing the testimony of Pennsylvania firefighting officials, agreed with these officials that Kangas was part of the firefighting team. At the hearing before the BJA, the Brook-haven Fire Chief, Rob Montella, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-6\">The junior firefighter is a \u2014 it\u2019s part of the team. They are ... just as much a part of being a firefighter as anybody else out there. They do all the jobs that they need to do. They help out. The jobs that they do are very important. If they\u2019re not there, somebody else has to do the job. If you don\u2019t have the manpower them jobs aren\u2019t getting done. They\u2019re getting done by them other guys that are doing different jobs that they\u2019re allowed to do. So the junior firefighter is a vital part of the fire department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The Pennsylvania State Fire Commissioner also testified, stating that the Pennsylvania death benefits statute makes no distinction between junior/apprentice firefighters and other firefighters who die in the line of duty, and that Kangas had been so recognized and placed on the state\u2019s Honor Roll of fallen firefighters. The Fire Commissioner testified that the state death benefits statute makes no distinction among junior, apprentice, or other firefighters and that age or service capacity are not barriers to state death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">The Court of Federal Claims observed that the federal statute does not exclude apprentice firefighters who die under conditions in which a non-apprentice would be recognized.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The testimony of the Brook-haven Fire Chief and Pennsylvania Fire Commissioner was clear that the duties performed by the apprentice firefighters freed the senior firefighters for other tasks, and that the apprentices\u2019 tasks are a necessary and integral part of the team effort in fighting fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">The Court of Federal Claims summarized the evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-12\">Christopher had been issued official firefighter equipment. He had completed 58.5 hours of in-house training and had trained in twenty-two different areas related to firefighting, including rescue operations, the functions of an air pack, electronics, carbon monoxide detection and hose rolling. Christopher also was certified in CPR and had responded to twenty-four house drills. The Brookha-ven Fire Department had authorized Christopher to be part of the firefighting team by participating at the scene of a fire, including bringing out portable equipment and fire hoses, providing food, drink and first aid to the other firefighters, and cleaning up after fires that were under control. After Christopher\u2019s death, the Brookhaven, Pennsylvania, Volunteer Fire Department added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>his name to the honor roll of its deceased members. Christopher was the only person on the honor roll to have died in what the Department determined was \u201cthe line of duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">70 Fed.Cl. at 321. The Court concluded that Kangas\u2019 service was within the scope of the PSOBA, whose purpose was to encourage and recognize persons who formally participate in public safety activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">On appeal by the United States, my colleagues now endorse the federal government\u2019s position that Christopher Kan-gas was not a \u201cfirefighter\u201d and that his death warrants neither compensation nor recognition. This position contravenes the statutory purposes, summarized in the legislative history as including increasing the morale of fire departments, assisting in recruiting efforts, showing appreciation for public service officers, and alleviating economic and emotional burdens placed upon public servants and their families. The Senate Committee Report accompanying amendments in 2000 explained that the national goal \u201cto reduce loss of life and property and protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure from all types of hazards, through a comprehensive, risk-based emergency management program ...\u201d with a broad mission focusing on four areas: preparedness <em>(e.g., </em>emergency planning and training), mitigation, response, and recovery. S. Rep. 106-295 (2000) at 1-2, the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 1552, Pub.L. No. 106-390. My colleagues\u2019 reliance on Christopher Kan-gas\u2019 exclusion from some senior firefighting activities as the basis for barring his recognition as a fallen firefighter is in direct conflict with the statutory purpose of recognizing the role of the firefighter and others serving the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The analogous Pennsylvania Emergency Law Enforcement Personnel Death Benefits Act, 53 P.S. \u00a7 891 et <em>seq. </em>states, as does the PSOBA, that: \u201cThis Act shall be broadly construed to grant benefits to firefighters ... for deaths related to the performance of their duties.\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 892.1. Under PSOBA regulation 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.5 the BJA must give \u201csubstantial weight to evidence and findings of fact\u201d presented by state or local agencies. Accordingly, when Pennsylvania has recognized Christopher Kangas as a fallen firefighter under a statute with almost identical language to the federal statute, the United States should not take a contrary position without exceptional good reason. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.4 (\u201c[the BJA] shall resolve any reasonable doubt arising from the circumstances of the officer\u2019s death ... in favor of the payment of the death ... benefit\u201d); <em>Davis v. United States, </em>46 Fed.Cl. 421, 427 (2000). <em>See also Demutiis v. United States, </em>48 Fed.Cl. 81 (2000) (the PSOBA must be construed in accord with its legislative intent and applicable canons of construction \u201cboth of which compel a conclusion that Congress desired this statute to be applied liberally\u201d), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>291 F.3d 1373 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Although the United States urges <em>Chevron </em>deference to the interpretation of the BJA, the term \u201cfirefighter\u201d in the PSOBA is not ambiguous. An interpretation that excludes apprentice firefighters who die while serving as apprentices, departs so markedly from the statutory purpose as to negate deference. <em>See Whitman v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, </em>531 U.S. 457, 485, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001) (judicial deference is not warranted where an agency \u201cconstrue[d] the statute in a way that completely nullifies textually applicable provisions meant to limit [the agency\u2019s] discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">The PSOBA does not limit \u201cfirefighter\u201d to exclude all persons who do not enter burning buildings. Observing the various federal laws with firefighter provisions, the civil service law as to federal employees is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>explicit that a \u201cfirefighter\u201d can be an administrator or supervisor who is not \u201cactively engaged in the suppression of fires\u201d \u2014 the definition adopted by my colleagues. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(21). However, according to the BJA\u2019s interpretation, an administrator or supervisor is not a \u201cfirefighter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">The Court of Federal Claims correctly concluded that apprentice firefighters are within the statutory purposes and entitled to the death benefits of the PSOBA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-5\">In conclusion Christopher was a recognized apprentice \u201cfirefighter\u201d of the Brookhaven Volunteer Fire Department. He was authorized to attend the scene of a fire, offload equipment, attach non-pressurized hoses to water sources, administer first aid to victims, assist in food services, roll hoses after a fire, remove debris, provide support at hazardous materials scenes and participate in search and rescue operations. Christopher engaged in activities involved in the \u201csuppression of fires.\u201d He was a \u201cfirefighter\u201d in the ordinary sense of the word.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">70 Fed.Cl. at 331. The exclusion of apprentices who are killed in the line of duty is inimical to the purpose of this statute that was designed to encourage and enlarge such public service. The PSOBA \u201cshould not be applied grudgingly, but rather should be construed liberally to avoid frustration of its beneficial legislative purposes.\u201d <em>Bice v. United States, </em>72 Fed.Cl. 432 (2006). <em>See Balt. &amp; Phila. Steamboat Co. v. Norton, </em>284 U.S. 408, 414, 52 S.Ct. 187, 76 L.Ed. 366 (1932) (remedial laws \u201care deemed to be in the public interest and should be construed liberally in furtherance of the purpose for which they were enacted and, if possible, so as to avoid incongruous or harsh results\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Logic and justice add their weight to the plain reading of this statute. The federal restriction of \u201cfirefighter\u201d to exclude apprentices who die in the line of duty is untenable, and in striking contrast to Pennsylvania\u2019s recognition of the death of such apprentices. From my colleagues\u2019 endorsement of this statutory interpretation I must, respectfully, dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-8\">. It is undisputed that accidental death while traveling to or from a fire is deemed compen-sable; indeed, a large number of such unfortunate accidents occur. \"According to the U.S. Fire Administration, of the 106 fire fighters who died in the line of duty in 2005, 26 were the result of vehicle accidents.\u201d http://www.iaff.org/media/021506health.pdf.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
