After a thorough review, we conclude that the Attorney General has the discretion to deny the adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">Ubaid Usmani, a native and citizen of Pakistan, entered the United States in 1995 as a non-immigrant visitor authorized to remain for a temporary period not to exceed six months. When he remained beyond that period, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued him a notice to appear, charging him with re-movability under INA \u00a7 287(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). Usmani filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal based on his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">Before the hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Usmani withdrew his application and filed an application to adjust status under INA \u00a7 245(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\u00ae. The parties do not dispute that Usmani was statutorily eligible to adjust status. Usmani received an approved labor certificate from the Department of Labor and an approved 1-140 employment-based visa petition prior to applying for adjustment of status under \u00a7 245\u00ae, thus making him statutorily eligible for adjustment. During Usmani\u2019s testimony, the government elicited several inconsistencies in the testimony regarding whether or not Usmani had participated in Pakistani political groups or Muslim student groups, and \u25a0 whether he had ever been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-10\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Usmani\u2019s application for adjustment of status because, although Usmani was statutorily eligible to adjust status, the IJ had concerns about Usmani\u2019s testimony and the inconsistencies. In light of these concerns, the IJ found that Usmani did not deserve \u201cthe extraordinary remedy of adjustment of status.\u201d After the IJ denied Usmani\u2019s motion to reconsider, Usmani appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), asserting that the authority to adjust status was not discretionary under the plain language of INA \u00a7 245\u00ae. The BIA affirmed, noting that the statutory language was discretionary. Usmani now petitions this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-11\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-12\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretation de novo, applying the two-step test articulated in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. See </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>445 F.3d 1311, 1318 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>tent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If the statute is ambiguous, we will defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation if it \u201cis based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2782.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">Under INA \u00a7 245(a), the status of certain aliens admitted or paroled into the United States <em>\u201cmay </em>be adjusted by the Attorney General, <em>in his discretion </em>and under such regulations as he may prescribe, to that of\u2019 a lawful permanent resident under certain circumstances. INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) (emphasis added). Several classes of aliens, however, are ineligible to adjust status. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 245(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of [\u00a7 245],\u201d however, an alien who would otherwise be ineligible for adjustment of status can establish eligibility to adjust his status upon payment of a fee, as long as (1) he is the beneficiary of any visa petition filed before April 30, 2001; (2) he is eligible for an immigrant visa at the time of the filing of the application; and (3) an immigrant visa is immediately available at the time of the filing of the application. INA \u00a7 245(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). Upon receipt of the alien\u2019s application and the required fee, \u201cthe Attorney General <em>may </em>adjust the status of the alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 245(i)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2) (emphasis added). Again, the parties concede that Usmani was statutorily eligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">Usmani argues that, under the plain language of INA \u00a7 245(i), the IJ did not have discretionary authority to deny his adjustment of status because, unlike \u00a7 245(a), \u00a7 245(i) does not refer to discretion, and, had Congress intended for the decision to be discretionary, it would have used the same \u201cin his discretion\u201d language as it did in subsection (a). Having considered the relevant statutory authority, we conclude that Usmani\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-8\">\u201cThe word \u2018may,\u2019 when used in a statute ... implies some degree of discretion.\u201d <em>DIRECTV, Inc. v. Brown, </em>371 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004) (citation and quotation omitted). However, this presumption \u201ccan be defeated by indications of legislative intent to the contrary or by obvious inferences from the structure and purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-9\">This court has never addressed the precise question at issue here: whether the Attorney General has discretion to deny a petition for adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i), once the petitioner is statutorily eligible for adjustment of status. In <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1363 (11th Cir.2006), this court noted that \u201c\u00a7 [245(i)] provides, just as \u00a7 [245(a)] does, that the Attorney General <em>may </em>approve an adjustment of status application only\u201d upon the completion of certain prerequisites. In that case, however, the alien was not statutorily eligible and had not applied for adjustment of status, but moved the IJ to continue removal proceedings pending approval of his application for a labor certificate. <em>Id. </em>at 1363. Thus, the issue of the IJ\u2019s discretion was not before the court. In <em>Merchant v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1375, 1379 n. 6 (11th Cir.2006), this court concluded that the IJ abused his discretion by denying a motion to continue the removal proceedings pending a determination on adjustment of status because Merchant was statutorily eligible for the adjustment. In dicta, this court further discussed the discretionary nature of the remedy provided by \u00a7 245(i), noting that although Merchant was \u201celigible for adjustment\u201d having satisfied all of the prerequisites, the ultimate decision to adjust Merchant\u2019s status remained with the Attorney General. <em>Id. </em>at 1379 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>In light of the statutory language, we conclude that the plain language of \u00a7 245(i) indicates Congressional intent that the IJ have discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough ... the mere use of \u2018may\u2019 is not necessarily conclusive of congressional intent to provide for a permissive or discretionary authority,\u201d <em>DIRECTV, Inc., </em>371 F.3d at 817, when Congress has intended mandatory action, it has used the word \u201cshall\u201d to convey that intent. <em>See, e.g., </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(b) (\u201cUpon the approval of an application for adjustment made under subsection (a) ..., the Attorney General shall record the alien\u2019s lawful admission ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">Usmani attempts to argue that Congressional intent was unclear, and he points to the language \u201c[notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of [\u00a7 245].\u201d This language does not, however, overcome the presumption of discretion associated with the use of the word \u201cmay.\u201d Congress\u2019s omission in \u00a7 245(i) of the phrase \u201cin his discretion\u201d does not establish that Congress intended adjustments under \u00a7 245(i) to be mandatory, and the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 245(i) as discretionary is a permissible, and logical, construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 245(i) creates discretionary authority for the Attorney General to deny adjustment of status. Therefore, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1175-8\">.On November 25, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (\u201cHSA\u201d), Pub.L. 107-296, Stat. 2125. The HSA created a new Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\u201d), abolished the INS, and transferred its functions to the new DHS. This case was initiated while the INS was still in existence. Therefore, this opinion refers to the INS rather than the DHS as the relevant agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1175-13\">. This was the second removal hearing.
