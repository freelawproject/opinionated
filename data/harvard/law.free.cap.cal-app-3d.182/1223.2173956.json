J.</author>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">Appellant Graciela Martinez and her five children filed a complaint for the wrongful death of Graciela Martinez\u2019s husband, Jorge Martinez, against defendants William Hagopian (respondent in this appeal), Artemio Solano, and Arcadio Solano. The complaint alleged three causes of action based on general negligence, premises liability, and assault and battery. An amendment to the complaint added a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress and a surviving cause of action for personal injuries on behalf of the decedent under Probate Code section 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">After unsuccessful cross-motions for summary judgment and a petition for extraordinary relief to this court by respondent, the trial court granted respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment pursuant to an alternative writ of mandate. Judgment was entered, and the complaint was dismissed as to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>Although appellant filed a notice of appeal from the minute order entered by the trial court, we have elected to construe the appeal to be from the judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1; <em>Helfer </em>v. <em>Hubert </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 22, 24-25 [24 Cal.Rptr. 900].)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Statement of the Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">The facts are taken from the deposition testimony of respondent, William Hagopian; respondent\u2019s foreman, Salvadore Lopez; appellant, Graciela Martinez; and appellant\u2019s brother-in-law, Salvador Martinez.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Respondent farms approximately 800 acres of vineyards as a partner in Hagopian Farms. During the harvest, which begins in September and continues through the middle of October, Hagopian Farms hires 80 to 100 farm laborers. Fifty to seventy-five percent of these laborers live in the three labor camps located on the farm. In housing the workers, respondent attempts to keep together friends, families, and persons speaking the same Spanish dialect. The housing facilities are provided rent free to the laborers so that the farm will have a work force available during the harvest.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">The laborers work five to six days a week from sunup until 2 or 3 p.m. The laborers are not permitted to drink alcoholic beverages during working hours. After the workday is over, however, laborers are free to do \u201canything at the time the law permit[s] them to do.\u201d Although the closest town is approximately 12 miles away and the grocery store is 4 miles away from the camps, Hagopian Farms does not supply any food or beverages to the laborers. There are no restrictions on visitors at the labor camps.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">On October 9, 1982, at approximately 9 p.m., appellant, her husband Jorge Martinez (hereafter decedent), their five children, and decedent\u2019s father arrived at Hagopian Farms to visit relatives who were living in one of the labor camps. Decedent\u2019s brother, Salvador Martinez, Salvador\u2019s wife, Raquel, and their children arrived at the same time in a separate car. The women and the children remained in the two cars, and the men got out to visit with their relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">Decedent had been drinking beer before he arrived at Hagopian Farms. Decedent did not bring any beer with him but continued to drink beer supplied by his relatives during the two hours they were at the labor camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">Sometime during that two hours, Raquel Martinez got out of her car and told her husband, Salvador, that someone was walking around her vehicle, that she was afraid, and that she wanted Salvador to keep her company. Salvador began arguing with this individual, and the man threatened Salvador <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>with a knife. Decedent came outside and apparently told this individual to \u201cleave that knife alone.\u201d Decedent struck this man, and when the man kept lunging at him, decedent pushed him through a plate glass window.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">During the fight, decedent was stabbed in the abdomen. None of the witnesses who testified at deposition saw the person who stabbed decedent. However, both Salvador Martinez and Salvadore Lopez believed that it was one of the Solano brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The Solano brothers were working for Hagopian Farms at this time. They had been coming to the farm at harvest for approximately three years and had never caused any problems. Artemio Solano was arrested and released on his own recognizance. Arcadio Solano was never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">\n<em>The nonapplicability of respondeat superior.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in granting respondent\u2019s summary judgment motion on the issue of respondeat superior.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, we must decide if the deposition testimony, when liberally construed as to appellant\u2019s position, fails to present a triable issue of fact on the question of respondeat superior and is sufficient to sustain a judgment in respondent\u2019s favor. <em>(Stationers Corp. </em>v. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 412, 417 [42 Cal.Rptr. 449, 398 P.2d 785].)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">Under the respondeat superior doctrine, an employer\u2019s liability extends to torts of an employee committed within the scope of his employment. <em>(Munyon </em>v. <em>Ole\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 697, 701 [186 Cal.Rptr. 424].) This includes willful and malicious torts as well as negligence. <em>(Carr </em>v. <em>Wm. C. Crowell Co. </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 652 [171 P.2d 5].) Nevertheless, if an employee inflicts an injury out of personal malice, not engendered by the employment, the employer is not liable. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 656.)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">The justification for respondeat superior is \u201ca rule of policy, a deliberate allocation of a risk.\u201d The employer is liable for injuries caused by risks inherent in or created by the enterprise because he, rather than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>innocent injured party, is best able to absorb and spread the risk through prices, rates, or liability insurance. <em>(Hinman </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Co. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 956, 959-960 [88 Cal.Rptr. 188, 471 P.2d 988].) However, respondeat superior is not merely a justification for reaching a \u201cdeep pocket\u201d or based only upon an \u201celaborate economic theory regarding optimal resource allocation. It is grounded upon \u2018a deeply rooted sentiment that a business enterprise cannot justly disclaim responsibility for accidents which may fairly be said to be characteristic of its activities. \u2019 [Citations. ] \u201d <em>(Rodgers </em>v. <em>Kemper Constr. Co. </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 608, 618 [124 Cal.Rptr. 143].)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">The determination as to whether an employee committed a tort during the course of his employment turns on whether \u201c1) the act performed was either required or \u2018incident to his duties\u2019 [citation], or 2) the employee\u2019s misconduct could be reasonably foreseen by the employer in any event [citations].\u201d <em>(Clark Equipment Co. </em>v. <em>Wheat </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 503, 520 [154 Cal.Rptr. 874].) The employee\u2019s actions need only fall within the range of actions covered by either part of this two-pronged test for the employer to be held liable. <em>(Alma W. </em>v. <em>Oakland Unified School Dist. </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 133, 139 [176 Cal.Rptr. 287].)  Here, appellant contends the employee\u2019s actions were foreseeable and thus fall within the second prong of this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\"><em>Rodgers </em>v. <em>Kemper Constr. Co., supra, </em>sets forth a test for application of this foreseeability concept: \u201cOne way to determine whether a risk is inherent in, or created by, an enterprise is to ask whether the actual occurrence was a generally foreseeable consequence of the activity. However, \u2018foreseeability\u2019 in this context must be distinguished from \u2018foreseeability\u2019 as a test for negligence. In the latter sense \u2018foreseeable\u2019 means a level of probability which would lead a prudent person to take effective precautions whereas \u2018foreseeability\u2019 as a test for <em>respondeat superior </em>merely means that in the context of the particular enterprise an employee\u2019s conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer\u2019s business. [Citations.] In other words, where the question is one of vicarious liability, the inquiry should be whether the risk was one \u2018that may fairly be regarded as typical of or broadly incidental\u2019 to the enterprise undertaken by the employer. [Citation.]\u201d (50 Cal.App.3d at pp. 618-619, quoting from 2 Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts, p. 1376.)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Appellant relies primarily on <em>Rodgers </em>v. <em>Kemper Constr. Co. </em>to support her position that the assault was foreseeable within the respondeat superior meaning of foreseeability. In <em>Rodgers, </em>the court concluded there was substantial evidence in support of holding defendant, a subcontractor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>liable vicariously where two of defendant\u2019s employees, who had remained on the jobsite drinking beer after their shift ended, assaulted and injured plaintiffs, employees of the general contractor, when one of the plaintiffs refused to give defendant\u2019s employees a ride on a bulldozer. The court found that the fact that the assault occurred after hours did not relieve defendant of liability since the employees had the implied or express permission of defendant to engage in the after-hours social activity. Further, the employees\u2019 remaining on the jobsite was \u201cconceivably\u201d of some benefit to defendant if additional help was needed. The court also found there was no evidence of personal malice unrelated to the employment. Rather, <em>the dispute </em>leading to the assault <em>was an outgrowth of the employment. </em>The quarrel on the jobsite arose over the rights and duties of defendant\u2019s off-duty employees and might normally be expected to occur during the course of a major construction job. Thus, it could rationally be determined that the employees\u2019 conduct was not so \u201cunusual or startling\u201d that it would be unfair to include the loss resulting from it among the other costs of the employer\u2019s business. <em>(Rodgers </em>v. <em>Kemper Constr. Co., supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d 608, 618-619.)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Appellant relies on the following similarities between this case and <em>Rodgers:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-6\">1. Respondent\u2019s employees were residing on the premises for the benefit and convenience of respondent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-7\">2. After-hours socializing and drinking occurred <em>on </em>the premises with either the express or implied permission of respondent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-8\">3. The injury to decedent was the result of the interaction between respondent\u2019s employees and visitors to the ranch who were permitted to visit by respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">Construing the evidence liberally in favor of appellant and assuming that the above facts are true, appellant\u2019s analogy to <em>Rodgers </em>misses a crucial element. The dispute leading to the assault was not an outgrowth of the employment relationship. Before liability attaches, there must be <em>a </em>nexus between the employment and the activity which results in an injury that is foreseeable. <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Trojan Fireworks Co. </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 157 [174 Cal.Rptr. 452].) The test is not whether it is foreseeable that employees might act in such a way as to give rise to civil liability but rather, whether the employee\u2019s act is foreseeable <em>in light of the duties the employee is hired to perform. (Alma W. </em>v. <em>Oakland Unified School Dist., supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d 133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>This assault arose out of an argument between the visitors and the workers concerning one worker\u2019s treatment of a visitor\u2019s wife. The dispute had no connection with any aspect of harvesting grapes. The fact that both the victim and his assailant had been drinking, that such drinking is common among farmworkers (as well as other persons) during their after-hours social activities, and that drinking often leads to quarrels and violence given the frailty of human nature, does not provide a sufficient link to the worker\u2019s employment to impose vicarious liability on the employer. To hold otherwise would be to essentially impose a theory of strict liability on the employer for all employee torts during after-hours social activities on the employer\u2019s premises, a result not permitted under settled law. Thus, we conclude that the instant assault cannot \u201cfairly be regarded as typical of or broadly incidental to\u201d the farming activities here involved. (2 Harper &amp; James, The Law of Torts, p. 1376.)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Martin, J., and Best, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-12\"> Since appellant\u2019s opening brief does not challenge the summary judgment on the causes of action based on theories other than respondeat superior, we do not treat those issues raised for the first time in appellant\u2019s reply brief\u2014appellant not showing good reason for failure to raise them before.
