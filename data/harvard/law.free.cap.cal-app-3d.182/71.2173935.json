J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF4\">For the second time we have granted a writ of review to consider the propriety of an order issued by the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) compelling the employer, the University of California (University,) to grant an employee organization access to the University\u2019s internal mail service.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">In <em>Regents of University of California </em>v. <em>Public Employment Relations Board </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 1037 [189 Cal.Rptr. 298], we set forth the salient facts in this dispute at pages 1039 and 1040 and reiterate them here for convenience: \u201cIn 1979, William H. Wilson and Local 371 of the Amer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees filed an unfair labor practice charge against the University before the PERB asserting that the University\u2019s refusal to permit the union to distribute organizational literature to the University\u2019s custodial employees through the intercampus mail system violated the rights guaranteed to employee organizations and employees under the provisions of the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA), reproduced in relevant part in the margin.<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u201cThe charge arose against the following background: The University maintains two operational units for its mail system at Berkeley. Mail collection and delivery for the Berkeley campus, nearby University state-wide offices and intercampus mail for the northern California campuses and laboratories are handled by the Harmon Gym facility at Berkeley. There, the outgoing mail is separated into three groups: (1) prestamped mail; (2) internal University mail for northern California; and (3) other mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u201cThe prestamped mail is delivered immediately to the United States Postal Service (U.S.P.S.) without further handling by the University. Internal University mail is monitored to assure that only official business mail is involved. This nonposted mail is then sorted and delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u201cOther mail is then taken to a second unit, denoted \u20182000 Carleton.\u2019 These pieces are rated, affixed with United States postage and delivered to the U.S.P.S. Senders are recharged by office or department at regular postage rates plus 25 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u201cIncoming mail to the University from the U.S.P.S. is handled in one of two ways: mail addressed to any of some 50 sites on the Berkeley campus is delivered to the site by the U.S.P.S.; other United States mail, not so addressed, is delivered to Harmon Gym where delivery is completed by University employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201cIn summary, the only mail accepted for delivery within the University\u2019s internal mail system is either posted mail which comes to Harmon Gym from the U.S.P.S. or official University business mail. The University has adopted regulations which deny use of its internal mail system to non-University organizations or for political, commercial or social purposes. Employee organizations are expressly prohibited from using the internal mail service. Pursuant to these regulations, the University has refused to deliver mail tendered by the union relating to its organizational activities unless the mail is stamped and sent through the U.S.P.S. It is that refusal which forms the basis of the union\u2019s unfair practice charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Based on a solicited advisory opinion from the U.S.P.S., the University took the position that carriage by the University in its internal mail distribution system of the letters of a union seeking to represent the University\u2019s custodial employees, without payment of postage, is prohibited by the Private Express Statutes. (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1693-1699, 1724; 39 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-606.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">After an appropriate hearing and administrative appeal the PERB ordered the University to allow free access to the intercampus mail system. Thereafter, we granted University\u2019s petition for a writ of review. Upon considering the University\u2019s challenge to the PERB order, we concluded that certain preliminary factual issues needed to be determined before a ruling on the order could be made. Accordingly, we remanded the matter for a determination whether the University\u2019s regulations denying union access to the internal mail system were reasonable in light of all the surrounding circumstances, including federal postal requirements. In reaching its determination, we suggested that the PERB consider (1) the University\u2019s distribution of literature through the internal mail system to disseminate an employee newsletter expressing management\u2019s views on labor-management issues; (2) the University\u2019s distribution of literature through the internal mail system soliciting charitable contributions deemed official business under the auspices of the chancellor; (3) the union\u2019s access to other means of communicating with custodial employees; and (4) the burden which would be placed on the University\u2019s internal mail system if access were provided. Most importantly, we stated that the PERB was free to consult federal law in order to determine whether the state statute may be enforced without offending federal postal regulations. <em>(Regents of University of California </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Public Employment Relations Bd., supra, </em>139 Cal.App.3d at p. 1042 and fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">After a subsequent evidentiary hearing and administrative appeal, the PERB found that: (1) articles and newsletters disseminated to employees by the University via the University mail system do include management positions on issues pertinent to employer-employee relations; (2) on at least three occasions the University has allowed use of the internal mail system by nonemployee organizations; (3) the union is not required to use an alternative means of communicating with employees where, as here, the University has made no showing that permitting employee organizations to have access to the internal mail system will disrupt the functioning of the University (see Richmond Unified School District (1979) 3 PERC p. 10105) and (4) there was no convincing evidence that permitting an employee organization to have access to the internal mail system would create any additional financial burden on the University. Regarding the crucial issue concerning a potential conflict with U.S. postal regulations, the PERB determined that the University\u2019s delivery of union communications falls within two \u201cexceptions\u201d and one \u201csuspension\u201d established by 18 United States Code sections 1694<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 1696<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 39 Code of Federal Regulations section 320.4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the PERB again found that the University\u2019s regulation prohibiting employee organization access to its internal mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>system is unreasonable within the meaning of Government Code section 3568 and ordered that the University grant the union access to the University\u2019s internal mail service.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Preliminarily, we note that under Government Code section 3564, subdivision (c) the \u201cfindings of the board with respect to questions of fact, including ultimate facts, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, are conclusive.\u201d In addition, the rule is that \u201c[u]nder established principles, PERB\u2019s construction is to be regarded with deference by a court performing the judicial functions of statutory construction, and will generally be followed unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>(San Mateo City School Dist. </em>v. <em>Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 850, 856 [191 Cal.Rptr. 800, 663 P.2d 523]; <em>Regents of the University of California </em>v. <em>Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 648, 653 [223 Cal.Rptr. 127].)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">We need not address each of the three regulations upon which the PERB based its order.  For the reasons stated below we are satisfied that the union\u2019s use of the University\u2019s internal mail system falls within the so-called \u201cletters-of-the-carrier\u201d exception as set forth in 18 United States Code section 1694 and 39 Code of Federal Regulations section 310.3(b), and that no conflict exists between the HEERA and federal postal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">As the PERB recognized, Article I, section 8, clause 7 of the United States Constitution authorizes Congress to establish \u201cpost offices and post roads.\u201d This provision of the Constitution has traditionally been construed as granting the federal government a monopoly over the delivery of mail. <em>(Associated Third Class Mail Users </em>v. <em>U.S. Postal Serv. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1979) 600 F.2d 824; <em>National Ass\u2019n of Letter Car. </em>v. <em>Independent Postal Sys. </em>(10th Cir. 1972) 470 F.2d 265; <em>Ex Parte Jackson </em>(1878) 96 U.S. 727 [24 L.Ed. 877].) The Private Express Statutes (39 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-606; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1693-1699, 1724) generally prohibit the delivery of letters along post routes by anyone other than the U.S.P.S., but establish certain statutory exceptions to the U.S.P.S.\u2019s monopoly over the delivery of letters. Pursuant to these statutes, theU.S.P.S. has developed rules permitting private carriage of letters by individuals and entities. (39 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 310, 320.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">The letters-of-the-carrier exception to the general prohibition regarding delivery of mail by non-U.S.P.S. persons is contained in 18 United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>States Code section 1694.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> U.S.P.S.\u2019s implementing regulation of the letters-of-the-carrier exception, 39 Code of Federal Regulations section 310.3(b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, permits a person or entity to deliver its own letters to another address or to pick up letters addressed to ;it from another person or entity. Where the carrier is an institution rather than an individual, letters addressed to its employees must concern the \u201ccurrent business\u201d of that institution; the exception does not permit an employer to carry personal letters addressed to its employees. Thus, there are two prerequisites for application of the letters-of-the-carrier exception: (1) the letter must be addressed to or sent from an individual in his or her capacity as an employee of the institution; and (2) the content of the letter must relate to the \u201ccurrent business\u201d of the institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Clearly, union letters to the University\u2019s custodial employees meet the first requirement. In its advisory letter to the University, theU.S.P.S. stated: \u201cThe [ljetters of the carrier exception permits an employer to deliver his own letters on his own current business by means of his own employees. Under this exception, an employee of the University who meets the qualifications set out in \u00a7 310.3(b)(2) may carry without payment of postage letters sent by <em>or addressed to members of the staff or </em>faculty in their official capacity as representatives of the employer University. It is this exception which permits the University\u2019s current use of an internal distribution system for mail pertaining to its business which is sent to and from locations within the University.\u201d (Italics supplied.) The more difficult question is whether the communications from th$ union to University employees relates to the current business of the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>In enacting the HEERA, the California Legislature explicitly stated its findings and intent. Government Code section 3560, subdivision (a) expresses the finding that \u201c[t]he people of the State of California have a fundamental interest in the development of harmonious and cooperative labor relations between the public institutions of higher education and their employees. \u2019 \u2019 Thereafter, subdivision (d) of the same section states that \u2018 [t]he people and the aforementioned higher education employers each have a fundamental interest in the preservation and promotion of the responsibilities granted by the people of the State of California. Harmonious relations between each higher education employer and its employees are necessary to that endeavor.\u201d Finally, subdivision (e) of the statute declares: \u201cIt is the purpose of this chapter to provide the means by which relations between each higher education employer and its employees may assure that the responsibilities and authorities granted to the separate institutions under the Constitution and by statute are carried out in an atmosphere which permits the fullest participation by employees in the determination of conditions of employment which affect them. It is the intent of this chapter to accomplish this purpose by providing a uniform basis for recognizing the right of the employees of these systems to full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing for the purpose of representation in their employment relationships with their employers and to select one of such organizations as their exclusive representative for the purpose of meeting and conferring.\u201d Unmistakably, the intent of the statute is to make collective bargaining a part of the \u201ccurrent business\u201d of the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Although no case has so construed the intent of Government Code section 3560, we find strong support for our view from the United States Supreme Court. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad </em>(1915) 235 U.S. 513 [59 L.Ed. 335, 35 S.Ct. 193], the high court held that the letters-of-the-carrier exception applied to the carriage of letters for a telegraph company by a railroad pursuant to an agreement between the companies. Under the agreement the railroad company leased to the telegraph company the right to operate telegraph lines which previously had been operated by the railroad. The railroad was given 25 percent of the cash receipts and joint supervision and control of a superintendent of telegraph who was paid by both companies. While the U.S.P.S. maintains in its amicus brief that the <em>Erie </em>decision was based on the assumption that the telegraph operations was a joint enterprise, the language of the opinion indicates otherwise! In explaining its decision, the court stated, \u201c[W]hile the companies in many respects are independent, they are also, in some respects, at least, dependent .... [W]hile it may be said that there is a railroad business in which the telegraph company has no concern, that is, business distinctly railroad, yet it is also so far concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>with the telegraph business as to make its efficient and successful operation of interest to it.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 520 [59 L.Ed. at p. 341].) Given the intent expressed in Government Code section 3560, we find the above-quoted reasoning equally applicable to the case at bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">More recently, in <em>Perry Ed. Assn. </em>v. <em>Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn. </em>(1983) 460 U.S. 37 [74 L.Ed.2d 794, 103 S.Ct. 948], the United States Supreme Court had occasion to consider a question concerning union access to the internal mail system of the Perry Township schools. In that case, a collective-bargaining agreement with the board of education provided that the Perry Education Association, but no other union, would have access to the inter-school mail system. The issue presented to the Supreme Court was whether the denial of similar access to a rival teacher union violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Although the court was not concerned with the same issue as is presently before this court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, it expressed the following pertinent view on labor-management relations: \u201cThe very concept of the labor-management relationship requires that the representative union be free to express its independent view on matters within the scope of its representational duties. The lack of an employer endorsement does not mean that the communications do not pertain to the \u2018official business\u2019 of the organization.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 51, fn. 10 [74 L.Ed.2d at p. 808].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We discern no meaningful distinction between the United States Supreme Court\u2019s designation of \u201cofficial business\u201d and the postal statutes\u2019 designation of \u201ccurrent business\u201d of an organization. The fact that the University is free to disseminate its own views on labor-management relations through internal carriage of the University\u2019s employee newspaper would appear to mandate equal access to employees by an employee organization in an arguably adversarial position. Accordingly, we find that the union\u2019s use of the University\u2019s internal mail system to communicate with University employees falls within the letters-of-the-carrier exception and there is no conflict with federal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Although the U.S.P.S. presumably will sustain a slight loss of mail revenue as a consequence, we do not believe, as the University asserted at oral argument, that our determination will somehow expose the University\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>internal mail system to a deluge of other communications possessing but a peripheral relationship to University business.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n                   We only hold that where, as here, the state Legislature has clearly emphasized the public interest in developing harmonious labor relations between the University and its employees, the internal mail system may be used by the interested parties for purposes of relevant communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The PERB order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Newsom, J., and Holmdahl, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Petitioner\u2019s application for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 10, 1986.
