We conclude that under the facts of this case, the search was lawful and the trial court correctly refused to suppress evidence thereby obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Following the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress, defendant Kenneth Lindsey pleaded no contest to the felony offense of receiving stolen property, to wit, a 1977 BMW automobile. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496.) Pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (m), he brought this appeal to test that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>The People\u2019s one witness at the hearing was Officer Knebel, then auto theft investigator for the Pasadena Police Department. Knebel testified that on July 21, 1982, he went armed with a warrant to defendant\u2019s home and arrested him for receiving a stolen Chevrolet automobile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While there, Knebel saw a BMW parked in defendant\u2019s driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">As of that date, Knebel had received information from a reliable informant which led him to believe that the BMW also was a stolen car. Specifically, Knebel was advised that defendant had purchased the car from one \u201cShakey,\u201d known to Knebel as the leader of an auto theft ring which specialized in Cadillacs, Mercedes-Benzes and BMW\u2019s. The ring operated by stealing the vehicle identification number (VIN) from a wrecked car and placing it on a stolen car of the same make and model. They would then inform the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) that the car had been restored and would register it in the name of a famous person, such as Marcus Allen or Jackie Robinson. Knebel knew that, according to DMV records, the BMW was a restored wreck registered to one \u201cJack Anderson\u201d at defendant\u2019s business address. He also knew that defendant had purchased other cars from \u201cShakey,\u201d all of which proved to be stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">After taking defendant into custody on the other charge, Knebel learned from defendant\u2019s wife that the BMW would be parked later that day at the bank where her daughter worked. When Knebel and his partner found the locked car outside of the bank, they looked through the window at the VIN plate on the steering column. The plate was scratched and bent in a manner inconsistent with factory installation. The rivets holding the plate were also damaged. However, neither the VIN nor the license plate number came up as stolen over the police radio.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">After unsuccessfully attempting to enter the car, Knebel went into the bank and asked defendant\u2019s daughter for the keys. She relinquished them after Knebel told her that he had received her father\u2019s permission to search the car. The trial court later determined that defendant had not consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">When Knebel opened the car, he first looked on the door jamb for the federal standard sticker, and noticed that some of the digits had been \u2018 \u2018 gouged out.\u201d He then looked under the hood and discovered that the secondary VIN also had been altered. Finally, Knebel discovered that the \u201csecret\u201d number located in the engine area was different from the number on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>steering column. The secret number belonged to a car that had been reported stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">At the hearing, defendant argued that this information should be suppressed because Knebel lacked probable cause to make a warrantless search. The People argued that Vehicle Code section 2805 authorized Knebel to check the secondary identification numbers because he had reason to believe the car was stolen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">After examining photographs of the VIN plate on the steering column, the trial court noted that something indeed appeared to be \u201cwrong\u201d with it. The court went on to find that Knebel\u2019s testimony was credible, and that his \u201cstrong suspicion\u201d that the car was stolen satisfied Vehicle Code section 2805 <em>and </em>relevant case law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Discussion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">We first address the issue of defendant\u2019s standing to seek suppression of evidence obtained from the BMW. Citing <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1978) 439 U.S. 128 [58 L.Ed.2d 387, 99 S.Ct. 421], the People argue that defendant can only challenge a violation of his own reasonable expectation of privacy, and that no such expectation exists in a stolen car. Whatever the merits of this claim, it need not be addressed here. Under federal law, the prosecution \u201close[s] its right\u201d to raise this \u201cfactual\u201d issue on appeal if it has failed to do so \u201cin a timely fashion during the litigation.\u201d <em>(Steagald </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 204, 209 [68 L.Ed.2d 38, 44, 101 S.Ct. 1642].) Here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>People failed to raise this issue below and cannot do so for the first time in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">We next consider defendant\u2019s one contention on appeal, which concerns the proper standard for gauging the reasonableness of Officer Knebel\u2019s conduct. Defendant argues that the trial court erred in requiring a showing of less than probable cause to justify a warrantless inspection under Vehicle Code section 2805. He insists that all evidence obtained from the BMW must therefore be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">We conclude that the legality of the officer\u2019s conduct can be determined without resort to Vehicle Code section 2805.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   The VIN plate in plain view, and the information obtained from the reliable informant, furnished probable cause to believe the BMW was stolen. This belief made the search for the secondary identification numbers permissible under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">We begin by examining the trial court\u2019s ruling in light of the relevant standard of review. The court concluded that Officer Knebel\u2019s \u201cstrong suspicion\u201d that the BMW was stolen satisfied United States Supreme Court cases requiring probable cause to make a warrantless auto search. We are obligated to review this issue de novo. Although the trial court\u2019s factual findings cannot be disturbed if supported by substantial evidence, we must exercise our independent judgment as to whether, on the facts found, the search was constitutionally reasonable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Loewen </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 117, 123 [196 Cal.Rptr. 846, 672 P.2d 436].)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">The recent case of <em>New York </em>v. <em>Class </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 106 [89 L.Ed.2d 81, 106 S.Ct. 960] provides the relevant guidelines. There, police officers stopped defendant\u2019s car after observing it commit two traffic violations. Defendant stepped out of the car, giving one officer a registration certificate and proof of insurance but stating that he had no driver\u2019s license. The other officer opened the door of the car to look for the VIN, which is located on the left door jamb in cars manufactured before 1969. Not finding it there, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>the officer reached into the car to move some papers obscuring the area of the dashboard where the VIN is located in post-1969 models. In so doing, the officer saw part of a gun protruding from underneath the driver\u2019s seat. The officer seized the gun and arrested defendant, who later moved to suppress the gun as evidence in his prosecution for illegal possession of a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Additional relevant facts were that although the officers lawfully stopped defendant\u2019s car, they had no reason to suspect that the car was stolen, that it contained contraband, or that defendant had committed any offense other than the traffic infractions. Nonetheless, the United States Supreme Court upheld the seizure of the gun as constitutional under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In a two-step analysis, the court first held that defendant had \u201cno reasonable expectation of privacy in the VIN,\u201d even though it was temporarily obscured from view. <em>(New York </em>v. <em>Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. at p. \u2014 [89 L. Ed. 2d at p. 90].) As part of the web of pervasive governmental regulation of the automobile, the VIN is required by federal law to be placed in plain view of someone standing outside of the car. Consequently, \u201c[a] motorist must surely expect that such regulation will on occasion require the State to determine the VIN of his or her vehicle, and the individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy in the VIN is thereby diminished.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The court next held, however, that an individual does have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the car\u2019s interior. The officer\u2019s act of reaching into the car to move the papers was therefore a warrantless search that required probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Three factors supplied that requirement. First, concern for officer safety at a traffic stop justified the officer reaching into the car instead of having defendant move the papers. Second, the intrusion was minimal. The officer merely checked the two locations where the VIN was required to be located: \u2018 \u2018 The officer did not root about the interior. . . before proceeding to examine the VIN. He did not reach into any compartments or open any containers. He did not even intrude into the interior at all until after he had checked the doorjamb for the VIN. When he did intrude, the officer simply reached directly for the unprotected space where the VIN was located to move the offending papers.\u201d <em>(New York v. Class, supra, </em>475 U.S. at p. \u2014[89 L.Ed.2d at p. 93].) Finally, the traffic violations provided probable cause to make this minimally intrusive search.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">In light of these principles, Knebel\u2019s act of peering through the BMW windshield to see the VIN in plain view on the steering column was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>constitutionally permissible. Although no traffic violation initiated this act, Knebel had a right to be where he was when it occurred. The car was located in a public parking lot and Knebel was standing outside of the car. Thus, defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the information obtained during this initial inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">This information, plus the facts already known to Knebel, supplied the probable cause needed to search for the secondary identification numbers. As indicated by both the evidence and the trial court\u2019s findings, the VIN plate and the rivets attaching it were damaged. This fact alone would lead a reasonable person to believe that the plate might have been tampered with in an effort to disguise a stolen vehicle: \u201cEven an appellate judge knows that manufacturer\u2019s identification numbers are required on automobiles (see Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 10750, 10751) for the purpose of aiding identification and deterring thefts and frauds. It would be exceedingly rare for a law-abiding citizen to have any occasion to remove the VIN plate from a motor vehicle. The discovery that this plate had been temporarily reattached to [the car] by nonstandard rivets quite reasonably supported [the officer\u2019s] \u2018strong suspicion\u2019 that [defendant] was claiming ownership of a stolen vehicle.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burnett, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.3d 795, 799.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Moreover, the fact that the number on the BMW\u2019s steering column did not match that of a stolen car is consistent with the information Knebel had obtained from a reliable informant. Knebel had been informed before entering the car that defendant had purchased it from an auto theft ring that operated by placing VIN plates from wrecked cars in stolen cars. He also knew that the car was registered as a restored wreck in DMV records.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">These facts led Knebel to reasonably believe that the BMW was stolen, and justified the ensuing minimal intrusion. Specifically, the search was focused on the limited objective of locating the secondary numbers, and was no more intrusive than necessary to fulfill that objective. Although acting upon what was later determined to be a misstatement of fact by Knebel, defendant\u2019s daughter voluntarily gave him the car keys.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Once inside, Knebel limited his search to the places on the door jamb and under the hood where the secondary numbers most likely would be located. No search was made of the car\u2019s interior or of any compartment or container therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">In sum, the search of the BMW was constitutionally permissible and evidence thereby obtained was properly deemed admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AGn\">Feinerman, P.

As noted by the parties, federal search and seizure law therefore applies. <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 886-887 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b679-10\"> VehicIe Code section 2805 has been construed as authorizing warrantless searches for a car\u2019s title and registration if the inspection is \u201cmade under reasonable circumstances, within constitutional limitations.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burnett </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 795, 800 [165 Cal.Rptr. 781], citing <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 361, 367 [142 Cal.Rptr. 299].) The validity of official conduct under the statute depends upon the unique facts of each case.
