Resources Code, \u00a7 30000 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposes mandatory duties upon defendant and that defendant breached such duties by (1) failing to adopt a policy of denying permits for septic tank system installation, expansion and repair at Big Rock Mesa; (2) failing to require Los Angeles County to carry out duties under the coastal act and other duties whereby the county would require the abolition of the septic tank system and installation of a sewer system or establish a drainage district and (3) failing to require Los Angeles County to prepare a local coastal program dealing with the above problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Plaintiffs further contend that administrative mandamus was inappropriate since there was no proceeding, decision or action to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The 23 plaintiffs in this action are homeowners at Big Rock Mesa in Malibu, California. Their properties are within the coastal zone area as defined by the California Coastal Act of 1976 (\u00a7 30103) and the prior California Coastal Zone Conservation Act of 1972 (formerly \u00a7 27100). They seek to hold the Commission and others liable for damages suffered to their properties resulting from the Big Rock landslide which became manifest in the summer of 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">On October 12, 1984, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint against the Commission for \u201cfailure to discharge mandatory dut[ies].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that complaint plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that \u201c[s]ince at least January 1, 1977, defendant Commission had the \u2018primary responsibility for the implementation\u2019 of the California Coastal Act of 1976 (Cal. Pub. Res. Code \u00a7\u00a7 30000 et seq.) and has been \u2018designated as the state coastal zone planning and management agency for any and all purposes\u2019 (Pub. Resource Code \u00a7 30330). It has thus been directed to \u2018protect, maintain, and, where feasible, enhance and restore the over-all quality\u2019 of Big Rock Mesa which lies within the Coastal Zone. (\u00a7 30001.5.) It has been directed to assure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>that new development there shall minimize risks to life and property in view of the high geologic hazard and not create or contribute significantly to geologic instability [\u00a7 30253, subds. (1), (2)] and it has adopted and enforced detailed Statewide and Regional Interpretive Guidelines in compliance with said duty. All local public agencies, including Los Angeles County, are required to comply with the provisions of the Act (\u00a7\u00a7 30003, 30004), and the Commission is authorized to bring appropriate legal actions necessary to achieve the Act\u2019s goals. (\u00a7 30334.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">That \u201c[s]ince January 1,1973, defendant Commission and its predecessor . . . have known\u201d that the drainage systems in the Big Rock area, including the private sewage disposal systems of individual property owners, were inadequate in light of the topographical and geological features and conditions of that area and as a result of such inadequate systems, \u201cthe earth underlying the Big Rock became increasingly saturated with water, the ground water levels increased, and underlying clays, strata, and slip planes became lubricated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Plaintiffs further alleged that defendant Commission breached its mandatory duties by doing nothing and that such inaction directly and proximately caused their damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">On February 27, 1985, defendant\u2019s demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 SAC was sustained with 20 days leave to amend on the first and third grounds stated in the demurrer \u201cas per the points and authorities supporting same.\u201d These grounds were that (1) defendant was immune from liability under Government Code sections 818.2, 818.4 and 818.6<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the seventh cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>action of the SAC failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and failed to state facts sufficient to overcome the Commission\u2019s immunity. In its minute order the trial court took particular pains to point out to plaintiffs what was required to be added in the pleading of any further amended complaint. \u201cIn particular [, the court pointed out, the new pleading should address the question of] what provision or provisions of the Coastal Acts (either 1972 or 1976) impose \u2018mandatory duties\u2019 to protect plaintiffs from the type of injury alleged in the Second Amended Complaint?\u201d and \u201c[w]hat act or acts did the Defendant, Coastal Commission, perform or fail to perform which was not in the Commission\u2019s discretion?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Plaintiffs elected not to amend their complaint and therefore their action against defendant was ordered dismissed on June 25, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">\u201cSince plaintiff[s] declined to amend [their] complaint, we do not consider the possibility that any defects in it could be cured by amendment, but presume that the pleader has stated his case as strongly as it can be stated in his favor. <em>(Royal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mazzei, </em>(1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 549, 555 [123 P.2d 586].)  While the complaint should be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 452), that rule \u2018does not, however, permit the insertion, by construction, of averments which are neither directly made nor within the fair import of those which are set forth. On the contrary, facts necessary to a cause of action but not alleged must be taken as having no existence.\u2019 (21 Cal.Jur. 54; <em>Feldesman </em>v. <em>McGovern </em>(1941) 44 Cal.App.2d 566, 571 [112 P.2d 645]; <em>Estrinv. Superior Court, </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 670, 677 [96 P.2d 340].)\u201d <em>(Frace </em>v. <em>Long Beach etc. Sch. Dist. </em>(1943) 58 Cal.App.2d 566, 568 [137 P.2d 60].)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Under the government tort liability act, there is no common law liability of a public entity, liability is wholly statutory. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 815 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Government Code section 815.6 relied on by plaintiffs to impose liability on defendant contains a three-pronged test for determining whether liability may be imposed on a public entity: an enactment must impose a mandatory, not discretionary, duty; the enactment must intend to protect against the kind of risk of injury suffered by the party asserting the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>as a basis for liability; and breach of mandatory duty must be a proximate cause of the injury suffered. <em>(State of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 848 [197 Cal.Rptr. 914].) The liability declared to be imposed by this section is only for a particular kind of harm caused by the failure to perform the mandatory duty, and that rule is a more narrow rule of liability than the general consideration of foreseeability. <em>(Shelton </em>v. <em>City of Westminster </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 610, 623 [188 Cal.Rptr. 205].)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><em>In Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 162-163 [188 Cal.Rptr. 104, 655 P.2d 306], Justice Mosk recited the statutory background of the 1976 Coastal Act as follows: \u201cIn recent decades, the People of California have become painfully aware of the deterioration in the quality and availability of recreational opportunities along the California coastline due to the combined factors of an increasing demand for its use and the simultaneous decreasing supply of accessible land in the coastal zone. Growing public consciousness of the finite quantity and fragile nature of the coastal environment led to the 1972 passage of Proposition 20, an initiative measure entitled the California Coastal Zone Conservation Act (the 1972 Coastal Act). (Former Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 27000-27650.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">\u201cThe 1972 Coastal Act created the California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission and directed it to oversee the orderly process of planning for the future development of the California coastline. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">\u201cOne of the stated purposes of the 1972 Coastal Act was to increase public access to the coast. The 1972 Coastal Act was an interim measure, destined by its own terms to expire at the beginning of 1977. It authorized the interim coastal commission to prepare a study summarizing the progress of planning in the coastal zone and delineating goals and recommendations for the future of California\u2019s shoreline for the guidance of the Legislature. The study, labeled the California Coastal Plan, was completed in December 1975 and submitted to the Legislature, which used it as a guide when drafting the California Coastal Act of 1976 (the Coastal Act). (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 30000 et seq.) The Coastal Act created the California Coastal Commission (the Commission) to succeed the California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Plaintiffs contend that defendant Commission breached mandatory duties under sections 30001, 30001.5, 30004, and 30253, and Government Code section 815.6 by (1) failing to adopt a policy of denying permits for septic tank system installation, expansion and repair at Big Rock Mesa; (2) failing to require Los Angeles County to carry out duties under the coastal act and other duties whereby the county would require the abolition of the septic tank system and installation of a sewer system or establish a drainage district; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>and (3) failing to require Los Angeles County to prepare a local coastal program dealing with the above problem.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 contention lacks merit. The sections plaintiffs rely on do not impose mandatory duties upon the Commission. They are recitations of legislative goals and policies. (See <em>City of Chula Vista </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 472, 480 [183 Cal.Rptr. 909).)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The responsibility for implementing the act\u2019s policies to achieve its stated goals is vested in the Commission. (\u00a7 30330.) This responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>requires the Commission to exercise considerable judgment. For example, in a situation where two or more policies conflict, the Commission must resolve the conflict \u201cin a manner which on balance is the most protective of significant coastal resources.\u201d (\u00a7 30007.5.) Since the exercise of the Commission\u2019s judgment is a discretionary act as opposed to a mandatory one (see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1968) 69 Cal. 2d 782, 788-794 [73 Cal.Rptr. 240, 447 P.2d 352]), it cannot be held liable for failing to exercise that judgment in the manner alleged by plaintiffs. Government Code sections 818.2 and 818.4 preclude such liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The Commission Cannot Be Held Liable for Its Alleged Failure to Adopt a Policy of Denying Permits for Septic Tank Installation, Expansion and Repair</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The Commission is authorized to determine whether or not to issue a permit for septic tank installation, expansion and repair. (\u00a7\u00a7 30600, 30106, 30610, subds. (a) and (d); Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 14, \u00a7 13250, subd. (b)(3).) The discretionary nature of this type of determination has been recognized by our Supreme Court in <em>State of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 237, 247 [115 Cal.Rptr. 497, 524 P.2d 1281]: \u201cEven the most cursory examination of the [1972 Coastal] Act reveals that determination of whether an applicant qualifies for a permit is entrusted to the Commission\u2019s discretion.\u201d It therefore follows that under Government Code section 818.4, the Commission is immune from liability for its failure to deny permits or conversely its issuance of permits for septic tank installation, expansion and repair. (See <em>O\u2019Hagan </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Adjustment </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 722, 726 [113 Cal.Rptr. 501].)</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The Commission is also authorized to adopt regulations that carry out the provisions and purposes of the act. (\u00a7 30333.) The definition of \u201cregulation\u201d has been broadly construed to include a policy intended to be generally applied in every case. <em>(Ligon </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 583, 588 [176 Cal.Rptr. 717].) Thus, the Commission could have adopted a policy of denying septic tank installation, expansion and repair. Plaintiffs contend that the Commission had a mandatory duty to do so. That contention is without merit. Nowhere in any statute is such a mandatory duty, as distinguished from a mere \u201cgoal,\u201d set forth. The determination of whether to promulgate a regulation or policy is a discretionary function and Government Code section 818.2 precludes the imposition of tort liability for the Commission\u2019s failure to exercise its discretion in the manner plaintiffs alleged it should have. (See <em>Nunn </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 616, 623, fn. 5 [200 Cal.Rptr. 440, 677 P.2d 846].)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The Commission Cannot Be Held Liable for Its Alleged Failure to Require Los Angeles County to Carry Out Its Duties Under the Coastal Act</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Plaintiffs contend that the Commission failed to discharge a mandatory duty by failing to require Los Angeles County to (1) abolish the use of septic tanks and require the installation of sewers or establish a drainage district; and (2) prepare a local coastal program dealing with the problem.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The Commission\u2019s primary duties under the coastal act are to grant or deny permits for coastal development<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (\u00a7 30600) and approve or disapprove local coastal programs. (\u00a7\u00a7 30500-30522.) The Commission reviews the local coastal programs prepared by local governments to determine whether or not they are consistent with the policies of the coastal act. The Commission may itself prepare the local coastal program but only if requested to do so by the local government. (\u00a7 30500.) In <em>City of Chula Vista </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at page 488, the court noted that \u201cthe Commission in approving or disapproving an LCP [local coastal program] does not create or originate any land use rules and regulations. It can approve or disapprove but it cannot itself draft any part of the coastal plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Since the Commission cannot, unless requested, draft any part of a local coastal program, it follows that the Commission cannot require local government to include any specific provisions in their plan. We therefore conclude that in the instant case the Commission was not under a mandatory duty, as plaintiffs contend, to require Los Angeles County to prepare a local coastal program dealing with the drainage problems in the Big Rock area.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Plaintiffs have not cited us to any authority, nor has our research disclosed any, supporting their contention that the Commission was under a mandatory duty to require Los Angeles County to abolish the use of septic tanks and require the installation of sewers or establish a drainage district.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Defendant Commission argues that the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 suit should be affirmed since plaintiffs can seek judicial review of defendant\u2019s action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>only by filing a writ of mandate and their failure to so file on a timely basis precludes such review. Plaintiffs contend that administrative mandamus was inappropriate since there was no proceeding and decision or action to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In view of the dispositive nature of our holding as to the issues discussed above we need not, and do not, reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The court\u2019s order (judgment) of dismissal was proper since the Commission did not have a mandatory duty to protect plaintiffs from the harm they alleged and is immune from liability under Government Code sections 818.2 and 818.4 for any such resulting harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The trial court\u2019s order (judgment) of dismissal of the seventh cause of action of plaintiffs\u2019 SAC is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Kingsley, Acting P. J., and Arguelles, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 17, 1986.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-10\"> All statutory references are to the Public Resources Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A_K\"> In plaintiffs\u2019 SAC they alleged other causes of action against other defendants for damages resulting from the landslide. Those other causes of action do not affect this appeal except insofar as certain paragraphs in them have been incorporated in the seventh cause of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\"> Respondent\u2019s alleged liability for plaintiffs\u2019 damages is based on Government Code section 815.6 which provides as follows: \u201cWhere a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury, the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\"> Govemment Code
