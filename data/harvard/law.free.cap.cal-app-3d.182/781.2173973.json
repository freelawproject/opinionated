On October 29, 1984, the court directed the county counsel to prepare guardianship petitions for the two older children. The matter was set to be heard on November 26, 1984. The court ordered that notice of the hearing be \u201cmailed at least 15 days before hearing, in the manner prescribed by section 1200.5 of the Probate Code . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Notices were mailed to the childrens\u2019 parents, appellant and Richard V., and their maternal grandmother and uncle, on November 9, 1984. No written acknowledgments of receipt of the notices of the hearing were filed. Appellant did not appear at the November 26, 1984, hearing. The petition for appointment of a guardian for the two children was granted. On appeal, appellant contends that notice of the hearing was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Division 4 (see \u00a7\u00a7 1400-3803) of the Probate Code governs guardianship, conservatorship and other protective proceedings. Probate Code section 1511<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires that at least 15 days notice of a hearing on a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>for appointment of a guardian shall be given. The notice must be accompanied by a copy of the petition. Notice served on the parents of the proposed ward or the person having legal custody shall be \u201cin the manner provided in Section 415.10 or 415.30 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or in such manner as may be authorized by the court . . . .\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1511, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, the court ordered service by mail pursuant to Probate Code section 1200.5. The question we address is whether notice of the hearing served on the parents by mail in accordance with the provisions of Probate Code section 1200.5 was sufficient because the statute allows service in \u201csuch manner as authorized by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The two acceptable methods of service, specifically authorized by the Legislature, are personal service pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 415.10<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and service by mail pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If personal service is elected, service of the notice is deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>complete at the time a copy of the notice and the petition is personally delivered to the person to be served. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 415.10.) If service by mail pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30 is elected as the method of service, the notice of hearing and petition shall be mailed by first-class mail or airmail, postage prepaid, to the sender <em>along with an acknowledgment of receipt </em>and return envelope. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 415.30.) Probate Code section 1467 provides that \u201c[i]f service is made by mail pursuant to this division in the manner authorized by Section 415.30 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the service is complete on the date a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>acknowledgment of receipt is executed.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under either of these methods, actual receipt of the notice is assured, i.e., the subject of the notice will either be personally served or will acknowledge receipt of a mailed notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The court authorized the notices in this case to be served in accordance with Probate Code section 1200.5. That section is located in the part of the Probate Code dealing with the administration of decedents\u2019 estates. (See Div. 3, Prob. Code, \u00a7 300 et seq.) It governs the manner of giving notice of certain petitions, such as a petition to set apart a homestead or exempt property (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1200.5, subd. (a)(2)), a petition for the sale of stocks or bonds (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1200.5, subd. (a)(5)), or a petition for final distribution (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1200.5, subd. (a)(12)). Probate Code section 1200.5 provides that at least 10 days before the hearing notice shall either be mailed to the interested persons or be personally served. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1200.5, subd. (b).) When service is by mail, there is no requirement that an acknowledgment of receipt be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We find that the phrase \u201cor in such manner as may be authorized by the court\u201d cannot be construed to allow for service by mail that is not in compliance with the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30. \u201cIt is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that in attempting to ascertain the legislative intention effect should be given, whenever possible, to the statute as a whole and to every word and clause thereof, leaving no part or provision useless or deprived of meaning.\u201d <em>(Weber </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 82, 86 [98 P.2d 492]; see also 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th ed. 1984) \u00a7 4606, p. 104.) To conclude that service by mail that does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30 may be authorized would render the provision that notice shall be \u201cserved in the manner provided in Section . . . 415.30 of the Code of Civil Procedure\u201d meaningless. The Legislature was careful to include in that section a requirement that, if service by mail is elected as the method of giving notice to the minor\u2019s parents, acknowledgment of receipt of the notice must be executed before service is deemed complete. The Legislature distinguished between parents and other relatives; notice to the latter need not be in conformance with Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the Legislature had not intended that mailed notice to parents have additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>guarantees of receipt of notice, there would have been no need to make such a distinction. The phrase \u201csuch manner as authorized by the court\u201d cannot be construed to nullify the specified methods of service. Thus, it can only be interpreted to provide for a court-authorized method of service that is different from (other than) those specifically listed in the statute if service by one of the two named methods is not possible. For example, the address of a long absent parent may be unobtainable. In such a situation, the court, upon proof that diligent efforts have failed to achieve the completion of personal service (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 415.10) or service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30, may authorize an alternative method of service.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">We find further statutory support for our conclusion that Probate Code section 1511 does not authorize service by mail in a manner that does not comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30. Probate Code section 1465 provides that <em>\u201c[ujnless otherwise expressly provided, </em>\u201d notice by mail is complete when the notice is deposited in the mail. If the Legislature had not considered significant the requirement that an acknowledgment of receipt be executed when a parent receives notice by mail of impending guardianship proceedings, it would not have specifically required that the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30 be followed. A provision that service could be made by mail would have been sufficient to invoke the mailing requirements of Probate Code section 1465. However, the Legislature chose to require the acknowledgment of receipt before service was completed. Furthermore, Probate Code section 1200.5, the section under which the court authorized service in this case, specifically states that the section \u201cshall not apply to proceedings under Division 4 (commencing with Section 1400) [guardianship and conservatorship provisions].\u201d Thus, the Legislature has expressly stated its intent that the method of service authorized by the court in this case not be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Because no acknowledgment of receipt of notice was executed, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30, the mailed service was not completed. No attempt to personally serve the notice was made. Notice to the parents, or proof showing why it could not be given, was necessary to give the court jurisdiction of the proceeding and power to make the order appointing a guardian for appellant\u2019s children.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(In re Dahnke </em>(1923) 64 Cal.App. 555, 559-560 [222 P. 381]; <em>Adoption of McDonnell </em>(1947) 77 Cal.App.2d 805, 813-814 [176 P.2d 778]; see also <em>Guardianship of Pankey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 919, 936-937 [113 Cal.Rptr. 858].) Because service of the notice was never completed, and no explanation was made as to the impossibility of giving notice as prescribed by the statute, the court had no jurisdiction to issue the order appointing a guardian. Consequently, the order is void.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">We reverse the judgment (order appointing guardian).</p>\n<p id=\"AiN\">Puglia, P. J., and Sparks, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b685-9\"> The order mandating 15 days notice is a modification of section 1200.5 of the Probate Code. That section, which requires <em>10 </em>days notice of a hearing, provides in pertinent part: \u201c(b) At least 10 days before the time set for the hearing of the petition or account, the petitioner or person filing the account shall cause notice of the time and place of hearing to be mailed to the executor or administrator, when he or she is not the petitioner, to any coexecutor or coadministrator not petitioning, and to all persons (or to their attorneys, if they have appeared by attorney), who have requested notice or who have given notice of appearance in the estate in person or by attorney, as heir, devisee, legatee or creditor, or as otherwise interested, addressed to them at their respective post office addresses given in their request for special notice, if any, otherwise at their respective offices or places of residence, if known, and if not, at the county seat of the county where the proceedings are pending, or to be personally served upon such person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Probate Code section 1511, the provision at issue here, specifically requires that 15 days notice be given.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-11\"> Probate Code section 1511 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Except as provided in subdivisions (f) and (g), at least 15 days before the hearing on the petition for the appointment of a guardian, notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given as provided in subdivisions (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
