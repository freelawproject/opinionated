(Alvord) appeal from a judgment compelling enforcement of a settlement agreement with Marcel Fiore et al. (Fiore). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The parties were limited partners in a joint venture created to acquire and develop real estate. Alvord sought to withdraw pursuant to a provision of the joint venture agreement giving remaining partners a right to buy out withdrawing partners\u2019 interest. Alvord and Fiore entered into an agreement to sell Alvord\u2019s interest in the joint venture to Fiore, but the amount of the sale price became disputed. Fiore sued to compel specific performance of the sale agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Before trial, the parties agreed to settle the matter. They concurred on all terms of sale except the value of the joint venture interest. The basic valuation process, as set forth in the stipulation, required each party to choose an appraiser, and together the two appraisers would choose an impartial third appraiser to value the joint venture\u2019s sole asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">As for the precise value of Alvord\u2019s interest, the parties stipulated that the court would decide the issue of whether the sale price should be calculated based on Alvord\u2019s full percentage of interest in the joint venture. Although Fiore argued that because Alvord held a minority interest in the venture, the fair market value of that interest would be less than the interest actually held by Alvord, the court ruled the percentage actually held by Alvord (15.63545 percent) would determine the sale price.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Alvord\u2019s counsel reduced the stipulation to writing, and Fiore\u2019s counsel and the trial court signed it. It stated \u201cThe defendants\u2019 [Alvord\u2019s] interest in the joint venture shall be the fair market value of the joint venture property, less encumbrances and other liabilities of the joint venture, as of July 31, 1981, multiplied by the defendants\u2019 percentage of interest in the joint venture.\u201d The stipulation also provided \u201cthe court shall reserve jurisdiction over all issues relating to the proposed purchase and may hear disputed matters by means of special setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Alvord\u2019s counsel fell ill before the settlement agreement could be carried out, and subsequently died. Alvord\u2019s replacement counsel claimed the appraiser\u2019s letter did not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute as to certain unverified offsets and credits, and thus he refused to complete the settlement transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">In May 1984, Fiore moved to have judgment entered based upon the settlement agreement. Fiore\u2019s counsel argued he had supplied documentary verification of the joint venture\u2019s liabilities as of July 31, 1981, to Alvord\u2019s original counsel and therefore all the preliminary transactions under the stipulation had been completed. The court granted Fiore\u2019s motion and entered judgment based on the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Alvord contends a motion to compel enforcement of an out-of-court settlement must be made by motion for summary judgment rather than by a nonstatutory \u201cspeaking\u201d motion. He relies on <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Matlock </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 876 [166 Cal.Rptr. 229].</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\"><em>Hastings </em>and the line of cases which follow it have been superseded by section 664.6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Corkland </em>v. <em>Boscoe </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989 [203 Cal.Rptr. 356].) The nonstatutory \u201cspeaking\u201d motion disapproved of in <em>Hastings </em>is \u201cnow authorized by statute [section 664.6] and is applicable not only to judicially supervised settlement conferences, but to stipulations of settlement in writing or orally before the court.\u201d <em>(Corkland, supra, </em>156 Cal.App.3d at p. 994.)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The stipulation, drafted by Alvord\u2019s own counsel, provided for a precise method of calculation to determine the net value of the asset. Alvord attacks that method and thus the terms of the stipulation, when he claims lack of verification for offsets and credits. Section 664.6 now authorizes the court to entertain challenges to the actual terms of the stipulation, that is, whether there actually was a settlement, upon a motion. As <em>Corkland </em>held, a motion for summary judgment is no longer required.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Alvord argues that the motion under section 664.6 must be denied if any material issues of fact are disputed. This argument is fully rebutted by the plain wording of the statute. When ruling on a section 664.6 motion, the court in effect acts as a trier of fact. \u201c[T]he trial court must determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement of all or part of the case. In making this determination, <em>trial judges, in the sound exercise of their discretion, may receive oral testimony or may determine the motion upon declarations alone.\u201d (Corkland, supra, </em>156 Cal.App.3d at p. 994, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">The proper standard of review, therefore, is whether the trial court\u2019s ruling was supported by substantial evidence. (See, e.g., <em>Casa de Valley View Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Stevenson </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1182, 1190 [213 Cal.Rptr. 790].) Fiore\u2019s counsel stated in his declaration that he had given documentary verification of encumbrances to Alvord\u2019s original counsel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Thus the court did not abuse its discretion when it determined the method set forth in the stipulation had been followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Alvord contends the court violated the parties\u2019 stipulation, and therefore exceeded its jurisdiction, when it rendered judgment based solely on the declarations of counsel and oral argument, without further insuring that all conditions to settlement had been fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\"><em>Corkland, </em>however, expressly authorized the trial court to determine the motions based solely on declarations if it so chooses. Section 664.6\u2019s express authorization for trial courts to determine whether a settlement has occurred is an implicit authorization for the trial court to interpret the terms and conditions to settlement. In the present case, the court determined the stipulation for settlement was not conditional and that any dispute about the terms could be determined by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">IV. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Low, P.
