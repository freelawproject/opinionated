J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxR\">This appeal raises a number of novel and complex questions concerning the interrelationship of the law of water quality and the law of water rights. The coordinated cases arise out of efforts by the State Water Resources Control Board (the Board) to set new water quality standards for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta) in order to take account of the combined effects upon the Delta of the state\u2019s two massive water projects: the Central Valley Project (CVP) and the State Water Project (SWP), operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (U.S. Bureau or Bureau) and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The Delta serves as a conduit for the transfer of water by the statewide water projects. Both the CVP and the SWP divert water from the rivers that flow into the Delta and store the water in reservoirs. Quantities of this stored water are periodically released into the Delta. Pumps situated at the southern edge of the Delta eventually lift the water into canals for transport south to the farmers of the Central Valley and the municipalities of Southern California. Water which is neither stored nor exported south passes through the Delta where it is used by local farmers, industries and municipalities. The excess flows out into the San Francisco Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The U.S. Bureau and the DWR hold a combined total of 34 permits for various units of the CVP and SWP to authorize diversion and use of the Delta\u2019s waters. These permits were issued by the Board and its predecessors over a period of years extending through 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">In 1976 the Board convened a hearing for two declared purposes: to formulate a water quality control plan for the Delta and to determine whether the water-use permits held by the U.S. Bureau and the DWR should be amended to implement the plan. In August 1978, following an extensive evidentiary hearing over an 11-month period, the Board adopted the \u201cWater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Quality Control Plan for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh\u201d (hereafter sometimes called the Plan) and \u201cWater Right Decision 1485\u201d (hereafter sometimes called the Decision or D 1485).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In the Plan the Board established new water quality standards for salinity control and for protection of fish and wildlife in the Delta and Suisun Marsh. In D 1485 the Board modified the permits held by the U.S. Bureau and the DWR, compelling the operators of the projects to adhere to the water quality standards as set out in the Plan. In this appeal we are requested to review the validity of those actions: namely, the Board\u2019s establishment of water quality objectives in the Plan and its modification of the water-use permits in the Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">We will conclude, inter alia, that the modification of the projects\u2019 permits in order to implement the water quality standards was a proper exercise of the Board\u2019s water rights authority. We will also conclude that in establishing only such water quality standards as will protect Delta water users against the effects of project activities, the Board misconceived the scope of its water quality planning function. Finally, we will determine that the Board has the power and duty to provide water quality protection to the fish and wildlife that make up the delicate ecosystem within the Delta.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">\n<em>The Water Projects</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The history of California water development and distribution is a story of supply and demand. California\u2019s critical water problem is not a lack of water but uneven distribution of water resources. The state is endowed with flowing rivers, countless lakes and streams and abundant winter rains and snowfall. But while over 70 percent of the stream flow lies north of Sacramento, nearly 80 percent of the demand for water supplies originates in the southern regions of the state. And because of the semiarid climate, rainfall is at a seasonal low during the summer and fall when the demand for water is greatest; conversely, rainfall and runoff from the northern snowpacks occur in late winter and early spring when user demand is lower. (See 1 Rogers &amp; Nichols, Water for Cal. (1967) pp. 20, 26-33, 43-46 [hereafter Rogers &amp; Nichols].) Largely to remedy such seasonal and geographic maldistribution, while simultaneously providing relief from devastating floods and droughts, the California water projects were ultimately conceived and formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">In 1933 the California Legislature adopted a plan for transfer of surplus water from the Sacramento River and its northern tributaries to the water-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>deficient areas of the San Joaquin Valley through construction of a \u201cCentral Valley Project\u2019 \u2019: Shasta Dam, the central feature, to store and regulate waters of the Sacramento River; Friant Dam, on the western edge of the Sierra, to divert water from the San Joaquin River to southern regions of the valley; and various other units designed to transfer water from the Sacramento River system to the San Joaquin Valley. (Wat. Code, \u00a7 11100 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, due to the pervasive unfavorable economic conditions during the Great Depression, the state turned to the federal government to finance and construct the massive project.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Construction of the CVP began in 1937. It is now one of the world\u2019s most extensive water transport systems. As noted, Shasta Dam on the upper Sacramento River is the focal point of the CVP. Shasta Dam was completed in 1945 but began storing water and generating electric power in 1944. The waters of the Sacramento River which flow past the Shasta Dam are augmented by additional water supplies brought through a tunnel from the Trinity River and from reservoirs formed by Folsom and Nimbus Dams on the American River. About 30 miles south of Sacramento, the Delta Cross Channel regulates the passage of Sacramento River water through the Delta to the Tracy Pumping Plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">At Rock Slough, a portion of the water is pumped into the Contra Costa Canal for municipal uses in Contra Costa County. At the Tracy Pumping Plant, the water is lifted nearly 200 feet above sea level into the Delta Mendota Canal and flows 117 miles southward to the Mendota Pool. Here, the waters from the north replace the natural flow of the San Joaquin River. At Friant Dam, the flow of the San Joaquin River is impounded and diverted through the Friant-Kern Canal 152 miles south to the southern reaches of the San Joaquin Valley. (See generally Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>pp. 42-62; Engle, Central Valley Project Documents (1956); see also Commentary, Craig, Cal. Water Law in Perspective, 68 West\u2019s Ann. Wat. Code (1971 ed.) pp. LXXVII-LXXIX; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Gerlach Live Stock Co. </em>(1950) 339 U.S. 725, 728-730 [94 L.Ed. 1231, 1236-1237, 70 S.Ct. <em>955]; Ivanhoe Irrig. Dist. </em>v. <em>McCracken </em>(1958) 357 U.S. 275, 280-283 [2 L.Ed.2d 1313, 1319-1321, 78 S.Ct. 1174].)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Following World War II, state authorities renewed their efforts to develop a comprehensive statewide water plan. In 1951 the Legislature authorized the Feather River and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Diversion Project. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>(\u00a7 11260.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This project\u2014referred to as the SWP\u2014began operations in 1967 under management of the DWR. Water from the Feather River is stored behind Oroville Dam and is released into the Feather River and its eventual confluence with the Sacramento River. The water flow continues through the Delta to the Clifton Court Forebay where a portion of it enters the South Bay Aqueduct for delivery to the Santa Clara Valley. A much greater portion is lifted into the California Aqueduct for transport through the San Joaquin Valley and eventually again lifted by a series of pumping stations over the Tehachapi Mountains for delivery and use in the Southern California region. (See generally Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 64-82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">At least one authoritative treatise has noted the numerous legal questions presented by the formation of these water projects. \u201cThe statewide coordinated development of California\u2019s water resources poses many complex legal problems. These problems are further complicated by: inadequacies and uncertainties of present state statutes generally: available procedures for acquisition of water rights; the nature and extent of vested rights in the use of surface and ground water: preferential rights of areas in which water originates: questions of the effectiveness of contract rights in assuring deficient areas of a dependable water supply; and questions of relations between the state and other agencies.\u201d (Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 114-115.) Virtually all of the problems catalogued by the authors are at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\n<em>The Law of Water Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">It is a fundamental principle of water law that one may not withdraw water from its source without first acquiring \u2018 \u2018 water rights .\u201d(\u00a7\u00a7 102,1052.)  Conceptually, what is meant by a water right is the right to <em>use </em>the water\u2014to divert it from its natural course. \u201c\u2018It is laid down by our law writers, that the right of property in water is usufructuary, and consists not so much of the fluid itself as the advantage of its use.\u2019 <em>(Eddy </em>v. <em>Simpson </em>(1853) 3 Cal. 249, 252.) Hence, the cases do not speak of the ownership of water, but only of the right to its use. <em>(Rancho Santa Margarita </em>v. <em>Vail </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 501, 554-555 [81 P.2d 533]; see generally Hutchins, The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Cal. Law of Water Rights (1956) pp. 36-38; 1 Rogers &amp; Nichols, Water for Cal. (1967) p. 191.) Accordingly, Water Code section 102 provides that \u2018[a]ll water within the State is the property of the people of the State, but the right to the use of water may be acquired by appropriation in the manner provided by law.\u2019\u201d <em>(National Audubon Society </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 441 [189 Cal.Rptr. 346, 658 P.2d 709], cert. den., 464 U.S. 977 [78 L.Ed.2d 351, 104 S.Ct. 413]; see generally Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>p. 191; Hutchins, The Cal. Law of Water Rights (1956) pp. 36-38, 120, 181-182.)  It is equally axiomatic that once rights to use water are acquired, they become vested property rights. As such, they cannot be infringed by others or taken by governmental action without due process and just compensation. <em>(Ivanhoe Irr. Dist. </em>v. <em>All Parties </em>(1957) 47 Cal.2d 597, 623 [306 P.2d 824], revd. on other grounds in <em>Ivanhoe Irrig. Dist. </em>v. <em>McCracken, supra, </em>357 U.S. 275; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Gerlach Live Stock Co., supra, </em>339 U.S. 725, 752-754 [94 L.Ed. 1231, 1249-1251]; Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 189-190, 496-497, 523-527; Hutchins, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 120-124, 183-186.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">California operates under a \u201cdual\u201d or hybrid system of water rights which recognizes both doctrines of riparian rights and appropriation rights. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shirokow </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 301, 307 [162 Cal.Rptr. 30, 605 P.2d 859].) When California achieved statehood, the Legislature adopted the common law of England and thereby incorporated the <em>riparian </em>doctrine. <em>(Lux </em>v. <em>Haggin </em>(1886) 69 Cal. 255, 361-409 [10 P. 674].) The riparian doctrine confers upon the owner of land the right to divert the water flowing by his land for use upon his land, without regard to the extent of such use or priority in time. <em>(Miller &amp; Lux </em>v. <em>Enterprise C. etc. Co. </em>(1915) 169 Cal. 415 [147 P. 567].) All riparians on a stream system are vested with a common ownership such that in times of water shortage all riparians must reduce their usage proportionately. <em>(Prather </em>v. <em>Hoberg </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 549, 559-560 [150 P.2d 405]; see generally Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 216-251; Hutchins, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 40-41, 52-55, 218-230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Upon discovery of gold and the development of the California mining industry, water was often diverted from streams passing through government lands to be used on nonriparian lands. To accommodate this usage, the doctrine of <em>appropriation </em>originated and was incorporated in California water law. <em>(Irwin </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1855) 5 Cal. 140.) The appropriation doctrine confers upon one who actually diverts and uses water the right to do so provided that the water is used for reasonable and beneficial uses and is surplus to that used by riparians or earlier appropriators. Appropriators need not own land contiguous to the watercourse, but appropriation rights are subordinate to riparian rights so that in times of shortage riparians are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>entitled to fulfill their needs before appropriators are entitled to any use of the water. <em>(Meridian, Ltd. </em>v. <em>San Francisco </em>(1939) 13 Cal.2d 424, 445-447 [90 P.2d 537].) And, as between appropriators, the rule of priority is \u201cfirst in time, first in right.\u201d (See <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Phillips, supra, 5 </em>Cal. at p. 147.) The senior appropriator is entitled to fulfill his needs before a junior appropriator is entitled to use any water. (See generally Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 254-304, 472-480; Hutchins, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 40-51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Initially, rights to appropriate water were acquired by actual diversion and use of the water. Beginning in 1914, however, a statutory scheme has provided the exclusive method of acquiring appropriation rights. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shirokow, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 301,308.) Thus, an application for appropriative rights must now be made to the Board for a permit authorizing construction of necessary water works and the taking and use of a specified quantity of water. (\u00a7 1201 et seq.; see generally Hutchins, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 94-112.) Riparian rights, however, continue to be acquired through ownership of land contiguous to the watercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Once an appropriative water right permit is issued, the permit holder has the right to take and use the water according to the terms of the permit. (\u00a7\u00a7 1381, 1455.) Upon compliance with the permit terms, a license\u2014the final document in the permit process\u2014is issued and the appropriative rights become confirmed. (\u00a7\u00a7 1600-1610.) Until the license is issued, the Board may reserve jurisdiction to amend the terms of the permit. (\u00a7 1394.) If the permit holder or license holder violates any of the terms or conditions or fails to apply the water to a beneficial purpose, the Board may revoke the permit or license. (\u00a7\u00a7 1410, 1611.) In 1980, the Board was given increased powers to enforce terms and conditions of an appropriation permit. (\u00a7 1825 et seq. [authorizing cease and desist orders and actions for injunctive relief].)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In its role of issuing appropriation permits, the Board has two primary duties: 1) to determine if surplus water is available and 2) to protect the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\n<em>Available Water Supply</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Section 1375 declares the basic principle that: \u201cAs a prerequisite to the issuance of a permit to appropriate water. . . [t]here must be unappropriated water available to supply the applicant.\u201d (Subd. (d).)  Accordingly, in reviewing the permit application, the Board must first determine whether surplus water is available, a decision requiring an examination of prior riparian and appropriative rights. <em>(Temescal Water Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. Public Works </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 90 [280 P.2d 1].) In exercising its permit power, the Board\u2019s first concern is recognition and protection of prior rights to beneficial use of the water stream. <em>(Meridian, Ltd. </em>v. <em>San Francisco, supra, </em>13 Cal.2d 424, 450.) Yet, the Board\u2019s estimate of available surplus water is in no way an adjudication of the rights of other water right holders <em>(Temescal Water Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. Public Works, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d at p. 103); the rights of the riparians and senior appropriators remain unaffected by the issuance of an appropriation permit. <em>(Duckworth </em>v. <em>Watsonville Water etc. Co. </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 425, 431 [150 P. 58].)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\n<em>Public Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">When the water commission was first created in 1914 its duties were largely ministerial, its only task to determine whether there was surplus water available for appropriation by the applicant. <em>(Tulare Water Co. </em>v. <em>State Water Com. </em>(1921) 187 Cal. 533, 537-538 [202 P. 874].) However, the Board\u2019s powers have been expanded to allow appropriation for beneficial purposes \u201cunder such terms and conditions as in its judgment will best develop, conserve, and utilize [the water] <em>in the public interest </em>. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1253, italics added; see generally <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 198 [116 Cal.Rptr. 770]; <em>Johnson Rancho County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>State Water Rights Board </em>(1965) 235 Cal.App.2d 863 [45 Cal.Rptr. 589]).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The nature of the public interest to be served by the Board is reflected throughout the statutory scheme. As a matter of state policy, water resources are to be used \u201cto the fullest extent. . . capable\u201d (\u00a7 100) with development undertaken \u201cfor the greatest public benefit\u201d (\u00a7 105). And in determining whether to grant or deny a permit application in the public interest, the Board is directed to consider \u201cany general or co-ordinated plan . . . toward the control, protection, development . . . and conservation of [state] water resources . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1256), as well as the \u201crelative benefits\u201d of competing beneficial uses (\u00a7 1257). Finally, the Board\u2019s actions are to be guided by the legislative policy that the favored or \u201chighest\u201d use is domestic, and irrigation the next highest. (\u00a7 1254.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Nonconsumptive or \u201cinstream uses,\u201d too, are expressly included within the category of beneficial uses to be protected in the public interest. Thus, the Board must likewise consider the amounts of water required \u201cfor recreation and preservation and enhancement of fish and wildlife resources\u201d (\u00a7 1243) and needed \u201cto remain in the source for protection of beneficial uses, including any uses . . . protected in any relevant water quality control plan . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1243.5). Thus, when determining appropriative water rights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the Board is expressly empowered to protect water quality as a matter of statewide interest (\u00a7\u00a7 1258,13000 et seq.) and major environmental concern (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21000, 21001).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Yet notwithstanding its power to protect the public interest, the Board plays a limited role in resolving disputes and <em>enforcing </em>rights of water rights holders, a task mainly left to the courts. Because water rights possess indicia of property rights, water rights holders are entitled to judicial protection against infringement, e.g., actions for quiet title, nuisance, wrongful diversion or inverse condemnation. (See generally, Hutchins, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 262-282, 348-356; Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 530-534, 545-547.) It bears reemphasis that the Board\u2019s role in examining existing water rights to estimate the amount of surplus water available for appropriation does <em>not </em>involve adjudication of such rights. <em>(Temescal Water Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. Public Works, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d 90, 103-106; Hutchins, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 98-99.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Unlike real property rights, usufructuary water rights are limited and uncertain. The available supply of water is largely determined by natural forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Riparians have no rights to a specific amount of water. Rather they enjoy as an incident of common ownership with other riparians on the stream a correlative share of the natural flow. Thus, in times of water shortage, all riparians must curtail their usage in order that they share the available water. Similarly, all riparians may be required to share expenses or inconvenience for the common good to enable all riparians to use the water. <em>(Rancho Santa Margarita </em>v. <em>Vail </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 501, 560-562 [81 P.2d 533]; see <em>People </em>ex rel. State Water Resources Control Bd. v. <em>Forni </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 743 [126 Cal.Rptr. 851].)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>In contrast, limitations on appropriators are more visible since appropriative rights are governed by the terms of the issued permit: the quantity of permitted water is specified together with other terms and conditions imposed by the Board. Moreover, appropriators are limited by priorities in time; their rights are subordinate to the rights of preexisting holders, i.e., riparians and senior appropriators.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Furthermore, superimposed on those basic principles defining water rights is the overriding constitutional limitation that the water be used as reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served. (Cal. Const., art. X, \u00a7 2.) Historically, appropriators, but <em>not </em>riparians, were limited to reasonable and beneficial uses of the water; riparians were subject only to the needs of other riparians on the same stream, frequently with wasteful results. This marked disparity between riparian and appropriation rights was dramatically illustrated in <em>Herminghaus </em>v. <em>South. California Edison Co. </em>(1926) 200 Cal. 81 [252 R 607], appeal dismissed 275 U.S. 486 [72 L.Ed. 387, 48 S.Ct. 27], where the court held that under the riparian doctrine the riparian owner was entitled to the full flow of the stream even though the water was used wastefully to flood her lands, thus depriving an upstream appropriator of needed water for a power plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In response to <em>Herminghaus, </em>a constitutional amendment was enacted in 1928 subjecting all water users\u2014riparians and appropriators alike\u2014to the universal limitation that water use must be reasonable and for a beneficial purpose. (Cal. Const., art. X, \u00a7 2.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   This <em>\u201crule of reasonable use\u201d </em>is now the cardinal principle of California\u2019s water law. (\u00a7 100; see generally Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 497-500; Hutchins, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 12-20, 230-234.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The courts have construed this rule as a valid exercise of the police power of the state to regulate the use and enjoyment of water rights for the public benefit. <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>v. <em>Forni, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 743, 753; see also <em>Gin S. Chow </em>v. <em>City of Santa Barbara </em>(1933) 217 Cal. 673, 701-703 [22 P.2d 5]; <em>East Bay M. U. Dist. </em>v. <em>Dept. of P. Wks. </em>(1934) 1 Cal.2d 476, 479-482 [35 P.2d 1027]; <em>Joslin </em>v. <em>Marin Mun. Water Dist. </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 132, 138 [60 Cal.Rptr. 377, 429 P.2d 889].) And this paramount limitation applies \u201cto all water rights enjoyed or asserted in this state, whether the same be grounded on the riparian right or . . . the appropriative right.\u201d <em>(Peabody </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo </em>(1935) 2 Cal.2d 351, 383 [40 P.2d 486].) Thus, no water rights are inviolable; all water rights are subject to governmental regulation. (Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 501-509.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">More recently, in <em>National Audubon Society </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 419, the California Supreme Court underscored a further significant limitation on water rights: the \u201cpublic trust\u201d doctrine. The court there held that the state\u2019s navigable waters are subject to a public trust and that the state, as trustee, has a duty to preserve this trust property from harmful diversions by water rights holders. Thus, the court determined that no one has a vested right to use water in a manner harmful to the state\u2019s waters. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 445-448.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\n<em>The Projects\u2019 Water Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Construction of the CVP, initially authorized in 1935 (49 Stat. 1028, 1038), was reauthorized in 1937 by the Secretary of the Interior and expressly made subject to the federal reclamation laws. (50 Stat. 844, 850.) Under section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902 (43 U.S.C. \u00a7 383), the U.S. Bureau is required to comply with state law and to acquire water rights for diversion and storage of water by the CVP.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">For their initial operations in the Sacramento Valley and the Delta, federal authorities acquired appropriative rights. In 1927, the California Legislature had authorized the DWR\u2019s predecessor agency to file applications to appropriate water for use in the contemplated CVP. (\u00a7\u00a7 10500-10506.) Upon the federal government\u2019s assumption of the project, the DWR assigned its applications to the U.S. Bureau. The CVP was actually completed and in operation before permits were issued: the first permits were issued to the U.S. Bureau in 1958 (Decision 893), and the principal permits were issued in <em>1961 </em>(Decision 990).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The DWR, too, obtained appropriative rights for operation of the SWP through the permit process, the permits being issued by the Board in 1967 (Decisions 1275 and 1291).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>One of the distinctive features of the statewide projects is the great distance between the point of storage and the point of diversion from the watercourse. On the San Joaquin River, the CVP\u2019s diversion of water is made at the point of storage\u2014the Friant Dam. In contrast, on the Sacramento River, the water is stored at the CVP\u2019s Shasta Dam and on the Feather River, at the SWP\u2019s Oroville Dam. This stored water, upon release, flows some 300 miles into the Delta where it is diverted for transport to the San Joaquin Valley and Southern California. Along that extended watercourse, a multitude of water users abound with individual rights to divert water. Thus, as a practical matter, the quantity of water available to the projects for export from the Delta largely depends upon the quantity diverted by the upstream users.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\n<em>Water Quality in the Delta</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The Delta generally describes a large lowland area with a labyrinth of natural channels in and around the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. The combined river water passes through the Delta into Suisun Bay and then into San Francisco Bay. In 1959, the legal boundaries of the Delta were fixed by the Legislature. (\u00a7 12220.) The bounded area is roughly triangular, with Sacramento at the north, Vernalis at the south and Pittsburg at the west.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The major factor affecting water quality in the Delta is saltwater intrusion. Delta lands, situated at or below sea level, are constantly subject to ocean tidal action. Salt water entering from San Francisco Bay extends well into the Delta, and intrusion of the saline tidal waters is checked only by the natural barrier formed by fresh water flowing out from the Delta.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">But as fresh water was increasingly diverted from the Delta for agricultural, industrial and municipal development, salinity intrusion intensified, particularly during the dry summer months and in years of low precipitation and runoff into the river systems. One of the major purposes of the projects was containment of maximum salinity intrusion into the Delta. By storing waters during periods of heavy flow and releasing water during times of low flow, the freshwater barrier could be maintained at a constant level.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Water quality is controlled by both federal and state legislation. Until 1972, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act relied upon state-formulated ambient water quality standards as the means of ensuring water purity. (79 Stat. 907, as amended; formerly 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151 et seq.) This approach proved ineffective and difficult to enforce against individual polluters. Consequently, in 1972 Congress substantially amended the act, declaring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>national objective of eliminating discharges of pollutants. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1); see generally <em>EPA </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Board </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 200, 204-206 [48 L.Ed.2d 578, 583-584, 96 S.Ct. 2022].)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Under the revised legislation now denominated the Clean Water Act, Congress made significant changes in the methods of controlling water pollution. First, the focus shift\u00e9d from overall water quality measurement standards to \u201cend-of-the-pipe\u201d discharge restrictions whereby water quality is monitored through measurement of a particular discharge against prescribed effluent limitations. Second-, the amendments establish a permit system prohibiting any discharge of pollutants without first obtaining, and complying with, a permit issued by the state water pollution control agency. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311, 1342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">However, it does not appear that excess salinity due to tidal water intrusion falls within the federal regulatory scheme, which defines a \u201cpollutant\u201d essentially in terms of waste material,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the \u201cdischarge\u201d thereof as \u201cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source, . . .\u201d (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(12).) The intrusion of salt water is neither a discharge from a point source nor a discharge of a pollutant. (See <em>U.S. </em>ex rel. <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Tenn. Water Quality Control Bd. </em>(6th Cir. 1983) 717 F.2d 992, cert. den., 446 U.S. 937 [80 L.Ed.2d 458, 104 S.Ct. 1909]; <em>State of Mo. </em>ex rel. <em>Ashcroft </em>v. <em>Dept. of the Army </em>(8th Cir. 1982) 672 F.2d 1297, 1304; <em>National Wildlife Federation </em>v. <em>Gorsuch </em>(D.C. Cir. 1982) 693 F.2d 156 [water quality changes from operation of dam were not discharges of pollutants].)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Significantly, water quality standards are retained under the Act as a supplement to the discharge limitations. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311(b)(1)(C), 1313.) The federal statutes require each state to engage in \u201ca continuing planning process\u201d and to identify those waters within its boundaries for which discharge restrictions are inadequate to achieve the water quality standards. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(d)(1)(A), (e)(1).) Additionally, every state water pollution control agency must conduct a triennial review of its water quality standards and submit proposed revisions to the Environmental Protection Agency for approval. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(1).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>A further aspect of each state\u2019s \u201ccontinuing planning process\u201d is the identification of so-called nonpoint source pollution. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1281, 1288.) <em>The act expressly recognizes saltwater intrusion as a form of non-point source pollution. </em>(33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1288(b)(2)(I) [states must prepare plans for areawide waste treatment management, including identification of saltwater intrusion], 1314(f)(E) [EPA must issue information for controlling nonpoint source pollution, including saltwater intrusion].) And the term \u201cpollution\u201d is broadly defined to mean \u201cman-made or man-induced alteration of the chemical, physical, biological, and radiological integrity of water.\u201d (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(19).)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Thus, the federal act mandates certain planning responsibilities including formulation of water quality standards to provide salinity control. But the act contains no provision for either implementation of water quality standards or regulation of nonpoint pollution sources, matters of enforcement relegated to the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In California, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (\u00a7 13000 et seq.) establishes a comprehensive statewide program for water quality control administered by nine regional boards and coordinated by the state Board. The regional boards are primarily responsible for formulation and adoption of water quality control plans covering the state\u2019s 16 planning basins (\u00a7 13240) subject to the Board\u2019s review and approval (\u00a7 13245). But the Board alone is responsible for setting statewide policy concerning water quality control (\u00a7\u00a7 13140-13147).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">And in its capacity as the designated state water pollution control agency for purposes of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (\u00a7 13160), the Board is empowered to formulate its own water quality control plans which supersede conflicting regional basin plans. (\u00a7 13170.) The Water Quality Control Plan under review in this appeal was adopted pursuant to that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">In formulating a water quality control plan, the Board is invested with wide authority \u201cto attain the highest water quality which is reasonable, considering all demands being made and to be made on those waters and the total values involved, beneficial and detrimental, economic and social, tangible and intangible.\u201d (\u00a7 13000.) In fulfilling its statutory imperative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the Board is required to \u201cestablish such water quality objectives ... as in its judgment will ensure the reasonable protection of beneficial uses ...\u201d (\u00a7 13241), a conceptual classification far-reaching in scope. \u201c\u2018Beneficial uses\u2019 of the waters of the state that may be protected against quality degradation include, but are not necessarily limited to, domestic, municipal, agricultural and industrial supply; power generation; recreation; aesthetic enjoyment; navigation; and preservation and enhancement of fish, wildlife, and other aquatic resources or preserves. \u201d (\u00a7 13050, subd.(f).)  Thus, in carrying out its water quality planning function, the Board possesses broad powers and responsibilities in setting water quality standards. The formulation of salinity levels to protect the beneficial uses listed falls well within that authorized function.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Comprehensive water quality standards for the Delta\u2014the so-called \u201cTracy standards\u201d\u2014were first formulated on November 19, 1965, through the combined efforts of the Sacramento River and Delta Water Association, the San Joaquin Water Rights Committee, the DWR, and the U.S. Bureau. In 1967 the Board issued Decision 1275 which approved the permits for operation of the SWP. In that decision the Board imposed as a condition of the permits compliance with the established water quality criteria. The U.S. Bureau voluntarily complies with the Tracy standards to meet its contractual obligations to water supply agencies who purchase water from the CVP.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Also in 1967, in compliance with the provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Board submitted the adopted standards, which were eventually approved by the Secretary upon the condition that the Board consider imposition of more stringent Delta salinity controls. In 1971, the Board issued Decision 1379 establishing new water quality standards purportedly applicable to both the CVP and the SWP. The decision was stayed as a result of litigation challenging the Board\u2019s authority to impose conditions on permits held by a federal agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">At about the same time, the regional water quality control boards (see \u00a7 13240) formulated plans for the 16 \u201cbasins\u201d of the state, including the Delta and the Suisun Marsh. The Basin 5B Plan, setting water quality standards for the Delta, and the Basin 2 Plan, setting standards for the San Francisco Bay Basin, were finally approved by the Board in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">In approving the Basin 5B Plan, the Board indicated its intention to convene hearings no later than July 1, 1978, for the purpose of receiving further evidence relating to salinity control and protection of fish and wildlife. As earlier noted, the Board held an extended evidentiary hearing culminating in adoption of the 1978 Water Quality Control Plan for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh. The Plan is intended to remain in effect for 10 years with new hearings to be scheduled in 1986 to reevaluate the Delta standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In conducting the 1978 proceedings, the Board for the first time acted pursuant to its combined authority to determine water rights and to establish water quality standards. (\u00a7 174.) In discharging its dual functions, the Board reconsidered existing water quality standards in light of current data concerning the effects on the Delta of the operations of the two water projects\u2014 the users with the greatest impact. The Board also undertook to modify the existing water rights permits of the projects\u2014the water rights holders with the lowest seniority\u2014in order to implement the enacted water quality standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The final product of the Board\u2019s efforts was the Water Quality Control Plan for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh and Water Right Decision 1485. In the Plan, the Board set new water quality standards to protect fish and wildlife and to protect agricultural, industrial and municipal uses of Delta waters. In the Decision, the Board modified the permits held by the U.S. Bureau and the DWR to compel the projects to release enough water into the Delta or to reduce their exports from the Delta so as to maintain the water quality standards set in the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\n<em>Trial Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">No less than eight petitions for writ of mandate were filed by interested parties seeking to invalidate the water quality Plan and the water rights Decision. The petitions were \u201ccoordinated\u201d and assigned to San Francisco Superior Court Judge Figone, who\u2014in light of the voluminous administrative record\u2014ordered the parties to brief certain \u201ckey legal issues\u201d for decision. The core of the trial court\u2019s written decision upholds the authority of the Board to impose the water quality standards upon the projects but rejects the standards as inadequate. The trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the Board to set aside its Plan and Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Virtually all the parties have appealed, challenging one or more aspects of the trial court\u2019s decision. These consolidated appeals require us to determine the scope of the Board\u2019s dual responsibility to regulate water quality and to supervise appropriation permits. Some parties, principally the U.S. Bureau and those who purchase exported water from the CVP, contend that the Board exceeded its authority in requiring the CVP to release more water into the Delta and to curtail exports, thus infringing vested appropriative water rights of the CVP.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Others, notably the Delta riparians, claim the Board\u2019s actions were inadequate in failing to provide more stringent water quality standards to protect their existing rights to use the Delta waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Subsumed in these several arguments is a central dispute concerning who should bear the financial burden for the additional water needed to maintain the water quality standards. The Delta riparians contend they are entitled to the free use of water flowing by their land while the projects argue that the riparians who benefit from the enhanced water quality should pay the cost of the added water supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The standard of review to be applied is complicated by two factors. First, the Board\u2019s exercise of authority involved both quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions invoking different standards for review. Additionally, the trial court did not review the lengthy administrative record or make factual findings<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but rendered its decision upon what it perceived to be solely questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\n<em>Dual Functions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">As noted, the Board performed both adjudicatory and regulatory functions in allocating water rights and ensuring water quality. (\u00a7 174.) The Board established water quality objectives in the Plan and at the same time implemented those objectives in the Decision by modifying the projects\u2019 appropriation permits to compel the projects to maintain the established water quality standards. Although the two functions are merged under a single board, each has distinct attributes.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">In performing its regulatory function of ensuring water quality by establishing water quality objectives, the Board acts in a legislative capacity. The Water Quality Control Plan itself is thus a quasi-legislative document. Accordingly, great deference must be given to the Board\u2019s determination, and appellate review thereof is narrowly limited: \u201cA reviewing court will ask three questions: first, did the agency act within the scope of its delegated authority; second, did the agency employ fair procedures; and third, was the agency action reasonable. Under the third inquiry, a reviewing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>will not substitute its independent policy judgment for that of the agency on the basis of an independent trial de novo. A court will uphold the agency action unless the action is arbitrary, capricious, or lacking in evidentiary support. A court must ensure that an agency has adequately considered all relevant factors, and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors, the choice made, and the purposes of the enabling statute.\u201d <em>(California Hotel &amp; Motel Assn. </em>v. <em>Industrial Welfare Com. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 200, 212 [157 Cal.Rptr. 840, 599 P.2d 31].) Moreover, absent any indication of arbitrariness or evidentiary or procedural defect, \u201c \u2018. . .in these technical matters requiring the assistance of experts and the collection and study of statistical data, courts let administrative boards and officers work out their problems with as little judicial interference as possible. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Industrial Welfare Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 690, 702 [166 Cal.Rptr. 331, 613 P.2d 579], cert. den. 449 U.S. 1029 [66 L.Ed.2d 492, 101 S.Ct. 602].)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In contrast, in undertaking to allocate water rights, the Board performs an adjudicatory function. <em>(Temescal Water Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. Public Works, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d 90, 100-106.) Thus, D 1485, providing for modification of the permits of the projects, is a quasi-judicial document, and review is governed under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. (Id., at p. 100; <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d 198, 207.) Nevertheless, deferential latitude should be accorded to the Board\u2019s judgment involving valuable water resources. Indeed, the Legislature has conferred broad discretion upon the Board to impose terms and conditions upon appropriation permits which <em>\u201cin its judgment </em>will best develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water sought to be appropriated.\u201d (\u00a7 1253, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Our conclusion finds further support in the reasons advanced by the court in <em>Ferrante </em>v. <em>Fish &amp; Game Commission </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 365, 374 [175 P.2d 222] [issuance of fishing permits by Fish and Game Commission]; \u201cThe Legislature has entrusted the supervision and protection of this valuable resource of the state to the respondent commission, not to the courts. The commission must be presumed to have a knowledge of the conditions which underlie and motivate its regulatory actions and unless it is demonstrated that those actions are not grounded upon any reasonable factual basis the courts should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion vested in it by the Legislature, nor lightly substitute their judgment for that of the commission.\u201d (See also <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d at pp. 208, 212.) In the final analysis, the touchstone for the Board\u2019s actions is the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; Johnson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>Rancho County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>State Water Rights Board, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.2d 863.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><em>Mountain Defense League </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1977) 65 Cal.App.3d 723 [135 Cal.Rptr. 588], cited by South Delta Water Agency, is procedurally distinguishable. There, the court held that where an administrative agency, acting in both capacities, reaches the required determination in a single decision, \u201creview of that determination must be by the more stringent standard [for quasi-judicial acts].\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 729.) But in that case the agency rendered only <em>one </em>decision: an amendment of the general plan with the concomitant approval of a private development plan. Here, in contrast, the Board made two separate and distinct dispositions: adoption of the quasi-legislative Plan containing water quality objectives for the Delta and issuance of the quasi-judicial Decision determining specific water rights of the projects. The two documents, of course, serve entirely different functions: the Plan is concerned only with water quality standards while the Decision allocates water rights. As a consequence, the two administrative actions must be reviewed under differing standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Factual Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">As earlier discussed, the Plan is quasi-legislative in nature and thus entitled to great deference. Our review is limited to whether the Board\u2019s actions are arbitrary, capricious, or lacking in evidentiary support, or otherwise in violation of procedures required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">However, since the trial court omitted review of the evidentiary administrative record, grounding its decision solely on matters of law, the only question before us with respect to the validity of the Plan is whether the Board acted in the manner required by law.  The established procedures for quasi-legislative acts are few. There is no requirement that \u201cthe agency prepare findings in support of its quasi-legislative decision. [Citations.] It is only when an administrative agency renders an <em>adjudicatory </em>decision that findings are required in order \u2018to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision . . . .\u2019 <em>(Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12].)\u201d <em>(Stauffer Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Air Resources Board </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 789, 794 [180 Cal.Rptr. 550]; see also <em>McKinny </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 79, 88 [181 Cal.Rptr. 549, 642 P.2d 460].)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The remaining issues on appeal are directly related to the Board\u2019s adjudicatory decision imposing new conditions upon the appropriation permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of the projects in order to implement water quality standards contained in the Plan.  In assessing the validity of permit conditions, courts ordinarily apply the conventional \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d rule. <em>(Bank of America </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d 198, 212.) In the context of water rights issues, the rule has been interpreted to require a search of the record for a \u201creasonable factual basis\u201d for the Board\u2019s action. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 208.) Accordingly, in reviewing the challenged conditions, courts must determine whether the conditions are supported by \u201cprecise and specific reasons founded on tangible record evidence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 213; see also <em>Johnson Rancho County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>State Water Rights Board, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.2d 863, 866, 876.)  But again, since neither evidentiary review nor factual resolution was undertaken by the trial court, necessarily we confine our examination to the legal determination whether the Board properly acted within the scope of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In short, the scope of our review is essentially twofold: 1) with respect to D 1485, the only question before us is whether the Board acted within its jurisdiction in imposing the water quality standards upon the projects; 2) with respect to the Plan, the only question is whether the Board acted contrary to procedures required by law. From that perspective, we turn to the parties\u2019 several contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\n<em>Water Quality Standards for Consumptive Uses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"APz\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Use of \u201cWithout Project\u201d Standards for the Central and Western Delta</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The primary purpose underlying the revised water quality standards contained in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Plan was salinity control in order to protect consumptive uses (agricultural, industrial and municipal) of the Delta waters. In adopting water quality standards designed to protect those uses, the Board employed a so-called \u201cwithout project\u201d level of protection: a water quality measurement utilizing the number of days in a year that water of suitable quality would be available at various points in the Delta based on calculated conditions that would (hypothetically) occur without the projects. The objectives, clearly, are to maintain the predicted levels of water quality in the Delta which would theoretically exist had the projects never been constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The trial court concluded that the without project standards were invalid. While we reach a similar conclusion, our analysis focuses upon two erroneous assumptions made by the Board in establishing the qualitative standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">First, the Board viewed \u201cwithout project\u201d as the measure of water flows necessary to protect the existing <em>water rights </em>in the Delta against impairment by the projects.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The approach taken is fundamentally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In its <em>water quality </em>role of setting the level of water quality protection, the Board\u2019s task is not to protect water rights, but to protect \u201cbeneficial uses. \u2019 \u2019 The Board is obligated to adopt a water quality control plan consistent with the overall statewide interest in water quality (\u00a7 13240) which will ensure \u201cthe reasonable protection of <em>beneficial </em>uses\u201d (\u00a7 13241, italics added). Its legislated mission is to protect the \u201cquality of all the waters of the state ... for use and enjoyment by the people of the state.\u201d (\u00a7 13000, 1st par., italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The Board\u2019s attachment to the concept of protecting \u201crights\u201d rather than \u201cbeneficial uses\u201d apparently stems from the assumption that protection of beneficial uses will require maintenance of constant flow levels in the Delta even during water shortages, whereas protection of water rights will permit some variations in water flow depending upon availability since riparians are entitled only to the natural flow. But such a view overlooks the Board\u2019s statutory commitment to establish objectives assuring the <em>\u201creasonable </em>protection of beneficial uses.\u201d (\u00a7 13241; italics added.) We think this statutory charge grants the Board broad discretion to establish reasonable standards consistent with overall statewide interest. The Board\u2019s obligation is to attain the highest reasonable water quality <em>\u201cconsidering all demands being made and to be made on those waters </em>and the total values involved, beneficial and detrimental, economic and social, tangible and intangible.\u201d (\u00a7 13000, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">At common law, holders of water rights were entitled to the natural flow of the water undiminished in quality. <em>(Meridian, Ltd. </em>v. <em>San Francisco, supra, </em>13 Cal.2d 424, 455 [riparians]; <em>Phoenix Water Company </em>v. <em>Fletcher </em>(1863) 23 Cal. 481, 487 [appropriators].) Accordingly, such holders could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>always maintain a nuisance action against upstream polluters. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3479; <em>Albaugh </em>v. <em>Mt. Shasta Power Corp. </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 751, 770-772 [73 P.2d 217] [riparians]; Wright v. Best (1942) 19 Cal.2d 368, 378 [121 P.2d 702] [appropriators]; see generally Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 506-508.) But while common law clearly affords water rights holders relief from pollution, it is debatable whether such protection included the right to require upstream subsequent appropriators to curtail their use of water solely to permit a sufficient flow to resist natural saltwater intrusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In the early case of <em>Antioch </em>v. <em>Williams Irr. Dist. </em>(1922) 188 Cal. 451, the court confronted the issue of saltwater intrusion in the context of appropriators\u2019 rights. In that case, the City of Antioch sought to enjoin upstream diversions of the Sacramento River which depleted the freshwater barrier and allowed Bay salt water to flow into the San Joaquin River, rendering Antioch\u2019s water supply unfit for domestic use. While recognizing the right of appropriators to water in its natural state free of pollution, the court distinguished the case before it from those granting relief from upstream polluters because \u201c[n]othing has been placed in the stream above by the defendants that in the least affects the purity of the water flowing therein. . . . The pollution of the water complained of is caused by the fact that the depleted volume of the stream does not hold back the rising tide of salt water from the bay below as effectually as the natural volume might do.\u201d <em>(Id.., </em>at p. 460.) To allow the freshwater appropriator below to enjoin upstream diversions to maintain a sufficient supply for a hydraulic barrier, the court continued, would be \u201cextremely unreasonable and unjust [to upstream beneficial users] and highly detrimental to the public interests besides.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 465.) The court ultimately concluded that the city\u2019s appropriation rights did not include the right to insist that junior appropriators curtail their upstream use so that a sufficient flow remains to hold back tidal intrusion. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Whatever final conclusion is to be drawn from <em>Antioch </em>regarding the nature and extent of common law riparian rights to salinity control, existing constitutional and legislative authorities encompass the Board\u2019s obligation to protect the quality of the Delta waters from saltwater intrusion. As mentioned above, the water quality legislation unmistakably requires the Board to formulate water quality standards to provide salinity control to \u201censure the reasonable protection of beneficial uses\u201d (\u00a7 13241), a statutory classification earlier noted as wide-ranging (\u00a7 13050, subd. (f)). Though there can be no doubt concerning the Board\u2019s authority to take action necessary to protect the consumptive <em>uses </em>(agricultural, industrial and mu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>nicipal) in the Delta, its approach to that task was seriously flawed by equating its water quality planning function with protection of existing water rights.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The second aspect underlying the challenged standards was the Board\u2019s perception of \u201cwithout project\u201d as the appropriate maximum level of protection in order to make the projects solely responsible for the adverse effects of project operations. That is, the without project standards were formulated to protect the quality of the Delta waters only from degradation by the projects; the Board made no effort to protect against water quality degradation by other users\u2014namely, upstream diverters or polluters. As a consequence, the Board erroneously based its water quality objectives upon the unjustified premise that upstream users retained unlimited access to upstream waters, while the projects and Delta parties were entitled only to share the remaining water flows.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The effect of the Board\u2019s failure to consider upstream users may be illustrated: If the upstream users left enough water in the stream flow to provide salinity control 300 days a year, then under the Board\u2019s approach the objectives would be to maintain that same level of water quality. In contrast, if upstream diversions and pollution effectively reduced salinity control in the Delta to only 200 days a year, the without project standards would maintain that lower level of water quality. We believe such an approach is legally unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In performing its dual role, including development of water quality objectives, the Board is directed to consider not only the availability of unappropriated water (\u00a7 174) but also <em>all </em>competing demands for water in determining what is a reasonable level of water quality protection (\u00a7 13000). In addition, the Board must consider \u201cpast, present, and probable future beneficial uses of water\u201d (\u00a7 13241, subd. (a)) as well as \u201c[wjater quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved through the coordinated control of <em>all </em>factors which affect water quality in the area\u201d (\u00a7 13241, subd. (c), italics added). Unfortunately, the Board neglected to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">In formulating the without project standards, the Board considered only the water use of the Delta parties (denominated \u201cvested water rights\u201d) and the needs of the customers served by the projects (denominated \u201cpublic interest\u201d). No attention was given to water use by the upstream users.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">We do not mean to suggest, as some apparently fear, that the Board must first define or quantify existing water rights before adopting a comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>water quality control plan; obviously, such an omnibus assessment would prove too cumbersome and impractical to accomplish the mandated periodic revisions of water quality control plans. (\u00a7 13240; 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(1).) Rather, the Board need only take the larger view of the water resources in arriving at a reasonable estimate of all water uses, an activity well within its water rights function to determine the availability of unappropriated water. <em>(Temescal Water Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. Public Works, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d 90.) We think a similar global perspective is essential to fulfill the Board\u2019s water quality planning obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">A water quality control plan must contain three elements: (1) beneficial uses to be protected; (2) water quality objectives; and (3) a program of implementation. (\u00a7 13050, subd. (j).) Once the Board establishes water quality objectives which ensure reasonable protection of beneficial uses (\u00a7 13241), the Board has the added responsibility to complete the water quality control plan by preparing an implementation program to achieve the water quality objectives. (\u00a7\u00a7 13240, 13050, subd. (j).) The program of implementation must include: \u201c(a) A description of the nature of actions which are necessary to achieve the objectives, including recommendations for appropriate action by any entity, public or private. [11] (b) A time schedule for the actions to be taken. [11] (c) A description of surveillance to be undertaken to determine compliance with objectives.\u201d (\u00a7 13242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In the present proceeding, the Board sought to implement the objectives of the Plan through D 1485. That is, in reliance upon its combined water quality and water rights authority, the Board modified the appropriation permits held by the U.S. Bureau and by the DWR to require the projects to release more water into the Delta and to curtail their exports of water from the Delta as necessary to maintain the water quality standards required under the Plan. It seems obvious that the Board\u2019s selection of without project standards was a necessary result of its election to exercise its combined functions in a single proceeding. Stated differently, the Board undertook its planning task under the assumption that implementation of the Delta water quality standards would require assertion of its water rights authority in modifying the water rights permits of the projects. Thus, the water quality standards were established only at a level which could be enforced against the projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">We think the procedure followed\u2014combining the water quality and water rights functions in a single proceeding\u2014was unwise. The Legislature issued no mandate that the combined functions be performed in a single proceeding. The fundamental defect inherent in such a procedure is dramatically demonstrated: The Board set only such water quality objectives as could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>enforced against the projects. In short, the Board compromised its important water quality role by defining its scope too narrowly in terms of enforceable water rights. In fact, however, the Board\u2019s water quality obligations are not so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Congress has declared in part that any revised or new water quality standards \u201cshall be such as to protect the public health or welfare [and] enhance the quality of water . . . taking into consideration their use and value for public water supplies, propagation of fish and wildlife, recreational purposes, and agricultural, industrial, and other purposes, and also taking into consideration their use and value for navigation.\u201d (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(2).) Similar legislative goals relating to the Board\u2019s broad planning function are to be found in the state statutes discussed. (\u00a7\u00a7 13000 [statewide program for water quality control], 13241 [water quality control plan to establish objectives ensuring reasonable protection of beneficial uses and prevention of nuisance].) But nothing in the federal act or California\u2019s Porter-Cologne Act allows the Board to limit the scope of its basin-planning function to such water quality standards as are enforceable under the Board\u2019s water rights authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">We are quick to add, however, that the without project standards do have a place in the water quality program. As discussed in part IIA <em>(infra), </em>we think the imposition of without project standards <em>upon the projects </em>represents one reasonable method of achieving water quality control in the Delta. But in order to fulfill adequately its water quality planning obligations, we believe the Board cannot ignore other actions which could be taken to achieve Delta water quality, such as remedial actions to curtail excess diversions and pollution by other water users.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In summary, we conclude that the Board failed to carry out properly its water quality planning obligations. Because the water quality objectives set at without project level of protection were not established in the manner required by law, they are found to be invalid.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, since remand to the Board could serve no useful purpose in light of the Board\u2019s announced intention to conduct hearings during 1986 to establish new and revised standards, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment which commands the Board to reconsider the Water Quality Control Plan. Of course, we would expect the renewed proceedings to be conducted in light of the principles and views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Adequacy of Interim Standard for the Southern Delta</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">For reasons substantially similar to those expressed regarding the water quality standards for the central and western Delta, we find the Board also erred with respect to the water quality standards designed to protect agricultural uses in the southern Delta.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In this region water quality degradation is caused not by oceanwater intrusion but mainly by upstream depletions of the San Joaquin River and salt infusion from irrigation waste-water runoff carried by the San Joaquin River. The SWP has no facilities on the San Joaquin River system. Although the CVP includes the Friant Project on the San Joaquin River and the New Melones Project on the Stanislaus River, the permits for these facilities were not before the Board in the present proceeding. Consequently, the Board believed it could not modify the CVP permits that <em>were </em>before the Board to effectively resolve the southern. Delta writer quality problems.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Instead, the Board retained the southern Delta agricultural water quality standard formerly adopted in the Basin 5B Plan (the \u201cVernalis\u201d standard). The Board viewed the Vernalis standard as a temporary or \u201cinterim\u201d level of protection while observing that a more permanent solution would be obtained through construction of physical facilities to provide better circulation and substitute supplies. But even that interim standard was made conditional upon the operation of the New Melon\u00e9s Project.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The trial court invalidated the southern Delta agricultural standard, in part, because it did riot provide full.protection to the. southern Delta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>riparians. In this respect, we think the trial court erred.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As detailed in our earlier discussion, the Board had no obligation to set water quality standards so as to provide salinity control to the southern Delta riparians. The Board\u2019s paramount duty was to provide \u201creasonable protection\u201d to beneficial uses, considering all the demands made upon the water. (\u00a7\u00a7 13000, 13241.) Whether the interim standard for the southern Delta provides a reasonable level of protection presented a question of fact requiring review of the administrative record. Since none took place, as explained, the trial court should not have invalidated the southern Delta standard on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Nevertheless, the approach taken by the Board, replicating the without project model, is similarly flawed. Once again, the Board confused its dual functions. Although the Board instigated a suitable program of implementation focusing on modification of the projects\u2019 permits, it set only such standards as could be achieved by such implementation, omitting any standards for the southern Delta because the permits of the projects before the Board were not responsible for the water quality degradation in that region.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To repeat our earlier observation, the Board\u2019s water quality obligations are much broader both in purpose and in scope. (\u00a7\u00a7 13000, 13241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Water quality objectives, we realize, may not always be readily enforceable. The statutory factors enumerated in section 13242, particularly the provisions for recommended action and time schedule, reflect the Legislature\u2019s recognition that an implementing program may be a lengthy and complex process requiring action by entities over which the Board has little or no control and also requiring significant time intervals. Thus, we do not believe that difficulty in enforcement justifies a bypass of the legislative imperative to establish water quality objectives which, in the judgment of the Board, will ensure reasonable protection of beneficial uses.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>In view of the Board\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of the Porter-Cologne Act, we conclude that the agricultural standard for the southern Delta was not established in the manner required by law. However, in light of the Board\u2019s announced intention to establish revised standards for the region, we decline to remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment commanding the Board to reconsider the Water Quality Control Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\n<em>Enforcement of Water Quality Standards for Consumptive Uses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Validity of Program Limited to Projects</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The issue of appropriate enforcement methods revolves principally about the Board\u2019s Water Right Decision 1485 modifying permits of the projects as a means to implement the (without project) water quality standards. We examine that issue and its permutations in the context of the Board\u2019s statutory powers and duties and the interests at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Although the Board is obligated to establish a program for implementing the water quality objectives, including a description of necessary actions (\u00a7 13242), one of the major uncertainties in the water quality legislation concerns the scope of the Board\u2019s power to take actions necessary to implement the water quality standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">It is settled law that all property is held subject to the exercise of the police power of the state, which may regulate its use and enjoyment for the public benefit. (See generally, <em>Penn Central Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 104, 124-125 [57 L.Ed.2d 631, 648-649, 98 S.Ct. 2646]; see also <em>Gin S. Chow </em>v. <em>City of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>217 Cal. 673, 702-703; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>v. <em>Forni, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 743, 753.)  There is little doubt that the state may undertake to regulate environmental quality notwithstanding the resulting limitation imposed on the free use of property rights. <em>(Morshead </em>v. <em>California Regional Water Quality Control Bd. </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 442, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>449 [119 Cal.Rptr. 586] [limitation on sewer connections until water quality standards met]; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Contra Costa County Water Dist. </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 404, 408 [95 Cal.Rptr. 852] [termination of water service until protective device installed to avoid contamination of public water supply]; see also <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Bay Area Air etc. Control Dist. </em>(1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 850 [48 Cal.Rptr. 295] [air quality]; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>California Coastal Zone Conservation Com. </em>(1975) 55 Cal.App.3d 889 [127 Cal.Rptr. 786] [coastal conservation]; <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 678 [183 Cal.Rptr. 395] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">What is uncertain, however, is the nature of the <em>Board\u2019s </em>power to enforce water quality. The Legislature has not adequately authorized the Board to exercise the state police power to compel compliance with water quality standards. Section 13000 provides, in part, \u201cthat activities and factors which may affect the quality of the waters of the state shall be regulated\u201d to attain the highest water quality reasonably possible, and the public welfare requirement for a statewide program invokes a correlative state duty \u201cto <em>exercise its full power ... to protect the quality of waters in the state from degradation </em>...\u201d <em>{passim, </em>italics added). But the nature of the <em>Board\u2019s </em>authority to regulate activities affecting water quality is unspecified.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The Board is singularly responsible for adopting state <em>policy </em>for water quality control (\u00a7 13140), defined to mean \u201cthe regulation of <em>any activity or factor\u201d </em>affecting water quality, including cure and prevention of water pollution and nuisance. (\u00a7 13050, subd. (i), italics added.) Moreover, the state policy adopted must include \u201c [w]ater quality objectives at key locations for planning <em>and operation </em>of water . . . projects and for water quality control <em>activities.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 13142, subd. (b), italics added.) These statutes grant wide authority to the Board in its <em>planning </em>role to identify activities of the projects and other water users requiring correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In contrast, the Board\u2019s enforcement powers are far from clear.  Though the Board has been given express statutory authority to regulate waste discharges (\u00a7\u00a7 13320-13389), excess salinity due to tidal water intrusion certainly does <em>not </em>qualify as \u201cwaste.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>\n                   Apart from regulating waste discharge, the Board\u2019s express authority to implement water quality standards seems limited to <em>recommending </em>actions by other entities. (\u00a7 13242, subd. (a).) Indeed, the regional boards who ordinarily formulate water quality control plans (\u00a7 13240) are empowered only to <em>\u201c[e]ncourage </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>regional planning . . . for water quality control\u201d and to <em>\u201c[rjequest </em>enforcement by appropriate [public] agencies of their respective water quality control.\u201d (\u00a7 13225, subds. (d), (i), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Both state and federal acts require their public agency counterparts to comply with state water quality controls. (\u00a7 13247; 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1323.) But the Legislature has thus far denied the Board explicit authority to enforce compliance, a recognized weakness in using water quality standards to control water purity. <em>(EPA </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Board, supra, </em>426 U.S. 200, 204, 206 [48 L.Ed.2d 578, 583, 584].) Enforcement authority\u2014in the form of clear and direct orders, injunctive relief and civil penalties\u2014is provided only for unauthorized discharge of pollutants. (\u00a7\u00a7 13320, 13331, 13340, 13350, 13386.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In the absence of explicit legislative authority to regulate water users, the principal enforcement mechanism available to the Board is its regulation of water <em>rights </em>to control diversions which cause degradation of water quality. Congress has expressly declared a policy of noninterference with state authority \u201cto allocate [water] quantities . . . within its jurisdiction\u201d and has declined \u201cto supersede or abrogate [water] rights . . . established by any State. . . .\u201d (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(g).) This section has been interpreted by at least one federal court to mean that the major responsibility for regulating water quality has been left to the states to permit water quality and water rights decisions to be coordinated. <em>(National Wildlife Federation </em>v. <em>Gorsuch, supra, </em>693 F.2d 156, 178-179, and fn. 67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">California, of course, has already combined both water resource functions within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board. The stated purpose of this merger was to ensure that \u201cconsideration of water pollution and water quality\u201d would become an integral part of the appropriative rights process. (\u00a7 174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">In the 1978 proceedings the Board, as noted, exercised its water rights authority as a means to implement the water quality standards for the Delta. In D 1485 the Board modified the appropriation permits held by the projects to require them to reduce their exports or release more water into the Delta to maintain the water quality standards contained in the Plan.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The role of the Board in acting upon permit applications has been aptly described by this court as a \u201cnecessary balancing process\u201d requiring \u201cmaximum flexibility\u201d in considering competing demands of flows for instream purposes and diversions for agricultural, industrial, domestic and other consumptive uses to arrive at the public interest. <em>(Fullerton </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 590, 603 [153 Cal.Rptr. 518].)  We think the Board could properly conclude that the public interest in the projects requires that they be held responsible only for water quality degradation resulting from the projects\u2019 own operations. Although we hold the without project standards inadequate to fulfill the Board\u2019s obligations to set water quality objectives for the Delta (pt. IA, <em>ante), </em>we nevertheless find no legal impediment to the Board\u2019s use of such standards to enforce water quality objectives against the projects themselves. The implementation program was flawed by reason of the Board\u2019s failure, in its water quality role, to take suitable enforcement action against other users as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">At least with respect to the southern Delta, the Board seemed aware of its obligation: first, in declaring its intent to take appropriate action in the absence of agreement for construction of new facilities;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> next, in noting the right of the southern Delta riparians to protection against harmful diversions or pollution by upstream users and the conditions subjecting the projects to prior vested rights.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Yet despite awareness of its \u201cbroad enforcement authority\u201d to set and implement suitable water quality objectives ensuring the reasonable protection of beneficial uses in the Delta, the Board\u2014we are advised\u2014took no further action. We presume the Board\u2019s scheduled 1986 hearings will not only seek to remedy that glaring omission, but also result in a comprehensive program to implement such objectives which will include the projects <em>and </em>other users along the watercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Authority of Board to Modify Permits to Enforce Water Quality Control Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The U.S. Bureau and federal contractors argue strongly that the Board had no authority to modify or interfere with the appropriative rights held by the U.S. Bureau for operation of the CVP.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> They contend that once an appropriation permit is issued, it is final and nonmodifiable. We disagree and will conclude that the Board\u2019s actions are supported on two independent grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\n<em>Reserved Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">In the present proceedings the Board explicitly grounded its authority to impose water quality standards on the CVP on its reserved jurisdiction. The trial court agreed. The trial court confirmed the Board\u2019s authority to modify the appropriation permits of the U.S. Bureau because the Board expressly reserved jurisdiction in Decision 990 and related decisions affecting the CVP to coordinate the terms and conditions with the SWP. The record of the Board\u2019s decisions in issuing permits for each unit of the CVP (reported in the margin) supports the court\u2019s determination that jurisdiction to coordinate the terms of project units was expressly reserved.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The Board\u2019s authority to reserve jurisdiction to amend permits and to \u201ccoordinate\u201d the terms of the permits with those of other units of the projects was expressly conferred by the Legislature in 1959. During that banner year of water resources legislation, section 1394 was enacted granting authority to the Board to reserve jurisdiction in order to impose new terms and conditions as necessary.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Review of the statutory language strongly indicates that the section was designed with the major projects uppermost in mind. During the same session of the Legislature, coordination of the SWP and the CVP was a consistent legislative goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">First, the Legislature enacted the Burns-Porter Act authorizing the SWP, a large-scale project contemplated as part of a \u201ccoordinated plan\u201d for the development, utilization or conservation of California\u2019s water resources. (\u00a7\u00a7 10500, 10504.5.) The DWR was empowered to \u201cco-operate with the United States\u201d for the public benefits to be derived from the project. (\u00a7 11500, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">During the same legislative session, the Delta Protection Act was passed requiring the. SWP to provide salinity control in the Delta \u201cin coordination with the activities of the United States . . . through operation of the Federal Central Valley Project . . .\u201d (\u00a7 12202) and further requiring integration of \u201cthe operation and management of [storage] releases . . . into the . . . Delta . . . [for use outside the area of origin] to the maximum extent possible . . . ..\u201d (\u00a7 12205.) Thus, there can be little doubt that in enacting section 1394, the Legislature clearly intended to grant the Board the authority it claimed\u2014to reserve jurisdiction over the projects\u2019 permits to enable the Board to coordinate the terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Salinity control in the Delta was unquestionably contemplated by state and federal authorities as one of the purposes to be fulfilled by the statewide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>water projects: the U.S. Congress when authorizing the CVP (Sen.Rep. No. 1325, 72d Cong. (1933)); and the California Legislature when authorizing the SWP to function \u201cin coordination with the [CVP] activities . . . in providing salinity control for the Delta . . .\u201d (\u00a7 12202). Consequently, in an effort to coordinate the operations of the projects, the Board imposed a new term\u2014\u201cTerm 2\u201d\u2014which compels the projects to provide salinity control in the Delta by maintaining the water quality standards contained in the Plan. We have no hesitancy in concluding that such an action was within the Board\u2019s authority to amend or modify permit terms and conditions. (\u00a7 1394.) As long as the Board had reserved jurisdiction to impose conditions for salinity control in at least one of the project permits, it retained the power and jurisdiction to \u201ccoordinate\u201d the permits and impose similar conditions upon all. As a pragmatic matter, the operations of the CVP and the SWP are inextricably interrelated. Both projects use portions of the Sacramento River and the many channels of the Delta as conduits for the transfer of water. Such natural conjoint use of the Delta is plainly conducive to the imposition of similar terms and conditions by the single state agency responsible for water quality standards and compliance. Any other conclusion, we think, would be wholly unreasonable and contrary to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\n<em>Unreasonable Use</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Independent of its reserved powers, we think the Board was authorized to modify the permit terms under its power to prevent waste or unreasonable use or methods of diversion of water. All water rights, including appropriative, are subject to the overriding constitutional limitation that water use must be reasonable. (Cal. Const., art. X, \u00a7 2; \u00a7 100; see also <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 183 [161 Cal.Rptr. 466, 605 P.2d 1].) The Board is expressly commissioned to carry out that policy. (\u00a7 1050.) To that end, the Board is empowered to institute necessary judicial, legislative or administrative proceedings to prevent waste or unreasonable use (\u00a7 275; Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 23, \u00a7 764.11), including imposition of new permit terms (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 23, \u00a7 761). Moreover, all permits of the projects are subject to the continuing authority of the Board to prevent unreasonable use. (See generally, <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>v. <em>Forni, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 743, 753.) .</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Determination of reasonable use depends upon the totality of the circumstances presented: \u201c\u2018The scope and technical complexity of issues concerning water resource management are unequalled by virtually any other type of activity presented to the courts. What constitutes reasonable water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>use is dependent upon not only the entire circumstances presented but varies as the current situation changes. . . . \u201c[W]hat is a reasonable use of water depends on the circumstances of each case, such an inquiry cannot be resolved <em>in vacuo </em>from statewide considerations of transcendent importance.\u201d\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>East Bay Mun. Utility Dist., supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 183, 194.)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Here, the Board'determined that changed circumstances revealed in new information about the adverse effects of the projects upon the Delta necessitated revised water quality standards. Accordingly, the Board had the authority to modify the projects\u2019 permits to curtail their use of water on the ground that the projects\u2019 use and diversion of the water had become unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Though we are mindful that the Board made no <em>express </em>finding of unreasonable use, such underlying finding is implicit in the Board\u2019s decision to impose without project standards upon the projects to prevent \u201cany material deterioration of water quality which would impair its usefulness for . . . senior right holders.\u201d Curtailment of project activities through reduced storage and export was eminently reasonable and proper to maintain the required level of water quality in the Delta.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">We perceive no legal obstacle to the Board\u2019s determination that particular methods of use have become unreasonable by their deleterious effects upon water quality. Obviously, some accommodation must be reached concerning the major public interests at stake: the quality of valuable water resources and transport of adequate supplies for needs southward. The decision is essentially a policy judgment requiring a balancing of the competing public interests, one the Board is uniquely qualified to make in view of its special knowledge and expertise and its combined statewide responsibility to allocate the rights to, and to control the quality of, state water resources. (\u00a7 174.)  We conclude, finally, that the Board\u2019s power to prevent unreasonable methods of use should be broadly interpreted to enable the Board to strike the proper balance between the interests in water quality and project activities in order to objectively determine whether a reasonable method of use is manifested.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Joint Responsibility to Maintain and Monitor Water Quality</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In 1960 the U.S. Bureau and the DWR entered into a preliminary agreement for the coordinated operation of the two projects. That agreement provides for a sharing of water in the Delta in times of shortage \u201cafter the consumptive use requirements of the Delta Lowlands are met\u201d and commits the projects to meet certain requirements \u201cfor navigation, fish conservation, outflows from the Delta, and water service through direct diversions from [Feather River waters] ... to the Delta Lowlands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In its Plan the Board determined that project operations were to be \u201ccoordinated\u201d; thus, in its Decision implementing the Plan involving modification of some 34 permits held by the projects, the Board made the projects equally responsible for maintaining water quality and for monitoring water quality in the Delta. Under the provisions of \u201cTerm 2\u201d of the Decision, the required water quality standards are to be maintained by the projects\u2019 reduction at the pumps, release of natural flow or storage, operation of the Delta Cross Channel gates or by any combination thereof.  The U.S. Bureau has challenged the Board\u2019s authority to impose joint responsibility, contending that the Board\u2019s action impaired its prior vested water rights.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In denying reconsideration, the Board disclaimed any intent to alter the relative priorities of the projects. Instead, the Board\u2014aware of project negotiations for a new joint operating agreement<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>\u2014committed resolution of the details of implementing the standards to the projects\u2019 cooperative efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The trial court\u2019s determination of this issue was twofold: first, that the Board\u2019s Decision erroneously altered the priority of the CVP permits; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>secondly, that by virtue of the 1960 agreement, the U.S. Bureau had waived its priority with respect to <em>consumptive </em>uses in the Delta. In essence, the trial court\u2019s ruling invalidated the Board\u2019s Decision with respect to the standards for nonconsumptive uses. We think the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">As previously discussed, the projects\u2019 permits were subject to the reserved jurisdiction of the Board to \u201ccoordinate\u201d project operations. Those activities are inextricably interrelated: the projects use parts of the Sacramento River and Delta channels in their transfer of water. Such natural intermingling and integrated use plainly requires coordination by the Board, a function clearly contemplated by the Legislature. (\u00a7\u00a7 12202, 12205.) Thus, in our view, the Board\u2019s power to modify the permits pursuant to its reserved jurisdiction includes the authority to impose responsibility to maintain water quality upon the projects equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Our determination is supported by relevant statutory and case law. The issuance of a permit grants the right to appropriate water \u201conly to the extent . . . allowed in the permit\u201d (\u00a7 1381) subject to the conditions enumerated therein, (\u00a7 1391) including reserved jurisdiction of the Board (\u00a7 1394).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Moreover, the power of the Board to set permit terms and conditions (\u00a7 1253) includes the power to consider the <em>\u201crelative </em>benefit\u201d to be derived. (\u00a7 1257.) If the Board is authorized to weigh the values of competing beneficial uses, then logically it should also be authorized to alter the historic rule of \u201cfirst in time, first in right\u201d by imposing permit conditions which give a higher priority to a more preferred beneficial use even though later in time. (See Hutchins, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 105-106, 131-132, 173-174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\"><em>East Bay M. U. Dist. </em>v. <em>Dept. of P. Wks., supra, </em>1 Cal.2d 476, is instructive. In that case, involving a permit for use of the Mokelumne River for power purposes, the Board imposed the condition that such use \u201cshall not interfere with future appropriations of said water for agricultural or municipal purposes,\u201d the two highest uses of water. (\u00a7\u00a7 106, 1254.) Consequently, East Bay MUD\u2019s permit became subordinate to future permits, contrary to the recognized \u201cfirst-in-time\u201d priority system. The Supreme Court upheld the Board\u2019s action over the objections of East Bay MUD, reasoning as follows: \u201c[Ujnless and until the statutory requirements and conditions are met, the applicant obtains no property right or any other right against the state. If the statutory prerequisites are not present, the application may be rejected in its entirety or, as here done, a permit may be issued with qualifications as to use of the water.... Clearly, the manner in which the unappropriated waters of the streams of the state shall be distributed among the applicants therefor involves questions of policy, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>the legislature, in the interest of the public welfare, may prescribe reasonable conditions and priorities in such distribution. . . . Where the facts justify the action, the water authority should be allowed to impose, in the public interest, the restrictions and conditions provided for in the act.\u201d (1 Cal.2d at pp. 480-481.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Such reasoning is equally applicable here. The scope and priority of appropriative rights are properly defined by the Board acting within its powers to consider the relative benefits of competing interests and to impose such conditions as are necessary to protect the public interest. Here, the projects\u2019 permits were issued subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the Board to coordinate project operations. D 1485 was an exercise of that continuing jurisdiction. Accordingly, when the Board imposed Term 2\u2014 requiring equal responsibility for maintaining the water quality standards\u2014 it acted well within its authority and did not infringe upon or otherwise unlawfully impair the \u201cvested\u201d appropriative rights of the U.S. Bureau, which held its permits subject to the exercise of such authority.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\n<em>Monitoring</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Although the additional requirement of joint monitoring was not challenged below, the trial court nonetheless held it invalid on the ground that the Board failed to consider the costs of monitoring activities, which the court characterized as \u201cwasteful.\u201d The trial court relied, erroneously we believe, upon the obligation of the Board to consider \u201ceconomic effects\u201d in setting water quality standards. (\u00a7 13241, subd. (d).) The monitoring provisions are not part of the water quality <em>objectives </em>but rather an integral provision of the Board\u2019s Decision concerning implementation of such objectives. Indeed, a program of implementation requires consideration of monitoring activities through \u201c[a] description of surveillance to be undertaken to determine compliance with objectives.\u201d (\u00a7 13242, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">We conclude that the Board acted within its authority in imposing a monitoring condition. Whether the monitoring program chosen is reasonable was a question of fact which could only be decided after review of the administrative record, a procedure not followed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Interference With Congressional Purposes</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The U.S. Bureau has consistently resisted efforts by the Board to compel compliance with water quality standards exceeding the so-called \u201cTracy standards,\u201d the agreed level of water quality under the terms of its contracts with its export customers. At trial the U.S. Bureau argued unsuccessfully that the Board lacked authority to regulate a federal facility. We agree with the trial court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">When authorized for federal financing, the CVP was made expressly subject to the reclamation laws. Section 8 of the federal Reclamation Act of 1902 (43 U.S.C. \u00a7 383)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> has been interpreted by our highest court to require the Bureau, in its operation of the CVP, to abide by state law with respect to the acquisition of water rights. <em>(California </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 645 [57 L.Ed.2d 1018, 98 S.Ct. 2985]; see also <em>South Delta Water Agency </em>v. <em>U.S. Dept. of Int. </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 767 F.2d 531, 536-538.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In <em>California </em>v. <em>United States, </em>the State Water Resources Control Board had approved the application of the U.S. Bureau to appropriate water from the Stanislaus River for operation of the New Melones Project (a unit of the CVP) subject to a number of conditions and limitations. The Bureau sought a judicial declaration that California lacked the authority to impose conditions on the federal project once the Board had determined that unappropriated water was available. In rejecting the argument, the U.S. Supreme Court held that under section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902, state-imposed conditions were valid as long as such conditions were not \u201cinconsistent with congressional directives . . . .\u201d (438 U.S. at p. 679 [57 L.Ed.2d at p. 1041].)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">On remand for determination whether the conditions imposed were inconsistent with congressional directives, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the challenged conditions. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>State of Cal., State Water Resources </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 694 F.2d 1171 <em>[New Melones II].) </em>The court of appeals clarified the test for \u201cconsistency\u201d as follows: \u201c[A] state limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>or condition on the federal management or control of a federally financed water project is valid unless it clashes with express or clearly implied congressional intent or works at cross-purposes with an important federal interest served by the congressional scheme.\u201d (694 F.2d at p. 1177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The U.S. Bureau\u2019s contention that the Board-imposed conditions for salinity control are inconsistent with congressional directives is premised on the following analysis: The early congressional authorization for construction of the CVP provided that \u201cthe . . . dam and reservoirs shall be used, first, for river regulation, improvement of navigation, and flood control; second, for irrigation and domestic uses; and, third, for power\u201d (50 Stat. 850 (1937)); thus one of the main congressional purposes of the CVP was to provide water for export for irrigation and domestic uses. Salinity control in the Delta was merely an incidental benefit; Congress never intended water quality or salinity control to take priority over exporting water to water-deficient areas in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In response, the Board argues that \u201criver regulation,\u201d the first priority stated, includes salinity control. The trial court adopted this interpretation, which we now approve.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In 1933 a special Senate subcommittee investigation of water shortage problems in the Central Valley noted the problem of saltwater invasion from the bay into the lower river and Delta channels (contaminating irrigation and industrial water) due in part to <em>\u201csubnormal stream flow </em>during . . . drought and ... the <em>reduction inflow </em>naturally available due to upstream irrigation and storage diversions.\u201d (Engle, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Sen.Rep. No. 1325, 72d Cong. (1933) pp. 495-496, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In a report by the Corps of Engineers the division engineer noted that a saltwater barrier dam was economically infeasible, and that saltwater incursion in the Delta \u201ccan best be prevented and a reasonable restoration of original <em>stream flow conditions </em>made, by securing a minimum discharge of 3,300 cubic feet per second at Antioch by the construction of the [Shasta] Reservoir.\u201d The Board of Engineers concurred, concluding that relief from such incursion could best be obtained \u201cfrom <em>increased flows </em>obtained from the [Shasta] Reservoir.\u201d (Engle, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pt. 1, H.R. Doc. No. 191, 73d Cong. (1933) pp. 514, 518, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">In authorizing $20 million of emergency relief funds for the CVP, President Roosevelt declared \u201c[t]he purpose [of the project] is to store and conserve flood and waste waters of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries so that the entire flow can be used for flood control, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>improvement of navigation, irrigation, the development of hydroelectric power, and the protection of the delta lands at the junction of the two rivers against injury from salt.\u201d (Engle, <em>op. cit. </em>supra, pt. 1, Exec. Order (Sept. 10, 1935) p. 560.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Under the terms of the federal River and Harbor Act of 1937 reauthorizing the CVP, the stated purposes included <em>\u201cregulating the flow </em>of the San Joaquin River and the Sacramento River, controlling floods, <em>providing for storage and for the delivery of the stored waters </em>thereof, for the reclamation of arid and semiarid lands . . . and other beneficial uses, [including electric energy] . . .\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> subject to the proviso that paramount priority be given to river regulation, improvement of navigation, and flood control. (50 Stat. 850, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Viewed against that historical background, \u201criver regulation\u201d may reasonably be interpreted as authority for storage and release of water in order to maintain necessary consistency in the stream flows. Such a significant purpose includes provision for additional release of stored water to prevent intrusive saltwater damage. We are convinced that salinity control was an integral part of the announced congressional purposes possessing a priority at least equal to that of transport to water-deficient areas. Thus, we conclude that the Board was fully authorized to impose the challenged water quality, standards or conditions, a regulatory exercise which we determine to be consistent with congressional directives.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Our conclusion is buttressed by related expressions of congressional intent. The federal W\u00e1ter Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) commands the states to prepare water quality control plans and to review them periodically. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(1).) Pursuant to these congressional directives, the Board adopted the Delta Plan and revised the water quality objectives to provide for greater salinity control. Moreover, section 313 of the FWPCA requires federal facilities to comply with state water quality controls. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1323(a).) In light of these circumstances reflecting congressional endorsement of water quality plans and salinity control, we conclude that the conditions imposed upon the CVP permits to further such compatible goals are not facially inconsistent with congressional directives.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The U.S. Bureau further insists that an evidentiary hearing is necessary to determine whether the effect of the Board\u2019s Decision upon the CVP <em>in fact </em>interferes with congressional purposes. We disagree. Although we recognize that the consistency issue is ordinarily a factual one (see <em>California </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>438 U.S. 645, 679; <em>New Melones II, supra, </em>694 F.2d 1171, 1174), in light of the Board\u2019s announced intention to establish new water quality standards at its scheduled hearings, we decline to remand the matter for such belated factual determination. At the ensuing Board hearings, the U.S. Bureau will have ample opportunity to present evidence supporting any claim of inconsistency with congressional purposes; and the Board\u2019s determination would, of course, be subject to judicial review.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We trust, in parallel expectation, that \u201c[a] spirit of cooperative federalism on both sides may accommodate the inevitable tensions and conflicts incident upon federal operation of an intrastate project, so that the legal question is never presented for adjudication.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 1182.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The Contra Costa Canal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Included within the Plan are salinity control standards for the protection of municipal and industrial uses of water taken from the Contra Costa Canal, one of the initial units of the CVP. (\u00a7\u00a7 11215-11216.) The canal provides water for about 240,000 people and a number of industries throughout eastern and central Contra Costa County. Water is diverted from the Delta at Rock Slough, then lifted by pumps into the canal and transported westerly some 47 miles through Contra Costa County. (See generally Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>p. 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The canal is operated by the Contra Costa Water District under a long-term purchase contract with the U.S. Bureau. (Engle, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pt. 2, pp. 213-240.) Under the terms of the original agreement, the U.S. Bureau assumed no responsibility with respect to the quality of the water to be furnished but agreed that the district would not be obligated to accept and pay for any water \u201cwhich contains in excess of twenty-five (25) parts by weight of chloride per one hundred thousand (100,000) parts of water.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>(Engle, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pt. 2, p. 220.)<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In 1970, the contract was amended to provide that project operations \u201cshall be performed in such manner as is practicable to maintain the quality of raw water to be delivered hereunder at the highest level reasonably attainable and consistent with M&amp;I [municipal and industrial] use. . . .\u201d However, the quality of water furnished is without warranty as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\n<em>Municipal Uses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">As earlier discussed, the Board employed without project standards to protect the existing water rights of Delta water users. The rights purportedly protected by the Board include not only common law water rights (riparian and appropriative) but also certain statutory \u201cwatershed\u201d rights.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The Contra Costa Water District holds neither riparian nor appropriation rights. Nevertheless, Delta water users enjoy certain statutory protections restricting project exports and requiring the projects to leave enough water in the Delta for purposes of salinity control.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Watershed or area-of-origin protective legislation was enacted during the formative years of the projects in order to alleviate the fear of Northern California interests that local water supplies would become depleted. (See generally Rogers &amp; Nichols, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 115-117; Hutchins, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 143-145.) In 1931 the Legislature enacted section 10505 which prohibits the DWR from assigning appropriative rights which would deprive the county of origin of water necessary for its development.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In 1933, contemporaneous with legislation authorizing construction of the CVP, the Legislature also enacted the Watershed Protection Act. (\u00a7\u00a7 11460-11463.) Under the provisions of section 11460, DWR project operations cannot deprive \u201ca watershed or area wherein water originates, or an area imme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>diately adjacent thereto which can conveniently be supplied with water therefrom, ... of the prior right to all of the water reasonably required to adequately supply the beneficial needs of the watershed, area, . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> A similar limitation upon federal agencies was later imposed. (\u00a7 11128.)<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Virtually none of this protective legislation has been interpreted by the courts. (But see generally <em>City of Fresno </em>v. <em>California </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 627, 630 [10 L.Ed.2d 28, 30-31, 83 S.Ct. 996].) The Attorney General, however, has construed the watershed and county-of-origin statutes as having a common purpose: to reserve to the areas of origin an undefined preferential right to future water needs. (25 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 8, 10 (1955).) The established priority does not create an individual \u201cwater right\u201d (\u00a7 11462; <em>id., </em>at p. 20) but rather a grant which is wholly inchoate. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 21.) As the needs of a watershed inhabitant develop, he must make and perfect a regular application to appropriate water; the Board must issue the permit despite the needs of the projects, and the water projects must honor the vested water right thus created. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Attorney General further concluded that if such needs can only be met by augmentation of the natural flow, then the watershed inhabitant must pay compensation to the projects. (25 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 23-24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In 1959, when the SWP was authorized, the Legislature enacted the Delta Protection Act. (\u00a7\u00a7 12200-12220.) The Legislature recognized the unique water problems in the Delta, particularly \u201csalinity intrusion,\u201d which mandates the need for such special legislation \u201cfor the protection, conservation, development, control and use of the waters in the Delta for the public good.\u201d (\u00a7 12200.) The act prohibits project exports from the Delta of water necessary to provide water to which the Delta users are \u201centitled\u201d and water which is needed for salinity control and an adequate supply for Delta users.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> (\u00a7\u00a7 12202, 12203, 12204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">But the crucial question left unanswered by the protective legislation is exactly <em>what </em>level of salinity control the projects must provide. As noted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the Board concluded that the projects are responsible only for maintaining that level of salinity which would exist in the Delta had the projects never been constructed, the so-called \u201cwithout project\u201d level. The Board declared that if the Delta water users desire a higher level of protection (a greater amount of outflow water), they can purchase such \u201cenhancement water\u201d from the projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">With respect to the drinking water standards, however, the Board followed a different approach. In formulating the water quality standards to protect municipal uses, the Board set a minimum level of protection of 250 mg/1 chloride concentration, the threshold level required by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300f-300j-10) and California\u2019s Pure Drinking Water Law (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 4010 et seq.; Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 22, \u00a7 64473). The Board selected the higher standards in order <em>to ensure the public health, </em>notwithstanding the recipients\u2019 lack of water rights.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> But although the Board determined that the recipients must pay for the additional \u201cenhancement water,\u201d it left the question of compensation for benefits received \u201cfor resolution by the project operators and municipalities involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The U.S. Bureau, together with the state and federal contractors, argued below that the Board had no authority to compel the projects to provide extra water in order to protect the quality of canal waters because the district has no vested water rights. Any additional water, it is argued, must be purchased by the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The trial court agreed and held the drinking water standards for the Contra Costa Canal invalid. The court reasoned that since the district had neither riparian, appropriative nor perfected watershed rights, the district was limited to its contractual rights, and it had \u201cbargained away\u201d its right to water of a specified quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The question thus presented is troublesome. Yet, a careful analysis impels the conclusion that the court\u2019s basic premise\u2014that water quality protection hinges on ownership of water rights\u2014is faulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">As discussed earlier, in performing its <em>planning </em>function, the Board is authorized to establish water quality objectives which in its judgment will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ensure \u201cthe reasonable protection of <em>beneficial uses </em>...\u201d(\u00a7 13241, italics added), a concept embracing a wide spectrum of consumptive and nonconsumptive, instream uses. (\u00a7 13050, subd. (f).) Thus, the Board\u2019s authority in setting water quality standards is <em>not </em>limited to the protection of water rights but extends to the protection of <em>all beneficial uses </em>from degradation of water quality, even if the resulting level of water quality exceeds that provided by water rights. Accordingly, we conclude that the Board acted within its broad water quality planning authority to set standards to protect municipal or domestic supplies.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><em>Enforcement </em>of the standards, however, presents an entirely different issue. Succinctly stated, the question is whether the Board has authority to compel the projects to comply with such water quality standards. The purpose of the trial court\u2019s ruling, it seems apparent, was not to invalidate the standards themselves but rather to deny the Board\u2019s attempt to compel compliance by the projects to supply salinity control water free of charge. We think the court\u2019s ruling was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\"> Under its reserved jurisdiction to modify the permits (\u00a7 1394), the Board was authorized to impose upon the projects water qu\u00e1lity standards at whatever level of protection the Board found reasonable (\u00a7 13241), whether \u201cwithout project\u201d or greater.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> By the very nature of the reserved jurisdiction, the Board was empowered to impose such terms and conditions upon the project permits as would in its judgment best serve \u201cthe public interest.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 1253, 1257, 1258; <em>Johnson Rancho County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>State Water Rights Board, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.2d 863; <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d 198, 212.) While the scope of that duty requires consideration of the public benefits derived from the projects (\u00a7 1256), it also requires that water quality needs be taken into account. (\u00a7\u00a7 1243.5, 1257, 1258, 13000.) Nothing in the statutory scheme limits the Board\u2019s supervisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>authority over appropriation permits to provide a level of water quality protection which exceeds the quality afforded by water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Further, as discussed before, the Board has the separate and additional power to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent unreasonable use or methods of diversion. (Cal. Const., art. X, \u00a7 2; \u00a7\u00a7 275, 1050; Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 761, 764.11.) That independent basis of authority vests jurisdiction in the Board to compel compliance with the water quality standards insofar as the projects\u2019 diversions and exports adversely affect water quality. Such authority, we think, includes the power to impose related costs on the projects. (Cf. <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>v. <em>Forni, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 743 [the Board could require riparian owners to incur reasonable expenses to build water storage facilities].) \u201c[T]he overriding constitutional consideration is to put the water resources of the state to a reasonable use and make them available for the constantly increasing needs of all the people. In order to attain this objective, the riparian owners may properly be required to endure some inconvenience or to incur reasonable expenses <em>(Rancho Santa Margarita </em>v. <em>Vail </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 501, 561 [81 P.2d 533]; <em>Waterford I. Dist. </em>v. <em>Turlock I. Dist. </em>(1920) 50 Cal.App. 213 [194 P. 575]; <em>Peabody </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo, supra, </em>at p. 376). Whether the requirement of building water reservoirs in the case at bench is the only feasible method for achieving the constitutional mandate of reasonableness is manifestly a question of fact.\u201d (54 Cal.App.3d at pp. 751-752.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Although <em>Forni </em>dealt with riparian rights, the same reasoning applies to appropriative rights.  The constitutional requirement of reasonable use applies \u201cto all water rights enjoyed or asserted in this state, whether the same be grounded on the riparian right or . . . the appropriative right.\u201d <em>(Peabody </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo, supra, </em>2 Cal.2d 351, 383; accord <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>v. <em>Forni, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d at p. 749; see also <em>Joslin </em>v. <em>Marin Mun. Water Dist., supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 132, 138; <em>Gin S. Chow </em>v. <em>City of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>217 Cal. 673, 703-705.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">However, we agree with the trial court that the Board failed to make necessary findings reflecting the balancing of interests between the domestic uses of the canal and the domestic uses of the export recipients in determining the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d We recognize that such findings need not be stated with the formality required in a judicial proceeding but must be adequate enough to permit a reviewing court \u201c \u2018. . .to determine whether they are supported by sufficient evidence or a proper principle and to apprise the parties as to the reason for the administrative action in order that they may decide whether, and upon what grounds, additional proceedings should be initiated.\u2019 <em>(Temescal Water Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Public Works, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>44 Cal.2d at p. 102.)\u201d <em>(Johnson Rancho County Water Dist. </em>v. <em>State Water Rights Board, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.2d 863, 874; accord <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d at p. 208.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The Board\u2019s decision offers no indication that the Board undertook the required factual analysis. Although the <em>Plan </em>contains language that the adopted standards were the result of a \u201cfull examination of agricultural, municipal and industrial, and fish and wildlife uses in the Delta; the beneficial uses of water exported from the Delta; and available Delta supplies . . .,\u201d our concern here is the Board\u2019s <em>enforcement </em>efforts. Whether the projects should be required to bear the costs of releasing additional water for outflow to ensure salinity control, or whether the release requirements should be conditional upon the execution of a repayment contract by the district, required a factual resolution. Unfortunately, no findings were made in the mistaken assumption that the parties would reach agreement on the \u201cquestion of compensation for benefits received . ...\u201d In this we think the Board erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Once again, given the scheduled hearings, a remand on this issue would be futile. At any future hearings regarding implementation of the new standards, the Board should make appropriate findings as to whether it is reasonable and in the public interest to require the projects to provide enhancement water for water quality control for the Contra Costa Canal without a repayment obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\n<em>Industrial Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Under the former Basin 5B Plan, water quality was measured in the western Delta at Antioch. Fibreboard Corporation and Crown Zellerbach Corporation\u2014riparians who manufacture salt-sensitive paper at their plants on the banks of the San Joaquin. River east of Antioch\u2014require salinity levels at or below 150 mg/1. When their usual water supply from the San Joaquin River reflects poor water quality, the companies obtain the needed supply from the Contra Costa Water Agency, which in turn purchases the water from the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">In the 1978 proc\u00e9edings the Board determined that to maintain \u201cwithout project\u201d standards of water quality at Antioch to protect the rights of the Antioch riparians would require a wasteful release of 25 acre-feet of outflow for each acre-foot diverted. As an alternative, the Board accepted the offer of DWR to provide a substitute supply to the Antioch riparians through the Contra Costa Canal. Accordingly, the Board eliminated the Antioch standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>from the Plan and required the projects only to meet the standards for the canal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The paper companies argued that the Board should require the DWR to enter a <em>binding contract </em>instead of an \u201coral commitment\u201d for delivery of the substitute supply before exempting the SWP from the Antioch water quality standards. The trial court agreed and invalidated the western Delta industrial standards. The trial court reasoned that an executory contract for the substitute supply was ineffective; as a result, the Board failed to protect the riparian rights of the paper companies. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">As we have previously discussed, the common law riparian rights of the paper companies do not include salinity control. <em>(Antioch </em>v. <em>Williams Irr. Dist., supra, </em>188 Cal. 451.) The trial court, focusing on the Delta Protection Act and its language that \u201cno added financial burden shall be placed upon said Delta water users\u201d for a substitute supply (\u00a7 12202), reasoned that the expense of litigation necessary to enforce the riparian water rights was inconsistent with the stated legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Yet, at the risk of tedious repetition, we reiterate that the Board\u2019s obligation, when setting water quality standards, is not to protect water rights but to provide \u201creasonable protection of beneficial uses.\u201d (\u00a7 13241.) The Board implicitly found that the waste associated with protection of the industries\u2019 use of Delta water at Antioch would be unreasonable. Under such circumstances, the Board was fully authorized to eliminate the burdensome Antioch standard from the Plan. The statutory proscription against added cost applies, we believe, to expenses directly and solely related to delivery of the substitute supply, not to conjectural litigation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Nor do we find any error in the Board\u2019s decision declining to impose the Antioch standards upon the projects. In light of the constitutional mandate proscribing unreasonable or wasteful use of water (Cal. Const., art. X, \u00a7 2), the Board had little choice but to exempt the projects from the Antioch standards. In doing so, it properly exercised its broad authority to assure that limited water resources be conserved for appropriate beneficial uses. (See <em>In re Waters of Long Valley Creek Stream System, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 339, 354.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">We hold that the Board could properly rely on the verbal offer of DWR to provide a substitute supply in lieu of the wasteful outflow requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>F.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Impairment of Suppliers\u2019 Contract Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">At trial the federal contractors argued that the Board failed to protect the contractors\u2019 rights to use the Delta water for a dependable water supply for the water-deficient areas of the state. The contractors argued that the mandated reduction of export water to achieve and implement the stated water quality standards constituted an unconstitutional taking of property without due process or just compensation as well as an unconstitutional impairment of a contract. (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9.) The trial court rejected the first argument on the basis that the federal contractors have no water rights of their own but are subject to the limitations of the permits held by the CVP. As to the latter issue, the trial court concluded that a potential claim of unconstitutional impairment of the water supply contracts required a factual determination on the extent of such impairment; accordingly, the court ordered the Board on remand to consider and determine the effects of the Plan and Decision on the rights of the federal contractors. In this appeal, a number of the parties challenge the ruling limited to the contract impairment issues. Since no argument is made concerning the nature of their water rights (as distinguished from contract rights), we confine our discussion to the contract impairment issue alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The CVP is a multipurpose project involving a massive network of reservoirs and canals serving many purposes simultaneously; i.e., flood control, navigation depths, salinity control, irrigation, power generation, recreation, municipal and industrial uses, and preservation of fish and wildlife. However, only some of these activities yield revenues; the remaining uses are subsidized.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">In 1935, before President Roosevelt authorized emergency funding for construction of the CVP, the Secretary of the Interior submitted a feasibility report in which estimates were made that the multimillion dollar cost of construction and maintenance would eventually be recovered through \u201cannual revenues from the sale of water and . . . electric power . . . .\u201d (Engle, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pt. 1, Feasibility Rep. (Nov. 26, 1935) p. 567.) Thus, it was initially contemplated that necessary costs of construction would be recouped through the sale of hydroelectic power and the delivery of water for irrigation and municipal-industrial uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Funds allotted for the CVP by presidential proclamation were made \u201creimbursable in accordance with the reclamation laws\u201d (Engle, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pt. 1, Exec. Order (Sept. 10, 1935) p. 559); a similar repayment condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>was included in the 1937 congressional authorization (50 Stat. 850). However, since the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 excludes costs of flood control and navigation from reimbursement (43 U.S.C. \u00a7 485h(a), (b)), repayment revenues are derived solely from the sale of hydroelectric power and water for irrigation and municipal/industrial supplies. (43 U.S.C. \u00a7 485h(c), (d), (e); see generally <em>Ivanhoe Irrig. Dist. </em>v. <em>McCracken, supra, </em>357 U.S. 275.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The other functions of the CVP, notably salinity control, protection of fish and wildlife and recreation, are neither mentioned in the authorizing legislation nor expressly declared nonreimbursable under reclamation laws. Thus, a later report concludes, the lack of available means to collect revenues for these services places the burden of such costs \u201cupon the revenue-producing functions.\u201d (Engle, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pt. 1, Rep. by Sect. of Interior on Allocation of Costs and Feasibility of the Central Valley Project, H.R. Doc. No. 146, 80th Cong. (1947) pp. 581, 592; see also <em>Ivanhoe Irrig. Dist. </em>v. <em>McCracken, supra, </em>357 U.S. 275, 295 [2 L.Ed.2d 1313, 1327-1328].)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Under the provisions of the long-term contracts between the federal government and various irrigation districts and water districts for irrigation water service and municipal-industrial water supplies, the U.S. Bureau has agreed to meet the \u201cTracy standards\u201d of water quality. Thus, the component costs of maintaining salinity control are factored into the contract price of the water to be paid by the contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Our threshold inquiry is whether a substantial impairment of contractual rights is factually demonstrated.  If only minor alterations are shown, our inquiry ends since no violation of constitutional dimension has occurred. <em>(Allied Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Spannaus </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 234, 244-245 [57 L.Ed.2d 727, 736-737, 98 S.Ct. 2716]; <em>In re La Fortune </em>(9th Cir. 1981) 652 F.2d 842, 846.) In determining the extent of impairment, the court may consider a variety of factors, including whether the industry has been so regulated in the past that the contractor has notice that further state restrictions apply <em>(Energy Reserves Group </em>v. <em>Kansas Power &amp; Light </em>(1983) 459 U.S. 400, 411 [74 L.Ed.2d 569, 580-581, 103 S.Ct. 697]), and \u201cwhether the parties have relied on the preexisting contract right and the extent to which the [regulation] violates the reasonable expectations of the parties <em>(Allied Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Spannaus, supra, </em>438 U.S. at p. 246 [57 L.Ed.2d at p. 737]; <em>In re Marriage of Bouquet, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 592 [128 Cal.Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371]).\u201d <em>(Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Rossi </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 256, 263-264 [187 Cal.Rptr. 845].) However, a state regulation that merely restricts a party to the gains reasonably expected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>from the contract does not constitute a substantial impairment. <em>(Energy Reserves Group </em>v. <em>Kansas Power &amp; Light, supra, </em>459 U.S. at p. 411 [74 L.Ed.2d at pp. 580-581]; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 114, 120 [192 Cal.Rptr. 762, 665 P.2d 534], app. dism., 465 U.S. 1015 [79 L.Ed.2d 669, 104 S.Ct. 1262].)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Nor is every impairment constitutionally proscribed. Contract rights, like other property rights, may be altered by the exercise of the state\u2019s inherent police power to safeguard the public welfare. <em>(Donlan </em>v. <em>Weaver </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 675, 682 [173 Cal.Rptr. 566].) The function of the court, then, becomes one of balancing the interests involved. \u201c[A]fter examination of [various] factors, the court must balance the severity of the impairment resulting from retroactive application of the statute against the state interest served by the statute. The key inquiry is whether the importance of the state interest justifies the impairment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Rossi, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.3d at p. 263.) \u201cIn evaluating the importance of the state interest and whether such interest justifies the impairment a court must consider where pertinent: whether the legislation was enacted to remedy an emergency situation <em>(Home Bldg. &amp; L. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, supra, </em>290 U.S. at p. 444 [78 L.Ed. atp. <em>432];Sonoma County Organization of Public Employees </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 309-313); whether the law is \u2018appropriately tailored and limited to the situation necessitating its enactment\u2019 <em>{Donlan </em>v. <em>Weaver, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at p. 682; <em>Home Bldg. &amp; L. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, supra, </em>290 U.S. at p. 445 [78 L.Ed. at p. 432]); the nature of the interest served by the legislation and whether the law was enacted to protect a broad societal interest rather than a narrow class <em>{Allied Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Spannaus, supra, </em>438 U.S. atpp. 248-249 [57 L.Ed.2d at pp. 738-739]).\u201d <em>{Id., </em>atp. 264.) Frequently, many, if not all, of these factors may be considered in the abstract without need of factual inquiry. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Here, no evidentiary showing is required, and we are able to reach the conclusion as a matter of law that no substantial impairment appears. The important factor underlying our determination is the expectations of the parties. The CVP\u2019s appropriated water rights are, by definition, conditional\u2014subject to the continuing supervisory authority of the Board, the constitutional limitation of reasonable use, and the priorities of senior rights holders. Logically, neither the project <em>nor </em>the contractors could have any reasonable expectation of certainty that the agreed quantity of water will be delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Indeed, the federal water supply contracts reflect the parties\u2019 understanding that the availability of supplies is uncertain: the contracts expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>provide for governmental immunity from any liability to the contractors due to the failure to furnish the specified quantities of water in times of water shortages. (Engle, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 91-92, 113-114, 131-132, 265-266, 277.) Thus, both substantively and conceptually, the contractors cannot justify any reasonable expectation of a certain or guaranteed water supply for delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Additionally, the very fact that \u201cwithout project\u201d standards require the project to rectify any quality degradation due to project operations undermines the theory that either the CVP or the federal contractors could reasonably expect a greater quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Even were we, arguendo, to find the impairment substantial, we think the Board\u2019s action was justified as a valid exercise of the state police power. As a statewide agency with plenary power and duties of management and oversight of valuable water resources, the Board unquestionably was performing a legitimate public purpose.

Similarly, the FWPCA requires the state pollution control agency to establish and periodically revise water quality standards \u201ctaking into consideration their use and value for. . . propagation of fish and wildlife . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>(33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(c)(2).) Thus, the Board acted within its water quality authority to establish standards for the protection of fish and wildlife.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The Board employed a \u201cmodified without project\u201d level of protection utilizing the striped bass fishery as a benchmark: water quality standards that would provide for \u201cthe maintenance of the fishery (as represented principally by striped bass) in the Delta estuary at levels which would approach those that would have existed in the absence of the SWP and CVP.\u201d In doing so, the Board recognized that while a higher level was necessary to ensure protection of other species (e.g., white catfish, shad and salmon), such level of protection would require the \u201cvirtual shutting down of the project export pumps,\u201d contrary to the broader public interest. Thus, the Board determined that the modified without project standards provided a reasonable level of protection, pending future mitigation actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In the proceedings below, the U.S. Bureau argued the Board had no authority to modify an appropriation permit once issued, and that the new standards for the protection of fish and wildlife will result in impairment of its vested appropriative rights. These arguments were, quite properly, rejected by the trial court. But the court nonetheless held the standards invalid by reason of the Board\u2019s failure to identify its <em>source </em>of authority. The court remanded the matter to the Board, presumably to ascertain whether a factual basis exists to support the revised standards. The court\u2019s ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The issue is now clearly controlled by <em>National Audubon Society </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 419, decided after the proceedings below.  In that case the Supreme Court clarified the scope of the \u201cpublic trust doctrine\u201d and held that the state as trustee of the public trust retains supervisory control over the state\u2019s waters such that no party has a vested right to appropriate water in a manner harmful to the interests protected by the public trust.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>at p. 445.)  \u201cOnce the state has approved an appropriation, the public trust imposes a duty of continuing supervision over the taking and use of the appropriated water. In exercising its sovereign power to allocate water resources in the public interest, the state is not confined by past allocation decisions which may be incorrect in light of current knowledge or inconsistent with current needs. [1\u00cd] The state accordingly has the power to <em>reconsider </em>allocation decisions . . . . [11] . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>No vested rights bar such <em>reconsideration.\u201d </em>(33 Cal.3d at p. 447, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">This landmark decision directly refutes the Bureau\u2019s contentions and firmly establishes that the state, acting through the Board, has continuing jurisdiction over appropriation permits and is free to reexamine a previous allocation decision. <em>(National Audubon Society </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 447.) In reaching its decision, however, the Board acted without the benefit of <em>National Audubon. </em>The Board primarily relied upon its reserved jurisdiction to impose conditions upon appropriation permits to protect the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The trial court\u2019s ruling that the source of authority be identified and enabling findings be made is flawed in several respects. First, the Board\u2019s promulgation of the water quality <em>standards </em>in the Plan was a quasi-legislative action for which findings of fact were not required. <em>(McKinny </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 79, 88; <em>Stauffer Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>Air Resources Board, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.3d 789, 793-794.) Secondly, the Board\u2019s obligation when setting such standards is to \u201cestablish such water quality objectives ... as <em>in its judgment </em>will ensure the <em>reasonable </em>protection of beneficial uses ....\u201d(\u00a7 13241, italics added.) The objectives contained in the Plan for the protection of fish and wildlife were determined necessary by the Board to provide a reasonable level of protection. That determination must be upheld absent a review of the administrative record and a showing of arbitrary or capricious conduct. No such evidentiary review has been undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Arguably, the trial court intended to invalidate the enforcement program contained in Term 2 of the Decision rather than the standards contained in the Plan. Of course, a water rights decision is a quasi-judicial act for which findings are required to show the underlying factual bases <em>(Temescal Water Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. Public Works, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d 90, 100-106; see also <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d 198, 205-206); but we are aware of no requirement that findings be made to show the source of legal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In the new light <em>o\u00ed National Audubon, </em>the Board unquestionably possessed legal authority under the public trust doctrine to exercise supervision over appropriators in order to protect fish and wildlife. That important role was not conditioned on a recital of authority. It <em>exists </em>as a matter of law itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Finally, as already shown, the Board retained continuing jurisdiction (\u00a7 1394) to impose new standards upon the projects in \u201cthe public interest.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>(\u00a7 1253; <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d 198, 212.) In acting upon appropriation permits, the Board was obliged to consider water quality for the protection of beneficial uses (\u00a7\u00a7 174, 1243.5, 1257, 1258) which expressly includes \u201cenhancement of fish and wildlife resources.\u201d (\u00a7 1243.) Here, the Board found that the imposition of the modified without project standards was in the public interest, taking into account not only the needs of the fishery, but also the value of the projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In summary, the Board\u2019s evaluation process was not only a valid exercise of its reserved jurisdiction but also, in retrospect, a proper exercise of its public trust authority as confirmed by our high court: \u201cThe state has an affirmative duty to take the public trust into account in the planning and allocation of water resources, and to protect public trust uses whenever feasible. . . .Asa matter of practical necessity the state may have to approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In so doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust [citation], and <em>to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust. </em>\u201d <em>(National Audubon Society </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 446-447; italics added.) The Board\u2019s action reflects complete symmetry with these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Amici curiae argue, however, that the Board did not go far enough and should have reopened the project permits to provide even greater protection to the fish and wildlife of the Delta and San Francisco Bay. Amici point out that the Board itself acknowledged the inadequacy of the standards to mitigate the detrimental effects of the projects. But this issue is beyond the scope of this appeal. Whether the standards are <em>in fact </em>reasonable and in the public interest is a question which requires a review of the evidentiary record. That question, we repeat, is not before us by reason of the posture of the case presented. We may properly assume, however, that in undertaking new hearings, the Board will be guided by the principles discussed in <em>National Audubon </em>and may consider whether a higher level of protection is necessary and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Amici further challenge the Board\u2019s declaration that it had no authority under its reserved jurisdiction to compel the projects to consider alternative water supply measures (e.g., groundwater management, water conservation, wastewater reclamation) to reduce exports from the Delta.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Amici concede, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>however, that no purpose would be served by a remand on this point. Again, for the guidance of the Board, we emphasize that the principles set out under <em>National Audubon </em>confirm the Board\u2019s power and duty to reopen the permits to protect fish and wildlife \u201cwhenever feasible,\u201d even <em>without </em>a reservation of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">In conclusion, we hold that the water quality standards designed to protect fish and wildlife were properly established by the Board in the exercise of its valid authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate, remanding the proceedings to the Board and commanding the Board to set aside the Plan and Decision, is reversed with directions to enter judgment denying the writ.

The southern Delta riparians contend, therefore, that water quality protection is needed from the pumping plants, and the permits which authorize diversions at the pumps <em>were </em>before the Board. But the Board found to the contrary\u2014that the project operations governed by the permits before the Board were not responsible for the water quality problems in the southern Delta.

The Board has no such public health authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Water delivered <em>to consumers </em>for domestic uses must conform to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300f-300j-10) and California\u2019s Pure Drinking Water Law (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 4010 et seq.). Among other things, each water supplier must comply with water quality regulations (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 4023 et seq.; Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 22, \u00a7 64401 et seq.) to assure safe drinking water quality. But these regulations apply to <em>retail </em>suppliers (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4010, 4010.1, subd. (e); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300f(4)); the State Water Project and the Central Valley Project act as <em>wholesale </em>water suppliers. The Board had no authority under the drinking water statutes to compel the projects to maintain salinity control. Moreover, under the safe drinking water statutory scheme, it is the Department of Health Services that is responsible for enforcement. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 4032-4035.) The trial court correctly concluded that the drinking water statutes did not give enforcement authority to the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b164-11\"> While it has been said that an impairment of a contract in which the state is a party is subject to stricter scrutiny <em>(United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 1, 26 [52 L.Ed.2d 92, 112, 97 S.Ct. 1505]), that principle has no application here. Although the state is a party in the sense that the contractors, as water districts, are political subdivisions of the state, the Board\u2019s action in no way benefits the contractors financially.
