J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In November 2014, California voters approved Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act (Proposition 47). This initiative reclassified as misdemeanors certain narcotics and theft offenses previously cast as felonies. We granted review in this matter to determine what effect the reduction of a felony conviction to a misdemeanor under Proposition 47 has on a related conviction, subsumed within the same judgment, for the crime of \"street terrorism.\" This gang crime occurs when a \"person who actively participates in any criminal street gang with knowledge that its members engage in, or have engaged in, a pattern of criminal gang activity ... willfully promotes, furthers, or assists in any felonious criminal conduct by members of that gang.\" ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 186.22, subd. (a).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Here, defendant stole a bicycle and on that basis was convicted of both felony grand theft (\u00a7 487, subd. (c)) and street terrorism. After Proposition 47 came into effect, defendant successfully petitioned to have the grand theft conviction reduced to a misdemeanor. (See \u00a7 1170.18, subds. (a), (b), as added by Prop. 47, \u00a7 14, approved by voters Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014).) The resentencing court refused to dismiss defendant's conviction for street terrorism, even though the theft of the bicycle supplied the \"felonious criminal\n   conduct\" necessary for the commission of this offense. ( \u00a7 186.22, subd. (a).) The Court of Appeal affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We conclude that defendant is entitled to have his street terrorism conviction dismissed. The reduction of defendant's grand theft conviction to a misdemeanor through Proposition 47 resentencing established the absence of an essential element\n   of the street terrorism offense -\n   <em>\n    felonious\n   </em>\n   criminal conduct. With this element now absent, in the full resentencing that is to occur under the initiative the court cannot lawfully impose sentence on the street terrorism conviction. We therefore reverse the judgment below.\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2013, Manny Ramirez was riding his bicycle in Oxnard when defendant Luis Valenzuela and his friend Timothy Medina waved at him to stop. Ramirez complied. Defendant asked Ramirez where he was from. Defendant also warned Ramirez that he did not like \"homies from East Side,\" a street gang in Santa Barbara.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ramirez replied that he was not a member of any gang. Defendant nevertheless tried to punch Ramirez. After Ramirez dodged his punch, defendant grabbed Ramirez's bicycle and said it was now his. Defendant gave Ramirez his address and told him he could come to his house and get the bike back, but Ramirez would need to bring an \"older homie from the neighborhood to vouch for him.\" Medina added, \"If you want your bike back, you'll have to throw down or fight for it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ramirez left. He reported the incident to police and gave them defendant's address. Police recovered the bicycle from that address and arrested defendant. The bicycle was worth approximately $ 200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2014, a jury found defendant guilty of felony grand theft (\u00a7 487, subd. (c) [recognizing the crime of grand theft as having occurred \"when the [stolen] property is taken from the person of another\"] ) as a lesser offense of the charged crime of robbery (\u00a7 211). The jury also found defendant guilty of street terrorism. ( \u00a7 186.22, subd. (a).) Enhancements alleging that defendant committed the felony grand theft offense for the benefit of a criminal street gang ( \u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1) ) and had suffered a prior serious felony conviction (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)) and a prior strike conviction (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i),\n   1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) were found true. The trial court subsequently sentenced defendant to nine years eight months in prison in connection with these crimes and enhancements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The electorate approved Proposition 47 while defendant's appeal was pending. Among its various provisions, this initiative redefined grand theft. At the time of defendant's crimes, taking property from the person of another was grand theft, a felony offense, regardless of the property's value. (See \u00a7 487, subd. (c).) Section 490.2, subdivision (a), added by Proposition 47, altered this rule. In general, \"Notwithstanding Section 487 or any other provision of law defining grand theft, obtaining any property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($ 950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor.\" (\u00a7 490.2, subd. (a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment on direct appeal, and this court denied defendant's petition for review. Defendant then filed a petition with the trial court seeking the reclassification and resentencing of his grand theft felony conviction as misdemeanor petty theft. (See \u00a7 1170.18, subd. (a).) In his petition, defendant also asserted that if this conviction was reclassified as a misdemeanor, his conviction for street terrorism must be dismissed because the specific criminal conduct underlying that offense - again, theft of a bike valued at $ 200 - could no longer be regarded as felonious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court resentenced the theft conviction as a misdemeanor. (See \u00a7\u00a7 490.2, subd. (a), 1170.18, subd. (b).) This reduction required the dismissal of the gang enhancement, which adheres only upon conviction of a felony. ( \u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court declined to dismiss the street terrorism conviction, however. The trial court resentenced defendant to seven years eight months in prison. This sentence consisted of the lower term of 16 months on the street terrorism count, doubled to two years eight months because of the prior strike, plus another\n   five-year term for the serious felony enhancement. (See \u00a7\u00a7 186.22, subd. (a), 667, subds. (a)(1), (e)(1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court's refusal to dismiss the street terrorism conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    People v.

According to the appellate court, the fact that Proposition 47 required defendant's theft conviction to be regarded as \"a misdemeanor for all purposes\" (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k)) upon resentencing was of no consequence to the street terrorism crime, because the gang offense was focused \"on the\n   <em>\n    commission\n   </em>\n   rather than the\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   of a felony.\" (\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   , at p. 452,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513328\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/209/860/\">\n    209 Cal.Rptr.3d 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , italics added.)

The STEP Act declares that \"[i]t is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this [measure] to seek the eradication of criminal activity by street gangs by focusing upon patterns of criminal gang activity and upon the organized nature of street gangs, which together, are the chief source of terror created by street gangs.\" (\u00a7 186.21, 2d par.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Although defendant was charged under two different provisions of the STEP Act, only one of these allegations is presently at issue.

Among these changes, the initiative amended various provisions of the Health and Safety Code and the Penal Code to reclassify as misdemeanors certain narcotics and theft offenses that had been denominated either felonies or \"wobblers\" (i.e., crimes capable of being charged as either felonies or misdemeanors). The initiative created a procedure through which persons serving a sentence for a qualifying felony may petition to have the conviction reclassified as a misdemeanor. (\u00a7 1170.18, subds.

A second defendant in\n    <em>\n     Buycks\n    </em>\n    , Laura Valenzuela, pursued similar relief on direct appeal for a one-year term enhancement imposed under section 667.5, subdivision (b), applicable \"for each prior separate prison term or county jail term imposed under subdivision (h) of Section 1170 or when the sentence is not suspended for any felony.\" (\n    <em>\n     Buycks\n    </em>\n    , at pp. 873-874,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514793\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/236/84/\">\n     236 Cal.Rptr.3d 84\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514793\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/236/84/\">\n     422 P.3d 531\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .)

Code \u00a7 11377 ) that was among the narcotics crimes reclassified as misdemeanors by Proposition 47, and which Valenzuela had\n    successfully petitioned to have reclassified as a misdemeanor.

The third defendant, Guiomar, had failed to appear in court on a felony charge of possessing a controlled substance ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350 ), leading to another criminal charge.

The reduction of defendant's felony grand theft conviction to a misdemeanor therefore established the absence of an essential element of the street terrorism crime.

But section 1320.5, the \"failure to appear\" statute under which Guiomar was convicted, is materially different from the street terrorism crime involved\n    here. A felonious failure to appear - involving a willful evasion of the court's process in what had been denominated, if not yet proved to be, a\n    felony matter - is not, as a matter of logic or gravity, affected by the reduction of a subsequent felony conviction in the matter in which defendant absented himself or herself. Critically, reclassification of a felony conviction associated with a crime for which a defendant failed to appear does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    function to negate an essential element of section 1320.5 offense.

By contrast, as the majority acknowledges, a street terrorism conviction\n    under section 186.22, subdivision (a) does not\n    require a conviction of any other felony offense. (See maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 247 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 661, fn.5, 441 P.3d at p. 904, fn.5.) As such, the fact that a felony conviction\n    <em>\n     unnecessary\n    </em>\n    to the street terrorism conviction was reduced to a misdemeanor should have no bearing on the continued validity of defendant's section 186.22, subdivision (a) conviction.\n    <em>\n     Buycks\n    </em>\n    is thus distinguishable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The majority's application of the full resentencing rule here essentially sanctions an end run around the Proposition 47 resentencing scheme.

It is one thing to recognize such a procedure in\n    <em>\n     Buycks\n    </em>\n    , where reduction of a felony to a misdemeanor under Proposition 47 eliminated the felony convictions required for the enhancements there, thus implementing the electoral intent manifested in section 1170.18, subdivision (k). It is quite another to apply such a procedure here. The majority contemplates the trial court will\n    <em>\n     strike entirely\n    </em>\n    the street terrorism conviction, even though that offense was nowhere mentioned in Proposition 47 and section 186.22 was not amended by the act, due to the happenstance that defendant was also concurrently convicted of grand theft, a conviction\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    required for a street terrorism conviction, and\n    <em>\n     that\n    </em>\n    theft conviction was later reduced to a misdemeanor. Indeed, the only difference between this case and\n    <em>\n     Martin\n    </em>\n    is that Martin did not have the good fortune to be convicted of theft in addition to conspiracy to commit theft.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Nothing in the language of Proposition 47 suggests the electorate contemplated such a random and haphazard scheme.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    We are, of course, bound by the voters' lawful enactments, and properly so. But we are bound to enforce those enactments in accordance with the voters' lawful intent. As Justice Yegan observed in\n    <em>\n     Martin\n    </em>\n    , \"The fabric of the law will stretch only so far before it will unravel.\" (\n    <em>\n     Martin, supra,\n    </em>\n    26 Cal.App.5th at p. 828,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514838\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/237/504/\">\n     237 Cal.Rptr.3d 504\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) To conclude that, in providing more lenient treatment for those convicted of nonviolent theft offenses, the voters intended to reduce culpability for those guilty of the separate, serious felony of street terrorism stretches credulity, and the fabric of the law, too far. I would affirm the Court of Appeal's judgment affirming the trial court's denial of resentencing under Proposition 47.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Dissenting Opinion by Justice Kruger\n    In 2013, in an apparent gang-related incident, defendant Luis Donicio Valenzuela took a bicycle worth around $ 200 dollars from another young man. He was convicted of two felonies: grand theft from the person ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. (c) ) and active participation in a street gang (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 186.22, subd. (a)). The latter offense applies to a person who actively participates in a criminal street gang with knowledge of the gang's pattern of criminal activity, and who \"willfully promotes, furthers, or assists in any felonious criminal conduct by members of that gang.\" (\n    <em>\n     Ibid.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    In 2014, while these convictions were on appeal, voters passed Proposition 47, which reclassified many drug possession and theft offense felonies as misdemeanors. Among the measure's new provisions was Penal Code section 490.2, which generally reduced felony punishment for theft of property worth $ 950 or less to the misdemeanor level. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , subd. (a).) Invoking this provision, defendant successfully petitioned the superior court to reduce his grand theft conviction to a misdemeanor. ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.18, subds. (a), (b), as added by Prop. 47, \u00a7 14, approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014).) He now argues that the superior court should also have dismissed his felony gang participation conviction altogether. He reasons that once the grand theft conviction was reduced to a misdemeanor, grand theft could no longer be used to satisfy the \"felonious criminal conduct\" element of the gang participation crime\n    under Penal Code section 186.22, subdivision (a).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The Court of Appeal rejected this argument. It explained that because liability under Penal Code section 186.22, subdivision (a) does not depend on having sustained any underlying felony conviction, the fact that defendant's grand theft conviction was later reduced to a misdemeanor had no bearing on the continued validity of defendant's gang participation conviction.

As\n    the Court of Appeal rightly noted, the argument conflates the grand theft\n    <em>\n     conviction\n    </em>\n    with the\n    <em>\n     conduct\n    </em>\n    underlying it. Defendant's gang participation conviction did not depend on the existence of a separate conviction for grand theft (or any other felony, for that matter); it depended only on his having committed or assisted in felonious conduct to promote the activities of a criminal street gang. It follows that the reduction of defendant's grand theft conviction does not entitle defendant to dismissal of his gang participation conviction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    This case is not like\n    <em>\n     People v. Buycks\n    </em>\n    (2018)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514793\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/236/84/\">\n     5 Cal.5th 857\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 871,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514793\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/236/84/\">\n     236 Cal.Rptr.3d 84\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514793\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/236/84/\">\n     422 P.3d 531\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In\n    <em>\n     Buycks\n    </em>\n    , we held that reduction of a felony conviction to a misdemeanor under Proposition 47 invalidated sentence enhancements based on the prior felony conviction because under Penal Code section 1170.18, subdivision (k), the reduced conviction \"shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes.\" There, the validity of each of the enhancements at issue depended on the existence of a felony conviction, not simply the commission of felonious conduct. (See\n    <em>\n     Buycks\n    </em>\n    , at pp. 888-890,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514793\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/236/84/\">\n     236 Cal.Rptr.3d 84\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514793\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/236/84/\">\n     422 P.3d 531\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [enhancement under Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b) ], 890-891 [enhancement under Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.1 ].) In contrast, the gang participation offense defined in Penal Code section 186.22, subdivision (a), does not refer-even implicitly-to a predicate prior felony conviction. It instead applies to a gang participant who has assisted other gang members in felonious conduct. The majority opinion does not explain how the reduction of defendant's grand theft conviction to a misdemeanor could possibly have altered the nature of the\n    <em>\n     conduct\n    </em>\n    underlying the gang participation offense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The majority opinion does gesture to a possible alternative rationale for reaching the same conclusion: that setting aside the fate of defendant's separate theft conviction, Proposition 47 itself retroactively operated on Penal Code section 186.22, subdivision (a), to preclude reliance on conduct involving theft of property worth less than $ 950. Although the majority opinion does not clearly say so, this is an entirely different argument for granting relief. It does not depend in any way on the reclassification of defendant's grand theft conviction; it depends, rather, on our usual presumption that legislation lessening punishment is intended to apply retroactively to all cases that have not yet become final on appeal. (\n    <em>\n     In re Estrada\n    </em>\n    (1965)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2335643\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/63/740/#p745\">\n     63 Cal.2d 740\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 745,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20172\">\n     48 Cal.Rptr. 172\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=408%20P.2d%20948\">\n     408 P.2d 948\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) The majority touches on this argument when it reasons that because defendant's gang participation conviction was not yet final when Proposition 47 took effect, \"the limited retroactivity rule of\n    <em>\n     Estrada\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2335643\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/63/740/#p745\">\n     63 Cal.2d 740\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20172\">\n     48 Cal.Rptr. 172\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=408%20P.2d%20948\">\n     408 P.2d 948\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , which presumes that ameliorative changes in the criminal laws were intended to be applied to cases with nonfinal judgments,\" makes the underlying conduct \"susceptible to reassessment\" under the measure's new provisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , 247 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 661, 441 P.3d at p. 905.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    There are, however, several difficulties with relying on this argument here, beginning with the fact it has not been properly presented to us. Defendant never made the\n    <em>\n     Estrada\n    </em>\n    argument in the Court of Appeal, and that court did not address it. Nor did defendant rely on\n    <em>\n     Estrada\n    </em>\n    in his briefing in this court. Even when we specifically asked the parties to brief that decision's significance, defendant affirmatively disclaimed reliance on this theory, conceding that he was not entitled to retroactive relief under\n    <em>\n     Estrada\n    </em>\n    . Counsel partly withdrew that concession in a letter submitted to the court before oral argument, but he still did not invoke\n    <em>\n     Estrada\n    </em>\n    as a standalone basis for relief; his arguments have instead relied on some amalgam of\n    <em>\n     Estrada\n    </em>\n    and his original, and incorrect, theory that the reduction of his grand theft conviction necessarily implies the invalidity of his gang participation conviction.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    As a consequence, neither the parties nor the courts have ever grappled with the implications of adopting a rule that would regard Proposition 47 as retroactively invalidating convictions for offenses that, like Penal Code section 186.22, subdivision (a), depend in some way on a showing that the defendant committed conduct punishable as a felony. The first, threshold question is whether this theory can be squared with\n    <em>\n     People v. DeHoyos\n    </em>\n    (2018)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514280\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/687/\">\n     4 Cal.5th 594\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 600-603,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514280\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/687/\">\n     229 Cal.Rptr.3d 687\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514280\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/687/\">\n     412 P.3d 368\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , in which we held that defendants who were serving felony sentences on Proposition 47's effective date-and who therefore could seek resentencing under Penal Code section 1170.18 -could not instead claim the direct benefit of retroactive amelioration under\n    <em>\n     Estrada\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Even if we were to answer that question in the affirmative, we would then have to confront an arguably anomalous consequence of the theory. Proposition 47 was designed to reduce certain felonies to misdemeanors. But retroactive application of Proposition 47 in this context could instead result in a defendant being relieved of\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    criminal liability for his or her formerly felonious conduct. In this case, of course, defendant was convicted of grand theft as well as gang participation, and that theft conviction has now been reduced to a misdemeanor. Dismissing or vacating defendant's gang participation conviction, as this court's disposition directs, will leave him with a misdemeanor conviction for his theft, just as a person who committed the same conduct after Proposition 47 would face prosecution for misdemeanor theft. But a defendant who, by contrast, had been charged with and convicted\n    only of gang participation under Penal Code section 186.22, subdivision (a), would, under the\n    <em>\n     Estrada\n    </em>\n    theory, be retroactively relieved of all liability. This is a result that the voters who approved Proposition 47 did not likely anticipate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Whether that consequence is one that should preclude retroactive relief is a significant question. But it is a question that is not properly before us, and it is therefore not one we can or should answer here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    On the only question properly presented to us, I think the Court of Appeal got it right: The reduction of defendant's grand theft conviction to a misdemeanor did not retroactively invalidate defendant's separate conviction for gang participation. In the absence of briefing and argument to support any other viable theory of relief, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    I Concur:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    CORRIGAN, J.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-91\">\n     A broad analogy might be drawn to a defendant who escapes while incarcerated for a crime later found to be unconstitutional.
