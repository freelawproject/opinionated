At the jail, she admonished Daly his refusal to submit to a chemical test to determine blood-alcohol content would result in suspension of his driving license for six months. Daly had a prior drunk driving conviction authorizing a one-year suspension for failure to submit to testing. Coffey did not admonish Daly as to that consequence. Daley did not submit to testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The Department of Motor Vehicles (Department) suspended Daly\u2019s driver\u2019s license. He requested a hearing. The hearing officer found Daly was lawfully arrested and that he refused to take any of the tests. Because Coffey failed to admonish Daly the prior would result in a one-year suspension, the hearing officer recommended Daly\u2019s license \u201cbe suspended for six months only under the provisions of Section 13353 of the California Vehicle Code.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Department suspended Daly\u2019s license for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The court granted Daly\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate and lifted the suspension, finding (1) Coffey admonished Daly his failure to take any of the tests would result in a six-month suspension, (2) Coffey failed to warn Daly such failure would result in a one-year suspension as he had a prior conviction within the past five years, and (3) Coffey\u2019s failure to admonish as to the one-year suspension required vacating the six-month suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Appealing, the Department argues the judge erred when he precluded sanctions altogether because the admonition spoke only to a six-month suspension, contending common sense and public policy authorize that suspension as Daly was warned the license would be suspended for six months. We shall conclude the six-month admonishment did not divest the Department of its duty to suspend Daly\u2019s license and the six-month suspension was a valid order. We shall reverse and remand with instructions to cause the Department to suspend Daly\u2019s license for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Section 13353, subdivision (a)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as effective at times relevant, provided in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who drives a motor vehicle shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>be deemed to have given his or her consent to chemical testing of his or her blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of his or her blood, and to have given his or her consent to chemical testing of his or her blood or urine for the purpose of determining the drug content of his or her blood, if lawfully arrested for any offense allegedly committed in violation of Section 23152 or 23153. The testing shall be incidental to a lawful arrest and administered at the direction of a peace officer having reasonable cause to believe the person was driving a motor vehicle in violation of Section 23152 or 23153. The person shall be told that his or her failure to submit to, or the noncompletion of, the required chemical testing will result in the suspension of the person\u2019s privilege to operate a motor vehicle for a period of six months, or for a period of one year if the person has previously been convicted of a violation of Section 23152, 23153, or 23103 as specified in Section 23103.5 within five years of the date of the refusal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Section 13353, subdivision (b), goes on to provide upon a prescribed notice of refusal to submit to a chemical test: \u201cthe department shall suspend the person\u2019s privilege to operate a motor vehicle for a period of six months, or for a period of one year if the person has previously been convicted of a violation of Section 23152,23153, or 23103 as specified in Section 23103.5 within five years of the date of the refusal. ...\u201d After a requested hearing, if the Department determines to suspend the affected person\u2019s privilege to operate a motor vehicle, the suspension does not become effective until five days after receipt of suspension notice (\u00a7 13353, subd. (c)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">After a police officer lawfully arrests a person for driving under the influence of alcohol, the officer must warn the person he or she has to submit to chemical testing, and refusal to do so results in a suspension of the driver\u2019s license. The warning must not be speculative and must be couched in mandatory language. If a court finds the warning to be inadequate, it will vacate the order to suspend the license. <em>(Decker </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 903 [101 Cal.Rptr. 387, 495 P.2d 1307]; <em>Giomi </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 905 [93 Cal.Rptr. 613].) In <em>Decker </em>and <em>Giomi, </em>the courts vacated suspensions of license because the warnings given there reduced \u2018\u201cthe admonition to one of bare possibility, which thus amounts to no warning at all.\u2019\u201d <em>(Decker, supra, </em>at p. 906, quoting <em>Giomi, supra, </em>at p. 907; see also <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 354, 360 [165 Cal.Rptr. 626].)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The implied consent statute \u201cis perhaps a paradigm example of a classic \u2018health and safety\u2019 police power measure, clearly enacted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Legislature to foster the safety of the public in the use of the state\u2019s highways.\u201d <em>(Hernandez </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 70, 76 [177 Cal.Rptr. 566, 634 P.2d 917].) It was passed \u201cto eliminate the carnage on our highways caused by those who drive after drinking excessively\u201d <em>(Behan </em>v. <em>Alexis </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 403, 407 [172 Cal.Rptr. 132]) and \u201cwas enacted to fulfill the need for a fair, efficient and accurate system of detection and prevention of [such] drunken driving.\u201d <em>(Kesler </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 74, 77 [81 Cal.Rptr. 348, 459 P. 2d 900]; <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>30 Cal. 3d 70 at p. 77.) The state has a strong interest in obtaining evidence of a person\u2019s blood-alcohol content at the time of an arrest. The alternative presented to a person stopped because the police officer has reasonable cause to believe the person is driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol (\u00a7\u00a7 23152, 23153), i.e., either take a test or have your driver\u2019s license suspended, avoids the violence which may occur if a recalcitrant and belligerent person refuses testing; it gives peace officers a tool of enforcement not involving physical compulsion. <em>(Hernandez </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>at p. 77; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Cozens </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 130, 143 [131 Cal.Rptr. 256].)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The law must be liberally construed to effect its purposes <em>(Lee </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 275, 282 [191 Cal.Rptr. 23]; <em>Ormonde </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 889, 893 [173 Cal.Rptr. 79]) and we should avoid creating exceptions and refrain from interference in the enforcement of the statute <em>(McDonnell </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 653, 662-663 [119 Cal.Rptr. 804]).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The suspension of a driver\u2019s license even for six months may have profound and obvious effects on one\u2019s life situation constituting a severe economic and personal hardship.  Thus, a driver\u2019s license is a fundamental right requiring the exercise by the court of its independent judgment in reviewing the administrative proceedings leading to a suspension. <em>(Berlinghieri </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 392, 398 [188 Cal.Rptr. 891, 657 P.2d 383].)  An equivocal admonition the failure to take a chemical test \u201ccould\u201d result in suspension of driving privileges is insufficient <em>(Decker </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>6 Cal. 3d 903 at p. 906) and the use of the words \u201cprobably\u201d and \u201cchances are\u201d suggestive of license suspension for failure to be tested amounts to a failure to admonish <em>(Giomi </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.3d 905 at p. 907).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Proper warning of the consequence of refusal is an element essential to the suspension of a driver\u2019s license. <em>(Janusch </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 193, 196 [80 Cal.Rptr. 726].)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>While an equivocal admonition which does not mislead or confuse may warrant license suspension (see <em>Decker </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 903 at pp. 907-908), here the arresting officer failed to admonish Daly his license would be suspended for one year for failure to take the test if he had a prior conviction within the past five years. The failure so to admonish was not equivocal; it was simply not given. What was given was an admonition of a six-month suspension. Daly was not misled or confused by that warning\u2014his license could be suspended. The only omission was a failure to inform him of the one-year consequence. The omission is not a sufficient reason to erase the six-month suspension. Our conclusion is consistent with the strong public policy implicit in California\u2019s drunk driving laws to deter the drinking driver by requiring the tests under the sanction of license suspension. Our holding does not read out of former section 13353, subdivision (a)(1) the legislative mandate the \u201cperson shall be told that his or her failure to submit to, or the noncompletion of, the required chemical testing will result\u201d in the suspension of his license. It only limits the suspension to the period of the warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Judgment reversed with instructions to cause the Department to suspend Daly\u2019s license for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Wiener, Acting P.
