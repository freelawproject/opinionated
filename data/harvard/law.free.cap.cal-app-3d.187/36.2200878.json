(Statutory references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise indicated.) In this case, we hold the statute was constitutionally applied when unrelated third parties were ordered to pay a wife pendente lite attorneys fees to compensate her attorneys for their successful opposition to various motions and writ petitions filed by third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Appellants Siller Brothers, Inc. (hereafter corporation) and Siller Brothers, a partnership (hereafter partnership; sometimes collectively third parties) appeal from an order directing them to pay $100,000 attorneys\u2019 fees pendente lite to wife\u2019s counsel. They contend: (1) section 4370 must be construed to permit fee awards from nonspouse parties only where the moving party has prevailed in the litigation; (2) section 4370\u2019s legislative history suggests nonspouse parties are subject to fee awards only if they \u201cstubbornly resist\u201d the family law court\u2019s jurisdiction; (3) the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to award the attorneys fees; (4) as applied in this case, section 4370 unfairly authorized the taking of third parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>property in violation of constitutional guarantees of substantive and procedural due process of law; and (5) the trial court\u2019s award constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In this published portion of our opinion we reject third parties\u2019 contentions; in an unpublished portion we reject husband\u2019s contention the trial court erroneously increased his pendente lite spousal support obligation. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Factual and Procedural Background of the Attorney Fee</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Award</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">After 21 years of marriage, husband and wife filed this action to dissolve their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Siller Brothers, Inc., is a California corporation formed after the marriage. Husband owns 40 percent of the shares of the corporation\u2019s stock. One of husband\u2019s brothers owns 40 percent of the shares and another brother owns 20 percent of the shares. Throughout the marriage husband contributed his services primarily to the business of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">The partnership was dissolved before the marriage and reformed after the marriage. Husband has a 50 percent interest in the partnership. One of husband\u2019s brothers owns the other 50 percent interest. The partnership is primarily in the farming business.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">Both business entities experienced substantial growth during the marriage. In 1982, the corporation owned more than $45 million in assets; the partnership held assets valued at more than $14 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">During the marriage 23 parcels of real property in this state were acquired with record title taken in the names of husband, wife, one of husband\u2019s brothers, and his wife. In 5 of the deeds, wife\u2019s interest is expressly referred to \u201cas community property\u201d; in the remaining 18 deeds she is identified as the wife of grantee Charles Siller (husband).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">Wife petitioned for dissolution of marriage in 1981. At some point in the first year of the proceeding wife took the position she was the owner of a one-quarter interest in the 23 parcels of real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">In late December 1982, the partnership filed an action seeking imposition of a purchase money resulting trust in its favor upon the 23 parcels. (See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Kehl </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 228, 238-239 [193 Cal.Rptr. 312].) The partnership alleged it paid the purchase price of those properties solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>from its own funds. Wife responded to the partnership\u2019s resulting trust action by obtaining the joinder of the partnership and the corporation as parties in the dissolution proceeding. (\u00a7 4363; Cal. Rules of Court, rules 1250-1256.) The various actions ended up in Sacramento County Superior Court pursuant to coordination proceedings. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 404 et seq.; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1501 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">In her first amended complaint for joinder wife alleged she owned a community property interest in real and personal properties claimed by the partnership, including the 23 parcels where title was taken in her name. Wife also alleged the corporation was a sham and shell and the alter ego of husband and others. She alleged husband invested community property funds in the corporation; using those funds the corporation acquired real and personal properties. Wife alleged the corporation\u2019s use of community funds, funds borrowed for which husband was guarantor, and husband\u2019s personal efforts, gave her a beneficial interest in the properties acquired by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Before trial wife moved for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees from third parties. Wife\u2019s motion was supported by her counsel\u2019s declaration stating that, both before and after third parties were joined as parties to the dissolution action, wife had been forced to resist numerous unsuccessful motions by third parties to block discovery. These included motions that the depositions of the custodians of records of the partnership and the corporation not be taken; a motion to limit or modify a subpoena duces tecum to third parties\u2019 bank; motions to limit the scope of examination and production of documents; and a motion for protective and quashal orders to custodians of records. Wife had also successfully resisted third parties\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings and two writ petitions to this court, one challenging the coordination order and the other attacking the order overruling their demurrer to wife\u2019s complaint for joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The trial court found wife had incurred $117,400 in attorneys\u2019 fees responding to third parties\u2019 unsuccessful procedural maneuvers. The trial court awarded wife $100,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees for which partnership and corporation were to be jointly and severally liable. It also awarded wife $100,000 in fees from husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Following a trial, the trial court found that corporation was the alter ego of husband, his brothers, and the partnership, \u201cbut the doctrine of alter ego will not be necessary to protect petitioner\u2019s community interest in [corporation] and/or [partnership].\u201d The court concluded wife owned no community property interest in the 23 parcels of real property; rather, she held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>title to the parcels in a resulting trust in favor of the partnership. Judgment was entered in accordance with these views. With respect to third parties, only the $100,000 pendente lite attorney fee award is at issue in this proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Discussion of the Attorney Fee Award</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\n<em>Pendente lite attorneys\u2019 fees were properly awarded under section 4370</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Third parties argue the trial court erred in ordering them to pay wife $100,000 in pendente lite attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to section 4370. For reasons that follow, we cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">\n<em>Section 4370 authorizes an award of attorneys\u2019 fees before judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">Third parties first contend this court should construe section 4370 to permit attorney fee awards against nonspouse third parties only when the party requesting fees has prevailed in the outcome of the litigation. We cannot do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">\u201cIn construing a statute \u2018we begin with the fundamental rule that a court \u201cshould ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019\u201d [Citations.] \u2018An equally basic rule of statutory construction is, however, that courts are bound to give effect to statutes according to the usual, ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.\u2019 [Citations.] Although a court may properly rely on extrinsic aids, it should first turn to the words of the statute to determine the intent of the Legislature. [Citations.] \u2018If the words of the statute are clear, the court should not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>698 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856]; cf. <em>Regents of University of California </em>v. <em>Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 601, 607 [224 Cal.Rptr. 631, 715 P.2d 590].)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Section 4370 unequivocally declares who is subject to a fee award: it provides \u201cthe court may order <em>any party, except a governmental entity, </em>to pay such amount as may be reasonably necessary . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) This language is not reasonably susceptible to a distinction between spouses, on the one hand, and nonspouse parties, on the other. \u201cIt is plain from the face of the statute that. . . fees and costs can be assessed against <em>any </em>party, regardless of the payor\u2019s relationship to the payee.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Newport </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 915, 918 [201 Cal.Rptr. 647], original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Section 4370 also says an award may be made \u201cDuring the pendency of any proceeding under this part, . . .\u201d \u201cDuring the pendency\u201d means while the proceeding is ongoing and necessarily includes the period before any party prevails in the litigation. Section 4370 further provides the award may be modified \u201cfrom time to time and before entry of judgment.\u201d Thus the statute\u2019s terms unmistakably authorize fee awards long before any party finally prevails in the litigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Moreover, a statute must be construed in context, considering its nature and obvious purpose. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Municipal Court (Gonzales) </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 114, 117 [186 Cal.Rptr. 716]; <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Alexis </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 709,715 [182 Cal.Rptr. 593].)  The obvious purpose of section 4370 is to provide one of the parties with funds reasonably required to litigate the controversy. <em>(In re Marriage of Sullivan </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 762, 768 [209 Cal.Rptr. 354, 691 P.2d 1020].) This purpose would be frustrated if the statute were somehow interpreted to permit the fee award only after the litigation had concluded and one party had prevailed. Therefore, we may not construe section 4370 as third parties suggest to permit attorney fee awards against nonspouses only when the requesting party has prevailed in the outcome of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\n<em>Section 4370 does not condition an award of attorneys\u2019 fees upon the \u201cstubborn opposition\u201d of a party to jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Third parties also contend section 4370 was intended to reach only those third parties who \u201cstubbornly resist\u201d the family law court\u2019s jurisdiction. We conclude that although the stubborn resistance of pension plans motivated the 1981 amendment of section 4370, the Legislature did not so limit the statute by the enacted language. Consequently, we shall not limit the reach of the statute as third parties suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Before its 1981 amendment (Stats. 1981, ch. 715, \u00a7 1, p. 2816) section 4370 provided in pertinent part, \u201c(a) During the pendency of any proceeding under this part [the Family Law Act], the court may order <em>the husband or wife, or father or mother, </em>as the case may be, to pay such amount as may be reasonably necessary for the cost of maintaining or defending the proceeding and for attorneys\u2019 fees; and from time to time and before entry of judgment, the court may augment or modify the original award for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees as may be reasonably necessary for the prosecution or defense of the proceeding or any proceeding related thereto.\u201d (Former \u00a7 4370, Stats. 1970, ch. 311, \u00a7 1, p. 705, italics added; <em>In re Marriage of Reyes </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 876, 878 [159 Cal.Rptr. 84].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The attorneys\u2019 fee award was justified as merely a component of the duty to support a spouse or child. (See <em>In re Marriage of Newport, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.3d at p. 922 (conc. opn. of Crosby, J.); <em>In re Marriage of Pallesi </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 424, 427 [140 Cal.Rptr. 842],)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">In <em>In re Marriage of Reyes, supra, </em>the wife in a marital dissolution proceeding joined as a party a pension fund to which her husband was a contributor. (97 Cal.App.3d at p. 878.) The trial court ordered the fund to pay wife her community property share of the pension benefits as they fell due. Subsequently the wife asked the trial court to assess attorneys' fees against the fund; the trial court declined and the wife appealed. <em>(Ibid.) </em>On appeal the wife contended former section 4370 should be construed to authorize a trial court to order <em>any party </em>in a dissolution proceeding to pay attorneys\u2019 fees. The court rejected the wife\u2019s contention, noting that under former section 4370 the trial court could order fee payments only from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>husband or wife or father or mother. <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 878-880.) The court noted that the Legislature in 1978 authorized joinder of pension plans in marital dissolution proceedings and stated it would be a logical step for the Legislature to authorize attorneys\u2019 fee awards against such parties. However, the court said \u201cthe Legislature has not done so, . . .\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 879-880.)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In 1981 the Legislature amended section 4370 to enact the interpretation urged by the wife in <em>Reyes. </em>(Stats. 1981, ch. 715, \u00a7 1, p. 2816.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The amendment provided in pertinent part that \u201cthe court may order any party, except a governmental entity, to pay such amount as may be reasonably necessary for the cost of maintaining or defending the proceeding and for attorneys\u2019 fees; ...\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">An analysis by the Assembly Judiciary Committee staff notes, \u201cThe State Bar claims that many employee pension benefit plans have resisted the jurisdiction of the California courts in attempting to resolve pension rights between parties to a dissolution, resulting in hardship to the marital parties. \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, it appears the recalcitrance of pension plans was <em>a motive </em>for the amendment of section 4370. However, while concerns over pension plans apparently motivated the 1981 amendment to section 4370, there is nothing in the language of the statute to suggest its effect was to be limited to pension plans or entities which \u201cstubbornly resist\u201d being brought into the litigation. The ascertainment of legislative meaning necessarily focuses on the enacted statute and not on an unenacted expression of legislative will, however reliable. <em>(In-Home Supportive Services </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 720, 734, fn. 15 [199 Cal.Rptr. 697].) Third parties are not beyond section 4370\u2019s reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\n<em>The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to make an award of fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Third parties also assert that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to award fees to wife only at the conclusion of the litigation in the event she had prevailed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They argue her joinder complaint was premised upon their possession of community property. They contend that since it was ultimately shown they did not possess community property, the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction of the dispute and therefore could not award pendente lite fees. We conclude the argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Subject matter jurisdiction is the \u201cpower to hear or determine the case.\u201d <em>(Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 288 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715].) Subject matter jurisdiction here is authorized by various statutes. Section 4351 provides in pertinent part that in a marital dissolution action \u201cthe superior court has jurisdiction to inquire into and render any judgment and make such orders as are appropriate concerning . . . the settlement of the property rights of the parties . . . .\u201d Section 4363 allows joinder as a party of \u201ca person who claims an interest in a proceeding under this part . . . .\u201d Section 4370 obviously allows the court to award fees against a third party joined in the dissolution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\u201cWhere jurisdiction of a California court depends on the . . . type of proceeding, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint (particularly the prayer) is usually determinative.\u201d (2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) \u00a7 11, p. 376; see <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>Greenberg </em>(1938) 12 Cal.2d 252, 254 [83 P.2d 293]; <em>Gardiner </em>v. <em>Royer </em>(1914) 167 Cal. 238, 244 [139 P. 75]; <em>In re Marriage of Halpern </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 297, 309 [184 Cal.Rptr. 740].) \u201cJurisdiction of the cause attaches at the time of commencement of the action and cannot be divested by the establishment to the satisfaction of the court of a defense to the whole or any portion of the claim, whether by demurrer, or by evidence on the trial.\u201d <em>(Gardiner </em>v. <em>Royer, supra, </em>167 Cal. at p. 244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Here, the court acquired subject matter jurisdiction by wife\u2019s complaint in joinder alleging third parties held and claimed property in which she had a community property interest. (\u00a7\u00a7 4351, 4363.) Since subject matter jurisdiction was unaffected by the ultimate outcome of these claims at trial, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to award pendente lite attorneys\u2019 fees. (\u00a7 4370; see <em>In re Marriage of Halpern, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at pp. 309-310.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\n<em>Section 4370 was constitutionally applied in this case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">1. <em>Third parties have made no facial challenge to the statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Third parties contend section 4370 authorized the taking of their property in violation of constitutional guarantees of substantive and procedural due process of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">In general, a citizen with standing (see <em>Willadsen </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 171,178 [188 Cal.Rptr. 488]), who thinks a statute violates constitutional rights, has different methods of challenge at his or her disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">First, the citizen can try to show a statute is unconstitutional \u201con its face.\u201d (See <em>Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 168, 180 [172 Cal.Rptr. 487, 624 P.2d 1215].)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">\u201cWhen a statute is attacked as unconstitutional on its face, the attacker \u2018cannot prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular application of the statute\u2019; instead, the challenger \u2018must demonstrate that the act\u2019s provisions inevitably pose a <em>present </em>total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.\u2019 <em>(Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 168,180-181 [172 Cal.Rptr. 487, 624 P.2d 1215] [original italics deleted, italics added]; see <em>County of Nevada </em>v. <em>MacMillen </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 662, 674 [114 Cal.Rptr. 345, 522 P.2d 1345]; 1 Sutherland, Statutory Construction, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 2.06, atp. 22.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 1246, 1255 [212 Cal.Rptr. 216].) These formidable rules insulating a statute from facial attack are understandable in light of the severe remedy for a successful facial challenge: invalidation of the statute in whole or in part. (See, e.g., <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Diego </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 490, 521 [69 L.Ed.2d 800, 823, 101 S.Ct. 2882]; <em>In re Misener </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 543, 546 [213 Cal.Rptr. 569, 698 P.2d 637]; <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 180, 191 [185 Cal.Rptr. 260, 649 P.2d 902].)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Thus, a statute is not facially unconstitutional simply because it may not be constitutionally applied to some persons or circumstances; at a minimum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>its unlawful applications must be substantial and real when judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep. <em>(Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 601, 615-616 [37 L.Ed.2d 830, 842, 93 S.Ct. 2908]; <em>County of Nevada </em>v. <em>MacMillen </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 662, 672 [114 Cal.Rptr. 345, 522 P.2d 1345].) Indeed, it has been said that a statute will be upheld against facial attack if an appellate court can conceive of a situation in which the statute could be applied without entailing an inevitable collision with, and transgression of, constitutional provisions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1255-1256.) Unless a statute facially tenders a present total conflict with constitutional provisions, any overbreadth in a statute is ordinarily cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which the statute is applied. <em>(County of Nevada </em>v. <em>MacMillen, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 672.) However, an exception to this latter rule has been recognized for statutes imposing criminal liability or impinging upon constitutional rights (usually of free speech). (See <em>Mulkey </em>v. <em>Reitman </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 529, 543-544 [50 Cal.Rptr. 881, 413 P.2d 825].) Statutes of this latter variety may be declared invalid in their entirety if piecemeal adjudication of the legality of the statute would entail the vague or uncertain future application of the statute, thereby inhibiting the exercise of constitutional rights. <em>{Ibid.; </em>see Tribe, American Constitutional Law (1978) \u00a7\u00a7 12-24, 12-25, pp. 710-714.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Although the nature of third parties\u2019 constitutional claims could be clearer, third parties have never tendered a coherent challenge to section 4370 on its face. They have never sought invalidation of the statute. Third parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>implicitly concede that section 4370 may constitutionally govern the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees from one spouse to another. They expressly admit the statute can be constitutionally applied to allow a spouse to recover pendente lite attorneys\u2019 fees against an unrelated third party where the spouse shows two things: (1) that the spouse would be substantially prejudiced in the prosecution of his or her case in the absence of a pendente lite award of attorneys\u2019 fees and (2) the spouse seeking the fees is reasonably likely to prevail on his or her claims against the third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Third parties\u2019 contention is that they were unfairly made to pay wife\u2019s fees solely on the ground they had an ability to pay and without requiring wife to make any showing of the likelihood of her ultimate success on the merits. In short, third parties contest the <em>application </em>of section 4370 to them in the circumstances of this case. Absent a coherent argument on the question, we will not on our own motion undertake an analysis of the facial constitutionality of section 4370.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The nature of third parties\u2019 claim serves to circumscribe our discussion. In the absence of a facial attack on section 4370, we have no occasion to construe the statute generally nor to consider possible applications other than the one at issue here. Thus, for example, since the trial court in this case awarded attorneys\u2019 fees as compensation to wife\u2019s attorneys for services already rendered, we have no occasion to consider circumstances that may justify an award of fees for services to be rendered in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">2. <em>Application of section 4370 to third parties did not violate their rights to substantive due process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Where a statute is not vulnerable to facial constitutional attack, a citizen may still contend the operation of the statute violates constitutional rights.  \u201cA statute valid on its face may be unconstitutionally applied. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 169, 180 [121 Cal.Rptr. 97, 534 P.2d 1001]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schueren </em>(1973) 10 Cal. 3d 553,561 [ 111 Cal. Rptr. 129, 516 P.2d 833].) \u201cThe claimed unconstitutionality may arise out of the application of the statute to a particular individual or class of individuals. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Spinks </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 748, 751 [61 Cal.Rptr. 743].) \u201cSometimes it is said of a statute which is not void \u2018on its face\u2019 that it nevertheless is invalid as applied. This is a malapropism, however, for a provision which is only invalid as applied in the facts of a particular case is possibly capable of valid application in another fact situation. In reality, it is only the implementing action which purports to apply the legislation and not the provision itself which is invalid in such cases.\u201d (1 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (Sands, 4th ed. 1985) \u00a7 2.06, pp. 31-32, fn. omitted.) Where <em>application </em>of a statute is successfully challenged on consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>tutional grounds, the usual remedy is an order to officials charged with enforcement of the statute to refrain from its unlawful application; the statute itself remains intact and may be applied in other situations where the Constitution is not offended. (See, e.g., <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 404-405 [149 Cal.Rptr. 375, 584 P.2d 512], <em>Choudhry </em>v. <em>Free </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 660, 669 [131 Cal.Rptr. 654, 552 P.2d 438]; <em>Castro </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 223, 225, 243 [85 Cal.Rptr. 20, 466 P.2d 244].)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Third parties assert that application of section 4370 to them was arbitrary, oppressive and unfair, in violation of their constitutional rights to substantive due process of law. (See, <em>e.g., Hale v. Morgan, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 399, 404-405.) However, for reasons that follow, we shall conclude application of section 4370 to third parties was reasonably related to a proper legislative goal, was fundamentally fair, and did not violate the constitutional rights of third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The due process clauses of the state and federal Constitutions, in their \u201csubstantive\u201d aspect, provide checks on the government\u2019s power to act unfairly or oppressively. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 398.) Unless application of a statute impinges upon \u201cfundamental rights,\u201d the initial question posed by a substantive due process challenge is whether the application is procedurally fair and reasonably related to a proper legislative goal. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Perkey </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 185, 189 [228 Cal.Rptr. 169, 721 P.2d 50]; <em>Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 362, 377 [149 Cal.Rptr. 360, 584 P.2d 497].)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Property rights have not been classified as \u201cfundamental rights\u201d invoking a requirement that legislation or its application be judged by a standard of \u201cstrict scrutiny. \u201d <em>(Hernandez </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 70, 81 [177 Cal.Rptr. 566, 634 P.2d 917].) Here, application of section 4370 required third parties to deliver their property\u2014 money\u2014to wife. Third parties have not contended application of the statute impinged on any \u201cfundamental rights.\u201d We conclude no \u201cfundamental rights\u201d of third parties are at issue here. (See <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>at p. 81.) It goes without saying that the purpose of section 4370\u2014to provide one of the parties to a marital dissolution with an amount adequate properly to litigate the controversy <em>(In re Marriage of Sullivan, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 768)\u2014is a proper legislative goal.  We therefore ask whether, in light of the statute\u2019s valid purpose, application of the statute to third parties was reasonable and proper or arbitrary and oppressive. <em>(Hale </em>v. <em>Morgan, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 399.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Third parties\u2019 initial contention of unfairness is that they cannot be compelled to pay wife\u2019s fees without any consideration of the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the dispute and simply because they had money and she did not. They correctly note that the obligation of one spouse to pay fees to the other spouse, based exclusively on monetary need, has been justified as a component of the marital obligation of support. (See <em>In re Marriage of Pallesi, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d at p. 427; <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Henry </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 707, 712-713 [6 Cal.Rptr. 418].) They assert that since neither corporation nor partnership was married to wife and had no legal obligation to support her, the justification for a pendente lite fee award fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Whatever may be said of this argument in the abstract, it fails in this case because the record makes clear the trial court did not make third parties pay wife\u2019s fees simply because they had money and she did not. Rather, the court\u2019s fee award compensated wife\u2019s attorneys for their successful opposition to previously described motions and writ petitions initiated by third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Third parties contend the trial court could not base its fee award on wife\u2019s successful opposition to these motions and petitions; they assert wife had to prevail on the merits of her claims or show a likelihood she would prevail.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We must disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">It is clear that the Legislature can constitutionally provide for the payment of litigation expenses from one party to another in appropriate circumstances before judgment. Thus, in <em>Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 362, our Supreme Court upheld, against a substantive due process challenge, section 1781, subdivision (d), which permits trial courts to impose class action notification costs upon class action defendants. In <em>Civil Service </em>the plaintiff had obtained a class certification that ordered the defendant to bear the initial cost, before trial, of notifying absent class members of the pendency of the litigation. (Pp. 370-374.) Pointing out that in most civil actions such notice costs are initially borne by the plaintiff, the defendant argued the trial court\u2019s order violated due process by requiring it to finance a lawsuit against itself. (P. 374.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Our Supreme Court disagreed, concluding an award of costs could be made before final judgment: \u201cAlthough defendant vigorously contends that it is unconscionable to require a defendant \u2018to finance\u2019 a lawsuit against itself, we know of no principle of law that precludes the state from providing for a division or shifting of litigation costs, prior to judgment, to effectuate legitimate public policies. Indeed, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s protesta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>tions, the instant order is by no means unusual in requiring a defendant, prior to judgment, to bear some litigation expenses which may aid the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 378, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Here, it is immaterial that wife did not show she would ultimately prevail in the outcome of the litigation nor that she did not, in fact, prevail following trial. Given the fact that wife held record title to the 23 parcels of real property<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that the trial court ultimately sustained her alter ego claim, wife\u2019s claims against third parties were not specious. By limiting its consideration to motions and writ petitions third parties actually made and lost, the trial court looked only to matters for which it was reasonable for wife to mount a defense. Because wife won on each of those matters, she prevailed on them as a matter of law. Although we shall assume third parties pursued their motions and writ petitions in good faith, the fact remains they lost. They have not challenged these rulings on this appeal and we must presume they were correct. (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 268, p. 276.) It has therefore been conclusively determined that third parties had no right to try to block wife\u2019s prosecution of her lawsuit in the ways they did, and this is so regardless of whether she ultimately prevailed at trial. With respect to each proceeding for which fees were awarded, third parties\u2019 assessment of their legal position was erroneous. Their errors caused wife to incur fees; the causal relationship between their errors and wife\u2019s fees, in and of itself, provides a sufficient constitutional ground of fairness to justify requiring third parties to compensate wife for fees reasonably incurred. (See \u00a7\u00a7 3520, 3523.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Nor is it material that third parties filed some motions (upon which fees were predicated) before they were joined in the dissolution action by wife. Section 4370 provides that \u201cAttorneys\u2019 fees and costs within the provisions of this subdivision may be awarded for legal services rendered or costs incurred prior, as well as subsequent, to the commencement of the proceeding.\u201d In the circumstances shown here, we perceive no constitutional impediment to fee awards for services rendered before third parties were joined in the proceeding. The fairness rationale of the fee award is still the same: third parties caused wife to incur fees resisting their nonmeritorious maneuvers. It is immaterial that they caused her to incur these fees before they were joined as parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">We hold substantive due process was satisfied by wife\u2019s showing she had prevailed on the matters for which the fees were awarded. The application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>of section 4370 to third parties was neither unreasonable nor oppressive. <em>(Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 378-379.) There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\n<em>Third parties were not denied their rights to procedural due process of law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Third parties also contend the trial court denied them their constitutional rights to <em>procedural </em>due process of law. They assert the question of wife\u2019s entitlement to attorneys\u2019 fees was unfairly adjudicated in that the trial court allegedly denied their request for a hearing at which they could show wife\u2019s claims were wholly without merit. Assuming for purposes of argument the inquiry would have been material, the short answer to this contention is it finds no support in the record. As we recount more fully in the margin, third parties were given every opportunity to present their legal and factual response to wife\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The rights of third parties to procedural due process of law were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\n<em>The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Third parties contend the trial court\u2019s fee award was an abuse of discretion. An award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in a marital dissolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>action is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear showing of abuse. <em>(In re Marriage of Sullivan, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at pp. 768-769.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Here the trial court expressly found wife had a need for fees. The court noted it was the third trial court hearing this matter to so find. Wife presented evidence of the fees she had incurred resisting third parties\u2019 maneuvers. The court had before it evidence showing third parties clearly had the ability to pay. Since third parties presented no evidence in opposition to wife\u2019s motion, there was plainly no abuse of discretion in the award of fees. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Discussion of the Spousal Support Order</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">The orders appealed from are affirmed.

A plausible challenge to a law as <em>void for overbreadth </em>can be made only when (1) the protected activity is a significant part of the law\u2019s target, and (2) there exists no satisfactory way of severing the law\u2019s constitutional from its unconstitutional applications so as to excise the latter clearly in a single step from the law\u2019s reach.

The court granted third parties two weeks until July 16 to file their declaration as requested. However, later in the hearing, third parties expressly withdrew their request to file additional declarations and agreed the matter could be submitted on the papers filed, provided they were allowed additional argument the next day, July 3.
