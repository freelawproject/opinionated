In 1981, he was convicted of first, degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187) and sentenced to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life with a 1-year enhancement. He seeks to transfer to Canada to complete his sentence pursuant to the Treaty Between the United States of America and Canada on the Execution of Penal Sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>(Treaty).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find that petitioner is ineligible for transfer under the Treaty at this time because his sentence remains indeterminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">\n<em>Legal and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The Treaty authorizes the transfer of certain convicted and sentenced individuals (offenders) to their country of origin for completion of their sentences.  A primary objective of the Treaty is to promote more effective social rehabilitation of offenders and parolees. (See Sen.Rep. No. 95-10, 1st Sess., p. 3 (1977).) Unlike the enactment of a similar treaty with Mexico,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the enactment of the Treaty was not motivated by adverse prison conditions in either the United States or Canada. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Pursuant to the Treaty, a transfer does not alter the term of the sentence imposed on the offender. The \u201cReceiving State\u201d (the country receiving the offender) must give legal effect to the sentence imposed by the \u201cSending State\u201d (the country transferring the offender). (Treaty, art. Ill, \u00a7 9.) The receiving state generally has no authority to modify a sentence of the sending state. (Treaty, art. V; see <em>Kanasola </em>v. <em>Civiletti </em>(6th Cir. 1980) 630 F.2d 472, 474.)</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Article III, section 7, of the Treaty is the subject of this appeal. Section 7 provides that only certain offenders designated therein are eligible for transfer: (a) one who is under a sentence of \u201cimprisonment for life;\u201d or (b) one whose sentence \u201cstates a definite termination date, or the authorities authorized to fix such a date have so acted;\u201d or (c) a juvenile offender; or (d) a dangerous or habitual offender subject to indefinite confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">In 1984, petitioner requested to transfer to Canada, asserting that he was subject to a sentence of \u201cimprisonment for life.\u201d The Board of Prison Terms (Board)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> denied his request on the ground that his sentence remained indeterminate. The Board informed him that once it established a release date for him, he would be eligible for transfer to complete the term of his sentence in Canada. In response, petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>in the Superior Court of the County of Marin against the Board, the Director of the Department of Corrections, and the Warden of San Quentin (collectively referred to as Board), challenging the Board\u2019s decision. The superior court issued a writ directing the Board to complete the transfer. This appeal by the People ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\n<em>Issue and Standard of Review on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The facts in this case are not in dispute. The only issue is one of law\u2014the interpretation of a statute. We therefore undertake an independent review of the lower court\u2019s order. <em>(Verdugo Woodlands Homeowners etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 696, 702 [224 Cal.Rptr. 903]; <em>San Diego Union </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 947, 952 [196 Cal.Rptr. 45].)</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">In issue is whether petitioner\u2019s indeterminate term of 26 years to life constitutes a sentence of \u201cimprisonment for life\u201d under article III, section 7, subdivision (a), of the Treaty, or an indeterminate term which remains to be \u201cfixed\u201d under subdivision (b). In reviewing this issue, we give weight to the interpretation of the governmental agency\u2014in this case, the Board\u2014 charged with implementing the Treaty provisions. <em>(Udall </em>v. <em>Tallman </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 1, 16 [13 L.Ed.2d 616, 625, 85 S.Ct. 792]; <em>Kolovrat v. Oregon </em>(1961) 366 U.S. 187, 194 [6 L.Ed.2d 218, 223, 81 S.Ct. 922].)</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">Interpretation of the provisions of an international treaty must begin with the specific language of the treaty itself: \u201cThe clear import of treaty language controls unless \u2018application of the words of the treaty according to their obvious meaning effects a result inconsistent with the intent or expectations of its signatories.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avagliano </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 176, 180 [72 L.Ed.2d 765, 770, 102 S.Ct. 2374].)</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">Here, the initial words of article III, section 7\u2014\u201cNo Offender shall be transferred unless: . . .\u201d\u2014establish that eligibility for transfer is strictly limited to those offenders subject to a sentence described in section 7, subdivisions (a) through (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">Section 7, subdivision (b), describes a sentence which \u201cstates a definite termination date, or the authorities authorized to fix such a date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>have so acted . . . .\u201d The \u201cclear import\u201d of this language encompasses a sentence having a definite termination date, or which had no definite termination date at the time of the sentencing, but which penal authorities such as the Board subsequently have rendered definite.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Article III, section 8, confirms that the term of the sentence must be definite before an offender is eligible for transfer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That section provides that at the time of the transfer, the sending state must furnish to the receiving state the <em>termination date </em>of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Here, petitioner\u2019s sentence\u201426 years to life\u2014has no definite termination date. Although California\u2019s Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act of 1976<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> changed sentences for most felonies to terms of definite duration, the term of 25 years to life for first degree murder remains indeterminate. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.) The Board is the only authority authorized to set the duration of the term. Under Penal Code section 3041, one year prior to an offender\u2019s minimum eligible parole release date, the Board either sets the release date or, because of public safety considerations, defers setting the release date. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3041, subds. (a) and (b).) In contrast, with offenders serving determinate sentences, the Board does not have similar absolute discretion to set the release date. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 3049.)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The Board, in setting the release date for an indeterminate sentence, performs the same function as does the trial court in ordering a determinate sentence\u2014it fixes a term of definite duration. The Board\u2019s determination is based upon the same criteria which govern determinate sentencing,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> including the need to provide uniform terms for offenses of similar magnitude and gravity, the number of victims of the crime, and other factors in mitigation or aggravation of the crime. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 3041, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The Board, therefore, is the authority which will \u201cfix [a definite termination] date\u201d under subdivision (b) of article III. Once it does so, petitioner will be eligible to transfer to Canada to serve the remainder of his period of imprisonment and parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Such application of section 7 is not inconsistent with the objective of the Treaty. As previously stated, Canada\u2019s primary concern in enacting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Treaty was not prison abuse, but the rehabilitation of parolees in Canada. (Sen.Rep. No. 95-10, 1st Sess., p. 3 (1977).) Once petitioner\u2019s release date is fixed, he will return to Canada, and his parole, including the date of its commencement, will be governed by the laws of Canada. (Treaty, art. IV.) Such application of section 7 is consistent with the other provisions of the Treaty and implementing legislation, pursuant to which the sending state has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the sentence term. (See Treaty, art. V; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4105(a), 4107(b)(1), and 4108(b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that his indeterminate sentence constitutes a sentence of \u201cimprisonment for life\u201d under subdivision (a) is inconsistent with the \u201cclear import\u201d of all provisions of the Treaty construed as a whole. First, his interpretation of \u201cimprisonment for life\u201d is not supported by its plain meaning or the legislation implementing the Treaty. \u201cImprisonment\u201d is defined under 18 United States Code section 4101 as the penalty under which an individual is confined to an institution. The common meaning of \u201clife\u201d is the duration of one\u2019s existence. Neither the Treaty nor the implementing legislation define this term as a period of confinement of potentially shorter duration than one\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Second, the interpretation of an international treaty is governed by federal law. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Belmont </em>(1937) 301 U.S. 324, 331-332 [81 L.Ed. 1134, 1139-1140, 57 S.Ct. 758].)  Under federal criminal statutes, a sentence of \u201clife imprisonment\u201d is a determinate term of the period of one\u2019s life, not an indeterminate number of years. For example, 18 United States Code section 3559(a)(1) provides that the maximum term of imprisonment for a crime is \u201clife imprisonment\u201d; the next most punitive term is \u201ctwenty years or more,\u201d an indeterminate term such as the term petitioner presently is serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">Title 18, United States Code section 4205 also makes a clear distinction between a determinate life term or a term of a definite number of years, on the one hand, and an indeterminate term, on the other hand. Section 4205(a) sets the minimum parole eligibility date of an offender serving a definite term, which includes a life term. Section 4205(b) governs the minimum parole eligibility dates for indeterminate terms, which include terms having a minimum and maximum number of years, and terms where the parole board has complete discretion to determine the release date. (See <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>United States </em>(8th Cir. 1978) 574 F.2d 937, 941.) Thus, under federal law, when, as here, the parole board has the absolute authority to set the release date, the sentence is not a determinate life term.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The interpretation of \u201clife imprisonment\u201d under federal law as opposed to state law is warranted by the fact that different states give different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>meanings to the term \u201clife imprisonment. \u201d (See, e.g., <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1983) 390 Mass. 308 [455 N.E.2d 632, 640] [\u201clife imprisonment\u201d for second degree murder signified indeterminate term with eligibility for parole after fifteen years]; <em>State of Louisiana </em>v. <em>Foley </em>(La. 1984) 456 So.2d 979, 983-984 [\u201clife imprisonment\u201d signified life term without benefit of parole].) Accordingly, the application of a state\u2019s definition of life imprisonment in determining an offender\u2019s eligibility for transfer would result in disparate treatment under the Treaty of offenders subject to similar sentences. (8) A court, in construing the terms of a treaty, must seek an interpretation which avoids such disparity and which affords uniform application. (See <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avagliano, supra, </em>457 U.S. at p. 185, fn. 11 [72 L.Ed.2d at pp. 772-773].)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The provisions of subdivision (b) would have little meaning if an indeterminate term of 26 years to life constituted a term of \u201clife imprisonment.\u201d Following petitioner\u2019s interpretation, an indeterminate term of 1 to 10 years would constitute a determinate term of 10 years. <em>All </em>terms would be definite. The provisions of subdivision (b), which require a definite term of years, or one rendered definite subsequent to sentencing as a condition to transfer, would have no significance.  In construing a statute, courts must avoid a construction which renders certain words or provisions meaningless or unnecessary. (See <em>Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avagliano, supra, </em>457 U.S. at p. 185, fn. 11 [72 L.Ed.2d at pp. 772-773]; <em>Bowland </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 479, 489 [134 Cal.Rptr. 630, 556 P.2d 1081].)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Petitioner\u2019s final argument is that the denial of his transfer at this time is inconsistent with article IV, section 1, of the Treaty. Article IV, section 1, provides that \u201c. . . the completion of a transferred Offender\u2019s sentence shall be carried out according to the laws and procedures of the Receiving State, including the application of any provisions for reduction of the term of confinement by parole . . . . \u201d Petitioner argues that although he does not yet have a parole release date, under article IV, section 1, the Canadian authorities are authorized to set the release date after his transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Under article IV, when an offender serving a determinate sentence transfers to Canada, the Canadian authorities determine his parole release date <em>based upon the term imposed by the United States, </em>but in accordance with Canadian laws, including any provisions for an increase or reduction of his term of confinement. (See <em>Boyden </em>v. <em>Bell </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 631 F.2d 120 [upon offender\u2019s transfer to the United States, authorities could recalculate offender\u2019s remission credits under United States law so as to increase his term of confinement, where they did not alter the term of the sentence imposed by Canada].) Thus, article IV gives Canada no authority to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>mine the term of a sentence. With an offender subject to an indeterminate sentence, the Board, in setting the parole release date, essentially \u201cfixes\u201d the term of the sentence. Transferring petitioner to Canada at this time would permit Canadian authorities to determine the term of his sentence. Neither the Treaty nor federal implementing legislation authorizes such delegation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Once the Board fixes petitioner\u2019s release date, he is eligible for transfer, and the Canadian authorities may increase or reduce his remaining term of confinement if authorized to do so under Canadian law.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Board\u2019s determination that petitioner is ineligible for transfer at this time was correct. The lower court\u2019s order granting the petition for writ of habeas corpus is reversed and remanded with directions that the petition be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">White, P. J., and Barry-Deal, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 5, 1987, and respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 2, 1987.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-11\">July 19,1978,30 United States Treaties and Other International Agreements 6263; Treaties and Other International Acts Series 9552.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-12\">The United States entered into a similar treaty with Mexico (Treaty Between the United States of America and the United Mexican States on the Execution of Penal Sentences, Nov. 30, 1977, 28 U.S.T. 7399, T.I.A.S. 8718).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b756-13\">Under federal legislation implementing the Treaty (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4100 et seq.), the United States Attorney General has delegated authority to the Board and its designees to transfer offenders \u201cin compliance with the conditions of the treaty.\u201d (28 C.F.R. \u00a7 527.40 (1986).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b758-10\">The only offender subject to an <em>indefinite </em>sentence who is eligible for transfer under section 7 is \u201ca dangerous or habitual Offender.\u201d (\u00a7 7, subd.
