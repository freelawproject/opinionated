Code, \u00a7 487, subd. 1) and forgery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 470) and the finding of truth of the enhancement allegation following his admission that he had served a prior prison term for a felony. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5.) This case raises the question of the jurisdiction of the superior court to enter judgment in a case in which no information was filed. We hold that the superior court had no jurisdiction to accept a guilty plea absent the filing of an information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">Appellant was charged with grand theft and nine counts of forgery in a complaint filed in municipal court. Following the preliminary hearing, appellant was held to answer on those charges and a date was set for arraignment in the superior court. At the superior court arraignment, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>\u201cThe Court: This is not an information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-4\">\u201cMr. Berry: There\u2019s a copy of the complaint inside that alleges the real offense, but no copy of an information to match it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-5\">\u201cThe Court: And what about the\u2014is there an information filed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-6\">\u201cMr. Berry: There appears to be no information filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-7\">\u201cThe Court: Do you have an information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-8\">\u201cMr. Berry: No. I have a copy of the complaint, however, and the complaint does have an enhancement alleging a prior.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-9\">The court and the parties thereafter apparently treated the municipal court complaint as an information. Appellant waived his constitutional rights, pleaded guilty to the first two causes of action of the complaint and admitted the truth of the enhancement allegation. The court accepted the plea. Appellant was subsequently sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">Grand theft (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. 1) and forgery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 470) are offenses which must be prosecuted by indictment or information. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 682.) An information must be filed within 15 days of the accused being held to answer for the offenses. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 739, 872.) There is no evidence that an information was filed in this case, and it appears from the record of the proceedings held April 29, 1985, that the court and parties were aware that no information appeared in the superior court file.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">Respondent argues that the information charging appellant in a <em>prior </em>felony prosecution, and presumably .filed in this case in connection with the enhancement allegation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5), should be treated as the accusatory pleading herein. The argument fails because that information does not allege the offenses to which appellant pleaded guilty, but rather offenses occurring approximately five years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-12\">Timely filing of the valid information gives the superior court jurisdiction to try an accused. <em>(Rogers </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1955) 46 Cal.2d 3, 7 [291 P.2d 929]; <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 319, 321 [121 P.2d 713]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nation </em>(1952) 108 Cal.App.2d 829, 831 [239 P.2d 891]; Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1963) \u00a7 180, pp. 170-171.)  Failure to file an information is an irregularity of sufficient importance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>to the functioning of the courts that the parties cannot cure the irregularity by their consent to the proceedings. (See <em>In re Griffin </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 343, 348 [62 Cal.Rptr. 1, 431 P.2d 625].)  The superior court did not have jurisdiction to accept appellant\u2019s guilty plea or to enter judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">Woods, P. J., and Arguelles, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
