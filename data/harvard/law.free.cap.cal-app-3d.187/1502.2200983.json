Appellant Winick Corporation (Winick) was a subcontractor on a public works project. The general contractor obtained a \u201cpayment bond\u201d from respondent Safeco Insurance Company (Safeco). When the general contractor failed to pay for labor and materials Winick had supplied, it served a \u201cStop Notice\u201d on the public agency which had contracted for the project. In order to continue with construction, the general contractor obtained a \u201cstop notice release bond\u201d from another insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-10\">On May 14, 1981, Winick filed a lawsuit against everyone involved, including a cause of action against Safeco. However, the summons and complaint was not served on Safeco until May 23, 1984, over three years after the case had been filed. Safeco moved to quash service of summons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1505\">*1505</page-number>and to dismiss the action against it for failure to serve and return service within three years. These motions were dismissed initially on the specific grounds Code of Civil Procedure section 990 allows three years <em>and ninety days </em>for service of summons and return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">Safeco then filed a renewed motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 581a for failure to serve and return service within three years or alternatively to reconsider the initial denial of its motion to dismiss. The hearing on these motions was continued several times. During this time a Court of Appeal filed <em>Republic Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 1253 [207 Cal.Rptr. 241]. Under authority of this case, the trial court granted Safeco\u2019s motions quashing service of summons and dismissing the action against Safeco with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">Eighteen days later Safeco proceeded to file a memorandum of costs and disbursements seeking $68 in \u201cclerk\u2019s fees\u201d and $12,481 in attorney fees under Civil Code section 1717. Winick responded by filing a motion for an order taxing costs raising three objections: (1) Safeco\u2019s memorandum was not timely filed since Code of Civil Procedure section 1033 requires a memorandum of costs to be filed no later than 10 days after entry of judgment; (2) Safeco erroneously based its request for attorney fees on Civil Code section 1717; and (3) the amount of the attorney fee request was unreasonable and inadequately supported by Safeco\u2019s submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">After a further exchange of memoranda, declarations, and the like, the hearing took place on February 28, 1985. The court first granted Safeco\u2019s motion for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 for its failure to file the memorandum of costs in a timely manner. It then denied Winick\u2019s motion to tax costs with the exception of $488 for clerk\u2019s time. This left standing an attorney fee award in the amount of $12,061. Winick filed a timely notice of appeal from the denial of its motion to tax costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-8\">On this appeal, Winick does not object to the dismissal of its cause of action against Safeco, with prejudice. It only challenges the existence and amount of the attorney fee award. Winick first contends Safeco is not entitled to any attorney fee award at all because it does not qualify as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the underlying litigation. Alternatively, assuming <em>some </em>attorney fee award is proper, Winick argues the amount the trial court awarded is unreasonable and inadequately supported by the record before the court. It asks us to reverse the denial of its motion to tax costs or, in the alternative, to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings as to the reasonableness of the attorney fee request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1506\">*1506</page-number>I. Safeco\u2019s Success in Obtaining a Dismissal With Prejudice for Failure to Timely Serve the Summons Qualifies It as a \u201cPrevailing Party\u201d Under Civil Code Section 3250</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">This case apparently raises a narrow issue of first impression\u2014must a defendant obtain a judgment on the merits to qualify as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d entitled to an attorney fee award under Civil Code section 3250? The latter section provides the basis for this attorney fee award and reads: \u201cAn action on the payment bond may be maintained separately from and without the filing of an action against the public entity by whom the contract was awarded or any officer thereof. In any action, the court <em>shall </em>award to the <em>prevailing party </em>a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee, to be taxed as costs.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">Under the traditional \u201cAmerican rule\u201d each litigant must bear its own legal fees\u2014whether it wins or loses.  Section 3250 is one of a steadily growing family of statutes which modify this rule for certain kinds of litigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A majority of these statutes only authorize courts to award attorney fees to winning plaintiffs while others only allow fee awards to winning defendants. The remainder are like section 3250 in allowing either side to obtain attorney fees if\u2014but only if\u2014they <em>prevail. </em>(Pearl, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>pp. 165-195.) However, section 3250 is different from many fee shifting statutes in <em>requiring </em>rather than permitting the trial court to award attorney fees to the prevailing party. That is, it provides \u201cthe court shall\u201d not \u201cthe court may\u201d award fees. Consequently, if Safeco qualifies as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d it has a legal right to reasonable attorney fees no matter how the trial judge or this court might feel about whether equity or public policy are served by shifting fees in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-7\">Winick contends Safeco is not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in this action because it did not win a judgment \u201con the merits\u201d but only on \u201ctechnical grounds.\u201d Both parties appear to assume that if a case must be decided \u201con the merits\u201d to qualify for attorney fees what happened here\u2014a dismissal for failure to timely serve the summons\u2014would not satisfy that standard and thus would not sustain the trial court\u2019s grant of fees. Consequently, we turn to the question of what it takes to be a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-8\">Neither party cited any cases under section 3250 which interpret the term \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Nor has our research uncovered any. So we must look elsewhere. Winick points to decisions interpreting the pre-1981 version of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1507\">*1507</page-number>Civil Code section 1717 which it contends interpreted \u201cprevailing party\u201d to require a decision \u201con the merits\u201d before a trial court could award fees. <em>(International Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Olen </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 218, 221-225 [145 Cal.Rptr. 691, 577 P.2d 1031]; <em>Samuels </em>v. <em>Sabih </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 335, 339-340 [133 Cal.Rptr. 74].)  Section 1717 outlines the ground rules where a <em>contract </em>as opposed to a specific statute authorizes fee-shifting. Thus, it does not control whether and how fee-shifting is to take place under section 3250. Nonetheless, interpretations of the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in section 1717 would at least be persuasive in construing the identical term in section 3250. However, the pre-1981 version of section 1717 contained an express and limited definition of what was meant by \u201cprevailing party\u201d in that statute. It said \u2018\u201cprevailing party\u2019 means the party in whose favor final judgment is rendered.\u201d When in <em>International Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Olen, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 218 the Supreme Court construed this definition to deny attorney fees to defendants where a plaintiff <em>voluntarily </em>dismisses its action <em>without prejudice, </em>the Legislature responded by changing the statutory definition of \u201cprevailing party.\u201d It now expressly allows fee award to the prevailing party no matter whether the litigation ended in a \u201cfinal judgment. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\">Thus, even if the statutory definition of \u201cprevailing party\u201d in section 1717 somehow controlled the definition of the same words in section 3250\u2014 which it does not purport to do\u2014the current definition actually supports the interpretation that fees should be awarded even without a final decision on the merits. And indeed this is how the present section 1717 has been interpreted. For example, in <em>Lanyi </em>v. <em>Goldblum </em>(1986) <em>177 </em>Cal.App.3d 181 [223 Cal.Rptr. 32], the court approved an attorney fee award for a plaintiff where the action had terminated through his acceptance of an offer of compromise under Code of Civil Procedure 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">As we look beyond section 1717, we find \u201cprevailing party\u201d has been defined in other contexts to allow attorney fee awards even where there has been no decision on the merits. The California Supreme Court has quoted with approval from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s admonition \u201cthat the inquiry as to a party\u2019s success must be a pragmatic one that may range outside the merits of the underlying dispute. \u2018It\u2019s initial focus might well be on establishing the precise factual/legal condition that the fee claimant has sought to change or affect . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Folsom </em>v. <em>Butte County Assn. of Governments </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 668, 685 [186 Cal.Rptr. 589, 652 P.2d 437].) Although this comment was made about <em>plaintiffs </em>who were seeking fee awards without reaching a decision on the merits, it makes equal sense when interpreting a statute which expressly <em>mandates </em>attorney fees for prevailing defendants as well as prevailing plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1508\">*1508</page-number>Undertaking a \u201cpragmatic inquiry\u201d into whether the defendant prevailed in the instant case we first note what it obtained was a dismissal <em>with prejudice </em>which has the effect of a final judgment. <em>(Foreman Roofing Inc. </em>v. <em>United Union of Roofers etc. Workers </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 99 [192 Cal.Rptr. 439].) This achieved one hundred percent of the \u201cprecise factual/legal condition\u201d Safeco \u201csought to change or affect.\u201d The most Safeco\u2014or any other civil defendant\u2014ordinarily can hope to achieve is to have the plaintiff\u2019s claim thrown out completely. This is exactly what happened here. In \u201cpragmatic\u201d terms, it does not make any difference whether this total victory comes only after a jury reaches a verdict as to each and every substantive issue or whether, as here, it comes through a judge\u2019s decision the plaintiff waited too long to serve its complaint on the defendant. In any practical sense of the word, the defendant \u201cprevailed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">In <em>Coalition for Economic Survival </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1985) 171 Cal. App.3d 954 [217 Cal.Rptr. 621], this division confronted a like issue in a very different context. There the plaintiffs, a group of welfare recipients, sought an order compelling the state government to continue welfare checks during a budget impasse. The plaintiffs lost in the trial court but won a stay in the California Supreme Court. As a result, the first round of checks\u2014amounting to millions of dollars\u2014was released. Predictably, before the Supreme Court could reach the merits of the controversy, the budget impasse was resolved. The state argued the welfare recipients were not entitled to attorney fees because they had not won a decision \u201con the merits.\u201d We rejected this notion. \u201c[Although we recognize the stay granted by the Supreme Court was not a decision on the merits, this decision had the effect of a final decision\u2014it gave the plaintiffs a substantial amount of the ultimate relief they requested. \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 962.) Accordingly, we held the welfare recipients indeed qualified as \u201cprevailing parties\u201d and were entitled to their attorney fees. The instant case is an even more compelling one for finding Safeco was a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d In this case there <em>was </em>a final judgment in favor of Safeco which gave it <em>all </em>the \u201crelief it requested.\u201d Accordingly, we hold it is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the meaning of section 3250 and thus entitled to an attorney fee under that section. Safeco likewise is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d on this appeal which is part of the action on the bond. Consequently, it is entitled to reasonable attorney fees in this appeal to enforce its attorney fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">II. The Amount of the Attorney Fee the Trial Court Awarded Did Not Constitute an Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-6\">Winick contends the $12,061 attorney fee award was excessive on its face and was not justified by the evidence before the trial court. The proper amount of attorney fees for work performed in the trial court is left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1509\">*1509</page-number>to the sound discretion of the trial court. Its decision on this issue \u201ccannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>(Melnyk </em>v. <em>Robledo </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623 [134 Cal.Rptr. 602].) We have examined the record and do not find an abuse of discretion. Although this case was decided on an early motion, there were several hearings and several exchanges of written arguments, declarations, and the like. Safeco\u2019s verified bill of costs is reasonably detailed and Winick failed to challenge any individual items in the trial court. Thus, the trial court was entitled to rely on it in assessing the appropriate award. <em>(Mojave &amp; B. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Cuddeback </em>(1915) 28 Cal.App. 439 [152 P. 943]; <em>Oak Grove School Dist. </em>v. <em>City Title Ins. Co. </em>(1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 678 [32 Cal.Rptr. 288].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-4\">At the trial level, and here, Winick relies primarily on its contention $12,061 is too much on its face for a defendant\u2019s work on a case which is dismissed for failure to timely serve the summons. Winick cites <em>Tedeschi </em>v. <em>Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1984) 579 F.Supp. 657; affd. (2d Cir. 1985) 757 F.2d 465 where the court refused to grant a defendant $49,235.75 in attorney fees for winning a dismissal at the motion stage. However, this same court did award a reduced sum\u2014$10,000\u2014to the defendant. We do not believe the trial court in the instant case abused its discretion in honoring a fee request which was within $2,000 of the <em>Tedeschi </em>award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">The judgment is affirmed.
