Maloney, registrar of contractors, and the Contractors State License Board of the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Consumer Affairs appeal from a judgment entered in a proceeding in administrative mandamus (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) ordering issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate commanding defendants to set aside their decision to suspend the contractor\u2019s licenses of plaintiffs and respondents Donald Ray Parker dba Parker Electric, and California Parker Electric Inc., of which Donald Ray Parker (Parker) is president.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The registrar of contractors filed an accusation against various related corporate entities but focused primarily on the conduct of California Parker Electric, Inc. The accusation asserted two grounds for discipline. It charged that California Parker Electric: (1) had violated Business and Professions Code section 7110<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in that it had willfully violated Labor Code section 227<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by withholding employee benefit contributions from employees\u2019 wages and failing to submit them to the union and (2) had violated Business and Professions Code section 7116<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by fraudulently representing to its employees that it had deducted the monies for that purpose and had forwarded the money to the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">At the subsequent administrative hearing Parker alleged that because the amounts owed to the union trust fund had been discharged in bankruptcy, the disciplinary action violated 11 United States Code section 525(a) (hereinafter section 525).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He argued that the sole purpose was to discipline him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>for failing to pay a debt that had been discharged in bankruptcy. The administrative law judge (ALJ) rejected that argument and found the registrar\u2019s accusations to be true. The ALJ found: (a) that the basis of the accusation was the fraud involved in the failure to forward the \u201cwithheld\u201d sums to the union, not the bankruptcy or the discharge of the debt and (b) that the state\u2019s interest in protecting employee and labor organizations was separate and apart from the matters resolved by the bankruptcy court. The ALJ proposed suspension of the contractor licenses of California Parker Electric, Inc. and Donald Ray Parker dba Parker Electric<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for concurrent six month terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Although it is not a part of the record, we presume and will assume that the registrar adopted the proposed decision of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Thereafter, Parker sought review of the registrar\u2019s decision by filing a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus. He claimed that appellants had acted in excess of the jurisdiction conferred by Business and Professions Code section 7113.5<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and also renewed the contention that section 525 barred the disciplinary action. Ignoring appellants\u2019 request for specific findings on willfullness and fraud, the trial court held that the registrar\u2019s action violated section 525 because it was imposed primarily for the collection of a debt and because suspension of Parker\u2019s license would force the close of his businesses depriving him of the fresh start contemplated by the Bankruptcy Code. The trial court granted the peremptory writ of mandate directing appellants to set aside the decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Section 525 prohibits a governmental unit from suspending, denying, revoking, refusing to renew, or discriminating with respect to a person\u2019s license \u201csolely because\u201d that person has been a bankrupt, was insolvent before or during bankruptcy, or has not paid a debt that was discharged in bankruptcy. The section is intended to ensure that persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>who have been debtors under the federal bankruptcy laws are not deprived of a \u201cfresh start\u201d by governmental discrimination. Discrimination based solely upon bankruptcy or nonpayment of a discharged debt could encourage reaffirmations, contrary to the express anti-reaffirmation policy of the code. <em>(Duffey </em>v. <em>Dollison </em>(6th Cir. 1984) 734 F.2d 265, 271.) Thus, it has been said that the \u2018\u201cprimary purpose of section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code is to prevent the government either from denying privileges to individuals solely as a reaction to their filing bankruptcy or from conditioning the grant of privileges on the bankrupt\u2019s reaffirmation of certain debts.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Duffey </em>v. <em>Dollison, supra, </em>at p. 271.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">However, section 525 does not insulate a debtor from all disciplinary actions merely because they arise from circumstances related to a debt which has been discharged in bankruptcy. Use of the statutory language of limitation \u201csolely because\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> prohibits actions against a licensee only if they are based on such grounds. Thus if bankruptcy or nonpayment of a discharged debt is the sole reason for disciplinary action, section 525 is triggered. However, if other factors indicate that the debtor is unsuitable to hold a license, the state may commence disciplinary proceedings. <em>(In re Fasse </em>(Bankr.D.Colo. 1984) 40 Bankr. 198, 201; <em>In re Hinders </em>(Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1982) 22 Bankr. 810, 813-815.) This distinction thus requires careful scrutiny of the facts of each case to determine the true basis for the governmental action at issue. (H.R.Rep. No. 95-595, 1st Sess., pp. 366-367 (1977); see also <em>Matter of Alessi </em>(Bankr.N.D.Ill., E.D. 1981) 12 Bankr. 96, 98-99 [upholding the Illinois Racing Board\u2019s denial of a racing license because its decision was supported by several nontainted reasons, including the negotiation of and previous license suspension based on dishonored checks as well as the accumulation of large debts which subjected the debtor to influence and endangered the sport\u2019s integrity]; <em>In re Webb </em>(Bankr.E.D.Pa. 1984) 38 Bankr. 541, 545 [upholding a gas company\u2019s refusal to restore service to debtor\u2019s home because it was based on illegal tampering and receipt of stolen gas, not solely on debtor\u2019s failure to make restitution]; <em>In re Fasse, supra, </em>40 Bankr. at p. 201 [upholding a Colorado law providing that payment on behalf of a broker from the state recovery fund precipitated a disciplinary hearing on his license on the condition that any actual discipline not be based solely on the nonpayment of a discharged debt]; cf. <em>Matter of Lam</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>billotte </em>(Bankr.M.D.Fla. 1982) 25 Bankr. 392; <em>In re Rath Packing Co., supra, </em>35 Bankr. 615; and <em>In re Geffken </em>(Bankr.N.D.Ohio 1984) 43 Bankr. 697 [each finding the disciplinary action was motivated solely or primarily on a debtor\u2019s failure to pay prepetition debts].)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Thus the dispositive question in the instant case is a factual one: what was the factor that motivated the decision to discipline Parker? The registrar specifically found that Parker\u2019s \u201cdeduction\u201d of the sums from the employees\u2019 payroll checks and the failure to forward such sums to the union constituted fraud which subjected his license to discipline under Business and Professions Code sections 7110 and 7116. The registrar further found that it was the fraud, rather than the bankruptcy discharge of the debt to the union, which formed the basis of the accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The trial court, however, made different findings. It found that the \u201cobligation\u201d owed to the trust fund \u201cwas a monetary one based on benefits that would normally have been paid by California Parker Electric\u201d and commented: \u201cThe Court is aware that had the monetary obligation been paid to the Union at the time owed that this proceeding would not have been brought by [the registrar], and therefore, <em>considers such action to be primarily for the collection of a debt and only incidentally to be concerned with the violation of the Labor Code Section requiring the payment of such union benefits.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The court thus concluded that \u201c[w]here, as here, the debtor has, in fact, discharged the debt upon which this proceeding was brought by [the registrar], then this Court believes that such action violates 11 USC 525.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Because the instant proceeding concerned the suspension of a contractor\u2019s license, the trial court was required to apply the independent judgment test in reviewing the agency\u2019s decision. (Cf. <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 139, 146 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242]; <em>Housing Development Co. </em>v. <em>Hoschler </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 379, 385-386 [149 Cal.Rptr. 400].) Normally, then, the question before this court is whether substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings. (Cf. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1948) 32 Cal. 2d 301, 308 [196 P.2d 20]; <em>Rabago </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 200, 206 [148 Cal.Rptr. 499].) The instant case does not fit into that procedural framework, however, because the trial court failed to make findings as a result of which it was impossible for this court to review the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The controlling principle is found in section 634 of the Code of Civil Procedure: \u201cWhen a statement of decision does not resolve a controverted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>issue, or if the statement is ambiguous, and the record shows that the omission or ambiguity was brought to the attention of the trial court either prior to entry of judgment or in conjunction with a motion under Section 657 or 663, it shall not be inferred on appeal or upon a motion under Section 657 or 663 that the trial court decided in favor of the prevailing party as to those facts or on that issue. \u201d Failure to make a finding, therefore, is normally reversible error unless this court concludes that there is no substantial evidence to support the position of the appealing party. (Cf. <em>In re Marriage of Davis </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 71, 75 [190 Cal.Rptr. 104]; <em>Rabago </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d at p. 212; <em>Newby </em>v. <em>Alto Riviera Apartments </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 288, 304 [131 Cal.Rptr. 547].)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">The crucial factual question omitted from the trial court\u2019s statement of decision concerns whether or not respondents actually violated the regulatory statutes in question here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In other words, did respondents commit fraudulent or willful acts in failing to forward to the union sums withheld from the employees\u2019 paychecks. In its memorandum of tentative decision, the trial court commented that \u201cwhether the prior obligation was one that violated a Labor Code section or was a business obligation should make no difference so long as the obligation was a monetary one.\u201d To the contrary, the answer determines whether or not section 525\u2019s prohibition is triggered. If respondents committed fraud in violation of the relevant statutes, and appellants decide to discipline them for such unlawful conduct, section 525 does not bar such action simply because the debt arising from the fraud is subsequently discharged in bankruptcy. In such circumstances, the disciplinary action would not have been instituted \u201csolely because\u201d respondents declared bankruptcy. Instead, the motivating factor would be the protection of the public from a contractor \u201cwhose method of doing business indicates a lack of integrity upon his part or a tendency to impose upon those who deal with him.\u201d <em>(West Coast etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Contractors\u2019 etc. Bd. </em>(1945) 72 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Cal.App.2d 287, 301-302 [164 P.2d 811].)On the other hand, if respondents were not fraudulent, i.e., if they simply failed to make the payments for lack of money, then section 525 would bar disciplinary action. The factual determination omitted from the trial court\u2019s decision is determinative and cannot be resolved by an appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to make new findings in accordance with the views expressed herein and to enter judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Anderson, P.

Under Business and Professions Code section 7122.5, the causes for discipline established against California Parker Electric, Inc., likewise constituted causes for discipline against Parker Electric. The ALJ also proposed that Donald Ray Parker and his brother be prohibited from serving as officers, directors, associates, partners, or responsible managing employees of any licensee and that any licensee which employs, elects, or associates either of them be subject to discipline as well. Because Donald Ray Parker is the individual whose conduct and status is essentially at issue here, references will be to him unless clarity requires that the corporate entity be named.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Section 7113.5 expressly provides that \u201cNo disciplinary action shall be commenced against a licensee for avoiding or settling in bankruptcy ... the licensee\u2019s lawful obligations incurred as a contractor for less than the full amount of such obligations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u201cNowhere in the Code or its legislative history is the seemingly obvious term \u2018solely because\u2019 defined.

In addition the court in <em>In re Rose, </em>23 B.R. 662, 668, n. 8 (Bkrtcy.D.Conn. 1982), noted, but did not specifically adopt, the debtor\u2019s suggestion that \u2018\u201csolely\u201d could be considered as meaning \u201cprimarily\u201d or \u201cpredominately.\u201d\u2019\u201d (I<em>n re Rath Packing Co. </em>(N.D.Iowa 1983) 35 Bankr. 615, 619 [refusing to specifically adopt any one definition but considering them to be instructive].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b207-5\">After the trial court rendered its tentative decision, appellants filed a request for a statement of decision which specifically requested the court to answer the question: \u201cwhether petitioners have subjected their licenses to discipline by the Contractors Board under Business and Professions Code section 7110 for wilful violation of Labor Code section 227, and, if not, why they haven\u2019t; ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Appellants also filed an objection to the proposed statement of decision, complaining, inter alia, that \u201cPetitioners[\u2019] proposed Statement of Decision does not resolve the following controverted issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">\u201ca.
