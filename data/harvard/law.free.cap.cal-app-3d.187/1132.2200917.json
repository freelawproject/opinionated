Nathaniel was again taken into custody after violating the terms of his probation. At the detention hearing, he was released pursuant to a home supervision plan (HSP). After the HSP was terminated, probation again commenced. Nathaniel admitted the probation violation. His 40-day commitment was stayed. Probation ended and the wardship terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">The County of Orange successfully petitioned the court to order the parents to reimburse it for the costs of the HSP and the probation supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">Appellants raise one issue: \u201cCourt-ordered supervision of a minor, whether only accused of acting, or having been found to have acted, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>manner violative of a Penal statute is an exercise of the State\u2019s police powers for the protection of society, and the rehabilitation of the probationer; not the rendition of support or maintenance. The cost may not be shifted to relatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">In December 1982, our Supreme Court decided <em>In re Jerald C. </em>(Cal.). The court invalidated former section 903.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court held it was a denial of equal protection to impose the cost of incarceration, including care, support and maintenance, on the parents of a child declared a ward of the court pursuant to section 602. Rehearing was granted, but before a new decision was rendered, the Legislature rewrote section 903.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While still allowing reimbursement for support of the minor, the section specifically excludes any charges related to \u201cincarceration, treatment, or supervision for the protection of society and the minor and the rehabilitation of the minor.\u201d (\u00a7 903.)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">After the rehearing, a new decision was rendered in <em>In re Jerald C. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 1 [201 Cal.Rptr. 342, 678 P.2d 917], but the court acknowledged \u201c[t]he new legislation is not applicable to this case.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 5, fn. 3.) The lead opinion maintained a parent could not be charged, with stated exceptions, for costs associated with a section 602 confinement. \u2018\u201cA statute obviously violates the equal protection claus\u00e9 if it selects one particular class of persons for a species of taxation and no rational basis supports such classification. . . . [Citations.]\u201d\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>The court recognized reimbursement for costs of counsel in juvenile proceedings and medical treatment is permissible. These are costs for which the parents would otherwise be responsible. \u201cHowever, relative responsibility statutes have been invalidated when the government charges were not for support which the relative refused or failed to provide but for the cost of maintaining public institutions for public benefit.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">\u201cThe basis of commitment under section 602 is criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 7) \u201cWhatever the basis for other commitments by the juvenile court (see \u00a7\u00a7 300, 601), the purposes of the confinement and treatment in commitments pursuant to section 602 include \u2018the protection of society from the confined person.\u2019 <em>(Dept. of Mental Hygiene </em>v. <em>Kirchner, supra, </em>60 Cal.2d [716] at p. 720 [36 Cal.Rptr. 488, 388 P.2d 720, 20 A.L.R.3d 353].)\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe state\u2019s purpose and the benefits provided are for society generally.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 11.) \u201c[T]he county may not recover its costs . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 10.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">In other words, the court recognized a section 602 commitment is for the benefit of society. As a result all costs, with few exceptions, associated with those commitments must be borne by society.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Under the mandates of section 903 and <em>In re Jerald C., supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 1, can the county be reimbursed for the costs of an HSP and probation supervision? We think not. The court in <em>In re Jerald C. </em>understood section 602 commitments were for the protection of society. It recognized \u201cprotection\u201d is provided when the minor is incarcerated in a governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>facility. But it also noted \u201cprotection\u201d includes rehabilitation and treatment when these services are rendered pursuant to a section 602 commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Section 903 limits reimbursement to reasonable costs of support while the minor is placed, detained or committed to any institution or <em>other place </em>pursuant to order of the juvenile court. Nathaniel was committed pursuant to section 602, by an order of the juvenile court, to be detained in his home and in the custody of his parents. By the terms of the last paragraph of section 903 the court may not collect for the expenses of treatment or <em>supervision </em>imposed for the protection of society and the minor and his or her rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">The county, nevertheless, argues <em>In re Jerald C., supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 1, and section 903 are inapplicable. Rather, it urges it is seeking its costs pursuant to section 903.2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The county correctly points out this section, unlike section 903, was not amended pursuant to the first <em>Jerald C. </em>decision. Therefore, it argues the Legislature intended the costs of probation to be reimbursable. But we cannot assume the Legislature intended to leave in place an unconstitutional statute. Rather, we must assume in amending section 903 and in leaving section 903.2 intact, the Legislature presumed the two statutes could be read together in a constitutionally permissible manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Section 903 allows for reimbursement for the costs of the care, support and maintenance of a minor in any county institution or any other place in which the child is detained or committed pursuant to an order of the juvenile court. The county may also collect for the costs of legal services rendered to the minor. (\u00a7 903.1.) These services for which reimbursement is sought are rendered for the benefit of the minor rather than for the benefit of society. And the parents, from whom reimbursement is being sought, have a preexisting statutory or common law duty to otherwise provide them. \u201c [T]he duty imposed by the statutes bears a rational relationship to the accomplishment of the state purpose of relieving the public treasury . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Jerald C., supra, 36 </em>Cal.3d 1, 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Section 903.2 permits reimbursement for costs of probation supervision for a minor. However, we conclude the costs of probation supervision are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>reimbursable only if the \u201ccharges exclude any costs of . . . treatment, or supervision for the protection of society and the minor and the rehabilitation of the minor.\u201d (\u00a7 903.)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">This interpretation is consistent with other statutory changes made or considered at the time section 903 was amended. Another bill considered by the Legislature would have amended section 903.2 to allow parents \u201cto pay all or a portion of the cost of short-term physical confinement orders as a condition of probation, including the cost of incarceration, supervision, and treatment.\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 842, (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) (Assem. Bill No. 738).) Nonetheless, the section remained unamended. The Legislature realized these were not compensable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">In other words, the Legislature intended reimbursement for probation supervision pursuant to section 903.2 only for expenses otherwise allowed pursuant to section 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">The Legislature in 1984 also enacted sect<em>ion </em>allowing the co\u00fcrt <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to make orders affecting the minor, including medical treatment and placement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>in a suitable family home. Section 727, subdivision (c) allows the court to order the parents to appear before a county financial evaluation officer for purposes of determining ability to reimburse the county.* ****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The parents can be charged for medical treatment, for costs of the minimum actual support while placed with a suitable family, and for the parent\u2019s counseling or education. The parents are not, however, to be charged with the cost of probation supervision. The Legislature therefore, in enacting section 727, was aware of which costs were reimbursable and which were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">We also note the charges for HSP reimbursement do not fall within section 903.2. The HSP is statutorily governed by sections 628, 628.1, 636 and 840. When read as a whole, the following statutory scheme emerges.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">A minor, who has been taken into temporary custody, shall be immediately released to the custody of his or her parent, guardian or responsible relative unless one or more of several conditions exists. (\u00a7 628.)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">If the minor meets the criteria for detention, the minor may still be exempt from 24-hour secure detention. The minor may be released to his or her parents on home supervision, subject to certain statutory conditions. (\u00a7 628.1.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">If a minor has violated an order of the juvenile court, the court may order the minor <em>detained </em>in juvenile hall or another suitable place, including his or her own home, again subject to certain statutory conditions. (\u00a7 636.)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Section 840 mandates \u201c [tjhere shall be in each county probation department a program of home supervision to which minors described by section 628.1 shall be referred.\u201d The section also defines home supervision as \u201ca program in which persons who would otherwise be detained in the juvenile hall are permitted to remain in their homes pending court disposition of their cases . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">\u201cThe duties of a deputy probation officer, or a probation aide, a community worker or a volunteer under the supervision of a deputy probation officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>assigned to home supervision are to assure the minor\u2019s appearance at probation officer interviews and court hearings and to assure that the minor obeys the conditions of his [or her] release and commits no public offenses pending final disposition of his [or her] case.\u201d (\u00a7 841.)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Thus, the Legislature has created, pursuant to the HSP, an alternative detention for a minor awaiting final disposition of a section 602 commitment. The statutes authorizing HSP do not provide for reimbursement. Section 628.1 defines certain conditions to be enforced as part of an HSP. Those conditions, however, are limited. \u201cAs a condition for such release, the probation officer shall require the minor to sign a written promise that he [or she] understands and will observe the specific conditions of home supervision release. Such conditions may include curfew and school attendance requirements related to the protection of the minor or the person or property of another, or to the minor\u2019s appearances at court hearings.\u201d (\u00a7 628.1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Thus the governing sections do not provide for reimbursement, and in any event, reimbursement is not permissible under either <em>Jerald C., supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 1, or section 903. Section 602 proceedings have commenced and the minor is detained because the conduct involved is sufficiently serious to be perceived, if continued, as offensive to society as a whole. The HSP is for the protection of society.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">The county raises several additional arguments. We are not impressed. It contends no one has a right to probation; if one wishes to avail oneself of its benefits, one must pay for it. The county suggests \u201cminors found eligible for probation represent a potential threat to society.\u201d If this potentially dangerous minor (and his or her family) wants the benefit of probation, they must be willing to pay for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">We first note the irony of the county\u2019s argument. Indeed, it is because the minor is a potential threat to society that society must pay for the costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>of supervision. The parents may be obligated to pay for only those state functions not conducted for the public benefit. <em>(In re Jerald C., supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 1, 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The county also alleges <em>Jerald C. </em>is inapt because it involved commitment to juvenile hall, boy\u2019s ranch and the California Youth Authority. Nathaniel Z., conversely, was allowed to stay at home. We fail to appreciate the distinction. Both <em>Jerald C. </em>and section 903 speak in terms of a section 602 commitment. The fact the minor is <em>committed </em>is operative, not where. Our Supreme Court and our Legislature recognized parents could not constitutionally be charged for certain expenses which properly were society\u2019s responsibility. It does not matter whether those costs are incurred while the minor is at home or in juvenile hall. In fact, section 903 specifically addresses this issue by forbidding reimbursement when detained \u201cin any . . . place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Moreover, the county fails to appreciate the difference between adult and juvenile probation. Unlike adult probation, juvenile probation is not a grant of leniency imposed as an alternative to the legally authorized sentence. An adult may reject the sentencing court\u2019s offer of leniency and refuse probation; juveniles may not. (1 Cal. Juvenile Court Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1981) \u00a7 9.52, p. 255.)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">\u201c[Pjarents may not be charged for costs when adult children are incarcerated in prison or committed to state hospitals for the dangerous.\u201d <em>(In re Jerald C., supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 1, 6.) Likewise there is no basis for charging parents of juvenile offenders. \u201cTo charge the cost of operation of state functions conducted for public benefit to one class of society is arbitrary and violates the basic constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">The judgment is reversed.

The county shall separately itemize the cost of each major component, such as food, clothing and medical expense, contained within the costs of support of the minor, for any person against whom the county seeks to impose liability under this section. [I] As used in this section, \u2018costs of support\u2019 means that portion of the costs incurred by the county in maintaining a minor that are equivalent to the reasonable expenditures required of a parent pursuant to Sections 196, 207, and 208 of the Civil Code, and does not include the expenses of incarceration, treatment, or supervision imposed for the protection of society and the minor and his or her rehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b993-9\">The lead opinion signed by three justices rejected the concept of allocating \u201cin a reasonable manner a portion of the costs to each juvenile . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 10.)

[K] The court shall order the care, custody, and control of the minor to be under the supervision of the probation officer who may place the minor in any of the following: [11] (1) The home of a relative. [H] (2) A suitable licensed community care facility. [H] (3) With a home-finding agency to be placed in a suitable licensed home or exclusive use home which has been certified by the agency as meeting licensing standards. [11] (b) Where the court has ordered a specific minor placed under the supervision of the probation officer and the probation officer has found that the needs of the child cannot be met in any available licensed or exempt facility, including emergency shelter, the minor may be placed in a suitable family home that has filed a license application with the State Department of Social Services, provided that all the following certification conditions are met: [11] (1) A preplacement home visit is made by the probation officer to determine the suitability of the family home. [11] (2) The probation officer verifies to the licensing agency in writing that the home lacks any deficiencies which would threaten the physical health, mental health, safety, or welfare of the minor.
