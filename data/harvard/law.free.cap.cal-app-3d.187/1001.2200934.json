Code, \u00a7 11359) after his motion to suppress (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5) was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">On August27,1984, while conducting random aerial overflights, a Nevada County sheriff\u2019s deputy observed marijuana growing on certain property. He executed an affidavit in support of a search warrant in order to search the area he had observed. The affidavit disclosed that the marijuana was located approximately 500 feet west of a residence in a rural area. A second patch was observed approximately 250 feet away from the residence. Paths connected the two marijuana gardens to the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">A search warrant was issued that authorized a search of the residence and vehicles under the control of persons in control of the marijuana. The warrant also included, in one provision, authority to search for \u201carticles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>personal property tending to establish the identity of the person or persons in control of the premises, vehicles, storage areas, or containers where controlled substances may be found, consisting of and including, but not limited to, utility company receipts, rent receipts, cancelled mail, envelopes and keys.\u201d The search conducted pursuant to the warrant produced 27 marijuana plants weighing approximately 120 pounds, 17 pounds of \u201csample\u201d marijuana, containers of marijuana seeds and buds and some miscellaneous papers, including letters and checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Defendant contends his motion to suppress was improperly denied because (1) the search warrant used to obtain certain evidence was predicated upon facts obtained by an illegal aerial overflight and (2) the search warrant itself was overbroad. In an unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude the aerial overflight lawfully established probable cause under <em>California </em>v. <em>Ciraolo </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 207 [90 L.Ed.2d 210, 106 S.Ct. 1809], In this published portion, we conclude the warrant was not overbroad. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Defendant contends the search warrant was overbroad by authorizing a search for items tending to indicate the identity of persons in control of premises, vehicles, storage areas or containers where controlled substances were found.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Frank </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 711 [214 Cal.Rptr. 801, 700 P.2d 415], in support of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\"><em>Frank </em>held that notebooks containing the personal thoughts of the defendant were unlawfully seized pursuant to three clauses of a search warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Id.., </em>at p. 722.) The court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> concluded that clauses two and eight of the warrant were overbroad and failed to satisfy the requirement of article I, section 13, of the California Constitution that a search warrant <em>particularly describ[e] </em>the place to be searched and the persons and things to be seized.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frank, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 724, 726, italics original.) The warrant thus placed no \u201cmeaningful restriction upon the objects to be seized, ...\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 726.) The court also held that all three clauses were unsupported by probable cause; nothing in the affidavit gave the magistrate any factual basis to conclude the defendant\u2019s residence contained documentary evidence of his whereabouts at the time of the crime or of any interest he may have had in the crime, or that he had any traffic tickets. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 728.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Here, defendant does not assert a lack of probable cause supporting the warrant, only that it was insufficiently specific. However, the <em>Frank </em>court did not single out as insufficiently particular the clause authorizing the officers to search for and seize indicia of ownership or occupancy (see <em>id., </em>at p. 726) but held only that there was no probable cause to believe any traffic tickets would be found. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 728, fn. 2.) We thus do not read <em>Frank </em>as defendant urges us to; the court never held overbroad (as insufficiently particular) the portion of the warrant allowing the search for evidence indicating the identity of the residents of the home. Indeed, one case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Holmsen </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1045 [219 Cal.Rptr. 598], has read <em>Frank </em>as not invalidating such dominion and control clauses. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1048.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>We recognize <em>Frank </em>uses some rather broad language in its discussion of overbreadth. For example, the court held clause two failed to satisfy the constitutional requirement of particularity because the search for documentary evidence of the defendant\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the crime encompassed items described only \u201cby impermissibly general categories such as \u2018credit card receipts,\u2019 \u2018records of telephone toll calls,\u2019 \u2018cancelled checks,\u2019 and \u2018personal diary notations. \u2019 In order to know whether defendant\u2019s apartment contained any documents in any of these categories,\u201d continued the court, \u201cit would inevitably be necessary for the police to rummage through <em>all </em>defendant\u2019s personal papers and read enough of each to learn its contents . . . .\u201d <em>(Frank, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 726, italics original.) The court reached the same conclusion with respect to clause eight of the warrant, which authorized the search for \u201c\u2018scrapbooks,\u2019 \u2018photographs,\u2019 \u2018tape recordings,\u2019 and \u2018writings\u2019\u2014and purported to limit them to items that \u2018could relate\u2019 to the victim\u2019s death and \u2018would indicate\u2019 either \u2018participation\u2019 or \u2018an interest\u2019 in that death by defendant. . . . [T]o execute this clause it would be necessary for the police both to rummage through all defendant\u2019s \u2018writings\u2019 and to read enough of each to learn its contents.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">It is difficult to discern from <em>Frank </em>a principled basis to distinguish between the generic categories found insufficiently particular and those not declared so. Thus, \u201ccredit card receipts,\u201d \u201crecords of telephone toll calls\u201d and \u201ccancelled checks\u201d were all declared overbroad <em>(Frank, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 726) while \u201cutility company receipts\u201d and \u201cinsurance papers\u201d were not expressly condemned, even though a search for each category would entail an intrusion into defendant\u2019s papers for purposes of examination and possible seizure. In any event, we do not read <em>Frank </em>as invalidating the warrant clause at issue here on overbreadth grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">However, even if our reading of <em>Frank </em>is wrong, the decision in that case was based exclusively on article I, section 13, of the California Constitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frank, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 724.) That crime took place in 1978, before the voters amended the California Constitution by enacting Proposition 8 in 1982. (See Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28.)* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since that provision was added, exclusion of evidence in a criminal trial on grounds it is the product of an illegal search or seizure is compelled only to the extent suppression is required by exclusionary rules necessary to enforce the United States Constitution. <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 879 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744]; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1986) 181 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>Cal.App.3d 842, 844-845 [226 Cal.Rptr. 714]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Love </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 104, 107 [214 Cal.Rptr. 483]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Aho </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 984, 991 [212 Cal.Rptr. 686]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 11, 17 [211 Cal.Rptr. 216].)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">\u201cGeneral warrants, of course, are prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. \u2018[T]he problem [posed by the general warrant] is not that of intrusion <em>per se, </em>but of a general, exploratory rummaging in a person\u2019s belongings. . . . [The Fourth Amendment addresses the problem] by requiring a \u201cparticular description\u201d of the things to be seized.\u2019 <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 433, 467 [29 L.Ed.2d 564, 583, 91 S.Ct. 2022] (1971). This requirement \u2018\u201cmakes general searches . . . impossible and prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another. As to what is to be taken, nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.\u2019\u201d <em>Stanford </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>379 U.S. 476, 485 [13 L.Ed.2d 431, 437, 85 S.Ct. 506] (1965), quoting <em>Marron </em>v. <em>United States, </em>275 U.S., at 196 [72 L.Ed. 231, 237, 48 S.Ct. 74].\u201d <em>(Andresen </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1976) 427 U.S. 463, 480 [49 L.Ed.2d 627, 642, 96 S.Ct. 2737].) \u201cAs for the . . . objective of preventing the seizure of objects on the mistaken assumption that they fall within the magistrate\u2019s authorization, <em>Marron </em>[v. <em>United States </em>(1927) 275 U.S. 192 (72 L.Ed. 231, 48 S.Ct. 74)] goes on to say that \u2018nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant,\u2019 but few warrants could pass such a strict test and thus it is more accurate to say that \u2018the warrant must be sufficiently definite so that the officer executing it can identify the property sought with reasonable certainty.\u2019\u201d (1 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure (1984) \u00a7 3.4(f), p. 227, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The warrant clause at issue here has been upheld in the federal courts against claims that it is insufficiently particular under the Fourth Amendment. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Burns </em>(10th Cir. 1980) 624 F.2d 95, 101, cert. den. <em>sub nom.

The clause is not overbroad under the Fourth Amendment because \u201cThe words therein \u2018tending to establish the identity of the persons in control of the premises\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>sufficiently identify and limit the items to be seized.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Honore, supra, </em>450 F.2d at p. 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Other closely related warrant clauses have also been repeatedly upheld by the federal courts against challenges for overbreadth.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Milliman </em>v. <em>State of Minn. </em>(8th Cir. 1985) 774 F.2d 247, 249-250 [\u201cWritings, including but not limited to books, checkbooks and bank accounts, magazines, automobile title certificates and registration cards, copies of real estate tax receipts, W-2 forms and other tax-related records ... all and any of which writings tend to show the presence of Lance Gerald Milliman and (his wife).\u201d]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 761 F.2d 1294, 1301-1302 [\u201c\u2018items or articles of personal property tending to show identity of persons in ownership, dominion or control of said premises. . . .\u2019\u201d]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(7th Cir. 1984) 726 F.2d 339, 342 [\u201cproof of residency\u201d]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Whitten </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 706 F.2d 1000, 1008-1009, cert. den.

The court will base its determination on such factors as the purpose for which the warrant was issued, the nature of the items to which it is directed, and the total circumstances surrounding the case. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lebron, </em>729 F.2d 533, 538 (8th Cir. 1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Apker, </em>705 F.2d 293,299 (8th Cir. 1983).\u201d <em>(Milliman </em>v. <em>State of Minn., supra, 774 </em>F.2d at p. 250.) We shall apply the foregoing test to determine whether the warrant at issue here is sufficiently particular under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>The warrant clause at issue here arises in a situation where police officers had ample probable cause to believe that occupants of the residence and those in control of vehicles on the premises were engaging in continuing criminal activity. The officers also had ample probable cause to believe contraband\u2014marijuana\u2014would be found in the areas subject to search. However, the officers did not know who lived in the residence nor who was in control of the vehicles nor who was in control of contraband likely to be found on the premises. The affidavit in support of the warrant alleged\u2014 and common experience tells us\u2014that houses and vehicles ordinarily contain evidence establishing the identities of those occupying or using them. However, we think it is obvious that the officers could not be expected to divine in advance of their entry the precise nature of such evidence\u2014whether mail, bills, checks, invoices, other documents, or keys. Nor could the officers be expected to know the precise location where such evidence would be located. To require such prescience from the officers would be patently unreasonable. Nor do we perceive a reasonable way to require police officers to describe the nature or location of identity evidence with greater particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">While a search for the matters described in the warrant may invade the privacy of the occupants of the premises, so does any search. The extent of invasion of privacy is not unreasonable in the circumstances. We cannot believe the Fourth Amendment prohibits officers with ample probable cause to believe those in a residence have committed a felony from searching the residence to discover ordinary indicia of the identities of the perpetrators,  We hold that the search warrant in this case was not overbroad under the Fourth Amendment and the evidence challenged by defendant was properly admitted. <em>(In re Lance </em>W., <em>supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 879; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burns, supra, </em>624 F.2d at p. 101; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Honore, supra, </em>450 F.2d at p. 33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Puglia, P.
