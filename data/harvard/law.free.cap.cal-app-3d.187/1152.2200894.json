Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 286, subd. (c)), six counts of sodomy in a local detention facility (\u00a7 286, subd. (e)), three counts of forcible oral copulation (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c)), and three counts of oral copulation in a local detention facility (\u00a7 288a, subd. (e)). The trial court sentenced him to 46 years in prison for these various crimes,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> consisting of 36 years under section 667.6, subdivision (d)\u2019s authorization for full-force consecutive terms plus 10 years under section 1170.1, subdivision (a)\u2019s consecutive sentencing framework. The trial court imposed then stayed execution of consecutive two-year terms on the nine local detention facility counts, which had been alleged and proved as alternative counts to the forcible offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">Cortez contends and respondent agrees that, because the jury did not find that he committed the crimes by means of \u201cforce, violence, duress, menace, or threat of great bodily harm,\u201d two results followed; 1) the trial court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>in invoking section 667.6, subdivision (d)\u2019s full-force consecutive term provision; 2) on remand, section 1170.1, subdivision (a)\u2019s five-year limitation on subordinate terms for crimes other than \u201cviolent felonies\u201d will come into play. Cortez also seeks further relief under section 654. For reasons to be stated, we will agree with Cortez\u2019s various contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">\n<em>Full-force Consecutive Terms</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">As noted above, Cortez was sentenced to six full-force six-year consecutive middle base terms for violating section 286, subdivision (c). In 1984, when the instant crimes occurred, section 667.6, subdivision (d) did not apply to a violation of section 286 unless the sodomy was \u201cby force, violence, duress, menace, or threat of great bodily harm.\u201d However, the trial court instructed the jury per CALJIC No. 10.50 (sodomy) and in accordance with the language of section 286, subdivision (c) that \u201cfear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury\u201d would support a conviction. The jury verdicts found, disjunctively, that Cortez \u201cused force, violence, duress, menace, <em>or </em>threat of immediate and unlawful bodily injury in the commission of the sodomy. \u201d (Italics added.) On this record, we cannot determine whether the jury found at least one of the factors required to trigger section 667.6, subdivision (d). This being the case, the trial court erred in imposing full-force consecutive terms. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reber </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 523, 535 [223 Cal.Rptr. 139]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Riffey </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 419, 422-425 [217 Cal.Rptr. 319]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Foley </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 1039, 1050-1057 [216 Cal.Rptr. 865]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Reyes </em>(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 803, 811-813 [200 Cal.Rptr. 651].) Resentencing must occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">\n<em>Limitation on Subordinate Terms</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">On remand, the trial court will have to decide whether to impose concurrent or consecutive terms on the forcible sodomies. Since the full-force provision of section 667.6, subdivision (d) cannot apply, any consecutive term necessarily will be under section 1170.1, subdivision (a), which authorizes subordinate consecutive terms equal to one-third the middle base term for the particular offense. However, section 1170.1, subdivision (a) places a five-year lid on \u201cthe total of subordinate terms for such consecutive offenses which are not \u2018violent felonies\u2019 as defined in subdivision (c) of section 667.5 ...\u201d Section 667.5, subdivision (a) authorizes a three-year enhancement upon a defendant convicted of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for each prior prison term served for a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d In 1984, when the instant crimes occurred, section 667.5, subdivision (c)(4), like section 667.6, subdivision (d) discussed above, applied to \u201csodomy by force, violence, duress, menace, or threat of great bodily harm.\u201d As noted above, we cannot de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>termine whether the jury found at least one of the essential factors. This being the case, Cortez asserts and respondent concedes that the <em>Reyes-Rijfey </em>rationale which precludes full-force consecutive terms also bars a total of subordinate terms exceeding five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">In our view, the analogy is persuasive. As noted, in 1984, the language of sections 667.5, subdivision (c) and 667.6, subdivision (d) was identical as concerned sodomy, as well as oral copulation. Thus, the Legislature provided for three different adverse sentencing consequences for sodomies (and oral copulations) committed by particular means. First, section 667.5, subdivision (a) required a three-year additional term for each prior prison term for a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d instead of the typical one-year enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b) for nonviolent felonies. Second, sections 667.6, subdivisions (c) and (d) provided respectively for discretionary and mandatory full-force consecutive terms rather than terms equal to one-third the middle base term under section 1170.1, subdivision (a). Third, section 1170.1, subdivision (a) removed the five-year ceiling on consecutive terms for \u201cviolent felonies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">At one time, before 1980, perfect congruence existed between the statutory definitions of forcible sodomy (and oral copulation), on the one hand, and the special provisions of sections 667.5, subdivision (c) and 667.6, subdivisions (c) and (d). Thus, sections 288a and 286, like the other sections, required that the forcible species of the crime involve \u201cforce, violence, duress, menace, or threat of great bodily harm.\u201d When a defendant was convicted of forcible sodomy (or forcible oral copulation), the jury necessarily determined that the defendant used those means which could expose him to the various adverse sentencing consequences noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">In 1980, matters changed, when the Legislature amended sections 288a, subdivision (a) and 286, subdivision (c) to require a lesser showing, to wit, \u201cfear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury. \u201d Sections 667.5, subdivision (c) and 667.6, subdivisions (c) and (d) were not amended at the same time. The result: the problems addressed in <em>Reyes, Foley, Riffey, Reber, </em>and the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">The cited cases have held that the trier of fact at the guilt phase must find the fact which invokes the full-force terms of section 667.6, subdivision (c) or (d). The sentencing judge may not fill a gap created by inadequate instructions and verdict forms. We see no reason in logic why a different rule should apply to a determination of fact which removes the five-year lid on consecutive terms under section 1170.1, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">The three-year enhancement for \u201cviolent felony\u201d prior prison terms \u201cshall be pleaded and proven as provided by law. \u201d (\u00a7 1170.1, subd. (f).) A \u201cviolent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>felony\u201d enhancement cannot be imposed where the trier of fact failed to determine at the guilt phase the existence of the critical facts. To not require a similar determination as a predicate to removing the five-year ceiling on subordinate terms would be anomalous in the extreme. In each case, the ultimate issue is whether the crime is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as defined in section 667.5, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">In 1985, in apparent reaction to <em>Reyes, supra, </em>the Legislature amended section 667.6, subdivisions (c) and (d) to restore the congruence between the full-force terms authorization and the statutory elements of forcible sodomy and oral copulation. (Stats. 1985, ch. 401, \u00a7 1.) At the same time, the Legislature also amended section 667.5, subdivision (c) in the same way. (Stats. 1985, ch. 402, \u00a7 1.) The Legislative Counsel\u2019s digest of the latter amendment explains: \u201cExisting law, with a specified exception, requires enhancement of a prison term imposed for a defined violent felony by 3 years for each previous violent felony for which the defendant served a prison term. \u2018Violent felony\u2019 is defined to include, in part, sodomy or oral copulation by threat of great bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">\u201cThis bill would instead include in this definition of \u2018violent felony\u2019 sodomy or oral copulation by fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another. This change would conform the above provisions on penalty enhancement to the existing definitions of the crimes of sodomy and oral copulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">The 1985 legislative action, to us, attempts a comprehensive cure of the various problems caused by the post-1980 disharmony between the three sentencing provisions, on the one hand, and the statutory definitions of forcible sodomy and oral copulation, on the other. The cure, through restored congruency, comes too late for the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">We conclude that the five-year ceiling will apply in the event that the trial court, on remand, imposes consecutive terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">\n<em>Future Enhancement Use of Alternative Convictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">As noted above, the trial court imposed then, pursuant to section 654, stayed execution of sentence on the nine local detention facility counts, alternative counts to the nine forcible sex crimes. Cortez contends that the trial court also should have stayed any future use of these alternative convictions. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Pearson </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 351 [228 Cal.Rptr. 509, 721 P.2d 595], our Supreme Court recently resolved this issue in line with Cortez\u2019s argument: \u201cAny subsequent sentences imposed on defendant can be enhanced on the basis of the convictions for which he served a sentence; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>but convictions for which service of sentence was stayed may not be so used unless the Legislature explicitly declares that subsequent penal or administrative action may be based on such stayed convictions. Without such a declaration, it is clear that section 654 prohibits defendant from being disadvantaged in any way as a result of the stayed convictions.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 361.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed. The judgment insofar as it relates to sentencing is vacated and the matter is remanded for resentencing in accordance with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">Before Franson, Acting P.
