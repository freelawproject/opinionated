In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 181 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011), which abrogated <em>United States v. Lorenzo, </em>471 F.3d 1219 (11th Cir.2006), we vacate Harris\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-24\">\u201cWe review sentencing decisions only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). First, we \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>tence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). If we conclude that no procedural error occurred, \u201cthe second step is to review the sentence\u2019s \u2018substantive reasonableness\u2019 under the totality of the circumstances, including \u2018the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">In now seeking remand for re-sentencing, Harris argues, as he did at his sentencing hearing, that the district court should consider his post-sentence rehabilitative conduct in determining his new sentence. When he received the 120-month sentence which is the subject of this appeal, this Court\u2019s precedent provided that \u201cpost-sentence rehabilitative conduct [was] an impermissible factor for the district court\u2019s consideration.\u201d <em>Lorenzo, </em>471 F.3d at 1221. In <em>Pepper, </em>the Supreme Court abrogated this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lorenzo, </em>and held that \u201cwhen a defendant\u2019s sentence has been set aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation and ... such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the now-advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines range.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 1236; <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>638 F.3d 1351, 1352 (11th Cir.2011) (recognizing that <em>Lorenzo </em>was abrogated by <em>Pepper).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Although <em>Lorenzo </em>was binding precedent at the time of his re-sentencing hearing, Harris contends that in light of <em>Pepper </em>the district court procedurally erred by failing to consider his post rehabilitative conduct. The government argues in response that any error by the district court was harmless. In imposing its sentence, the district court stated: \u201cThe Court recognizes your significant rehabilitation in prison but feels that ... 120 months is an appropriate sentence under the circumstances.\u201d Based on that statement, the government argues that the district court did, in fact, consider Harris\u2019s post-rehabilitative conduct but concluded that it did not warrant a lesser sentence. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1121, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992) (\u201cIf the party defending the sentence persuades the court of appeals that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the erroneous factor, then a remand is not required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">After thorough review of the record, we vacate Harris\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing. The district court\u2019s statement regarding Harris\u2019s post-rehabilitative conduct is ambiguous. While the district court expressly recognized Harris\u2019s post rehabilitative conduct at re-sentencing, it is unclear from the record whether the court actively considered that conduct in determining its sentence. Given that our decision in <em>Lorenzo </em>was binding precedent at the time of Harris\u2019s re-sentencing, we will not infer that the district court gave consideration to a factor that at the time was impermissible. <em>See Lorenzo, </em>471 F.3d at 1221. For these reasons, we vacate Harris\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing so that the district court may consider his post-sentence rehabilitative conduct as permitted under <em>Pepper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
