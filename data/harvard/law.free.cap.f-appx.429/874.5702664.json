Walker argues on appeal that the district court erred in assigning a 12-level increase to her offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), because her prior conviction under state law did not categorically qualify as a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of the Sentencing Guidelines. She contends certain acts that the Ohio statute criminalizes would not qualify as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) because they do not require the requisite act and <em>mens rea. </em>Therefore, she maintains that the court should have looked beyond the language of the statute to consider the factual circumstances of her conviction through examination of certain judicial documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">\u201cWe review questions of law with respect to the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.2006) (reviewing whether district court correctly interpreted a conviction under a Florida solicitation statute to fall within the meaning of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2). We generally adopt the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d to determine \u201cwhether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense for enhancement purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1273. This approach requires the sentencing court to look no farther than the fact of conviction and the statutory offense to see if it is the equivalent of a relevant offense level-enhancing definition in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1328 (11th Cir.2010). When a violation of a state statute is broader than the offense as described in the Guidelines, so that a state conviction may or may not qualify for an offense level enhancement, this Court employs the modified categorical approach. <em>Id. </em>This approach allows a court to consider certain judicial documents to ascertain the factual circumstances of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction, and determine whether it warrants an enhancement under the Guidelines. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) provides a 12-level enhancement if the defendant was deported after a conviction for a felony \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d if the sentence imposed was \u201c13 months or less.\u201d The Application Notes to \u00a7 2L1.2 state that drug trafficking is \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">In interpreting whether a violation of a state statute categorically falls within the meaning of this particular enhancing provision, we have held that we are not constrained by the element-oriented approach used to interpret the meaning of other provisions, such as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the same Guideline section. <em>See United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228, 1231-33 (11th Cir.2003). There, we examined the Georgia drug trafficking statute and determined that a conviction under it qualified as a drug trafficking offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 even though all the state statute required for conviction was \u201cpossession of 28 grams or more of methamphetamine.\u201d We clarified that a state law violation can qualify as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2 even though the literal language of the statute does not contain an element as described in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>We held that where the literal language of the state statute is missing an element of intent to distribute, this element may be inferred from the structure of the state\u2019s statutory system. <em>Id. </em>In Georgia, the state devised a three-tier system with different, more serious crimes becoming available as the amount of drugs increased. At the top was drug trafficking, which criminalized the possession of 28 grams or more of methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>at 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The Ohio statute Walker was convicted of violating provides: \u201c(A) No person shall knowingly do any of the following: (2) Prepare for shipment, ship, transport, deliver, prepare for distribution, or distribute a controlled substance, when the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the controlled substance is intended for sale or resale by the offender or another person.\u201d Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 2925.03(A)(2) (\u201cTrafficking offenses\u201d). Other circuits have held that the statute triggers \u00a7 2L1.2(b). See <em>United States v. Fuentes-Oyervides, </em>541 F.3d 286 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Karam, </em>496 F.3d 1157 (10th Cir.2007) \u201cWhile the relevant portion of the Ohio statute prohibits conduct which alone may consist of no more than mere possession, it does so only when the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe the controlled substance is intended for sale or resale by ... another. This language makes clear that the statute prohibits only acts of distribution.\u201d <em>Karam, </em>496 F.3d at 1167-68 (internal quotations and citation omitted). As our precedent makes clear, even if abstract portions of the statutory language could be said to prohibit only acts of possession, it is proper to infer the intent to distribute by looking at the provision in its entirety and in relation to the statutory scheme as a whole. <em>See Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d at 1232-33. Looking at the statute in this light, a violation of Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 2925.03(A)(2) categorically qualifies as a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">Within her argument discussed above, Walker also argues that because the district court improperly applied the Guidelines, her sentence was procedurally un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>reasonable. Therefore, she alleges, the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">Because we hold that a conviction under Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 2925.03(A)(2) categorically qualifies as a drug trafficking offense, the district court did not misapply the Guidelines. Therefore, Walker\u2019s sentence was procedurally sound, and the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-11\">.
