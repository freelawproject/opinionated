We granted a COA on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-23\">Whether the district court committed a procedural error by declining to review the merits of Smith\u2019s claim concerning the state trial court\u2019s admission into evidence of two photographs of the victim\u2019s dead body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-24\">We now hold that the district court committed procedural error, and as a result we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-25\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo. Digsby v. McNeil, </em>627 F.3d 823, 830 (11th Cir.2010). When a district court fails to address all of the claims presented by the petitioner, however, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 938 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>Of course not all errors in state trial proceedings support claims for habeas relief. As relevant here, a federal court reviewing a state prisoner\u2019s habeas petition may not \u201creexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions,\u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 480, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991), but it may review state evidentiary rulings to determine whether the rulings violated the petitioner\u2019s due process rights. <em>Felker v. Turpin, </em>83 F.3d 1303, 1311-12 (11th Cir.1996). In such instances, the inquiry is limited to determining whether evidentiary errors \u201c\u2018so infused the trial with unfairness as to deny due process of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Felker, </em>83 F.3d at 1311 (quoting <em>Lisenba v. California, </em>314 U.S. 219, 228, 62 S.Ct. 280, 286, 86 L.Ed. 166 (1941)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Adhering to these rules, the district court accepted and adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report, which dismissed the claim underlying this appeal \u2014 Ground 7 in Smith\u2019s underlying habeas petition \u2014 because that claim failed \u201cto present [a] proper ground! ] for habeas corpus relief.\u201d According to the Magistrate Judge, this is so because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-6\">Evidentiary errors in the admission of photographs, which are matters of state law, ordinarily will not support the granting of habeas relief. <em>Smith v. Newsome, </em>876 F.2d 1461, 1468 (11th Cir.1989). \u201cIt is not the province of a federal habeas Court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions.\u201d <em>[Estelle, </em>502 U.S. at 67-68, 112 S.Ct. at 480],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">We take from this discussion that the Magistrate Judge concluded that Smith failed to plead a federal constitutional violation in his petition, and as a result denied Smith\u2019s claim as one seeking habeas relief premised upon -state evidentiary errors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">We think, however, that the Magistrate Judge failed to afford Smith\u2019s <em>pro se </em>petition the liberal construction to which it is entitled. Our longstanding rule is that the pleadings of a <em>pro se </em>litigant are liberally construed. <em>Bellizia v. Florida, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>614 F.3d 1326, 1329 (11th Cir.2010). Accordingly, courts must show leniency to <em>pro se </em>litigants, even as they should not serve as de facto counsel or rewrite a pleading in order to sustain an action. <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998), <em>overruled on other grounds as recognized in, Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 709 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">A liberal construction of Smith\u2019s petition compels the conclusion that Smith pled a federal due process violation. Smith\u2019s habeas pleadings described \u201cGround Seven\u201d as \u201cTrial court abused its discretion by admitting Two photographs! ] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 that were highly prejudicial.\u201d Smith later supplemented his petition, explaining in his \u201cBrief in Support of petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2254\u201d that the prejudice from the photographs \u201cviolated Due Process.\u201d And petitioner\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation stated that the magistrate erred by not concluding that the challenged photographs prejudiced his right to a fair trial in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. As clarified in these filings, petitioner\u2019s evidentiary claim was a constitutional due process claim that prejudice from the offending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>photographs so infected the integrity of his trial as to warrant habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Because we need not rewrite petitioner\u2019s assertions or otherwise act as counsel for Smith to conclude he is invoking his constitutional right to due process, <em>see GJR Invs., </em>132 F.3d at 1369, his habeas petition should be construed to raise a claim for habeas relief premised on the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. U.S. Const, amend. XIV. Therefore, we hold that Smith has presented a proper ground for federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">The upshot of this holding is that Smith has raised a potentially viable claim for habeas relief that was not passed upon by the district court\u2019s initial Order disposing of his habeas petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For this reason, we must vacate the Order below and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-8\">. Similarly, by describing the Report and Recommendation as \"[finding Ground 7] to be [an] inapplicable ground[ ] for federal habeas relief,\u201d the District Court appears to have reached the same conclusion that Ground 7 did not present a claim for relief premised upon the Constitution. Thus, because neither the Magistrate Judge nor the District Court inquired into the merits of Smith\u2019s due process claim, the record belies the Respondent\u2019s contention that the District Court \"by implication\u201d ruled on the merits of Smith's due process claim, and we therefore reject that argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b960-16\">. We hold only that Smith has pled a federal claim, but take no position as to the merits of that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
