The district court sentenced appellant to concurrent prison terms of 36 months on Counts Two and Three and a concurrent prison term of 24 months on Count Four. He appeals his sentences on Counts Two and Three, which constitute a variance above the Guidelines sentencing range of 18 to 24 months, as procedurally and substantively unreasonable. The sentences are substantively unreasonable, he says, because the variance the court imposed is greater than the variances imposed in other circuits and therefore unreasonably disparate. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-17\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In determining reasonableness, we \u201cevaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7] 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We conduct a two-step review, first ensuring that the sentence is procedurally reasonable, and then examining whether the sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The \u00a7 3553(a) purposes include the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>dant with needed training or treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">When considering the difference between a particular sentence and sentences imposed for similar crimes, we are not persuaded by bare numbers without context. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1317 (11th Cir.2007). In <em>Campbell, </em>we considered a challenge by the former mayor of Atlanta to his sentences for tax fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 1308-09. Rejecting Campbell\u2019s argument that \u201cstatistics ... indicate that Campbell\u2019s sentences greatly exceed the average sentences imposed upon those convicted of tax crimes,\u201d we explained that \u201cthe statistics Campbell cites are bare numbers without context and, therefore, do not persuade us that his sentences are unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court properly calculated the Guidelines sentencing range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not rely on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the sentence imposed. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The district court\u2019s acknowledgment that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the parties\u2019 arguments is sufficient, and the court ordinarily does not need to \u201cstate on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">With regard to substantive reasonableness, \u201c[t]he district court has wide discretion to decide whether the section 3553(a) factors justify a variance,\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir.2010), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2166, 179 L.Ed.2d 946 (2011), such as the variance the court imposed on Counts Two and Three here. \u201c[T]he justification [must] be \u2018sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1196 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011) (citation omitted). Although a sentence should not be greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a), focusing solely on this requirement is problematic. <em>Id. </em>at 1197. \u201cThe requirement is not merely that a sentencing court when handing down a sentence be stingy enough to avoid one that is too long, but also that it be generous enough to avoid one that is too short.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We set aside a sentence only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">Appellants 36-months\u2019 sentences are reasonable. The Sentencing Commission sentencing statistics appellant gave the district court in an effort to show that the upward 12-months\u2019 variance the court fashioned here is unreasonable are bare numbers without context. In particular, appellant did not elaborate on the facts of the cases in which the judges of the Middle District of Florida imposed upward variances. Although he argues that the district court failed to adequately explain the sentences, the record is clear that the court did provide an adequate explanation for the upward variance. Finally, the sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>fences reflect the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
