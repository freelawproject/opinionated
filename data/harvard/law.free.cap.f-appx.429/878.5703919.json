He now appeals the sentence, raising two issues: (1) whether the district court\u2019s statement at the sentencing hearing that the applicable Guidelines sentencing range was \u201cpresumptively reasonable\u201d constitutes procedural error, and (2) whether the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence by failing to afford adequate weight to his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Franklyn did not object to the district court\u2019s statement that the applicable Guidelines sentencing range is presumptively reasonable. Thus, to prevail on that issue, he must show that the court (1) erred; (2) the error was plain; and (3) it affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Bacon, </em>598 F.3d 772, 777 (11th Cir.2010). If these elements are present, we may exercise our discretion to vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We resolve the first issue against Franklyn, because the error did not affect Franklyn\u2019s substantial rights, and turn to the second issue, whether his sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">A sentence is substantively unreasonable if it \u201cfails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable Guidelines sentencing range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">A district court abuses its discretion when it balances the \u00a7 3553(a) factors unreasonably or places unreasonable weight on a single factor. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>(U.S. Apr. 4, 2010) (No. 10-727). We will remand for resentencing when \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">We find nothing in this record to indicate that the district court failed to comply with these sentencing principles and objectives. Franklyn\u2019s sentence is therefore substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
