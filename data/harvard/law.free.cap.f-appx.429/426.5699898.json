Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006), in which we held that a district court may order a term of imprisonment to run consecutively to an unimposed state sentence. Arp\u00f3n further concedes that his remaining arguments are foreclosed as this court has repeatedly held that a sentencing judge may find by a preponderance of the evidence all the facts necessary to the determination of a sentencing guidelines range. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rhine, </em>583 F.3d 878, 891 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>487 F.3d 232, 245-46 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 798 (5th Cir.2006). The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
