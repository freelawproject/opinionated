For the following reasons, we will dismiss Golden\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Golden\u2019s complaint, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, alleges that various prison employees at the State Correctional Institution in Fayette, Pennsylvania, where he was formerly incarcerated, violated his constitutional rights by planting \u201cGovernment Micro Eye Cameras\u201d in his food and broadcasting images obtained from those cameras on prison television. Golden believes that, once ingested, the cameras \u201cattach[ ] to the visual cortex and then can be seen by someone on a computer,\u201d thus providing the defendants with a means of keeping tabs on him. The District Court dismissed Golden\u2019s complaint, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, finding that Golden\u2019s \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cdelusional\u201d allegations lacked a basis in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Golden has been granted in forma pauper-is status, we review this appeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Contrary to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) \u2014 formerly \u00a7 1915(d) \u2014 provides a court with \u201cthe unusual power to pierce the veil of the complaint\u2019s factual allegations and dismiss those claims whose factual contentions are clearly baseless.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). \u201c[A] finding of factual frivolousness is appropriate when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible, whether or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them.\u201d <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Having reviewed Golden\u2019s complaint, we conclude that his allegations are fantastic, delusional, and simply unbelievable. <em>Id. </em>at 32-33, 112 S.Ct. 1728 (a complaint may be dismissed as lacking a basis in fact if it is premised upon \u201callegations that are fanciful, \u2018fantastic,\u2019 and \u2018delusional[.]\u2019\u201d) (citations omitted). Accordingly, we will dismiss Golden\u2019s appeal. Golden\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Tabron v. Grace, </em>6 F.3d 147, 155-56 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
