Ramadan alleged that she suffered past persecution and had a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground, namely her particular social group of being a female in the Middle East. The BIA denied Ramadan\u2019s withholding claim in part because this purported social group was \u201ctoo broad to be legally cognizable\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">We express no view on that finding by the BIA because Ramadan fails to challenge it in her brief to this Court, and she has therefore abandoned any such argument. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result, Ramadan cannot show that any past persecution she suffered or well-founded fear of persecution she may have was on account of a statutorily protected ground, as required to obtain withholding of removal. <em>See Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 860-61 (11th Cir.2007); INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). Accordingly, we deny her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-10\">. Ramadan has also abandoned on appeal any claim of asylum or relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
