On appeal, OrtizAlvear argues that the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of the federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2), in <em>Cuellar v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 550, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>128 S.Ct. 1994, 170 L.Ed.2d 942 (2008), which rendered him actually innocent of his money laundering conviction. He explains that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was inadequate to challenge his conviction based on the retroactive application of <em>Cuellar </em>because he had previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">In 1995, Ortiz-Alvear was convicted in the Eastern District of New York for conspiracy to commit a drug offense, structuring financial transactions to avoid currency reporting requirements, and money laundering. His convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, and in 1998 he filed an unsuccessful motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">He was later transferred to a facility in the Southern District of Georgia and in 2009, Ortiz-Alvear filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition, arguing that he was actually innocent of the money laundering charges because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cuellar </em>narrowed the definition of money laundering so that it no longer covered his conduct. Because he had previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, he argued that he was entitled to relief under \u00a7 2241 via the savings clause in \u00a7 2255. The district court, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, denied relief on the ground that the Supreme Court had not identified <em>Cuellar </em>as retroactively applicable. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005). Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) \u2014 the \u201csavings clause\u201d \u2014 \u201cpermits a prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition only if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945 (quotation omitted). Statutory restrictions on \u201csuccessive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section inadequate or ineffective within the meaning of the savings clause. Thus, a petitioner who has filed and been denied a previous \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the successive motion restrictions simply by\u201d requesting relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). As this court has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-8\">[t]he savings clause of \u00a7 2255 [only] applies to a claim when: 1) that claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; 2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, 3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-9\"><em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). In order for a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy via the savings clause, he must meet all three criteria articulated in <em>Wofford. See </em>177 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">When the Supreme Court announces a new rule, that rule is generally only applicable to criminal cases pending on direct review. <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 351, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004). But new substantive rules, including decisions that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms, generally apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>Id. </em>at 351-52, 124 S.Ct. 2519; <em>see also United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 711 (11th Cir.2002) (stating that \u201c[d]ecisions of the Supreme Court construing substantive federal criminal statutes must be given retroactive effect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">Ortiz-Alvear was convicted under the federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, which \u201cprohibits specified transfers of money derived from unlawful activities.\u201d <em>Cuellar v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 550, 556, 128 S.Ct. 1994, 170 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>942 (2008). Under subsection (a)(2), it is unlawful to transfer funds \u201cknowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part \u2014 (i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or (ii) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(2). In <em>Cuellar, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted the term \u201cdesigned\u201d to narrow \u00a7 1956\u2019s scope, holding that, in a prosecution for concealment money laundering, <em>\u201chow </em>one moves the money is distinct from <em>why </em>one moves the money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 128 S.Ct. 1994 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court thus held that merely hiding funds during transportation was not a violation of the statute and that the government must prove that the transportation had the purpose of concealing the source or ownership of the funds. <em>Id. </em>at 568, 128 S.Ct. 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Ortiz-AIvear argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s narrow interpretation renders him actually innocent of his money laundering conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the third <em>Wofford </em>criterion, Ortiz-AIvear may only \u201copen a portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding if \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised.\u201d <em>Darby, </em>405 F.3d at 945. Because OrtizAlvear\u2019s direct appeal and first \u00a7 2255 were governed by the law of the Second Circuit, it is that circuit\u2019s law that must have \u201csquarely foreclosed\u201d Ortiz-Alvear\u2019s claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Here, the government concedes, and we agree, that <em>Cuellar </em>is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review because it established a new substantive rule of criminal law. But Ortiz-AIvear is not entitled to relief because he must meet all three criteria articulated in <em>Wofford </em>to avail himself of the savings clause, see <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244, and Ortiz-AIvear cannot show that Second Circuit law squarely foreclosed his claim at the time of his direct appeal or first \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Second Circuit precedent did not \u201csquarely foreclose\u201d Ortiz-Alvear\u2019s claim\u2014 that he did not violate \u00a7 1956(a) (2) (B) (i) by simply hiding funds during transportation \u2014 until at least 2006, when the court of appeals decided <em>United States v. Gotti </em>459 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2006) and <em>United States v. Ness, </em>466 F.3d 79 (2d Cir.2006), <em>vacated by Ness v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 1091, 128 S.Ct. 2900, 171 L.Ed.2d 839 (2008). Prior to 1998, the year in which OrtizAIvear filed his \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate in the Eastern District of New York, no circuit precedent squarely foreclosed OrtizAlvear\u2019s claim. Thus, Ortiz-AIvear has failed to \u201copen a portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding via the savings clause in \u00a7 2255 because he has not met the third prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-6\">. Ortiz-Alvear\u2019s passing references to the Suspension Clause and to the concurrent sentence doctrine are insufficient to raise any argument on appeal. <em>See Chavis v. Clayton County Sch. Dist., </em>300 F.3d 1288, 1291 n. 4 (11th Cir.2002) (confirming that \"a passing reference in an appellate brief is insufficient to raise an issue\u201d).
