(He was sentenced, <em>inter alia, </em>to 292 months imprisonment.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Cruz, who testified, maintains there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because the Government failed to prove he knew the vehicle he was driving contained drugs. Because Cruz moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case, and again at the close of all the evidence, his sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge is preserved for review. Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Accordingly, Cruz\u2019 challenge is reviewed for \u201cwhether, considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>226 F.3d 340, 343 (5th Cir.2000). Direct and circumstantial evidence are weighed equally, and it is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAll credibility determinations and reasonable inferences are to be resolved in favor of the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Resio-Trejo, </em>45 F.3d 907, 911 (5th Cir.1995). The Government\u2019s burden was to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Cruz had: knowledge; possession of a controlled substance; and, intent to distribute that substance. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Delgado, </em>256 F.3d 264, 274 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">\u201cThe knowledge element in a possession case can rarely be established by direct evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>522 F.3d 482, 489 (5th Cir.2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cKnowledge can be inferred from control of the vehicle in some cases; however, when the drugs are hidden, control over the vehicle alone is not sufficient to prove knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). If hidden, \u201cproof of the defendant\u2019s knowledge depends on inference and circumstantial evidence\u201d. <em>United States v. Garcia-Flores, </em>246 F.3d 451, 454 (5th Cir.2001). Our court requires circumstantial evidence \u201cthat is suspicious in nature or demonstrates guilty knowledge\u201d. <em>Mendoza, </em>522 F.3d at 489 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Guilty knowledge may be inferred from: failure to make eye contact; inconsistent statements; implausible explanations; and the amount of drugs being large enough such that it is irrational to believe the drugs would have been entrusted to a party who is not a member of the conspiracy. <em>E.g., United States v. White, </em>219 F.3d 442, 447-48 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Ortega Reyna, </em>148 F.3d 540, 544 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-16\">Viewing the evidence in the requisite light most favorable to the verdict, a reasonable juror could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Cruz knew he was transporting drugs. A reasonable juror\u2019s inference of such knowledge was supported by: Cruz\u2019 avoiding eye contact with law-enforcement agents; and his making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>several inconsistent statements to them. A reasonable juror was also permitted to find Cruz\u2019 explanation \u2014 that he believed he was illegally transporting currency, not drugs \u2014 implausible, in the light of: his admission that he knew the woman who had provided him with the vehicle regularly transported drugs from Mexico to Dallas; and testimony that drugs are generally sent northbound and cash southbound. In addition, Cruz does not challenge testimony at trial that he was entrusted with transporting a significant amount of drugs of substantial value.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
