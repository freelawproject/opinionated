We resolve the issue against appellant and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-21\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cFor a factual finding to be clearly erroneous, [we], after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-22\">The base offense level of a \u00a7 2252(a)(2) offense is enhanced by five levels under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) if the offense involved the \u201cdistribution for the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of value, but not for pecuniary gain....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B). Child pornography can constitute a \u201cthing of value\u201d for purposes of the enhancement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>comment, (n.l). \u201cDistribution\u201d is defined as including \u201cposting material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor ... for public viewing but does not include the mere solicitation of such material by a defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a defendant distributes child pornography with the expectation that he will receive other child pornography in exchange, the district court may properly apply this enhancement. <em>Bender, </em>290 F.3d at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Appellant has not shown that the district court clearly erred in applying the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) enhancement. We are not left with the \u201cdefinite and firm\u201d conviction that the court made a mistake because it could reasonably find on the record before it that appellant was aware of the nature of his file-sharing program and had the expectation of receiving additional child pornography in exchange with those who accessed his shared folder.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
