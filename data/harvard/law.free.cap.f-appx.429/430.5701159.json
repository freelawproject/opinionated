Howard, through the Federal Public Defender, contends that the district court abused its discretion by not granting a reduction to the middle of the recalculated guidelines range. He also contends that the district court committed procedural error or abused its discretion by failing to give reasons for the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-22\">As Howard concedes, his arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). In <em>Evans, </em>we noted that, because the district court was under no obligation to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence at all, it was under no obligation to reduce the sentence even further within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the recalculated range. <em>Id. </em>at 673. In addition, the district court was not required to give reasons for granting the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion but not imposing a lower sentence within the recalculated guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 674. Accordingly, Howard\u2019s contentions are foreclosed by <em>Evans, </em>and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See id. </em>at 672-74.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
