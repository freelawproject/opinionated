He contends that he filed his motions pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and raises the substantive claim that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to conduct an individualized assessment. The government responds that, pursuant to the unambiguous language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e), the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Catalano\u2019s motions to revisit his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-24\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning the jurisdiction of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Oliver, </em>148 F.3d 1274, 1275 (11th Cir.1998). Whether the district court has the authority to modify a custodial sentence after it has been imposed is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194 n. 9 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-25\">We recently held that \u201c[t]he authority of a district court to modify an imprisonment sentence [once it has been imposed] is narrowly limited by statute\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-26\">Specifically, [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3582(c) provides that a court may not modify an imprisonment sentence except in these three circumstances: (1) where the Bureau of Prisons has filed a motion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>either extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant a reduction or the defendant is at least 70 years old and meets certain other requirements, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A); (2) where another statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 expressly permits a sentence modification, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B); or (3) where a defendant has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Commission and certain other requirements are met, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI51\"><em>Id. </em>at 1194-95; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). As to the second circumstance allowing a sentence modification set forth in \u00a7 3582, \u201c[t]he unambiguous language of \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B) indicates that, absent other express statutory authority, modification of an imprisonment sentence can only be done pursuant to Rule 35.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1195. Further, a district court has no \u201cinherent authority\u201d to modify a sentence that has already been imposed. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315, 1319 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that the district court erred in concluding that it had \u201cinherent power\u201d to correct a sentence it had imposed six years earlier and which it viewed to be illegal).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">We conclude that none of the circumstances allowing a district court to modify a sentence are present in the instant case. The district court recognized that it had no authority to reconsider Catalano\u2019s sentence by stating that it \u201ccannot\u201d reconsider the motion. The district court was correct that it lacked jurisdiction and thus we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-7\">.
