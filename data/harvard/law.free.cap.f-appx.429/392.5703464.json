Shelby seeks to appeal the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants and the dismissal with prejudice of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit, alleging that Captain Enlers used excessive force when she slapped him on his ears causing pain and diminished hearing, that Sergeant Williams failed to protect him because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>did not intervene to stop her, and that both were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs by failing to allow him to see a doctor, all in violation of the Eighth Amendment. We construe Shelby\u2019s motion to proceed IFP and his appellate brief as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). We ask only whether the appeal involves meritorious legal issues. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Where the merits are intertwined with the IFP decision, we may reach the merits when deciding the IFP motion. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Nickell v. Beau View of Biloxi, L.L.C., </em>636 F.3d 752, 754 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The primary focus of an excessive-use-of-force claim is the reason behind the use of force, namely, \u201cwhether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). However, the force used and the injury generally must be more than de minimis, though even a de minimis use of force is actionable if it is \u201crepugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 995 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>Glenn v. City of Tyler, </em>242 F.3d 307, 314 (5th Cir.2001). As the district court concluded, in light of Shelby\u2019s allegations and the medical evidence, any force that may have been used by Captain Enlers resulted in an injury which, even giving credence to Shelby\u2019s account of the original altercation, is not sufficient to give rise to a claim of a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">If the events in question do not give rise to a claim against Enlers, then the claim against Sergeant Williams for \u201cfailure to protect\u201d also fails. Further, although Shelby alleges that Sergeant Williams saw the incident, nothing in the record establishes that Sergeant Williams could have prevented the incident or even knew of Captain Enlers\u2019s alleged intentions. Accordingly, Shelby cannot establish that Sergeant Williams knew of a \u201csubstantial risk of serious harm\u201d to Shelby or that Sergeant Williams disregarded the risk by \u201cfailing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">As for the denial of medical treatment, Shelby\u2019s medical records show that he received medical care the day after the alleged assault and again a few days after that. A delay in treatment does not violate the Eighth Amendment unless there has been deliberate indifference that results in substantial harm. <em>Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993). There is no evidence that any purported delay in treating Shelby resulted in any harm, substantial or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Shelby cannot succeed on any claim of vicarious liability or respondeat superior because under \u00a7 1983, there is no liability under these theories. <em>Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 303 (5th Cir.1987). Moreover, because there-was no constitutional deprivation, there can be no supervisory liability. <em>See id. </em>at 304. Although Shelby argues that the defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity, we need not reach that issue because he cannot establish a constitutional violation. <em>See Wells v. Bonner, </em>45 F.3d 90, 93-94 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Finally, along with his federal civil rights claims, Shelby raised state-law claims. The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over these claims and dismissed the entire complaint with prejudice. Shelby\u2019s federal claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>are without merit, and thus the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Rhyne v. Henderson Cnty., </em>973 F.2d 386, 395 (5th Cir.1992). However, the court should have dismissed those claims without prejudice. <em>See Bass v. Parkwood Hosp., </em>180 F.3d 234, 246 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Accordingly, Shelby\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is GRANTED; the judgment is MODIFIED to be without prejudice as to the state-law claims; and the judgment is AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
