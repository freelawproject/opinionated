Galiana argued the state trial court erred by violating his Confrontation Clause rights under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), in denying his motion to exclude the results of one of his blood alcohol tests. The district court denied Galiana\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, concluding the supervisory lab technician\u2019s in-court testimony did not violate <em>Crawford. </em>The <em>district </em>court then granted Galiana a certificate of appealability on his claim disputing the admissibility of the supervisor\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-20\">On appeal, Galiana argues the district court erred in holding the state court\u2019s admission of the lab supervisor\u2019s in-court testimony, who did not actually conduct the test, was proper and not a violation of his Confrontation Clause rights under <em>Crawford. </em>Additionally, Galiana argues the admission of the supervisory technician\u2019s testimony was not harmless error, as it had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-21\">If a federal court determines there has been a constitutional error, habeas relief may not be warranted if the error was \u201charmless.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 622-23, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1713-14, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). We ask \u2018Vhether the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637, 113 S.Ct. at 1722. \u201cUnder this standard, habeas petitioners may obtain plenary review of their constitutional claims, but they are not entitled to habeas relief based on trial error unless they can establish that it resulted in actual prejudice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-22\">Even if the district court erred in admitting the testimony of the supervisory lab technician, it resulted in harmless error. The jury heard testimony from multiple law enforcement personnel and paramedics that alcohol could be smelled on Galiana\u2019s breath, he had bloodshot eyes, mumbled, and was unsteady on his feet, all indicia of intoxication. Galiana even told a state trooper while he was in the hospital he had blacked out right before the accident. Additionally, the emergency room physician who treated Galiana testified the results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>from the toxicology test run on Galiana\u2019s blood while he was at the hospital determined his blood alcohol content was .272, well over the legal limit. Given all of the testimony presented, the supervising lab technician\u2019s testimony did not have a substantial effect or influence on the jury\u2019s verdict. Thus, the district court did not err in concluding any Confrontation Clause error was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-17\">.
