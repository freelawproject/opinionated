He asserts that the district court improperly applied an enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">To obtain a COA, Ruiz must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(e)(2); <em>see also Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When, as here, the district court\u2019s denial of relief is based solely on procedural grounds, a COA may issue \u201cwhen the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Ruiz has not made the requisite showing. Consequently, his motion for a COA is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">Before a successive \u00a7 2255 motion may be filed in the district court, the putative movant must obtain authorization from this court for the district court to consider the motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A); \u00a7 2255. We may authorize the filing of a successive \u00a7 2255 motion only if the movant makes a prima facie showing that his claim relies on either (1) newly discovered evidence that, if proved and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty of the underlying offense; or (2) a new rule of constitutional law that was previously unavailable has been made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review. \u00a7 2244(b)(2); \u00a7 2255. Ruiz has not made the requisite showing. Consequently, his motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">COA DENIED; MOTION FOR AUTHORIZATION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
