(Walgreen) and the denial of his motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. On appeal, Lowry argues the district court misinterpreted the term \u201cactual charge on the claim for program benefits\u201d in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 414.904. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">The False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting \u201ca false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval\u201d or knowingly making or using \u201ca false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(A), (B). \u201cThe False Claims Act does not create liability merely for a health care provider\u2019s disregard of Government regulations or improper internal policies unless, as a result of such acts, the provider knowingly asks the Government to pay amounts it does not owe.\u201d <em>United States </em>ex rel. <em>Clausen v. Lab. Corp. of Am., Inc., </em>290 F.3d 1301, 1311 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Medicare will reimburse a health care provider for 95% of a flu vaccine\u2019s average wholesale price. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u(o)(l)(A)(iv). Section 1395u(o)\u2019s implementing regulation states that such reimbursement is based on \u201cthe lesser of ... [t]he actual charge on the claim for program benefits; or ... 95 percent of the average wholesale price.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 414.904(a), (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">The district court did not err in dismissing Lowry\u2019s action and denying him leave to file a third amended complaint. <em>See Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1073 (11th Cir.2005) (stating a district court may dismiss where an \u201camendment would be futile\u201d). First, Lowry\u2019s second amended complaint failed to state a claim because it cited a regulation governing Medicaid reimbursements while alleging that Walgreen filed fraudulent Medicare claims. Second, an amendment would have been futile because Lowry\u2019s proposed third amended complaint also failed to state a claim under the False Claims Act. <em>See Sibley, </em>437 F.3d at 1073. The plain language of both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395u(o) and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 414.904 merely sets an upper reimbursement limit of 95% of the vaccine\u2019s average wholesale price, and nothing in either section references a provider\u2019s advertised price or \u201cusual and customary charge.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the action and the denial of leave to file a third amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-11\">. We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>\"accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 872 (11th Cir.2008). We also reviews issues of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
