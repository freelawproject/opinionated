The district court imposed a within-guideline sentence of 108 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">Martinez first argues that because the record clearly reflects that the district court believed that it had no discretion to consider his alleged cooperation in the absence of a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the district court effectively rendered the Guidelines mandatory, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\"><em>Booker </em>rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory rather than mandatory. <em>See id. </em>at 245-46, 125 S.Ct. 738. <em>Booker </em>instructs appellate courts to review sentences for reasonableness in light of the statutory sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 260-62, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-18\">The district court\u2019s statements at sentencing belie Martinez\u2019s argument that the court believed it could not depart in the absence of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The district court, after hearing the sentencing arguments of counsel, stated that it had considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and found that a sentence within the guideline range was \u201cappropriate.\u201d The court declined to depart downward, believing that it was \u201cnot warranted.\u201d <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>480 F.3d 309, 320 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he district court implicitly recognized that it could deviate from the Guidelines, but based on the facts before it, decided not to do so.\u201d). The district court did not state that it could not depart because no \u00a7 5K1.1 motion had been filed; it merely noted that no \u00a7 5K1.1 motion had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-19\">We also reject Martinez\u2019s assertion that the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for downward departure based on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>substantial cooperation. Because Martinez neither shows that the Government bargained away its discretion to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion nor argues that the Government acted with unconstitutional motive, his downward departure claim is not reviewable. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-87, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. Urbani, </em>967 F.2d 106, 110-11 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
