Nunez asserts the district court abused its discretion when it excluded evidence of Marcel Li\u2019s prior criminal convictions for medicare fraud and money laundering, and Alberto Valdes\u2019 prior criminal conviction for money laundering.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nunez claims this evidence would have supported his defense that he had no knowledge of the fraud, and that he was duped into the scheme by these two \u201cprofessional con-artists.\u201d After review, we affirm Nunez\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-22\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded Li and Valdes\u2019 prior criminal convictions. First, as conceded by Nunez, the convictions were not admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Further, the evidence was not offered to attack the credibility of Li or Valdes, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>were not witnesses at trial and did not make statements submitted into evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 609. Lastly, the evidence was not relevant to an issue at trial because it was not probative of whether Nunez was unaware of the charged fraud as he contended. Notably, Nunez offered other evidence showing that Li and Valdes were involved in the offense, which the Government did not dispute. Accordingly, we affirm Nunez\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-14\">. Nunez claims Li and Valdes were the masterminds behind the fraudulent scheme. Li and Valdes were not charged in the indictment and did not testify at Nunez\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b856-23\">. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1096 (11th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2342, 176 L.Ed.2d 564 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b857-16\">. We note that even if the district court erred in excluding the evidence, the error was harmless as there was overwhelming evidence of Nunez\u2019s guilt, and the jury did not find credible his defense that he was merely a \"patsy\u201d of Li and Valdes. <em>See United States v. Guzman, </em>167 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.1999) (\"[ojverwhelming evidence of guilt is one factor that may be considered in finding harmless error.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1109 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that an evidentiary error is harmless if it did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on the jury's verdict).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
