We granted Taylor a certif\u00edcate of appealability (COA) on the following issue only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATW9\">Whether the district court erred in denying Taylor\u2019s claim that appellate counsel had been ineffective for failing to argue that Taylor had been convicted based on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-21\">On appeal, Taylor argues two witnesses who testified against him at trial were his accomplices. Taylor claims the state failed to corroborate their testimony, as required by Alabama law, and his appellate and trial attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to raise this argument at trial or on appeal. The state responds the district court never addressed the claim raised in the COA and, pursuant to <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 935-36 (11th Cir.1992), we should vacate the district court\u2019s judgment against Taylor and remand the case back to the district court to permit it to determine whether the claim has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-22\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253; <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). Procedural issues that must be resolved before we can address the underlying claim specified in the COA are presumed to be encompassed in the COA. <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1248 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001). Out of \u201cdeep concern over the piecemeal litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>of federal habeas petitions,\u201d we held in <em>Clisby </em>that the district courts must \u201cresolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to [\u00a7 2254], regardless whether habeas relief is granted or denied.\u201d <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 935-36. When a district court fails to address all of the claims in a habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The district court failed to address the claim raised in Taylor\u2019s COA. Therefore, we vacate the denial of Taylor\u2019s habeas petition and remand the case back to the district court for consideration of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
