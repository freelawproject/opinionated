Stearns, Judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-19\">This is a suit by certain judgment creditors of Adolph Nicolai to set aside two deeds, and subject the real property therein described to the payment of certain judgments rendered against the grantor. The facts are that on April first, eighteen hundred and ninety, the defendants Adolph Nicolai and Karoline, his wife, for the expressed consideration of eight thousand five hundred dollars, executed to their son-in-law, the defendant W. W. McGuire, a warranty deed which purported to convey the following described real property, to wit: Beginning at a point in the north line of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>block one hundred and ninety-four in the city of Portland, Oregon, which is forty-five feet westward from the northeast corner of said block, and running thence southward parallel with Sixth Street ninety-five feet; thence westerly parallel with Jackson Street fifty-five feet; thence north parallel with Sixth Street ninety-five feet, and thence easterly fifty-five feet to the place of beginning; and on October twentieth of that year the said Nicolai and wife, for the expressed consideration of one dollar and other good and valuable considerations, executed to their daughter Rosalia McGuire, wife of the defendant W. W. McGuire, a warranty deed, subject to certain mortgages, which purported to convey the following real property: lot one in block sixteen in Couch\u2019s Addition, and the west half of lots seven and eight in block one hund.red and ninety-four in said city. At the the date of the latter conveyance the defendant Nicolai was indebted in various amounts to the several plaintiffs, who thereafter obtained judgments against him upon their respective demands, and had executions issued thereon, and delivered to the sheriff of Multnomah County, but that officer, being unable to find any property of the defendants in the writs upon which he could levy, returned them wholly unsatisfied. The plaintiffs uniting their claims in this suit allege, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendant Nicolai is insolvent and that said deeds were executed without any consideration and with a fraudulent intent to hinder, delay, and defraud his creditors, and that they were accejited by the defendants W. W. and Rosalia McGuire, with full knowledge and notice of Nicolai\u2019s insolvency and intention for the purpose of aiding him in carrying said intention into effect. The defendants deny this allegation, and for a further defense allege that the lots conveyed to Rosalia were subject to two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>mortgages securing an indebtedness of sixteen thou-, sand dollars, the payment of which they assumed, and which, together with judgment liens and street assessments against the property, and certain indebtedness due and owing from Nicolai to W. W. McGuire for money paid out, advanced to, and expended for him, and certain of his indebtedness which they assumed and agreed to pay, amounting at the time of the sale and conveyance to thirty thousand dollars, constituted and was a full and adequate consideration therefor, and that they purchased said property in good faith, and paid therefor the consideration aforesaid, without any intention to hinder, delay, or defraud any of the creditors of Nicolai. The court, before the cause was submitted, granted leave to amend the answer by adding an allegation to the effect that the deed from Nicolai to Rosalia McGuire was executed in pursuance of an agreement between herself and husband that she should hold the title to the premises in trust for him. A reply having put in issue the allegations of new matter contained in the 'answer, a trial was had before the court resulting in a decree confirming the defendants\u2019 title to the property and dismissing the suit, from which decree the plaintiffs appeal.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b44-3\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-4\">For appellants there was a brief by <em>Messrs.

W. McGuire, alone, purchased the real property conveyed by the two deeds, and assumed the judgment and mortgage liens thereon, as part of the consideration, is in direct conflict with the averments in the answer of himself and Rosalia McGuire of a joint purchase and assumption by them, and therefore irrelevant: <em>Schooner Hoppet, </em>7 Cranch, 394, 395; <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Chiles, </em>10 Pet. 211; <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>14 Or. 355, 356.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-6\">The acceptance of the deed of October twentieth, eighteen hundred and ninety, by Rosalia McGuire, the grantee, containing the recital in the covenant, \u201cexcept said mortgages which the said grantee hereby assumes and agrees to pay,\u201d established a contract between her grantors and herself, and bound her individually to discharge said incumbrances, or answer for any deficiency: <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Beers, </em>24 N.

W. McGuire, to pay which Nicolai and his wife executed their deed of that date. While there is a controversy about the amount due McGuire at that time, we think the evidence fully shows that it was the sum stated above, and that no actual fraud was intended by either party to the deed, and hence the only question to be considered is whether the grantee paid a full consideration for the premises. The value of the property conveyed is estimated by two witnesses at four thousand dollars, and by three others at four thousand two hundred dollars, four thousand three hundred dollars, and five thousand dollars, respectively. The eight thousand five hundred dollars mentioned in the deed appears to have been adopted by the parties as the amount to be inserted as the consideration therefor before the interest had been computed upon the sum due McGuire, without any intention of defrauding Nicolai\u2019s creditors. The right of a debtor to prefer a particular creditor is not prohibited by statute, but where such creditor is a relative or member of the debtor\u2019s family the court will examine the evidence relating to the transfer of the debtor\u2019s property in satisfaction of the preferred creditor\u2019s claim with greater care: <em>Jolly </em>v. Kyle, 27 Or. 95 (39 Pac. 999). Tested by this rule, we conclude the defendant W. W. McGuire has paid an adequate consideration and clearly established his title to the premises conveyed to him. The evidence also shows that the lots conveyed to Rosalia McGuire were subject to the following liens: Mortgages and interest, sixteen thousand two hundred and thirty dollars; street assessment, one hundred and ninety-one dollars; judgments, three thousand one hundred and fifty-two dollars; and that in consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>four thousand two hundred and sixty-one dollars and seventy-five cents due from Nicolai to McGuire, and the latter\u2019s agreement to assume and pay off said liens, Nicolai and wife, on October twentieth, eighteen hundred and ninety, conveyed the premises to Rosalia in trust for her husband. The plaintiffs dispute an item of two thousand one hundred dollars claimed to have been loaned by McGuire to Nicolai, but McGuire shows from whom he obtained it, and his bookkeeper testifies that he drew a note for this amount which Nicolai signed, and that he saw McGuire pay Nicolai quite a sum of money. We think it clearly appears from the evidence that between April first, and October twentieth, eighteen hundred and ninety, McGuire, loaned to and assumed the payment of debts for Nicolai amounting to four thousand two hundred and sixty-one dollars and seventy-five cents. The deed to Rosalia was immediately recorded, and the parties took possession of the premises under it, and, while there are some circumstances connected with the transfer that would seem to indicate fraud, we are convinced from the evidence that no actual fraud ivas intended, and that the conveyance was made in good faith, and with no intention upon the part of McGuire or his wife to defraud the creditors of Nicolai. The value of the lots conveyed to Rosalia McGuire is estimated at from eighteen thousand five hundred dollars to thirty-six thousand dollars, in which latter sum two witnesses agree, while six others place the value below twenty-three thousand eight hundred and thirty-four dollars, the amount paid and assumed by McGuire. From this evidence we think an adequate consideration was paid, and hence the decree must be affirmed and it is so ordered. Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
