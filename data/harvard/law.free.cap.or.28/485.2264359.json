Hendrix to quiet the title to lots three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten in block twenty-five; lots six, seven, eight, nine, and ten in block twenty-six; blocks thirty-five, thirty-six, and four blocks known as the Courthouse Square, in the town of Cornelius, Oregon. The facts are that on June seventh, eighteen hundred and sixty, the defendant was the owner in fee simple of the following described premises, to wit: \u201cBeginning at a point thirteen and twelve hundredths chains east of the northwest corner of B. Q. Tucker\u2019s land claim, in Washington County, Oregon; running thence south forty-five and seventy-five hundredths chains to the base line; thence east thirty chains; thence north forty-five and seventy-five hundredths chains; thence west thirty and sixty \u25a0 hundredths chains to the place of beginning, containing one hundred and forty acres.\u201d On the third day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty, the County Court of Washington County, Oregon, rendered judgment in favor of one W. T. Newby against the said defendant, upon his confession, in words and figures as follows, to wit: \u201cIn the County Court of the State of Oregon for Yfashington County. W. T. Newby <em>versus </em>H. H. Hendrix \u2014 Confession of Judgment. I, H. H. Hendrix, the defendant above named, hereby confess myself indebted to W. T.

Subscribed and sworn to before me this seventh day of June, eighteen hundred and sixty. W. D. liare, Clerk of the County Court.\u201d On October twenty-third, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, by consideration of the circuit court of said county, one S. M. Gilmore obtained a judgment against said H. H. Hendrix for eight hundred and ninety dollars and fifty-three cents, in his absence, the service of the summons having been made by publication. On March eighteenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, an execution was issued upon the Newby judgment, which recited that: \u201cWhereas on the seventh day of June, eighteen hundred and sixty, by consideration of a confession of judgment in the Circuit Court of the County of Washington in the State of Oregon, W. T. Newby, plaintiff, recovered judgment against H. H. Hendrix, defendant, lor the sum of three hundred and sixteen dollars damages and costs, which judgment was enrolled and docketed in the clerk\u2019s office of said court on the seventh day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty,\u201d and commanded the sheriff of said county to satisfy the same out of the personal property of the defendant, or, if sufficient could not be found, then out of the real property belonging to him in that county. On the same day an execution was also issued on the Gilmore judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-3\">The sheriff levied on the real property above described, and other lands of the defendant, under both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>writs, and made the following return on the first execution: \u201cServed the within execution by levying upon the following described real estate (for the want of personal property) to wit: Lying and being in the County of Washington, Oregon, and described as follows\u201d (here follows the description of the one hundred and forty-acre tract as above given, and also the description of another tract known as the H.

Hendrix Donation Land Claim). \u201cAnd after duly advertising the same as required by law, as the annexed notice will show, for sale to the highest bidder, for cash, on the premises, on Tuesday, the twenty-second day of April, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, on which day I proceeded to offer said premises as follows, to wit: The first described piece, and sold the same to Mrs. Adelia Snelling for the sum of three hundred dollars, she being the highest bidder therefor. I then proceeded to offer the second described piece, and sold the same to Mrs. Adelia Snelling for the sum of one hundred dollars, she being the highest bidder therefor, \u2014 being the sum of four hundred dollars for the whole of said lands; the interest sold being the entire interest of said H. H. Hendrix in and to the same. And I disposed of said proceeds of said sale as follows: Paid to W. T. Newby the sum of two hundred and eighty-three dollars and seventy-five cents (\u00a7283.75), being the principal and interest of this execution; paid W. D. Hare, clerk, four dollars and seventy-one cents, clerk\u2019s fees; paid sheriff\u2019s fees, original costs, seventeen dollars and ten cents;- county fee, three dollars; paid accruing costs, thirty dollars and fifty-five cents; leaving in my hands the sum of sixty-three dollars and eighty-five cents to apply on an execution in my hands, issued out of the circuit court in favor of W.

(Signed) R. E. Wiley, Sheriff of Washington County.\u201d On October twelfth, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, the sheriff executed to the said purchaser, Adelia Snelling, a deed, wherein he recited that the premises therein described had been levied on and sold to her in pursuance of an execution issued out of the circuit court in the case of <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Hendrix, </em>and by virtue of an execution issued out of the county court in the case' <em>Newby </em>v. <em>-Hendrix. </em>The following indorsement appears on said deed: \u201cState of Oregon, County of Washington, <em>ss. </em>No irregularity in the proceedings concerning the sale within recited appearing, this deed is approved in open court this thirteenth day of October, A.

Shattuck, Judge of the Circuit Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-3\">Adelia Snelling having died intestate, one Whee-lock Simmons was appointed administrator of her estate, who, on July fifteenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, in pursuance of an administrator\u2019s sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the decedant\u2019s real property, executed to one Stephen Sell a deed to the premises so purchased from the sheriff. On April seventeenth, eighteen hundred and seventy-one, Sell and wife by deed conveyed the same premises to one William L. Halsey, who established and platted the townsite of Cornelius thereon, and, having dedicated the streets to the public, on September twenty-second of that year filed a plat thereof for record. On December fifth, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, Halsey and wife by deed conveyed the lots and blocks first above described, together with other lots and blocks in the town of Cornelius, to the plaintiff, who immediately removed the fences which inclosed the premises so platted into lots and blocks. In December, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, the defendant commenced to inclose the land in controversy, and, refusing to desist when so ordered, this suit was instituted. The plaintiff alleges in its complaint that it is the owner in fee and in the possession of the premises, and that it had been in the continued adverse possession thereof for a period of more than ten years prior to the commencement of the suit, and prays that the defendant be required to set forth any title that he may claim therein; that he be decreed to have no title to said premises, and that plaintiff has a valid title thereto. The defendant, after denying the material allegations of the complaint, alleges that he is the owner and in possession of the premises, and sets out the source and muniments of his title; that the plaintiff is asserting some title thereto, but that its conveyances and claim based thereon constitute a cloud on his title which he prays may be removed. The reply having put in issue the allegations of new matter contained in the answer, the case was referred to C. E. Runyon, who took and reported the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>from -which the court below found that the equities were with the defendant, and, having rendered a decree as prayed for in the answer, the plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b499-3\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-4\">For appellant there was a brief and an oral argument by <em>Mr. Albert E- Tamer.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-5\">For respondent there were briefs and oral arguments by <em>Messrs.

Conceding without deciding that the county court had such authority, we will examine the foundation of plaintiff\u2019s alleged title, namely, the judgment, execution, sale, and deed: <em>McRae </em>v. <em>Daviner, </em>8 Or. 63; <em>Faull </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>19 Or. 455 (20 Am. St. Rep. 836, 26 Pac. 662); <em>Cloud </em>v. <em>El Dorado County, </em>12 Cal. 128 (73 Am. Dec. 526); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Lockwood, 21 </em>Cal. 220; <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Light, </em>38 Cal. 649 (99 Am. Dec. 441). The sheriff\u2019s return shows that the real property was sold upon an execution issued out of the circuit court on a judgment by confession rendered in the county court. Every court has the inherent right to control its own process, and, unless authorized by law, no other court can interfere with such right: <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>80 Ill. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>54. There being no statutory provision authorizing the clerk of the circuit court to issue an execution out of that court upon a judgment rendered in the county court, the writ so issued must be regarded as an absolute nullity:' 1 Freeman on Executions, \u00a7 15; <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Colcord, </em>1 Okl. 260 (32 Pac. 330).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> The defendant insists that, the Gilmore judgment having been rendered in the circuit court on a service of summons by publication, no jurisdiction of the person was obtained, and, the record introduced in evidence failing to show that the land had been attached so as to render a judgment given in the action <em>quasi in rem, </em>no jurisdiction of the subject matter was acquired, and hence the judgment is void; while the plaintiff contends that the court rendering the judgment being one of general jurisdiction, and the record being silent, it must be presumed from the judgment that the court complied with every statutory requirement, and thereby obtained jurisdiction. The sheriff\u2019s return indorsed on the execution issued on this judgment discloses that the property was levied upon by virtue thereof, and advertised for sale; but it does not show that any sale was made in obedience to its commands. \u201cWhile,\u201d says Baldwin, J., in <em>Cloud </em>v. <em>El Dorado </em>County, 12 Cal. 128, (73 Am. Dec. 526,) \u201cit is undoubtedly the duty of the sheriff to make this return, and while it is important as evidence of a permanent and authentic character that he should do so, the title of the purchaser does not depend upon his performance of this duty. The purchaser has no control over the conduct of the officer in this respect; nor is it just or reasonable that he should be responsible for the remissness or negligence of the sheriff in the discharge of such an office.\u201d This doctrine was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>affirmed in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Lockwood, 21 </em>Cal. 220; <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Light, </em>38 Cal. 649, (99 Am. Dec. 441,) and lastly in <em>Frink </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>70 Cal. 296 (11 Pac. 820), If the necessary preceding steps have all been properly taken, a sheriff\u2019s deed is evidence of title in the grantee, and the recitals therein are <em>prima fade </em>evidence of the facts recited: <em>Dolph </em>v. <em>Barney, </em>5 Or. 191. \u201cA sale,\u201d says Mr. Freeman in his work on Executions, volume 2, \u00a7 325, \u201cmay be made under several writs. Some of these writs may be valid, and the others void. If either of the writs under which a sale is made is valid, the officer has the power to sell, and consequently the power to convey. If in his deed- he recites several writs, some of which are valid and some void, the recital of the void writs may be treated as surplusage, and the deed, being supported by the valid writ, and the power to sell and convey thereby conferred, is as effective as if all the writs were unobjectionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> The sheriff\u2019s deed being <em>prima fade </em>evidence of title in plaintiff\u2019s grantors, the question is presented whether the judgment rendered in the case of <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Hendrix, </em>upon whieh the deed must rest for its foundation, is valid, or at least not vulnerable to collateral attack. The judgment in this case is as follows: \u201cS. M. Gilmore <em>\u2022versus </em>H. H. Hendrix. And now on this day comes the plaintiff, by M. McBride, his attorney, and the said plaintiff files affidavit of publication of notice of the pendency of this suit, to wit (here insert), in accordance with the order of this court made at the May term thereof, eighteen hundred and sixty-one; and said defendant, being called, comes not, but makes default. It is therefore ordered by the court that the default of the defendant be entered. And it appearing to the court that this suit is founded upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>a promissory note for the payment of money only, and that there is now due and owing from the said defendant thereon to the said plaintiff the sum of eight hundred and ninety dollars and fifty-three cents; it is therefore considered and adjudged by the court that the plaintiff have and recover off and from said defendant the sum of eight hundred and ninety dollars and fifty-three cents, together with his costs to be taxed, and that he have execution therefor.\u201d It appears from this record that the defendant was a nonresident of the state, and, not appearing or answering, the court acquired no jurisdiction to render a judgment <em>in personam </em>on the service of a summons by publication; and hence the authority to render the judgment, so as to become <em>quasi in rein, </em>must depend on the court\u2019s having obtained jurisdiction of the defendant\u2019s property by some legal process, before any order could be made authorizing the service of a summons by publication: <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>95 U. S. 714; <em>Goodale </em>v. <em>Coffee, </em>24 Or. 346 (33 Pac. 990). The statute in force at the time of the rendition of the judgment contained ample provisions for and prescribed the mode of attaching the defendant\u2019s property to satisfy any judgment which might be rendered against it: Statute 1855, \u00a7 119, <em>et seq. </em>It will be observed that the judgment contains no recital of the defendant\u2019s property being attached, and no other evidence thereof having been introduced, can it be presumed that the court obtained jurisdiction of the subject matter? \u201cThe jurisdiction,\u201d says Mr. Freeman in his work on Judgments, volume 1, \u00a7 123, \u201cexercised by courts of record is, in many cases, dependent upon special statutes conferring an authority in derogation of the common law, and specifying the manner in which such authority shall be employed. The decided preponderance of adjudged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>cases upon the subject establishes the rule that judgments arising from the exercise of this jurisdiction are to be regarded in no other light, and supported by no other presumptions, than judgments pronounced in courts not of record. The particular state of facts necessary to confer jurisdiction will not be presumed; and if such facts do not appear, the judgment will be treated as void.\u201d It is needless to cite further authority in support of this proposition, for the rule has been already settled in this court that whenever a mode of acquiring jurisdiction, not in accordance with the general course of the common law, has been prescribed by statutes, that mode must be strictly followed, and the authority for rendering the judgment in pursuance thereof must affirmatively appear on the face of the record: <em>Northcut </em>v. <em>Lemery, </em>8 Or. 316; <em>Odell </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>9 Or. 298. Prom the failure to prove that the defendant\u2019s property had been attached it follows that jurisdiction of the subject matter was not acquired, and the judgment rendered in the case of <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Hendrix </em>is consequently void.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><bracketnum>4.</bracketnum> The deed recites that the premises were sold on execution issued from the county court, and this, under the authority heretofore cited, is <em>prima faeie </em>evidence of the fact, but such recital could not prevail here, in the face of a copy of the execution in evidence from which it appears that the writ purports to have been issued from the circuit court. Nor could the court\u2019s approval of the sheriff's deed cure the infirmities of the judgment, for a confirmation of an execution sale of real property is a determination of the regularity of the proceedings under the writ only, and supplies all defects except those founded in a want of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>jurisdiction: Rorer on Judicial Sales, \u00a7 123; <em>Leinenweber </em>v. Brown, 24 Or. 548 (34 Pac. 475).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><bracketnum>5.</bracketnum> It is contended that the plaintiff and its predecessors in interest had been in the adverse possession of the premises in controversy, under a claim of ownership, for a period of more than ten years immediately preceding the commencement of this suit, and that, the statute of limitations having run in its favor, the defendant\u2019s right of entry was barred. The evidence shows that the one hundred and forty acre tract was inclosed' at the time the sheriff\u2019s deed was executed, October twelfth, eighteen hundred and sixtyihree, and that a portion of the land was cultivated from that time until the plaintiff received its deed, December fifth, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, and removed the fence from that part of the tract embraced in the townsite of Cornelius; that from eighteen hundred, and seventy-two to the commencement of this suit the premises in controversy remained open and uninclosed, during which time there was no visible evidence of any claim of ownership on the part of any one; but that the plaintiff appointed persons living at Cornelius to act as its agent, paid the taxes annually assessed on the property most of the time, and sold and conveyed other lots to persons who in some instances erected buildings thereon. From this evidence it is clear that no adverse title had been acquired by plaintiff\u2019s predecessors at the time it received its deed. \u201cThe legal title,\u201d says Thayer, J., in <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Mulkey, </em>14 Or. 64 (12 Pac. 76), \u201cdraws after it the possession, and a right of entry is not barred, unless there has been a disseisin followed by an actual, open, notorious, and continuous adverse possession for the period of ten years next prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>commencement of the action. To be an adverse possession it must be an occupancy under a claim of ownership, though it need not be under color of title.\u201d Adverse possession depends upon the intent of the occupant to claim and hold real property in opposition to all the world, and this intent is to be inferred from proof of the occupancy: <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>23 Or. 515 (32 Pac. 402). It must be admitted that the plaintiff claimed title to the <em>loeus in quo; </em>but, never having occupied any portion of the premises, its claim of ownership, in the absence of occupancy, can never become the foundation of an adverse right. In <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>La Grande Water Company, </em>20 Or. 34 (10 L. R. A. 484, 25 Pac. 373), Lord, J., in commenting upon the character of such occupancy, says: \u201cTo effect that result, the possession taken must be open, hostile, and continuous; \u2018he must unfurl his flag on the land, and keep ft flying, so that the owner may see, if he will, that an enemy has invaded his domains, and planted the standard of conquest.\u201d\u2019 Tested by this rule there is nothing to show that the plaintiff ever did anything on the land to notify the defendant that it had invaded the premises in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><bracketnum>6.</bracketnum> True, the deed of Halsey and wife described the property as lots and blocks in the town of Cornelius, but adverse possession of it cannot be predicated upon the occupancy of some lot therein by a grantee of the plaintiff. When the premises consist of several known lots or tracts, and are conveyed by the same instrument, each is distinct, and an entry and occupancy of one under color of title is not constructively an occupancy of all: <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>McEwan, 7 </em>Or. 87; <em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>McClear, </em>18 Or. 126 (22 Pac. 1057); <em>Stewart </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>v. <em>Harris, </em>9 Humph. 714; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Carleton, </em>12 N. H. 9 (37 Am. Dec. 190); <em>Denham </em>v. <em>Holeman, </em>26 Ga. 182 (71 Am. Dec. 198); <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>1 Div. and Bat. L. 546 (30 Am. Dec. 143). Plaintiff not having acquired any title by its deed, and there being no evidence of its occupancy of the premises, it follows that the decree must be affirmed.
