(Selective). The trial court found there was no coverage under plaintiffs\u2019 homeowner\u2019s insurance policy for the mold contamination and other damages to their home allegedly caused by water from a torrential rainstorm. Their all-risks homeowner\u2019s policy with defendant covered physical loss to property. Defendant, however, disclaimed liability under clauses excluding \u201closs caused by ... mold\u201d and damage resulting from \u201cfaulty ... design ... workmanship ... [and] maintenance.\u201d We find a question of fact regarding causation, and ultimately coverage, and therefore, reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">We view the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was entered. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146, 156 (1995). Plaintiffs, Joseph and Susan Simonetti, are the owners and residents of a home insured by Selective continually since 1998, having purchased the newly constructed residence on March 27,1995. Within a year or two of moving into the house, plaintiffs noticed leaks in one of the windows in the first floor den and notified the builder Hovnanian who then caulked the window. Thereafter, plaintiffs intermittently discovered further leaking from the same window, usually after substantial rainfalls, and as late as March, 2001, but when the problem was reported, Hovnanian told plaintiffs it was their responsibility to caulk the windows because this was just normal wear and tear.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">On June 16, 2001, there was a severe rainstorm, and a very substantial water leak caused damage throughout plaintiffs\u2019 home, including the den, the room where the previous leaks had taken place, the upstairs bedroom, and the back of the house where wind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>had blown off siding. Plaintiffs reported the damage to Selective on June 19, 2001, and defendant\u2019s representative visited the home a few days later to examine the damage. At that time, however, plaintiffs did not inform the representative of any prior damage attributable to leaking water.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Plaintiffs discovered mold growth in their home on August 28, 2001, about two months after the June rainstorm, and immediately notified Selective. Defendant responded on August 30, 2001, by sending plaintiffs a reservation of rights that cited certain provisions from Selective\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy excluding coverage for mold. Plaintiffs\u2019 file was then sent to defendant\u2019s environmental claims unit where it was initially determined that the homeowner\u2019s policy covered mold and its remediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">In late September, 2001, plaintiffs\u2019 claim was transferred to another Selective representative, Louis Crisci, a property specialist with expertise in mold, who visited the house in October. According to a letter sent by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to Mr. Crisci, while at the house, Mr. Crisci informed the plaintiffs that they would be covered for a period of up to six months up to $2,400.00 per month in rental expenses and an additional $600.00 per month as a furniture allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">On October 30, 2001, Mr. Crisci obtained documents from Royal Specialty Underwriting, Inc. (Royal), Hovnanian\u2019s insurer, including a report dated September 19, 2001, by Harvey A. Kagan, Sc.D., P.E., of International Environmental Services, Inc., issued to Royal. The report indicated that the water damage to plaintiffs\u2019 house appeared to have occurred from the time in 1997 that the plaintiffs first noticed the leakage in the den. According to Kagan, water leakage was due to a combination of design defects and waterproofing workmanship defects. These defects included, among other things, numerous rooflines creating complex intersections, an insufficiently short gutter along the bedroom roof, and the failure to install a cricket or diverter upslope from the nursery wall. In fact, an October 1, 2001 report by plaintiffs\u2019 expert engineer, Al Vasys, also determined that the water intrusion was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>direct result of poor workmanship during the original construction of the house. According to Vasys, the method of stucco and flashing application resulted in gaping holes in the wall permitting water entry into the wall cavity.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The homeowner\u2019s policy in question covered \u201cdirect loss to property described in Coverage A and B only if that loss is a physical loss to property.\u201d The relevant exclusion clause stated: \u201cWe do not insure, however, for loss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">2. Caused by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">e. Any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">Wear and tear, marring, deterioration; Inherent vice, latent defect, mechanical breakdown; Smog, rust or other corrosion, mold, wet or dry rot ... [ ]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Another exemption, found in Section 1, \u201cExclusions,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">2. We do not insure for loss to property described in Coverages A and B caused by any of the following. However, any ensuring [sic] loss to property described in Coverage A and B not excluded or excepted in this policy is covered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-11\">c. Faulty, inadequate or defective:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-12\">(1) Planning, zoning, development, surveying, siting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-13\">(2) Design, specifications, workmanship, repair, construction, renovation, remodeling, grading, compaction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-14\">(3) Materials used in repair, construction, renovation or remodeling;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-15\">(4) Maintenance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-16\">of part or all of any property whether on of [sic] off the \u201cresidence premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM9\">Based on the information then available, on November 7, 2001, defendant issued a denial of coverage to the plaintiffs on the grounds that the damage to the house resulted from wear and tear, deterioration, latent defect, inherent vice, corrosion, mold, wet or dry rot, setting including resultant cracking of walls; neglect, faulty, inadequate or defective specifications, workmanship, construction, repair, materials used in repair, construction or maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-17\">Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendant alleging breach of contract, bad faith and violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -56:8-2.27.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Selee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>tive moved for summary judgment on the issue of coverage. The trial court concluded that there was no coverage and granted summary judgment in favor of defendant. In his oral opinion, the judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">But I think there\u2019s a generic proximate cause consideration that I have to make in any event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">But given the present state of the facts, I find no fault in this, but nobody posits that this storm \u2014 all experts only focused on the failure of Hovnanian to deliver a house free of defects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">The fact that this house leaked with normal storms, presumably normal storms, it just leaked more with this storm. So, I think it\u2019s \u2014 to me, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s\u2014the predominant cause is the faulty construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">If this was a situation where there was no history of leaking, I think the plaintiff has a better chance of proving that the storm, itself, was a predominant cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">But here, the only thing that the big storm did was cause more damage because prior storms, presumably, by everybody\u2019s articulation, lesser storms, still caused the problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">So that, to me, the predominant cause in this was the faulty construction. And as such, there\u2019s an exclusion for that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">We apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review when evaluating whether summary judgment was proper. <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d at 156. As does the motion judge, we first decide if there is a genuine issue of material fact, and if none, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Ibid.; see also Prudential Prop. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Boylan, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 167, 704 A.2d 597, 599-600 (App.Div.1998); <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">Plaintiffs argue that the mold and other damage is a direct physical loss to the home caused by water intrusion from the rainstorm, a covered loss. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention that \u201cmold\u201d is excluded based on the plain language of the policy, plaintiffs maintain that mold damage is covered in contrast to damage caused by mold. In other words, the mold itself is a covered loss, for which plaintiffs claim recovery for repair and remediation, rather than a <em>cause </em>of loss otherwise exempted from coverage. Both as to the mold as well as other damages, plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>also claim that the water intrusion occasioned by the June 16, 2001 rainstorm was a \u201cdistinct occurrence\u201d and the proximate cause of their loss. Defendant counters that plaintiffs\u2019 loss resulted from one or more excluded <em>causes </em>\u2014 i.e. faulty design, workmanship and maintenance \u2014 which, even if acting jointly with a covered peril, were the predominant cause, defeating coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We start our analysis by reference to well-settled principles of insurance law. As a threshold matter, the interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law which we decide independent of the trial court\u2019s conclusions. On this score, when interpreting an insurance contract, the basic rule is to determine the intention of the parties from the language of the policy, giving effect to all parts so as to give a reasonable meaning to the terms. <em>Stone v. Royal Ins. Co., </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>246, 248, 511 A.2d 717, 718 (App.Div.1986); <em>Tooker v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>217, 222-223, 319 A.2d 743, 745-746 (App.Div.1974). When the terms of the contract are clear and unambiguous, the court must enforce the contract as it is written; the court cannot make a better contract for parties than the one that they themselves agreed to. <em>Stone, supra, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 248, 511 A.2d at 718; <em>Flynn v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>146 <em>N.J.Super. </em>484, 488, 370 A.2d 61, 63-64 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>5, 379 A.2d 236 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">However, where an ambiguity exists, it must be resolved against the insurer. <em>DiOrio v. New Jersey Manufacturers Ins. Company, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>257, 269, 398 A.2d 1274, 1280 (1979). If the controlling language of the policy will support two meanings, one favorable to the insurer and one favorable to the insured, the interpretation supporting coverage will be applied. <em>Corcoran v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 243, 333 A.2d 293, 298 (App.Div.1975). Yet, an insurance policy is not ambiguous merely because two conflicting interpretations have been offered by the litigants. <em>Rosario v. Haywood, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>521, 530-531, 799 A.2d 32, 38, 39 (App.Div.2002), <em>citing Powell v. Alemaz, Inc., </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>33, 44, 760 A.2d 1141, 1147 (App.Div.2000). A genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ambiguity exists when the \u201cphrasing of the policy is so confusing that the average policyholder cannot make out the boundaries of coverage.\u201d <em>Lee v. General Accident Ins. Co., </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 513, 767 A.2d 985, 987 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Even if a particular phrase or term is capable of being interpreted in the manner sought by the insurer, \u201cwhere another interpretation favorable to the insured reasonably can be made that construction must be applied.\u201d <em>Ellmex Const. Co., Inc. v. Republic Ins. Co., </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>195, 204, 494 A.2d 339, 344 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>453, 511 A.2d 639 (1986). In this regard, coverage clauses should be interpreted liberally, whereas those of exclusion should be strictly construed. <em>Butler v. Bonner &amp; Bamewall, Inc., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>567, 576, 267 A.2d 527, 532 (1970); <em>Ellmex Constr. Co., Inc., supra, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 205, 494 A.2d at 344. Finally, insurance contracts are to be construed in a manner that recognizes the reasonable expectation of the insured. <em>Zuckerrnan v. Nat. Union Fire Ins., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>304, 320-21, 495 A.2d 395, 404 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Governed by these principles, we conclude that mold damage caused by a covered event is covered under the Selective policy. On the other hand, losses caused by mold may be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Mold can be both a loss and a cause of loss. <em>Liristis v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., </em>204 <em>Ariz. </em>140, 61 P.3d 22, 25 (Ct.App.2002). <em>Cf. Phillips Home Builders, Inc. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>700 A.2d 127, 129-30 (Del.1997). This distinction between mold damage and loss caused by mold is supported by the very language of Selective\u2019s policy: \u201c[w]e do not insure, however, for loss <em>caused by ... </em>mold ...\u201d (emphasis added). This language does not exclude all mold. Rather, it excludes loss \u201ccaused by\u201d or resulting from mold. The language clearly focuses on \u201ccause\u201d of the loss, conveying the intention to exclude mold as a cause of loss. But mold which is the loss is not mentioned. If Selective had intended to exclude not only losses caused by mold, but also mold itself, it could have easily expressed that intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>As noted, where the insured\u2019s loss can be viewed in two ways, basic principles of insurance law, instructing us to interpret coverage provisions broadly and to construe exclusions and limitations narrowly, require that we view this loss in the manner that brings it within the policy\u2019s coverage. <em>See, e.g., Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hurley, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>260, 272-74, 765 A.2d 195, 201-02 (2001); <em>Gibson v. Callaghan, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>662, 669-71, 730 A.2d 1278, 1282-83 (1999). And to the extent the policy terms at issue here are ambiguous, long-accepted principles of interpretation applicable to insurance contracts require us to construe this policy language against the drafter, in favor of the insured, and in accordance with the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations. <em>See, e.g., Gibson v. Callaghan, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 669-71, 730 A.2d at 1282-83; <em>Salem Group v. Oliver, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>1, 4, 607 A.2d 138,139 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We, therefore, conclude that if plaintiffs prove the mold resulted from a covered peril, then the cost of removing the mold is not a loss separate from, or caused by, the mold itself, but rather is within the coverage provided to the homeowners under defendant\u2019s policy. In other words, when a covered event causes mold, the mold damage includes the cost of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Consequently, the next issue we address is whether the mold and other damage claimed by plaintiffs was caused by a covered peril or a covered cause of loss. In this regard, plaintiffs claim the damage to their home was a direct physical loss from the June 16, 2001 rainstorm and consequent water intrusion. Defendants counter that the damage resulted from one or more excluded causes, or was actually previous damage from prior water leaks. Because a question of fact is presented as to whether some or all of the damage, including mold, was caused by the rainstorm, summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">By the terms of Selective\u2019s policy, every risk of direct physical damage is a covered cause of loss unless a particular cause of loss is listed in the exclusions. Here, defendant points to the policy exclusion for faulty design, workmanship and maintenance, which it claims to be the primary cause of plaintiffs\u2019 loss, barring their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>recovery even if included causes contributed to their damage. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The fact that two or more identifiable causes \u2014 one a covered event and one excluded \u2014 may contribute to a single property loss does not necessarily bar coverage. In the first place, the Selective policy does not contain an anti-concurrent or anti-sequential clause in Exclusion 2a dealing with faulty design, workmanship and maintenance, which would exclude coverage when a prescribed excluded peril, alongside a covered peril, either simultaneously or sequentially, causes damage to the insured. <em>See Assurance Co. of America, Inc. v. Jay-Mar, Inc., </em>38 F.Supp.2d 349, 352-354 (D.N.J.1999). Significantly, however, Selective did include such an anti-sequential and anti-concurrent clause in Exclusion 1 for Earth Movement, etc., evidencing a clear intention to bar coverage in the latter, but not the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Moreover, even where included and excluded causes occur <em>concurrently, </em>it is for the factfinder to determine which part of the damage was due to the included cause of loss and for which the insured can recover. <em>Brindley v. Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co. of Newark, N.J., </em>35 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 6, 113 A.2d 53, 56 (App.Div.1955); <em>see also Newman v. Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>86 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 403, 207 A.2d 167 (App.Div.1965) (following <em>Brindley). </em>And with regard to sequential causes of loss, our courts have determined that an insured deserves coverage where the included cause of loss is either the first or last step in the chain of causation which leads to the loss. <em>See Franklin Packaging Co. v. Cal. Union Ins. Co., </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>188, 191, 408 A.2d 448 (App.Div.1979), <em>certif. denied, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>434, 420 A.2d 340 (1980) (quoting 5 <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 3083 at 309-311 (1970) for the proposition that \u201crecovery may be allowed where the insured risk was the last step in the chain of causation set in motion by an uninsured peril, or [w]here the insured risk itself set into operation a chain of causation in which the last step may have been an excepted risk.\u201d); <em>Stone v. Royal Ins. Co., supra, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 251, 511 A.2d 717 (following <em>Franklin Packaging)-, Ariston Airline Catering </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>Supply Co., Inc. v. Forbes, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 487, 511 A.2d 1278 (Law Div.1986) (following <em>Franklin Packaging).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Regardless of whether the multiple causes here may be considered \u201cconcurrent\u201d or \u201csequential,\u201d and irrespective of the applicability of the proximate cause analysis embodied in the Appleman\u2019s Rule, there remains a factual question as to the actual cause of the damage to plaintiffs\u2019 home, namely whether plaintiffs sustained a direct physical loss proximately caused by the unusual severity of the June 16, 2001 rainstorm. Clearly, issues of causation are for the jury to resolve. <em>Verdicchio v. Ricca, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>1, 24-25, 843 A.2d 1042, 1056-57 (2004); <em>Scafidi v. Seiler, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>93, 101, 574 A.2d 398, 401-02 (1990); <em>Kulas v. Pub. Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>311, 319-20, 196 A.2d 769, 773-74 (1964). Here, since the parties disagree, and the proofs conflict, the factual issue presented of causal connection \u2014 whether some or all of plaintiffs\u2019 loss was caused by the June 16, 2001 rainstorm \u2014 must be decided by the factfinder on a complete record. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of Selective and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-18\"> Plaintiffs also named Hovnanian as a defendant and sought damages for faulty design and workmanship. On behalf of their children, they also sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>damages for personal injury and emotional distress caused by toxic fungi and mold.
