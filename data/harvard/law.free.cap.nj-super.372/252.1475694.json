Abdullah was convicted of knowing and purposeful murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(l)(2) (Count One); second-degree burglary, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2 (Counts Two and Three); third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:39-4d (Counts Four and Five); and fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C: 39-5d (Counts Six and Seven).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Prior to trial, defendant\u2019s motions to suppress evidence seized from the victim\u2019s apartment, dismiss the indictment, suppress the telephone toll records from the Atlantic County Jail to the victim\u2019s residence, and suppress his statements to the police were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">On September 13, 2002, the trial judge sentenced defendant on the murder conviction to a life term with a minimum period of thirty years without parole. On the third count armed burglary conviction, defendant was sentenced to a consecutive term of ten years with a five-year period of parole ineligibility. The remaining convictions were appropriately merged. Defendant appeals and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Defendant, also known as Aeem, first met Catrina Lark in 1996 and thereafter they developed a relationship. Defendant would visit Lark during the day and return to his girlfriend Joan Robinson\u2019s apartment at night. Defendant fathered two children with Robinson and referred to her as his \u201cwife.\u201d Defendant\u2019s relationship with Lark ended sometime between December 1998 and January 1999. Lark then began dating defendant\u2019s cousin Robert Boswell. After being incarcerated on January 15, 1999, in the Atlantic County Jail for a parole violation, defendant learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>that Lark was seeing his cousin. Soon thereafter, Boswell was incarcerated in the same jail. On March 21, 1999, Corrections Officer Frank Timik observed an argument between defendant and Boswell while they were being visited by their respective girlfriends. Timik heard defendant call Lark a \u201cbitch\u201d and a \u201cwhore.\u201d Defendant and Boswell were thereafter placed on the no contact list.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">According to Lark\u2019s mother, Shelby, Lark refused to accept daily collect calls from defendant after their relationship ended. Phone records from Atlantic County Jail indicate that defendant made 467 calls to Lark from the County Jail. (Defendant admitted making numerous calls to Lark, including 192 calls in a single day.) Shelby testified that one day in March, while she was visiting Lark, she accepted a call from defendant and used the occasion to tell him to stop calling her daughter because Lark did not want to be bothered by him anymore. Shelby stated that defendant responded: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have the bitch, nobody can have her. I\u2019ll kill her first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Defendant claimed that he made the calls after he learned Lark was pregnant with his child and she threatened to abort the pregnancy if he did not leave his wife. Defendant told Lark that he would not leave his wife but that he would be a father to his child. He denied ever threatening Lark. Defendant was released from the county jail in April 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">On May 1, 1999, at approximately 3:30 a.m., Lark phoned Jessica Ruiz, her friend and neighbor who lived in an apartment across the street from her. At the time Ruiz was awake watching television with her then boyfriend, Lark\u2019s cousin, Ronald Taylor. Ruiz related that Lark called her and told her that defendant was outside \u201cknocking on her window trying to get in her house.\u201d Before hanging up the telephone, however, Lark told Ruiz that defendant had left the area and that she would be all right.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Stella Hargrove lived on the second floor in the same apartment building as Lark. She testified that she was awakened in the early morning hours by a female voice in Lark\u2019s apartment saying, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u201cAleem don\u2019t hit me.\u201d Ronald Taylor woke up and left Ruiz\u2019s apartment between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. He went across the street to visit Lark. When Taylor arrived at Lark\u2019s apartment, he found the door unlocked and Lark lying on the kitchen floor. The apartment was in complete disarray and Lark was lying in a pool of blood. Taylor ran back to Ruiz\u2019s house and told her to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Officer Ed Leon of the Atlantic County Police Department was dispatched to Lark\u2019s apartment. Leon found Lark lying on her kitchen floor, nude from the waist down, with a pool of blood around her head. She had no pulse, her skin was cold, and she was becoming rigid.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Police officers seized various items from Lark\u2019s apartment believed to be associated with the attack that were either near the body or in Lark\u2019s bedroom. The items included: a blood stained rolling pin, a broken clothes iron, a broken ceramic lamp, a broken cast iron frying pan, three blood-stained serrated steak knives with bent blades, three blood-stained kitchen knives with broken blades, and three intact bloodstained kitchen knives. Only two items, both serrated steak knives, were not found in plain view\u2014 one behind a chair in the bedroom and the other on the right side of a sofa cushion which was slightly askew. According to the Atlantic County Medical Examiner, Doctor Hydow Park, Lark\u2019s death was caused by \u201cmultiple blunt and sharp force injuries to the head, neck, and upper torso areas.\u201d These included numerous stabbing and cut wounds to her head, face, neck, back, hands, and chest. Additionally, Lark had a large open skull fracture around her left eye caused by a heavy object.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Phillip Beesley, a Senior Forensic Scientist with the Department of Law and Public Safety Forensic Science Section (the Department), testified that swabbings taken from various locations in the apartment tested positive for blood and tissue and were submitted for DNA testing, along with blood samples taken from the victim and defendant. Patricia Prusak, also a Senior Forensic Scientist employed by the Department, found defendant\u2019s DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>matched one of the specimens taken from the apartment and also matched the source mixed with Lark\u2019s DNA on two other specimens taken from the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Officer Howard Mason and several other officers went to defendant\u2019s home. Mason noticed that defendant had a cut on his hand that was bleeding. Defendant claimed that he was injured when he fell from his bicycle. He also stated that he had not left his house the entire night. Defendant claimed that he had not been in Lark\u2019s apartment since the last week in December 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Robinson told police that defendant left her apartment at approximately 2:40 a.m. and made a great deal of noise when he returned between 3:00 and 3:30 a.m. Two of defendant\u2019s fingerprints were found on the handle of the frying pan found next to Lark\u2019s body. A bloodstained glove belonging to defendant and used by him to lift weights was recovered from Lark\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">At trial, Defendant admitted that he left his house at about 2:30 a.m. to purchase some marijuana. Victor Winters, a witness called by defendant, acknowledged selling marijuana to defendant and smoking it with him for about half an hour. Defendant denied referring to Lark as a \u201cbitch\u201d and a \u201cwhore\u201d during the alleged incident at the county jail. Defendant also denied threatening Lark in a conversation with Lark\u2019s mother. He also claimed that approximately a week after he was released from jail and a week to ten days before the murder he saw Lark at a party at his cousin\u2019s house. According to defendant, there was no confrontation or ruckus between them. They had a brief conversation concerning whether she aborted her child. He claimed that they really did not interact and \u201cwould just pass each other by without too much conversation at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">On appeal, defendant raises the following points</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO THE JURY CREATED A RATIONAL BASIS FOR A VERDICT CONVICTING DEFENDANT OF THE LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE OF PASSION/PROVOCATION MANSLAUGHTER.

In support of his request, defendant asserted that the evidence presented respecting the numerous telephone calls made by him was consistent with anger, jealousy, and obsession, which bespoke passion/provocation. Denying defendant\u2019s request the judge found \u201cthat there was some proof of passion but no rational basis for adequate provocation or to conclude that defendant did not have time to cool off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">On appeal, defendant asserts that there was a rational basis to support a jury charge on passion/provocation manslaughter. He points to the State\u2019s opening and closing arguments in which the prosecutor told the jury that defendant \u201cin his rage\u201d murdered Lark and that defendant was \u201cangry\u201d and \u201cfurious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8e directs that \u201c[t]he court shall not charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis for a verdict convicting the defendant of the included offense.\u201d <em>See State v. Sinclair, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>525, 540, 231 A.2d 565 (1967). When a defendant requests a charge on a lesser offense, the trial judge must focus on the facts in evidence \u201cto ensure that there is a rational basis for a jury to reject the greater charge and convict of the lesser\u201d charge. <em>State v. Brent, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>107, 116, 644 A.2d 583 (1994). Moreover, where the evidence reasonably supports defendant\u2019s request for a jury charge on a lesser-included offense, a trial court\u2019s failure to give it is reversible error. <em>State v. Crisantos, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>265, 278, 508 A.2d 167 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The elements of passion/provocation manslaughter are: (1) adequate provocation; (2) absence of a cool-off period between the provocation and the slaying; (3) the provocation must have actually impassioned the defendant; and (4) defendant must not have cooled off before the slaying. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-4b(2). The evidence did not support such a charge. <em>See also State v. Mauricio, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>402, 411, 568 A.2d 879 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The judge correctly determined that the evidence was insufficient to establish adequate provocation at or about the time of the murder or that defendant did not have a reasonable time to cool off. Lark broke off the relationship approximately five months before she was killed. Defendant was angered while he was in jail when he learned in January that Lark was seeing Boswell and that she was pregnant. He was also concerned and tried to dissuade her from terminating her pregnancy. Clearly, there was a sufficient cool-down period between the incidents that occurred while defendant was incarcerated and when Lark was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The subject of her pregnancy came up again at the party held approximately one week before the murder. Although the record is somewhat unclear, defendant may have learned that Lark had terminated her pregnancy. However, there is no evidence that defendant was angered by this turn of events. According to his testimony, there was no confrontation or ruckus between them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>when they met at the party. More importantly, there is no evidence that the two had any interaction following the party. Even if one could conclude that defendant was angered by Lark\u2019s relationship with Boswell or the termination of her pregnancy at the time he saw her at the party, there was more than ample time for defendant to cool off.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">(2) Defendant argues next that there was plain error because the prosecutor in his summation ridiculed the defense, voiced his opinion that defendant was guilty, and expressly argued that defendant and his alibi witnesses were liars. Specifically, defendant asserts that the following remarks were improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">(1) |W]e know he lied and we know he lies when it\u2019s convenient. He chooses when he\u2019s going to be truthful ... when he\u2019s going to be honest, whether it\u2019s going to hurt him, whether it\u2019s going to help him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">(2) So clearly when he says he had no anger towards her, he just wanted to find out about this baby situation ... and everything was cool between them, clearly that\u2019s not the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">(3) I submit the testimony of Victor Winters is not credible. It was not believable. The first time Mr. Kramer talks to Victor Winters was Monday, last Monday. Victor Winters adds information as he goes along ... I could just see how he\u2019s lying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">(4) When you look at it in conjunction with all the other evidence we know he [defendant] was not truthful about how he got those cuts on his hands. Clearly it was a time when he felt he needed to lie. He lied here and he lied to the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">(5) The defendant can\u2019t tell the truth about this because the truth puts him in the middle of a murder____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">We briefly describe the applicable legal principles. In reviewing alleged prosecutorial misconduct, we consider: (1) whether defense counsel objected in a timely and proper fashion to the remarks; (2) whether the offending remarks were withdrawn promptly; and (3) whether the court gave the jury curative instructions. <em>State v. Zola, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>384, 426, 548 A.2d 1022 (1988) , <em>cert. denied, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>1022, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1146, 103 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 205 (1989) ; <em>State v. Setzer, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>553, 566, 634 A.2d 127 (App.Div.1993), <em>certif. denied, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>468, 640 A.2d 850 (1994). Where, as here, the defendant\u2019s lawyer fails to object at trial, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>may legitimately infer that counsel did not consider the remarks inappropriate or prejudicial. <em>State v. Vasquez, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>528, 560, 628 A.2d 346 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>480, 634 A.2d 527 (1993). When prosecutorial misconduct is being raised for the first time on appeal, we need only be concerned with whether \u201cthe remarks, if improper, substantially prejudiced the defendant's] fundamental right to have the jury fairly evaluate the merits of [his] defense, and thus had a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>489, 510, 158 A.2d 11 (1960). Even where a prosecutor has been guilty of misconduct, reversal of a defendant\u2019s conviction is not necessary unless the conduct was so egregious that it deprived the accused of a fair trial. <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 322, 524 A.2d 188 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>947, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2433, 124 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>653 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">A prosecutor may make comments on the evidence and the inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the proofs. <em>State v. Timmendequas, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>515, 587, 737 A.2d 55 (1999); <em>State v. Frost, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 82, 727 A.2d 1 (1999); <em>State v. Harris, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>122, 194, 716 A.2d 458 (1998); <em>State v. Perry, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>45, 47-48, 319 A.2d 474 (1974). It is inappropriate, however, for a prosecutor to \u201cexpress his or her personal belief or opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimony or evidence or the guilt of the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Marshall, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>1, 154, 586 A.2d 85 (1991) (quoting ABA Standards for Criminal Justice \u00a7 3-5.8(b) (2d ed.1980)). A prosecutor may, however, suggest that witnesses lied, or suggest that witnesses are not credible. <em>State v. Morton, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>383, 457-58, 715 A.2d 228 (1998). This is especially so where there is conflicting evidence or reasonable inferences can be drawn from the evidence presented during the trial. <em>Ibid. </em>We note that, in evaluating any claim of error, we are obliged to recognize that a prosecutor may argue the State\u2019s ease in a forceful manner. <em>Setzer, supra, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 565, 634 A.2d 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The prosecutor did not offer a personal opinion of defendant\u2019s veracity, or refer, explicitly or implicitly, to matters outside of the record but instead commented, in light of the conflicting evidence, that defendant and Winters were not truthful. Moreover, the trial judge instructed the jury that the comments of counsel were not evidence and were not controlling. Credibility was hotly contested by the defense and the prosecutor\u2019s statements were made in response to the defense\u2019s position. <em>State v. Engel, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. 336, 379, 592 </em>A.2d 572 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. 393, </em>614 A.2d 616 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Arguing that the State improperly denigrated the defense, defendant points to the following statements in the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">Now during the testimony of the defendant it reminded me of a documentary that I saw recently ... And it was a documentary on the octopus. Now the octopus is an animal that has a very unusual defense mechanism and that\u2019s called an ink pack and <em>when </em>an octopus becomes afraid, when he becomes fearful because an enemy may be coming near, he releases that ink pack. The purpose of releasing that ink pack .. is to muddy the waters so you can\u2019t see clearly, so you can\u2019t see through the mud and he tries to use that muddy water to escape. And that\u2019s what we saw from the defendant when he was on the witness stand. He\u2019s got an answer for every piece of evidence in this case. He\u2019s a victim <em>of </em>circumstances from witnesses who mishear things to ... police who are planting evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">Officer Francisco must be part of this police ... conspiracy to set this defendant up, along with all the other people that we heard that must have been part of this extravagant convoluted conspiracy to set this defendant up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">If they (the police] don\u2019t remember something, they\u2019re lying. They\u2019re trying to hide things. There\u2019s a conspiracy behind every door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">Every piece of evidence that ties this defendant to the crime was because of trickery, lying, deceit, everybody wants to be on the team.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">She knew she was going to die that evening and she decided [to sayj that the defendant was outside her window just to set him up when she's in the after life. I mean how ridiculous does that have to be to believe \u2014 the defense theory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">Now if the State is so corrupt and these investigators are so corrupt, why aren\u2019t they pouring her blood onto his clothes ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">And all the police officers that ... were there must have been in on this conspiracy. That\u2019s what the defense wants you to believe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">Again, we disagree. A prosecutor is not permitted to attack, disparage, or demean adverse counsel, either directly or indirectly. <em>State v.

Nor is a prosecutor permitted to \u201ccast unjustified aspersions\u201d upon defense counsel. <em>Tabor v. O\u2019Grady, </em>59 <em>N.J.Super. </em>330, 340, 157 A.2d 701 (App.Div.1960). However, a prosecutor is permitted to respond to arguments raised by the defense so long as it does not constitute a foray beyond the evidence adduced at trial. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247, 266, 670 A.2d 1100 (App.Div.) (citing <em>State v. Wilson, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>233, 241-42, 607 A.2d 1289, (1992)), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>587, 677 A.2d 759 (1996)). Here, the prosecutor was forcefully responding to defendant\u2019s assertions. We do no believe that his remarks in response to the defense were unjustified or sufficiently egregious to deprive defendant of a fair trial. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Next, defendant contends that admission of color photographs shown on a television screen, depicting the scene of the crime and the autopsy, were gruesome, unnecessary, and denied defendant of his right to a fair trial. He argues that the explicit description by the police and the medical examiner were sufficient to inform the jury in graphic detail of the numerous wounds and injuries suffered by the victim. Defendant asserts that the judge erred in determining that the photographs had probative value and were not unduly inflammatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\u201cThe admissibility of photographs of a crime victim rests within the discretion of the trial judge and his ruling will not be overturned in the absence of a palpable abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Micheliche, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>532, 544-45, 533 A.2d 41 (App.Div.1987) (citing <em>State v. Thompson, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>396, 420, 283 A.2d 513 (1971)). Such photographs \u201cbecome inadmissible only when their probative value is so significantly outweighed by their inherently inflammatory potential as to have a probable capacity to divert the minds of the jurors from a reasonable and fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>evaluation of the basic issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231, 249-50, 540 A.2d 201 (App.Div.1988). The exclusion of photographs is not justified because they are cumulative evidence. <em>Micheliche, supra, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 545, 533 A.2d 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The State has the burden of showing a purposeful and knowing murder. Although gruesome, the photographs were \u201clegitimately a part of the State\u2019s proof of defendant\u2019s criminal state of mind.\u201d <em>Ibid. The </em>photographs of the <em>crime scene </em>showed the location of the body, the weapons, and bloodstains. There was a photograph of the broken frying pan handle with defendant\u2019s fingerprints on it in close proximity to the victim. As we pointed out in <em>Micheliche, </em>the photographs were probative to show the jury \u201cthat the attack was performed with such convulsive ferocity that it could only have been the product of a knowing purpose to cause death.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In light of what we have said regarding defendant\u2019s first three points, we need not address his Point IV argument that the cumulative effect of the error asserted in Points I, II, and III requires us to grant a new trial. Suffice it to say this contention is without merit. <em>B. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">We turn next to defendant\u2019s argument that the imposition of a consecutive ten-year term with five years of parole ineligibility on the third count burglary conviction was improper and excessive. Where circumstances are such that defendant is \u201cthe type of repetitive offender [who] is not likely to be rehabilitated,\u201d consecutive sentencing may be appropriate for protection of the public. <em>State v. Mosch, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 464, 519 A.2d 937 (App.Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">In <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 643-44, 498 A.2d 1239 (1985), our Supreme Court enumerated the following criteria to be considered in determining whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>(1) there can be no free crimes in a system for which the punishment shall fit the crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">(2) the reasons for imposing either a consecutive or concurrent sentence should be separately stated in the sentencing decision;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">(3) some reasons to be considered by the sentencing court should include facts relating to the crimes, including whether or not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">(a) the crimes and their objectives were predominantly independent of each other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">(b) the crimes involved separate acts of violence or threats of violence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">(c) the crimes were committed at different times or separate places, rather than being committed so closely in time and place as to indicate a single period of aberrant behavior;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">(d) any of the crimes involved multiple victims;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-11\">(e) the convictions for which the sentences are to be imposed are numerous;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-12\">(4) there should be no double counting of aggravating factors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-13\">(5) successive terms for the same offense should not ordinarily be equal to the punishment for the first offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-14\">(6) there should be an overall outer limit on the cumulation of consecutive sentences for multiple offenses not to exceed the sum of the longest terms (including an extended term, if eligible) that could be imposed for the two most serious offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">The Legislature displaced the sixth factor, effective August 5, 1993, providing that there \u201cshall be no overall outer limit on the cumulation of consecutive sentences for multiple sentences.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-5(a)(2). In any event, the focus should be on the fairness of the overall sentence, and the sentencing judge should set forth in detail the reasons for concluding a particular sentence is warranted. <em>State v. Miller, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>112, 122, 527 A.2d 1362 (1987). In passing upon the sentence, the judge noted, \u201cthis is the most brutal murder that I have seen in over twenty-three years on the bench.\u201d He indicated that defendant committed these crimes shortly after he \u201cmaxed out\u201d on his previous eighteen-year term on drug offenses, and pointed out that he was \u201cthe same man who laughed and smirked at the victim\u2019s family during the course of the proceedings leading up [to] and during trial.\u201d In the same vein, Shelby Lark\u2019s testimony revealed that when defendant threatened to kill Lark he stated that he was not afraid to go back to jail. The judge in his statement of reasons demonstrated that he indeed considered relevant circumstances, including the severity of the offense and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the need to impose consecutive sentences to protect society from someone who is likely to resort to criminal behavior to further his anti-social lifestyle. Under these circumstances, the imposition of consecutive sentences did not violate the <em>Yarbough </em>guidelines and was an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion. <em>See Mosch, supra, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 464-466, 519 A.2d 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Likewise, we are satisfied that the sentence imposed on the first count and third count convictions is not manifestly excessive or unduly punitive and does not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>210, 215-16, 564 A.2d 1202 (1989); <em>State v. Ghertler, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>383, 393, 555 A.2d 553 (1989); <em>State v. Both, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 363-65, 471 A.2d 370 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">In his supplemental brief, defendant contends that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized in the apartment where the victim was found. He argues that he had an interest in the apartment and, therefore, a search warrant should have been obtained. Applying the Fourth Amendment standard, the judge found that defendant had no standing to bring a motion to suppress because he had no expectation of privacy in the apartment. The judge also found that the police were properly in the apartment, given the emergent circumstances, and that the items found, except for two, were in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">In <em>State v. Alston, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>211, 224-26, 440 A.2d 1311 (1981), the Court parted company with the United States Supreme Court concept of standing, which espoused that even the assertion of ownership of the property seized under certain circumstances is not sufficient to confer Fourth Amendment standing of a legitimate expectation of privacy. <em>Alston </em>involved the search of the passenger compartment of an automobile in which two revolvers were found belonging to passengers. <em>Id. </em>at 217, 440 A.2d 1311. Concluding that \u201c[Ilegit\u00edmate expectations of privacy are those that flow from some connection with or relation to the place or property to be searched,\u201d the <em>Alston </em>Court held that Article I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>paragraph 7 of the New Jersey constitution provides greater protection because a \u201ccriminal defendant is entitled to bring a motion to suppress evidence obtained in an unlawful search and seizure if he has a proprietary, possessory, or participatory interest in either the place searched or the property seized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227-28, 440 A.2d 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The trial judge did not find defendant\u2019s testimony that he signed the lease to Lark\u2019s apartment, paid the rent, and had an ongoing relationship with her to be credible. In reaching his finding, the judge noted that defendant produced no receipt, no check, no money order, and no lease evidencing his claim that he had an interest in the apartment. The judge found that defendant did not live in Lark\u2019s apartment at the time and that his relationship with her ended in December 1998 or early January 1999, at which time Lark changed the locks to her apartment. When defendant was asked for his address he gave the address he shared with Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Where a judge\u2019s factual findings could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record it is improper for us to interfere. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964); <em>see also State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 474, 724 A.2d 234 (1999). On this record, there was sufficient credible evidence to conclude that defendant did not have a proprietary, possessory, or participatory interest in Lark\u2019s apartment. Unlike <em>Alston, </em>we are not dealing with an interest in the property seized but rather the property searched. Although the judge mistakenly relied upon the Fourth Amendment standard (expectation of privacy rather than proprietary, possessory, or participatory interest), we find no error. Discounting defendant\u2019s testimony as not credible, defendant did not establish either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Additionally, the search and seizure was not violative of the Fourth Amendment. \u201c[A] police officer lawfully in the viewing area\u201d is not expected to \u201cclose his eyes to suspicious evidence in plain view.\u201d <em>State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 237, 463 A.2d 320 (1983). Here, the police were properly at the scene of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>crime involving a reported homicide, there was probable cause to believe that all the evidence seized was associated with the criminal activity, and all but two items were in plain view. <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 <em>\u00dc.S. </em>443, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971). In <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>385, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2408, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>290 (1978), the Court discussed and held that there was no explicit murder or crime scene exception. Instead, the <em>Mincey </em>Court recognized that officers who arrive at a crime scene to assist a victim of a homicide where there is reason to suspect foul play are properly on the premises. <em>Id. </em>at 392, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2408. Moreover, the Court held that officers properly on the premises to investigate a homicide are permitted to conduct a search for other crime victims or criminals and may seize any evidence that is in plain view during the course of such legitimate emergency activities. <em>Id. </em>at 393, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2408; <em>State v. Faretra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>527, 533-534, 750 A.2d 166 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The judge found that the officers were properly on the premises pursuant to a legitimate emergency entry and the evidence seized, except for the two serrated steak knives, fit the plain view exception. The judge also noted that all the items would have inevitably been found because Lark\u2019s next of kin consented to a search of the apartment for a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">We are satisfied that the record here established that defendant did not have standing to challenge the search, that the search conducted essentially \u201cdemonstrates a permissible entry followed by a plain-view observation of incriminating evidence,\u201d and that there was a valid consent to search by a person with authority over the premises, which would have led to \u201cthe inevitable discovery of all the evidence seized.\u201d <em>Faretra, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 535, 750 A.2d 166 (citing <em>State v. Sugar, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>214, 495 A.2d 90 (1985)). Accordingly, the order to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">In Point III of his pro se brief, defendant contends that the State turned over phone records evidencing some 467 tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>phone calls for the period between February 22 and April 3, 1999. He argues that the State suppressed evidence favorable to him, specifically, the telephone records for the period between January 1 and February 22, 1999. He claims that those phone records would have corroborated his testimony that he learned that Lark was pregnant and she threatened to terminate the pregnancy if he did not leaye Robinson. Defendant\u2019s claim simply lacks merit. The record reveals that all phone records involving defendant\u2019s pin number were moved into evidence. Moreover, even if they were not, defendant would have been fully aware of the telephone calls made by him and he could have readily obtained the records or moved to have the State produce them.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Likewise without merit is defendant\u2019s contention in Point IV of his pro se brief that the introduction of numerous phone calls made by him from the Atlantic County Jail, together with the evidence that he and Boswell argued while their respective girlfriends were visiting them at the jail, amounts to evidence of prior crimes, contrary to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). There was no evidence of defendant\u2019s prior crime, merely reference to the fact that he was in jail when these relevant events occurred. Moreover, the judge provided the following appropriate limiting instruction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">And you\u2019ll recall that during the trial you heard testimony of an incident that occurred while the defendant was at the Atlantic County Justice Facility or that [he] had some form of relationship to that facility and as I told you at the beginning of the trial, and I\u2019ll remind you now, this information is not to be used to in any way show that the defendant\u2019s a bad person or that he is disposed to commit crimes. An innocent person can be in jail simply by reason of an inability to make bail on a given charge. Whatever brought the defendant to the justice facility is totally irrelevant to your deliberations in this case and you should not speculate about it____You should not consider this in your deliberations in any way. This evidence is before you solely for the limited purpose as it pertains ... to the evidence introduced to show motive or purpose for the alleged offense and it is to be used for no other purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">In Point II and Point V, defendant also contends, pro se, that he was denied due process because his trial attorney failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>to request and follow up with a request for DNA testing and was further denied ineffective assistance of counsel based upon his trial attorney\u2019s failure to investigate and call crucial defense witnesses during his suppression hearing and trial. Allegations respecting advice obtained from counsel that involve assertions and evidence beyond the trial record are best addressed on an application for post-conviction relief. <em>State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 460, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992); <em>State v. Ospina, 239 N.J.Super. </em>645, 656, 571 A.2d 1373 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>321, 604 A.2d 597 (1990). We therefore defer further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">We next address the contention raised in the supplemental briefs that defendant was denied his right to have a jury determine the imposition of consecutive maximum term sentences. Relying primarily upon the recent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S.-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>403 (2004), defendant asserts he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to have a jury determine the essential facts for imposition of a maximum statutory term, a parole bar, and consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Ralph Howard Blakely, who had been diagnosed with various psychological and personality disorders, abducted his wife Yolanda from their Washington home. He bound Yolanda with duct tape, forced her at knifepoint into a wooden box in the bed of his pickup truck, and drove her to a friend\u2019s house in Montana in an attempt to dissuade her from prosecuting the divorce action. Before he left, the couple\u2019s thirteen-year-old son Ralphy returned from school. The defendant ordered Ralphy to follow him in another car, threatening that he would harm Yolanda with a shotgun if he did not do so. <em>Id. </em>at 2534.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">Blakely eventually pled guilty to second-degree kidnapping involving domestic violence and use of a firearm. <em>Id. </em>at 2534-35. Under the plea agreement, the prosecutor recommended a standard range sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 2535. The \u201cstandard range\u201d sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>under the Washington Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) was forty-nine to fifty-three months. <em>Ibid. </em>However, the SRA also permits a judge to impose a sentence above the standard upon a finding of \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons to justify an exceptional sentence.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Wash. Rev.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9.94A.120(2) (2000)). Although the act listed aggravating factors justifying departure from the standard, Washington case law provided that \u201c[a] reason offered to justify an exceptional sentence can be considered only if it takes into account factors other than those which are used in computing the standard range sentence for the offense.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. Gore, </em>143 Wash.2d 288, 315-16, 21 P.3d 262 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The judge rejected the State\u2019s recommendation, finding that the defendant acted with \u201cdeliberate cruelty\u201d and imposed an exceptional sentence of ninety months after hearing Yolanda\u2019s description of the crime. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant objected to the sentence, which exceeded the plea agreement. <em>Ibid. </em>Following a three-day bench trial, which consisted of testimony from various witnesses, the judge adhered to his initial findings of deliberate cruelty and re-imposed the ninety-month sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 2536-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Noting in <em>Blakely </em>that \u201c[t]his ease requires us to apply the rule we expressed in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>466, 490, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2348, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>435 (2000),\u201d Justice Scalia writing for the majority stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime <em>beyond the prescribed statutory maximum </em>must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\"><em>[Blakely, supra, </em>542 U.S. at-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2536 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the defendant pled guilty to second-degree possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose for firing several shots into an African-American\u2019s home. The State moved for an extended term pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7 and 2C:44-3(e), permitting an enhanced penalty of up to twenty years, contending that the offense was committed because of racial bias. Following a hearing, the judge imposed an extended term of twelve years. The majority held that it violated due process for the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>to remove from a jury the assessment of facts, beyond a reasonable doubt, which increased a prison term from a range imposed for a second-degree crime to that imposed for a first-degree crime. In reaching its decision, however, the <em>Apprendi </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqj\">We should be clear that nothing in this history suggests that it is impermissible for judges to exercise discretion, taking into consideration various factors relating both to offense and offender, in imposing a judgment <em>within the range </em>prescribed by statute. We have often noted that judges in this country have long exercised discretion of this nature in imposing sentences <em>within statutory limits </em>in the individual case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\"><em>[Apprendi, supra, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>at 481,120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2348 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Initially, we note that here, unlike in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi, </em>the imposition of a life sentence with thirty years of parole ineligibility was \u201cwithin the statutory range,\u201d of knowing and purposeful murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b(l), as was the ten-year-term for second-degree burglary, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-6a. Unlike the Washington statutes, our statutes relevant to this appeal provide for standard ranges, rather than an enhanced term beyond the maximum, which can only be imposed upon a finding that the offense involved an additional element like \u201cdeliberate cruelty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Defendant argues that under <em>Blakely </em>the standard sentence cannot exceed the presumptive term without a jury determining the aggravating factors that justify upwards departure. In other words, defendant asserts that the maximum term that can be imposed under our statute, without jury involvement, is the presumptive sentence. In support of his contention, defendant relies on the following excerpts from the majority\u2019s opinion in <em>Blakely, </em>defining statutory maximum.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">Our precedents make clear, however, that the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict and admitted by the </em>defendant____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">In other words, the relevant \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d is <em>not the maximum </em>sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>urithout </em>any additional findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\"><em>[Blakely, supra, </em>542 U.S. at-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2537.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Addressing the types of findings that offend the Sixth Amendment, Justice Scalia pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Whether the judge\u2019s authority to impose an enhanced sentence depends on finding a specific fact (as in Apprendi), one of several specified facts (as in Ring) or any aggravating fact (as here) it remains the case that the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not authorize the sentence. The judge acquires that authority only upon finding some additional fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 2538.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">As we have previously stated, our statutory scheme provides a standard range within which aggravating factors are used to determine a term beyond the presumptive. Neither <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b(l) (providing for a term of thirty years to life for murder) nor <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6a (providing five to ten years for second-degree offenses with a presumptive term of seven years) provides for enhanced terms above the maximum within the standard range. Accordingly, we do not agree with defendant\u2019s contention that a presumptive term is the maximum sentence that can be imposed without a jury finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of certain aggravating factors. However, even if we agreed with defendant\u2019s contention, there remain other considerations that lead us to the inescapable conclusion that the circumstances here do not justify our intervention on a constitutional basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The Washington statute invalidated by <em>Blakely </em>provided for a judicial finding of deliberate cruelty, an additional offense-based element, beyond the bare elements of the offense charged. <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>specifically excepted a prior conviction as a fact that must be submitted to a jury. <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 U.S. at -, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2536. Moreover, <em>Blakely </em>suggested that the types of facts that should be subject to jury determination are those that go \u201cbeyond the bare elements of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2538 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">The factors enumerated by the judge, as well as his findings, were set forth in the Judgment of Conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">The court finds aggravating factors 1, 3, 6, and 9 and no mitigating factors apply to this sentence. This is the most brutal murder the court has seen in over twenty-three years on the bench. Defendant stabbed and bludgeoned the victim. Six knives were either bent or broken. A cast iron frying pan, an electric frying pan, a wooden rolling pin, and an electric iron and a ceramic lamp were also smashed and broken over the victim\u2019s head and body. Defendant has a prior history of domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>violence. He has previously violated parole. This is a vicious dangerous defendant. Society needs to be protected from him. Accordingly, a consecutive sentence is imposed on the non-merging burglary count. An eighteen-year prison term imposed on a prior offense did not deter defendant. He violated parole on that offense and committed this murder shortly after being released when he \u201cmaxed out.\u201d In response to defendant\u2019s allocution, he is the same man who laughed and smirked at the victim\u2019s family during trial. 1-Iis sympathy at sentencing rings hollow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The only offense-based aggravating factor found by the judge was <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2G:44-la(l):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">The nature and circumstances of the offense, and the role of the actor therein, including whether or not it was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The remaining aggravating factors, 3 (the risk that the defendant will commit another offense), 6 (the extent of the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record), and 9 (the need for deterring the defendant and others from violating the law), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:44-1(3), (6) and (9), are offender-based factors. Logically they fall within the recidivism exception outlined in both <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>as they stem from a common origin, namely the defendant\u2019s criminal record. <em>See Carson v. State, </em>813 N.E.2d 1187 (Ind.Ct.App.2004) (holding that aggravating circumstances derivative of defendant\u2019s criminal history do not implicate the <em>Blakely </em>analysis). <em>State v. Dixon, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 140, 787 A.2d 211 (App.Div.2001) (holding that persistent offender extended term is not in violation of <em>Apprendi </em>because it falls within the \u201ccriminal history\u201d exception). <em>Blakely </em>points out that increased judicial discretion in sentencing should not be \u201cat the expense of the jury\u2019s traditional function of finding the facts essential to lawful imposition of a penalty,\u201d thus implying that the relevant factors are those which embrace traditional elements of an offense, not the defendant\u2019s propensity to engage in criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">In crafting the Judgment of Conviction, the trial judge spelled out the nature and circumstances of the murder as the basis for applying the offense-based aggravating factor, namely, that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner. He did not apply aggravating factor 1 to the second-degree burglary. He found the remaining offender-based factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>applicable to both convictions. Thus, the judge\u2019s finding of aggravating factors 3, 6, and 9 used to justify the maximum second-degree ten-year term did not offend <em>Blakely, </em>as they were derived from defendant\u2019s prior criminal record and, therefore, expressly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We turn our attention to the life sentence imposed on the murder conviction and whether the finding that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner offends <em>Blakely </em>as asserted by defendant. Our analysis begins with the recognition that our statutory scheme provides that there is no presumptive term for murder. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-lf(l). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b(l) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">Murder is a crime of the first degree but a person convicted of murder shall be sentenced ... to a term of 30 years, during which the person shall not be eligible for parole, or be sentenced to a specific term of years which shall be between 30 years and life imprisonment of which the person shall serve 30 years before being eligible for parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">We pointed out in <em>State v. Manzie, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>267, 271, 762 A.2d 276 (App.Div.2000) <em>aff'd, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>113, 773 A.2d 659 (2001), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">[a]lthough murder is characterized as a crime of the first degree, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:11-3b(l), it is rarely, if ever, analyzed as a first degree crime because the murder statute establishes a discrete sentencing scheme, which deviates substantially from the sentencing options applicable to first degree crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">We also noted in <em>Manzie </em>\u201c[m]urder is the only crime for which life imprisonment is an available ordinary sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 762 A.2d 276; <em>see also State v. Serrone, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>23, 27, 468 A.2d 1050 (1983) (holding that life imprisonment for murder is an ordinary term). Therefore, unlike first-, second-, third-, and fourth-degree offenses, murder has it own \u201cdiscrete\u201d scheme similar to the example found acceptable in <em>Blakely:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">In a system that says the judge may punish burglary with 10 to 40 years, every burglar knows he is risking 40 years in jail. In a system that punishes burglary with a 10-year sentence, with another 30 added for use of a gun, the burglar who enters a home unarmed is entitled to no more than a 10-year sentence \u2014 and by reason of the Sixth Amendment the facts bearing upon that entitlement must be found by a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\"><em>[Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2540.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Thus, defendant\u2019s assertion that a judicial finding that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, like the deliberate cruelty factor in <em>Blakely, </em>is constitutionally invalid because it represents an enhanced sentence above the presumptive term misses the mark. Firstly, as we have previously pointed out, the life term does not represent an enhancement of a sentence beyond the standard range set forth in the murder statute. Secondly, because the crime of murder has no presumptive term, defendant, like every murderer, \u201cknows he is risking\u201d life in prison. <em>Ibid. </em>Thirdly, even if we were to conclude that the offense-based aggravating factor found here does not survive <em>Blakely, </em>its application is harmless, beyond a reasonable doubt, because the remaining offender-based aggravating factors, together with the absence of any mitigating factors, are sufficient to justify the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Finally, we address defendant\u2019s contention that the factors used to support imposition of parole ineligibility and consecutive terms should be determined by a jury. Both <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>involved a single offense. Neither dealt with, nor are they applicable to, the determination of consecutive sentences. <em>See People v. Sykes, </em>120 <em>Cal.App. </em>4th 1331, 16 <em>Cal.Rptr</em>.3d 317 (2004) (noting that the historical and jurisprudential basis for the <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>holdings did not involve consecutive sentencing). Although the imposition of consecutive terms and a five-year term of parole ineligibility, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6b, increase defendant\u2019s punishment, they do not increase the penalty above what the law provides for the offense charged. <em>See Harris v. United States, </em>536 <em>U.S. </em>545, 562, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>2406, 2416-17, <em>153 L.Ed.2d </em>524, 541 (2002) (plurality opinion). We are satisfied that the sentence imposed does not suffer from the constitutional infirmities proscribed by <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
