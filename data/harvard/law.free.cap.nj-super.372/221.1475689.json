On that earlier occasion, we disagreed with the trial judge\u2019s determination that plaintiff had no standing to pursue his assignor\u2019s claim, but concluded that the dismissal of the complaint should be affirmed because the evidence adduced at trial did not demonstrate, or permit a legitimate inference, that defendant Mellon PSFS breached the midnight deadline rule. <em>Triffin v. Mellon PSFS, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>3, 855 A.2d 2 (App.Div.2004). Judge Coburn wrote separately to express his disagreement with our ruling on standing, but stated his agreement with our discussion of the merits and joined in the judgment affirming the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">In moving for reconsideration, plaintiff contends that we overlooked (1) the parties\u2019 stipulation of certain facts which, he claims, mandates a judgment in his favor, and (2) Mellon\u2019s failure to produce, at trial, a witness and documents pursuant to his notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>in lieu of subpoena. While these circumstances went unmentioned in our earlier opinion, they were not ignored or misapprehended. We take this opportunity to explain why plaintiffs contentions do not compel an alteration of our prior decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The stipulation of facts referred to in the motion for reconsideration consists of Mellon\u2019s concession that the checks in question were presented to it by First Union on August 23, 2001 and dishonored on October 1, 2001. Plaintiff argues that this stipulation provides \u201call of the operative facts required\u201d to establish a midnight deadline violation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">While our courts favor stipulated facts because they serve \u201cto avoid the expense, trouble, and delay of coming forward with proofs when certain otherwise-contestable facts are admitted,\u201d <em>Negrotti v. Negrotti, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>428, 432, 487 A.2d 328, 330 (1985), they must be construed \u201cwith reference to their subject matter and in light of the surrounding circumstances,\u201d <em>Kurak v. A.P. Green Refractories Co., </em>298 <em>N. J.Super. </em>304, 325, 689 A.2d 757, 768 (App.Div.1997). Despite plaintiffs contention that the stipulation definitively resolved all the issues in dispute, we conclude that the stipulation can only be accurately understood when considered in the context of Mellon\u2019s counsel\u2019s statements as to what it was he was conceding, most telling of which are the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">So, if the [forged] check was deposited for $335.14 that was the amount <em>that Mellon originally debited from Current Foods Concept's] account, </em>and then when [Current Food Concept] made its claim [that it was a victim of forgeries,] Mellon credited the account of Current Food Concepts for that same amount, so I presume that that\u2019s the amount that Mellon received from First <em>Union----So, if we\u2019re being asked to stipulate that the debit </em>\u2014 or <em>that the amount that First Union passed back to Mellon was the amount of the items themselves then, you know, we\u2019ll stipulate to </em>that____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">In other words, by so stipulating, Mellon intended to convey that it immediately responded to the checks upon presentment and later was reimbursed by First Union on October 1, 2001. As can be seen, this last event, which the parties stipulated as the date Mellon \u201cdishonored\u201d the checks, was not intended to be represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>tative of the date that Mellon first responded to the checks. As recognized in our earlier opinion, Mellon\u2019s other evidence demonstrated that Mellon paid the checks when presented and only later, when it became apparent that the checks were counterfeit, did Mellon obtain affidavits of forgery from its customer and pursue reimbursement, which it obtained, from First Union. Thus, in light of its context and the surrounding circumstances, <em>Kurak, supra, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 325, 689 A.2d at 768, we reject the contention that the stipulation is conclusive as to the alleged midnight deadline violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Plaintiffs argument in this regard is also based upon a mistaken understanding of the UCC provisions cited in our earlier opinion. These provisions do not require the completion of a bank\u2019s involvement with an item by the midnight deadline. The deadline\u2019s essential purpose is to foster the continued and rapid movement of such items through the marketplace, hence, forbidding a bank, upon penalty of the imposition of liability for delay, to simply hold an item and use the drawer\u2019s money as long as possible. <em>See </em>James J. White and Robert S. Summers, <em>Uniform Commercial Code, </em>Vol. 2, \u00a7 20-2 (4th ed., 1995). The meaning of the stipulation, as revealed by the discussion among the court and counsel quoted earlier, and the applicable statutes, cannot be equated with plaintiffs contention that Mellon conceded a breach of the deadline. Instead, when examined in context, the stipulation\u2019s meaning is entirely consistent with our prior holding that Mellon timely acted on the check and later sought reimbursement when the check\u2019s counterfeit nature was revealed. In other words, when considered in its setting, the stipulation that the checks were \u201cdishonored\u201d on October 1, 2001 does not mean, and was obviously not intended to mean, that Mellon simply held the check for over one month. Instead, the stipulation only fixes the date that Mellon was reimbursed by First Union for having mistakenly paid these counterfeit items on a previous occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">As explained in our earlier opinion, a bank\u2019s rights with respect to a paid item are not permanently fixed when the clock strikes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>twelve. Items may be paid provisionally, and the bank\u2019s obligations may be further adjusted by clearing house rules or other agreement. And, while the bank\u2019s obligations are ordinarily fixed upon making \u201cfinal payment,\u201d as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-215, the bank may still seek reimbursement even after it has \u201cfinally paid\u201d an item, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-418. In this last circumstance, the item is \u201cdeemed not to have been paid or accepted\u201d but is treated as \u201cdishonored,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-418(d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the very word used by the parties in their stipulation to describe Mellon\u2019s actions on October 1, 2001. Accordingly, even if we were to accept the stipulation on its face and ignore all the other evidence in the record, as plaintiff mistakenly argues, the stipulation remains entirely consistent with Mellon\u2019s exercise of a right of reimbursement pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-418 and not a breach of the midnight deadline. In addition, a look beyond the mere words of the stipulation to the other evidence contained in the record, which we have previously discussed, demonstrates that Mellon did not simply hold the checks for more than one month but paid them immediately and later obtained reimbursement from First Union. Illuminated by that evidence, the stipulation obviously contains only the intention of the parties to stipulate that Mellon was reimbursed by First Union on October 1, 2001. Thus, the existence of the stipulation of facts referred to by plaintiff does not effect our earlier decision that plaintiffs proofs failed to fix the date of the midnight deadline or illuminate what Mellon did or did not do within that deadline, and presents no reason for an alteration of our earlier judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Plaintiff also argues that we should not have affirmed the dismissal of Ms complaint, but instead should have entered judgment in his favor, because Mellon failed to produce the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>and documents requested in his notice in lieu of subpoena. Putting aside the fact that plaintiff never made this argument in his submissions to this court, we observe that plaintiff also failed to fully pursue his oral motion for enforcement of the notice in lieu of subpoena at trial. When the issue arose during the course of the trial, the colloquy among the trial judge and counsel resulted in the stipulation of facts referred to above. Once the stipulation was expressed, the trial judge asked plaintiff if that was \u201csufficient for [his] purposes,\u201d to which plaintiff responded that it was, and following which he rested his case. Because plaintiff failed to further pursue enforcement of the notice in lieu of subpoena, and because he failed to raise the issue in his brief on the merits, plaintiff will not now be heard to complain, in seeking reconsideration, that the trial judge should have enforced the notice in lieu of subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Plaintiff lastly argues that Judge Coburn\u2019s separate opinion is not a concurring opinion but, in fact, a dissenting opinion, and should be amended to so indicate. We disagree. Our judgment affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Judge Coburn concurred in that judgment, albeit for different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s contention appears to center on the fact that we held he had standing to sue and expressly disagreed with <em>Triffin v. Bridge View Bank, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>473, 750 A2d 136 (App.Div. 2000), while Judge Coburn expressed his continued adherence to <em>Bridge View Bank, </em>an opinion which he authored. Notwithstanding that disagreement, our further review of the merits of plaintiffs claim led to a conclusion, in which Judge Coburn joined, that plaintiff failed to produce any evidence at trial to demonstrate Mellon\u2019s breach of the midnight deadline rule. As a result, Judge Coburn concurred in the judgment and correctly labeled his separate opinion as a concurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">We further observed that the correct labeling of Judge Coburn\u2019s separate opinion is purely academic for present purposes. While the defining of the opinion as a dissent or concurrence may have relevance to the appealability, as of right, of our judgment, <em>R. </em>2:2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>1(a)(2), it bears no impact and presents no reason for the reconsideration of the opinion which announced the judgment of this court. Whether or to what extent Judge Coburn\u2019s separate opinion gives rise to an appeal as of right is a matter which rests only with our Supreme Court. <em>See Stone v. Old Bridge Tp., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>110, 115-16 n. 2, 543 A.2d 431, 433-34 n. 2 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Motion denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\"> <em>NJ.SA. </em>12A:3-418(d) states, in its entirety: \u201cNotwithstanding 12A:4-215, if an instrument is paid or accepted by mistake and the payor or acceptor recovers payment or revokes acceptance under <em>[NJ.SA. </em>12A:3-418(a) or (b)], the instrument is deemed not to have been paid or accepted and is <em>treated as dishonored, </em>and the person from whom payment is recovered has rights as a person entitled to enforce the dishonored instrument\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-17\"> I am authorized to state that Judge Cobum concurs in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
