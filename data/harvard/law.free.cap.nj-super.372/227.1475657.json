The trial judge merged count three with count one and sentenced defendant to life imprisonment, with thirty years to be served before parole eligibility on the murder conviction, and to a concurrent five year term for the weapons offense based on defendant\u2019s possession of the shotgun without first haying obtained a firearm purchaser\u2019s identification card. Defendant also received a concurrent seven year sentence, with 85% to be served before parole under the No Early Release Act (NERA), for an eluding offense to which he pled guilty. The parties agreed that NERA applied to that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">On this appeal defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">POINT I - WHERE THE STATE CALLED SEVEN EYEWITNESSES AND NONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY DEFENDANT AS THE MURDERER, THE COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO INSTRUCT THE JURY THAT THE STATE HAD TO PROVE IDENTIFICATION BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT DENIED DEFENDANT HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO PRESENT A DEFENSE AND TO A FAIR TRIAL.

(Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>POINT III - WHERE SOME WITNESSES IDENTIFIED DEFENDANT AS \u201cBROOKLYN\u201d AND DEFENDANT DENIED THAT HE WAS KNOWN BY THAT NAME, IT WAS THE JURY\u2019S JOB TO DECIDE WHETHER HE WAS KNOWN BY THAT NAME, BUT THE COURT TOOK THE ISSUE FROM THE JURY WHEN IT REPEATEDLY INSTRUCTED THAT \u201cTHE GRAND JURORS CHARGE THAT LESLIE RANDOLPH KING, ALSO KNOWN AS BROOKLYN,\u201d COMMITTED THE ALLEGED OFFENSES.

Washington, </em>542 U.S.-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531,159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Our careful review of the record convinces us that there is no basis for reversing the convictions and that only the following discussion is appropriate in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(2). We also uphold the challenged sentences in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">The following facts, developed at the trial with respect to the shotgun killing of Lesley Jean Francois, were sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">On the night of November 26, 2000, and early morning of November 27, 2000, Francois and defendant were at the Rainbow Bar in Irvington. Francois had been drinking heavily. After dancing with Francois, a woman was talking with defendant while Francois was attempting to get her attention. Denton Howell, also known as \u201cDufer,\u201d who knew both Francois and defendant, told Francois not to \u201cdisrespect the man,\u201d referring to defendant, while he was talking to the woman. Due to the loud music in the bar and the nature of the discussion, Francois and Howell stepped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>outside to talk further about the matter. Thereafter, Francois\u2019 friends, defendant, the woman in question and others at the bar also went outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">While outside, Francois\u2019 friend, Robenson Demande, started questioning the others about the problem. Howell then removed a .357 Magnum from his pocket and pointed it at Demande. Dwight Townsend, Howell and another man, known as Junior, thereupon pulled Demande around the corner. Demande testified that one of the men took his money while Howell was pointing a silver gun at him. They then heard a shot go off.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Howell looked around the corner to see what happened. He also fired \u201ca single shot in the air,\u201d because he thought someone was firing at him. A few minutes after, the defendant, who was known to Howell as \u201cBrooklyn\u201d and was identified by Howell in the courtroom, walked up to Howell and asked him \u201cto drop off [defendant\u2019s] car for him\u201d at defendant\u2019s house. After leaving the bar, Howell \u201cdrop[ped] off\u2019 defendant\u2019s car and then buried the .357 Magnum gun in his own backyard. According to Howell, \u201cBrooklyn\u201d was wearing a light colored shirt and a black leather jacket that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Defendant visited Howell the next day. According to a statement Howell gave to the police, defendant told him \u201cif the kid\u2019s not dead, he would have to kill him.\u201d At trial, Howell could not confirm that the statement was accurately reported. He could not recall what defendant said to him at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Howell further testified that he did not possess a shotgun at the bar that night. Howell, however, pled guilty and was sentenced on aggravated assault and possession of a weapon charges relating to the handgun he did possess and the events that occurred at the Rainbow Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Demande incorrectly thought he \u201cwas the one who got shot\u201d during a robbery when forced to go with the men at gunpoint. He observed the gun as \u201csilver,\u201d like a .45, and \u201cflat,\u201d not round. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>According to Demande, Howell could not have shot Francois because he was in front of Demande when the shot went off.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Townsend also saw Howell with a gun, but not a shotgun. After the shot was fired and the crowd started to disperse, Townsend went around the corner and saw a man with a shotgun in his hand. He also heard someone yell \u201cBrooklyn did it.\u201d Townsend saw the man inside the bar wearing a hooded sweatshirt. He did not know the shooter and did not identify him in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Franco Charles also walked outside of the bar and witnessed someone coming across the street towards Francois with \u201csomething in his hand.\u201d The person \u201cpulled out a gun\u201d and shot Francois. He described the shooter as wearing \u201ca yellow vest,\u201d with dark sleeves. He was unable <em>\u201cto </em>make out\u201d the shooter\u2019s face. After the shooting, he also witnessed the shooter walk away.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Katrina Johnson, another patron of the bar, testified that the defendant was wearing \u201ca yellow hood and a beige vest.\u201d She knew the defendant as \u201cBrooklyn.\u201d In her statement to the police, she described \u201cBrooklyn\u201d as wearing a black vest, yellow sweater, blue jeans and a tan hat.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Denise Hyman, another patron at the bar, also testified that the defendant was known as \u201cBrooklyn.\u201d She stated that he was wearing \u201ca yellow vest,\u201d a black hooded sweatshirt, black pants and a hat.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">The Medical Examiner determined that the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the chest, at close range, approximately three feet or less in distance. The victim had a blood-alcohol level of .130 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">On December 1, 2000, the defendant was arrested after a vehicle chase. Defendant testified at trial that he did not stop because his \u201clicense was suspended.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The car ultimately crashed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>and defendant sustained injuries resulting in surgery and placement of a steel rod inside his leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Detective Bobby Goines of the Irvington Police Department visited defendant at the hospital on the afternoon of December 2, 2000. He spoke to the defendant and realized he was in \u201cbad condition.\u201d Goines handed defendant a business card to give to the guarding officer so Goines could be contacted when defendant was \u201cready\u201d and felt \u201clike talking to [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">At around 7:30 p.m. that evening, Goines received a telephone call informing him that the defendant wanted to talk. Goines returned to the hospital. Because defendant was still in a lot of pain, Goines told him to call back when he was in better condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">On the night of December 3, 2000, Goines received another call that the defendant wished to talk to him. Goines returned to the hospital. Defendant thanked him for his prior courtesy, and said that he was willing to give a statement. After Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> warnings were administered, defendant gave a statement when Investigator Quovella Maeweather of the Essex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office arrived. Defendant advised Maeweather that he read and signed the <em>Miranda </em>form which she then witnessed. Maeweather also transcribed the interview between Goines and defendant. The defendant reviewed the statement and signed it. Maeweather witnessed him sign the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">In his statement, defendant stated that he used to be known by the name \u201cBrooklyn\u201d; that he was talking to a woman at the bar when a man walked over and pulled the woman\u2019s hair; that the \u201cguy said we can take it outside\u201d; and after \u201cDufer\u201d unsuccessfully tried \u201cto fix everything up,\u201d everyone went outside. When outside the bar, defendant heard two shots, \u201c[o]ne came from across the street by the club [and the] other from the corner of 16th Avenue somewhere.\u201d According to defendant, he \u201cgrabbed\u201d a shotgun and fired \u201cat the person who fired at [him] from across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the street,\u201d that it was the \u201csame guy from inside the club,\u201d and that he \u201chit\u201d the man, and \u201cdropped the gun and ran.\u201d He stated that he was in the street between the bar and the gas station, about six to seven feet away from the victim, when he fired. The victim was \u201cin front of the club doors\u201d when the defendant fired at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Defendant further stated that he \u201cgrabbed\u201d the shotgun from someone standing next to him. He then gave Howell the keys to his car, walked home and took Howell home after Howell drove the car to his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The defendant also testified at trial. He testified that he went to the Rainbow Bar on November 26, 2000 around midnight. He was most likely wearing jeans, a gray hooded sweatshirt, a black jacket and a hat. He drove his girlfriend\u2019s red Oldsmobile to the bar and parked it at the gas station across the street from the tavern. Before the defendant entered the bar, Howell was outside and requested to use the defendant\u2019s car to pick up another person. Defendant gave Howell the keys and then walked into the bar. While the defendant was talking to a young woman, Francois came up to the woman and pulled at her. Francois was drunk. The defendant told Francois he was talking to the woman and that she would be available when he finished. Francois and the defendant started arguing. The defendant informed Francois that he had not come to the bar for any altercations and turned his back on Francois. When he turned around, Howell and Francois were arguing, as defendant continued his conversation with the woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">When Francois and Howell stepped outside the bar, others followed. Defendant decided he was going to leave and went across the street to his car, but realized that Howell had his keys. He started to look for Howell when he heard a loud gunshot. He ducked and then looked around. He saw Howell with a couple of people around the corner from the entrance to the bar. Then he heard a second shot which made a different sound from the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>The defendant further testified that a man next to him had a gun, with a round barrel and a brown handle, in his hand. The man was \u201cscared as hell to use it.\u201d So defendant \u201cgrabbled]\u201d the gun from the man and fired across the street in the direction from which the shots were being fired towards him. The defendant also testified that, \u201cto his knowledge,\u201d he did not hit anyone. Then he \u201claid\u201d the gun back on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The defendant thereafter went across the street to see Howell, who had a \u201cbig gun\u201d in his hand. He told Howell to \u201ctake my car, handle your business and drop it off at my house later.\u201d The defendant then started to walk home, but ultimately took a cab to his house. When Howell arrived with the defendant\u2019s ear, he took him home. Later on November 27, 2000, the defendant went to Howell\u2019s house to discuss what happened earlier that morning, but Howell was \u201cno help\u201d in telling the defendant about the events that occurred in front of the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">After being released on the eluding charge, defendant \u201cturn[ed him]self in\u201d to the police on the present indictment after being told he had been charged with those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The defendant also testified that he is not known as \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d and that he was \u201c[n]ever\u201d called by that name, although he once lived there. He stated that he does not own a twelve-gauge shotgun. The defendant further testified that he did not recall giving a statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">None of the witnesses who testified for the State expressly identified defendant as the man who shot Francois. However, in addition to the testimony, including that of defendant, that defendant fired a gun in the direction of where Francois was standing following the verbal exchange over a woman in which both were interested, there was testimony that defendant was wearing clothing matching that observed on the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Defendant contends that the trial judge erred by not specifically instructing the jury on the State\u2019s burden to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>identification when none of the eyewitnesses identified him as the assailant. In response, the State argues that defendant invited the error by requesting the trial judge not to give an instruction on identification and should, therefore, be precluded from raising the claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">At the charge conference, the trial judge reviewed the instructions he planned to give, including lesser-included offenses, defenses and factual assertions. Specifically with respect to the issue of identification, the judge summarized the position of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">It\u2019s my understanding that identification is not sought by either the State or the defendant as a model charge here, inasmuch as the defendant, by his own testimony indicates that he was at the scene at the time of the offenses alleged, although he denies that he was the person who committed them. And I do not intend to charge false-in-one; false-in-all. I believe both counsel agree that that not be charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Defense counsel indicated that she had \u201cno\u201d disagreement with the judge\u2019s summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Moreover, in summation, after noting that no one at the scene of the crime \u201cmade an in-court identification of my client as the person with the shotgun who shot Mr. Francois,\u201d counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A82\">Now, basically, this is not an identification case. Because if it was, I just pack up and go home. The State has not put any witness on who identifies my client as the shooter. This is, ladies and gentlemen, a case about statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Counsel further noted \u201cthat a lot of statements were taken from civilian witnesses and from my client,\u201d and that the case was commenced and premised on defendant\u2019s admission that he \u201cdischarged a shotgun.\u201d The thrust of the defense was that the State built its case around the defendant\u2019s statement but that the statement, if any, was actually given in the hospital room, was involuntary, and did not \u201ccontain ... the truth.\u201d According to counsel, defendant did not \u201crecall giving the statement, though he does say he signed it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Because defendant asserted that although he fired a weapon, his shot did not hit the victim, we incline to the view that a charge relative to identification should have been given to the jury. <em>See, e.g., State v. Robinson, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>32, 40-41, 754 A.2d 1153, 1158 (2000); <em>State v. Green, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>281, 288-294, 430 A.2d 914, 917-921 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>(1981); <em>State v. Copling, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>417, 431-34, 741 A.2d 624, 632-34 (App.Div.1999), <em>certif. denied, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>189, 752 A.2d 1290 (2000). A critical issue in the case is whether defendant was the person who shot the victim and caused his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">However, we cannot conclude under these circumstances that the trial court committed \u201cplain error\u201d by not so charging. <em>See State v. Green, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 289, 430 A.2d at 917-18; <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 338, 273 A.2d 1, 8 (1971); <em>R. </em>2:10-2. \u201c[TJhe issue is whether the failure to instruct the jury as to identification created a possibility of injustice sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to the propriety of the jury\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Copling, supra, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 431-32, 741 A.2d at 632. Resolution of that issue requires a \u201chighly fact-sensitive\u201d analysis. <em>State v. Green, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 291-92, 430 A.2d at 919; <em>State v. McNeil, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>266, 272, 696 A.2d 757, 760 (App.Div.1997); <em>State v. Salaam, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 69-72, 541 A.2d 1075,1076-78 (App.Div.1988); <em>State v. Frey, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 329-30, 476 A.2d 884, 885-86 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Defendant admitted that he was at the scene and, in fact, testified that he fired a shotgun toward the victim. On the other hand, as defendant was not specifically identified by any witness, the traditional identification charge was not appropriate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, while we do not accept the State\u2019s assertion that identification was not a \u201ccrucial issue,\u201d and believe that specific reference to the subject of identification was warranted, <em>see State v. Copling, supra, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 432-33, 741 A.2d at 632-33, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>identification of the person who shot Francois was in contest,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we find no \u201cplain error\u201d warranting reversal. This case involves more than a mere failure by defense counsel to request a specific instruction or objection to its omission. Here defense counsel expressly declined an instruction on the subject and affirmatively asserted that identification was not an issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We are more than satisfied that the judge\u2019s charge as a whole, including the instructions on burden of proof, culpability and causation, were adequate to assure defendant a fair trial in which the jury was obligated to determine, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was the actor who shot Francois. In her summation, defense counsel attacked that conclusion by stressing that the principal investigator, Goines, prematurely closed his investigation because witnesses said the shooter was wearing a yellow vest, others said a person nicknamed \u201cBrooklyn\u201d was wearing a yellow vest, and that defendant was identified as \u201cBrooklyn.\u201d She also asserted that Howell was the killer, that defendant\u2019s close friends did not see defendant with a yellow vest, and that his conduct was inconsistent with proofs required to satisfy the State\u2019s burden. It was thus clear to the jury that it had to find that this defendant not only was at the scene and shot in the direction of the victim, but actually was the one who caused his death. The jury instructions required no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In essence, in these circumstances, in which defendant acknowledged both his presence at the scene and shooting of a gun, but no witness identified him as the shooter, combined with his counsel\u2019s affirmative decision not to ask for an identification charge, we can find no \u201cplain error\u201d warranting reversal because the trial judge did not expressly instruct the jury on the subject of identification. <em>Cf. State v. Garron, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>147, 179-81, 827 A.2d 243, 262-63 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>(2003) (trial judge has independent obligation to charge lesserineluded offense).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">We also reject defendant\u2019s argument that the trial judge committed plain error when he read the indictment which alleged that \u201cLeslie Randolph King, also known as Brooklyn\u201d committed the three offenses. Defendant argues that by reading the indictment with \u201cthe alias\u201d included, the court removed the disputed issue as to whether the defendant was known as \u201cBrooklyn.\u201d However, in his instructions, the judge made clear that \u201cthe indictment is not evidence bearing upon the issue of whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of any charge stated in the indictment.\u201d With respect to the murder charge, the judge also made clear \u201cthat the defendant has pleaded not guilty to the count. And the fact that I read it is to provide a context for you and not to give any more emphasis to one side or the other. Remember, he\u2019s pled not guilty to this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Moreover, the nickname provided relevant proof in the case. Contemporaneous declarations and identifications referred to \u201cBrooklyn\u201d as the shooter, and several witnesses testified that they knew the defendant as \u201cBrooklyn.\u201d The defendant, in his statement to the police, acknowledged that he was known as \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d although he no longer used that name. At trial, the defendant testified that he was never called by the name \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d although he had lived in Brooklyn. Whether the defendant was known as \u201cBrooklyn\u201d was a contested issue at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Use of the name \u201cBrooklyn\u201d was neither prejudicial nor an ominous sounding alias. Rather, as developed in the evidence, it was a nickname allegedly associated with the defendant. Therefore, its inclusion in the reading of the indictment does not warrant reversal. <em>See State v.

As we noted in <em>Salaam, supra, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 73, 541 A.2d at 1078, \u201c[t]he principal objection to the use of an alias in a criminal proceeding is that an alias implied that the defendant belongs to the criminal class and thereby prejudices the jury.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>at 73, 541 A.2d at 1078. However, even then, \u201cthe majority of decisions involving this issue hold that the admission of irrelevant aliases into evidence will not afford a basis of reversal unless some tangible form of prejudice is demonstrated, i.e. where such names have been intentionally offered as indicia of guilt.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Defendant argues that his statement to the police must be suppressed because the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and Optional Protocol on Disputes, April 24, 1963, art. 36, 21 <em>U.S.T. </em>77, <em>T.I.A.S. </em>No. 6820 (Convention) was violated when the police failed to notify him of his right to contact the consulate of his native country before giving his statement to the police.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Defendant is a citizen of Guyana. Both Guyana and the United States are signatories to the Convention, which was ratified by Congress in 1969. The Convention is a multi-lateral treaty addressing the estabiishment of consular relations between signatory nations. <em>See State v. Homdziuk, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>279, 288, 848 A.2d 853, 859 (App.Div.2004). It protects foreign nationals who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>are detained or placed in custody. <em>State v.

Cevallos-Bermeo, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>181, 185-87, 754 A.2d 1224, 1227-28 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>607, 762 A.2d 221 (2000); <em>Jang, supra, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 94, 819 A.2d at 15), nor found it to require suppression of a statement given in the absence of knowledge of the rights it provides. <em>Jang, supra, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 88, 93-94, 819 A.2d at 11, 14-15; <em>Cevallos-Bermeo, supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 187-188, 754 A.2d at 1228. To the contrary, we have recently held that the exclusionary rule is not applicable as a remedy for violation of Article 36 of the Convention. <em>Homdziuk, supra, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 289-90, 848 A.2d at 859-60. We add only that the defendant spoke English and the record reflects that he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to giving his statement, and knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">By supplementary brief, defendant contends that the life sentence for murder must be reduced, and a thirty-year term imposed, as a result of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In <em>Blakely, </em>the United States Supreme Court repeated its holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>466, 490, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that \u201cother than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. The majority also stated that \u201cour precedents make clear ... that the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original; citations omitted.) Thus, defendant argues, because in New Jersey the presumptive sentence for each degree of crime cannot be raised without the judge\u2019s finding of an aggravating factor or factors not found by the jury, the \u201cpresumptive term\u201d cannot be raised in the absence of a jury determination relating to that factor or factors. We need not address the issue because we conclude there is no presumptive sentence for murder, and no additional \u201creal time\u201d results from the concurrent sentence imposed for the weapons violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Defendant argues that the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d or \u201cpresumptive sentence\u201d for murder at the time of this offense was thirty years, and that that term was raised because the trial judge found aggravating factors not found by the jury. Defendant does not contend that the mandatory ineligibility term of thirty years, as established by the Legislature, has to be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument addressed to the specific term. At the time of this offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b provided (as it does now) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">[m]urder is a crime of the first degree but a person convicted of murder shall be sentenced, except as provided in subsection c of this section [relating to capital punishment], by the court to a term of 30 years, during which the person shall not be eligible for parole, or be sentenced to a specific term of years which shall be between 30 years and life imprisonment of which the person shall serve 30 years before being eligible for parole.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">There is no presumptive sentence for murder provided by the Legislature, see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lf(l) (excepting murder from the presumptive term provisions) and none established by case law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Therefore, even assuming that <em>Blakely </em>prevents a judge from raising a \u201cpresumptive term\u201d based on aggravating factors embodied in N.J.S.A 2C:44-l(a), there was no presumptive term for murder, at least none less than life imprisonment, and the judge could impose a sentence in the range of thirty years to life imprisonment without making fact-finding which raised the presumptive. Stated differently, because there is no \u201cpresumptive sentence\u201d for murder, the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for purposes of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>is life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We recognize that we have sustained life sentences for murder based on the judicial assessment that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating. <em>See State v. Soto, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>47, 71-72, 773 A.2d 739, 754 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>209, 785 A.2d 438 (2001); <em>State v. Torres, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 161-64, 713 A.2d 1, 17-19 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>425, 719 A.2d 1023 (1998). <em>See also State v. Zadoyan, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 289-92, 675 A.2d 698, 703-05 (App.Div.1996) (carjacking). But that does not mean that there is a \u201cpresumptive sentence\u201d less than life for murder or that, for constitutional purposes, the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d is less than the top of the range in the absence of some legislative intent providing otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The sentence on the weapons offense does involve raising the presumptive term from four years to five. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-6a(3); 2C:44-lf(l). The judgment refers to aggravating factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">1. The nature and circumstances of the offense, and the role of the actor therein, whether or not it was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">3. The risk that defendant will commit another offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>9. The need for deterring defendant and others from violating the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In finding that \u201c[t]he preponderance of aggravating factors favors a higher term\u201d than the presumptive, the judge also found that mitigating factor seven applied, that is \u201c[t]he defendant has no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity has led to a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present offense.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">A reading of the trial judge\u2019s remarks at sentencing make clear that aggravating factor number one was found in light of the manner in which the shooting occurred because \u201cthe almost execution style of the behavior that resulted in the death here [was] cold and calculated,\u201d \u201calmost business like.\u201d When referring to aggravating factor number one, the judge said that it applied because of \u201cthe very direct and execution style, cool detached behavior and role of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Thus, the aggravating factors used to increase the presumptive sentence for the weapons offense did not include factor one. To the extent the other aggravating factors were related to the offense because defendant did not have a record and they cannot be said to be subject to <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>exception permitting the judge to make fact-finding relating to prior convictions, 542 U.S. at-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2536; <em>see also, e.g., State v. Dixon, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 140, 787 A.2d 211, 221 (App.Div.2001) (persistent offender statute upheld) <em>certif. denied, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>181, 796 A.2d 898 (2002), the sentence in this case was concurrent and far shorter than the sentence for murder with its thirty-year parole ineligibility term. It was also concurrent to and far shorter than the uncontested sentence with the NERA term for eluding to which he pled guilty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>As a result, even if <em>Blakely </em>prohibits the trial judge from using an aggravating factor or factors not found by the jury, and not based on prior convictions, to increase the specific term sentence imposed (an issue we do not decide), it was harmless in this case. Suffice it to say, therefore, that with respect to the five year sentence imposed on the weapons offense, the trial judge made findings which, under traditional New Jersey law, permitted the increase of the presumptive term. <em>See State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 363-64, 471 A.2d 370, 386 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-12\"> This was apparently the event resulting in the eluding charge to which he pled guilty.

The model charge on that subject instructs the jury to examine the reliability and credibility of the specific identification. Given the testimony in this case, and the absence of any specific identification of defendant as the shooter, the model charge would have been inappropriate. Before us, however, defendant attaches the first and last paragraphs of the model charge on \"identification: in-court and out-of-court identifications,\u201d and urges it should have been given. As noted, we are inclined to the view it should have been, at least upon request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\"> The State also argues that defendant\u2019s pretrial statement had \"the aura\u201d of asserting self-defense, but the trial judge declined to charge self-defense over defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\"> In so concluding, we do not necessarily accept the State\u2019s assertion that defense counsel purposefully decided not to request an identification instruction because it \"would have focused the jury\u2019s attention on the strong circumstantial evidence that enveloped the defendant as Francois' killer [and] the jury\u2019s concentration on that evidence linking the defendant to Francois' death would have detracted the jury's attention from the defense linchpin that no one positively identified defendant as the shooter.\u201d Accordingly, we do not preclude a petition for post-conviction relief based on the failure of defense counsel to request the instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\"> The defendant also argued before the trial judge that the statement should be suppressed because it was not made voluntarily and knowingly as he was under the influence of medication and he had no recollection of giving the statement. As already noted, the trial judge found that the defendant made the statement voluntarily and knowingly. That decision is not challenged on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\"><em> </em>N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3(b) also provides for life imprisonment without parole in certain circumstances when the death penalty is not imposed. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2 (N.E.R.A.) for offenses occurring after June 29, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b271-13\"> See legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3b, 2C:43-7a(l),(2), and 2C:44-lf(l) and the amendments thereto; <em>State v.
