Defendant appeals from the judgment of the Family Part ordering the forfeiture of his service handgun, ammunition, other gun paraphernalia, and firearm identification card. The seizure order was issued as part of a domestic violence temporary restraining order (TRO) obtained by his former wife. She voluntarily withdrew the TRO before any final restraining order was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">Based on the record before us, we conclude that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant was unfit to possess a firearm. We hold, however, that the evidence presented by the State provided a rational basis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c, to question defendant\u2019s suitability to possess a firearm. Under the doctrine of implied waiver, defendant\u2019s right to confidentiality in the medical information kept on file by the Division of Pensions and Benefits is subordinate to the State\u2019s interest in preventing the possession of firearms by individuals deemed statutorily disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The parties are former husband and wife. They were married for approximately eight years and had three children who were ten, eight and five years old at the time this matter came before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The incident that gave rise to the issuance of the TRO against defendant occurred on June 6, 2002. The record does not contain a copy of the domestic violence complaint filed by his former wife, but she gave the following description of the incident in the course of her testimony at the forfeiture hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">I was leaving my house in Freehold, and I was driving to the woman\u2019s house who used to provide day care for me, to make a final payment to her. And I was driving down Route 9 and I noticed in my rear view mirror, a car driving fairly close to me. And I thought it was just somebody that wanted to pass me. So I went, I was in the fast lane, went to the slow lane. The car went behind me and I proceeded to drive down. And then X got into Lakewood on West County Line Road, and I was stopped at a traffic light, and I looked in my rear view mirror and I noticed that this car was behind me at this traffic light.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">And I kind of got a little taken aback by it, because it was from Freehold to Lakewood. So, I made the left onto Hope Chapel Road and I pulled over on the side of the road, and the car went past me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">So, I proceeded to go to this house where I was going to make the payment. And I walked in the house and there was a couple people in there, and I had just explained that I believed that I was being followed. And they said, what do you mean\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">And I proceeded to make the payment. And they went outside for whatever reason, and came back in. They said that there\u2019s a car that you described sitting out in front of the house. And there was a man in the car taking pictures of your car and the house. And I went to go outside and at that point the car was gone. So then I called the Lakewood Police to come.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\">THE COURT: So you never realized who was in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>THE WITNESS: Absolutely not. Uhhum. I didn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">She also testified that, in the course of their marriage, defendant was occasionally \u201cverbally abusive,\u201d a term she defined as \u201cyelling, being aggravated at stuff, blaming me for problems with bills.\u201d There was also one incident of physical abuse that occurred on Christmas Eve in 1998. According to the former Mrs. Cordoma, defendant physically threw her down onto the ground, causing her to strike her head against sheetrock that had been placed there. Although she did not receive medical attention, she had scratches and a bump on her head. She did not summon the police nor seek judicial relief in the form of a domestic violence TRO. The couple separated in November 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The ex parte TRO issued in connection with the forfeiture proceedings contained the standard provision, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-29b, barring defendant from possessing any firearm. The police officer who served the TRO described defendant\u2019s demeanor at the time of service as \u201crelaxed.\u201d The officer permitted defendant to leave the room to retrieve the handgun that he kept unloaded and locked in a secure container. The officer also confiscated twenty rounds of .40 caliber ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">It is undisputed that defendant possessed this weapon incident to his former position as a State Corrections Officer. It is equally undisputed that defendant never threatened his former wife with the gun or otherwise used the weapon in an inappropriate manner against her or anyone else. The TRO remained in effect from June 7, 2002, until July 26, 2002, when the former Mrs. Cordoma voluntarily moved before the Family Part to dismiss the complaint and vacate the restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">On October 9, 2003, the State instituted forfeiture proceedings before the Family Part pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3). As part of the testimony received concerning defendant\u2019s fitness to possess a firearm, the court heard the following from defendant\u2019s former wife:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">Q. Are you aware if [ defendant] has any kind of physical disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>A. I know that, it was after we were separated, but I know that he\u2019s retired from his job as a corrections officer for a disability. I know that he has a disability retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">Q____How do you know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">A. Because at one point when we were at both of our respective attorney ... for a four-way conference on the day of our divorce, we were sitting in the lobby and just speaking. And I asked him did, you know, just basically what happened with your disability? Why aren\u2019t you working?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">And he told me that he didn\u2019t really want to talk about it, and <em>it wasn\u2019t that much of a physical thing, it was more of a mental disability. </em>And I said, what do you mean? And he said, I just don\u2019t want to talk about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">But I know that, because at that point he was seeing my children, and I know that he wasn\u2019t in a hospital or anything like that. So, and that\u2019s the most that I know ... (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The State also called Peter Gorman, a representative of the State\u2019s Division of Pensions and Benefits, to establish a foundation for admitting defendant\u2019s retirement file. According to Gorman, defendant obtained an \u201cordinary disability\u201d retirement benefit. This meant that the nature of the disability was not caused by a work-related accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the State attempted to introduce into evidence the medical documentation submitted by defendant in support of his application for \u201cordinary disability\u201d benefits, defendant objected based on the patient/physieian privilege. Thereafter, the following colloquy between the court and defense counsel ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">THE COURT: And well, what is the basis of the objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Well, doctor/patient privilege. I am not releasing those records for this hearing. My client is not releasing those records for this hearing. THE COURT: Well, here\u2019s the thing. In order to make a determination as to whether the weapons should be forfeited and his authority to carry weapons should be revoked, N.J.S.A 2C:58-3 suggests that I have to make a finding as to whether the person has \u2014 And I have no idea what the disability was or what the medical situation was. But he has to be ... physically capable, not suffer from a physical defect or disease. And that he\u2019s not somebody who would be considered ... unsafe to carry firearms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">And also as to whether he suffers from a mental disorder, and whether he was confined for that disorder. So, I think it\u2019s completely relevant to my determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>as to whether this person should receive his weapon back and whether he should be authorized to carry a permit, license or other authorization to use or own a firearm. DEFENSE COUNSEL: I certainly don\u2019t disagree. It\u2019s probably very relevant. But it\u2019s also privileged and I\u2019m not waiving it for my client, and my client is not waiving it. I think the burden is upon the State to prove that my client is unfit in some fashion. Because we heard no testimony from the wife saying he\u2019s physically or mentally unfit in any fashion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">THE COURT: Well, you have to understand, the burden here is a simple preponderance of the evidence. Is it more likely than not. So, without \u2014 If you want to not have them come in, and the only thing I heard about was the wife saying that he had a mental disability, then I\u2019ll leave that to you. I don\u2019t know what those records say. I have absolutely no idea. And if you don\u2019t want me to consider them, I won\u2019t consider them. But I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s better or worse. But if you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Well, but since \u2014 Judge, I think the reason why I\u2019m fighting so hard is that first he was never confined for a mental disorder. There\u2019s nothing before Your Honor reflecting that my client was confined in any fashion. THE COURT: There\u2019s nothing that says he wasn\u2019t either.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The court ultimately denied the State\u2019s application to introduce the medical information contained in defendant\u2019s retirement file. Construing the provisions of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>506, the court concluded that defendant had a reasonable expectation that the medical information provided to the Division of Pensions and Benefits would be used exclusively to support his application for benefits, and would not be disclosed to any third party for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Thus, the only evidence before the court as to defendant\u2019s fitness to possess a firearm came from the testimony of his former wife. Defendant allegedly told her that his disability pension was based more on his \u201cmental\u201d rather than his physical condition. After reviewing the applicable statutory provisions, the court granted the State\u2019s forfeiture application. The court explained its ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">Now here, I have absolutely no real information about the medical disability. I\u2019m going to assume, based upon just the testimony that was provided to the Court, but which I had no, I have no basis to believe or disbelieve. But again, the burden here is a preponderance of the evidence. And I hear about a medical disability, there are records that I have not been able to consider. But I\u2019ve received no testimony other than that the defendant here had a mental disability and received, as Mr. Gorman testified, total and permanent disability as a New Jersey corrections officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>I have no testimony from this defendant to say what it was that was the problem, or what it is that he might have done to correct the problem. And therefore, I cannot say that he does not pose a threat to the public health and safety. And I cannot say that he is fit to carry a firearm or is fit to be authorized, permitted or licensed to carry a firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">And therefore, based upon that and based upon, again, the burden. I believe State has met their burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the weapons or weapon here should be seized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">... But again, I have no idea. And even if it wasn\u2019t a mental disability, let me say this. <em>Whatever the disability was, I have no idea if that would prohibit him, from being able to possess a firearm. </em>The only testimony I had here was from the wife, who said it was a mental disability. And then again, you know, I have nothing to contradict that. So, I have to say, as I indicated, up until the point where the records were an issue, I did not believe that the State had proved to me that there was an issue of concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">Again, that was based upon my reading of the underlying domestic violence complaint. It was one where he supposedly followed her and took some photographs. But I did not hear anything from him with regard to that situation or their subsequent relationship, or whatever disability might have caused him to seek a full and complete disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: But Judge, in your ruling if you\u2019re going to conclude, if you did, you did conclude that it was a mental disability, the statute requires that there be proof of confinement. There\u2019s no proof of confinement before Your Honor in any fashion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">THE COURT: All I need to find \u2014 I don\u2019t have to find on a medical disability. All I have to find is that he is unfit to carry a weapon. I hear that there\u2019s a medical disability, I hear that he\u2019s completely and totally disabled and permanently disabled from the New Jersey Department of Corrections. And I have no, nothing before me from him by way of testimony, by way of records, by way of anything to indicate to me that he is not incapable or unfit to carry a firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">I\u2019m not basing my finding on the medical, the mental disability. That testimony came in by somebody who had a conversation with your client. And I heard absolutely nothing to contradict it, or to even to establish a basis at all. <em>So, I\u2019m going to have to assume, based upon the fact that the defendant did not take the stand, and based upon the fact that I heard nothing or could see nothing with regard to what, if anything, this disability was, that he is in fact unfit. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">In 2003, the Legislature amended the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act to require law enforcement officers, who have probable cause to believe that an act of domestic violence has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>committed, to: (1) inquire as to the presence of weapons on the premises; (2) seize any weapon the officer reasonably believes would expose the victim to a risk of serious bodily injury; and (3) also seize any firearm purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun issued to the person accused of committing domestic violence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(l)(a), (l)(b). By so doing, the Legislature signaled its clear concern with the increased danger posed by firearms in the hands of those charged with domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">It is now well-settled that the voluntary dismissal of a domestic violence complaint does not mandate the automatic return of any firearms seized by law enforcement officers in connection therewith. <em>In re Return of Weapons to J.W.D., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>108, 110, 693 A.2d 92 (1997); <em>State v. One Marlin Rifle, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>359, 371, 725 A.2d 144 (App.Div.1999); <em>State v. Freysinger, </em>311 <em>N.J.Super </em>509, 515, 710 A.2d 582 (App.Div.1998); <em>State v. Volpini, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>401, 412, 677 A.2d 780 (App.Div.1996). The State retains the statutory right to seek the forfeiture of any seized firearms provided it can show that defendant is afflicted with one of the legal \u201cdisabilities\u201d enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Within forty-five days of seizure, the State can petition the Family Part for a forfeiture order \u201cto obtain title to the seized weapons, or to revoke any and all permits, licenses and other authorizations for use, possession, or ownership of such weapons.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3); <em>State v. Wahl, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super </em>356, 362, 839 A.2d 120 (App.Div.2004). The proceedings are to be conducted in a summary fashion and the burden of proof is iipon the State to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that forfeiture is legally warranted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">After the hearing the court shall order the return of the firearms, weapons and any authorization papers relating to the seized weapons to the owner if the court determines the owner is not subject to any of the disabilities set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:58-3e. and finds that the complaint has been dismissed at the request of the complainant and the prosecutor determines that there is insufficient probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>to indict; or if the defendant is found not guilty of the charges; or if the court determines that the domestic violence situation no longer exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3c contains eight separate statutory \u201cdisabilities,\u201d any one of which is legally sufficient to deny the issuance of a permit to own and possess a firearm. In the course of the hearing here, the court discussed the applicability of disabilities (2) and (5), which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">No handgun purchase permit or firearms purchaser identification card shall be issued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">(2) To any drug dependent person as defined in [N.J.S.A 24:21-2], to any person who is confined for a mental disorder to a hospital, mental institution or sanitarium, or to any person who is presently an habitual drunkard;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">(5) To any person where the issuance would not be in the interest of the public health, safety or welfare;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-12\"><em>[NJ.S.A </em>2C:58-3c.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">Disability (2) is not applicable on its face because the State did not present any evidence that defendant was ever drug dependent, confined for a mental disorder or was, at the time of the hearing, a \u201chabitual drunkard.\u201d In this light, the hearing judge correctly focused her analysis on disability (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">This broadly worded disqualification criterion eludes precise definition. We are satisfied, however, that it must be liberally construed to effectuate the overarching public policy objectives of the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act. That is, to afford \u201cmaximum protection\u201d to victims of domestic violence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-18; <em>See also State v. Volpini, supra, </em>291 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 408-09, 677 A.2d 780. A trial court must therefore be mindful that individuals who pose a general threat to the public health, safety or welfare may pose an even more immediate and defined threat to those who have been the direct recipients of their violent conduct. That threat is not necessarily extinguished after the vacation of judicially imposed restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Thus, a judicial declaration that a defendant poses a threat to the public health, safety or welfare involves, by necessity, a fact-sensitive analysis. It requires a careful consideration of both the individual history of defendant\u2019s interaction with the former plaintiff in the domestic violence matter, as well as an assessment of the threat a defendant may impose to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">These guiding legal principles notwithstanding, we stress that no matter what the subject matter, a judge sitting as the trier of fact is always obligated to impartially, rationally and dispassionately make factual findings that are supported by competent and credible evidence. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974); <em>R. </em>1:7-4. This duty is never more important than when it is tested against the backdrop of a vitally important public policy concern like the one involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Guided by this responsibility, we have not hesitated to set aside a trial court\u2019s forfeiture ruling when it was not supported by sufficient competent evidence. In <em>One Marlin Rifle, supra, </em>the trial court found that defendant posed a threat to public health, safety and welfare and ordered forfeiture of the firearm. The court\u2019s ruling was based, in pertinent part, on the testimony of defendant\u2019s former wife, who was also a certified clinical nurse specialist. At the forfeiture hearing, she testified as to her husband\u2019s mental condition and his use of the drug Paxil, which she described as an \u201canti-depressant drug used both to treat depression in \u2018an agitated form\u2019 as well as to control the behavior of persons suffering from \u2018intermittent explosive disorder.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 365, 725 A.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">On appeal, we held that, although medically trained, the wife was not qualified to offer an opinion as to her husband\u2019s mental condition because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:ll-23b prohibits a nurse from providing a medical diagnosis. <em>One Marlin Rifle, supra, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 369, 725 A.2d 144. Moreover, even if she met the threshold qualification requirement to provide a diagnosis, her testimony constituted a net opinion, not supported by competent evidence combined with medical analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 372, 725 A.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Thereafter, we reversed the trial court\u2019s forfeiture ruling because the State failed to present sufficient credible evidence from which to conclude that defendant posed a threat to the public health, safety or welfare:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">The evidence of harassment and \u2018outbursts\u2019 described by [defendant\u2019s wife], appears more aptly described as frustration surrounding the marital break-up, rather than psychological behavioral outbursts. Even [defendant\u2019s wife] conceded that this was a distinctly possible explanation of her estranged husband\u2019s behavior. Furthermore, [the wife\u2019s] testimony was self-serving and cloaked in medical terminology that lacks proper foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Here, the evidence presented by the State in support of its forfeiture application is even less compelling. There is no evidence that defendant\u2019s former wife has any medical training or that defendant was taking anti-depressant medication at the time of the hearing or had ever been treated for a psychiatric disorder. The single isolated statement attributable to defendant, that his disability pension was due mostly to an unspecified \u201cmental\u201d problem, is utterly insufficient to support any finding that defendant poses a threat to the public health, safety or welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Notwithstanding these deficiencies, we are satisfied that the record here provides a sufficient basis to question defendant\u2019s fitness to possess a firearm. Our conclusion is based on three separate pieces of evidence: (1) defendant\u2019s permanent disability pension from his position as a State Corrections Officer; (2) his former wife\u2019s testimony that defendant told her that his disability pension was based mostly on his \u201cmental\u201d condition; and (3) defendant\u2019s failure to rebut the logical inference to be drawn from this evidence; namely, that the Division of Pensions and Benefits found defendant unfit to perform the duties of a Corrections Officer due, at least in part, to an unspecified \u201cmental\u201d problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Once this evidence was before the court, it had a rational basis to question defendant\u2019s fitness to possess a firearm under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3e(5). Moreover, because defendant\u2019s possession of the firearm here is incidental to his former position as a State Corrections Officer, any information bearing upon his fitness to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>perform the duties of that office is directly probative of whether his continued possession of his service weapon constitutes a threat to the public health, safety or welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Defendant nevertheless objected to the court reviewing his retirement file asserting patient/physician privilege. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>506. Although not cited by either party, we also recognize that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:l-1.2(c) provides that \u201cmedical testimony obtained ... for disability retirement shall be restricted for the confidential use of the Boards of Trustees\u201d of the Division of Pensions and Benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">We are satisfied, however, that in these circumstances, defendant\u2019s right to keep confidential the medical information provided to the Division of Pensions and Benefits is subordinate to the public\u2019s interest in preventing individuals deemed statutorily unfit from possessing firearms. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that, even in the absence of statutory authority, there are circumstances in which a court may override a claim of privilege. In <em>In Re Kozlov, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>232, 398 A.2d 882 (1979), the Court articulated three \u201cfoundations\u201d that must be established in order to find an implied waiver of a recognized privilege. There must be (1) a legitimate need for the evidence; (2) the evidence must be relevant and material to the issue before the court; and (3) by a fair preponderance of the evidence, the party must show that the information cannot be secured from any less intrusive source. <em>Id. </em>at 243-44, 398 A.2d 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Thus, applying the <em>Kozlov </em>three-part test, we have held that a plaintiff in a medical malpractice case had effectively created a limited waiver of the psychologist/patient privilege by placing her emotional and mental state in issue based, in part, on her demand for psychological distress damages. <em>Arena v. Saphier, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 88-91, 492 A.2d 1020 (App.Div.1985). In order to protect the holder of the privilege from undue disclosure, the judge should ordinarily examine confidential information <em>in camera. Irval Realty v. Bd. of Pub. Util. Comm\u2019rs, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>366, 375, 294 A.2d 425 (1972); <em>State v. Kunz, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>128, 145, 259 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>895 (1969); <em>United Jersey Bank v. Wolosoff, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>553, 563, 483 A.2d 821 (App.Div.1984); <em>DeGraaff v. DeGraaff, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 583, 395 A.2d 525 (App.Div.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Here, by falling under the jurisdiction of the Family Part, defendant placed his continued fitness to possess a firearm directly into question. In this context, the applicability of all three <em>Kozlov </em>factors is obvious. Under the express provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3), the State has a clear interest in preventing statutorily \u201cunfit\u201d persons from possessing firearms. The medical evidence substantiating defendant\u2019s disability pension from his position as a State Corrections Officer is directly relevant to determining whether he is fit to possess a firearm. Finally, this type of medical information cannot, by definition, be found in any other place.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Defendant, of course, should not be denied his interest in maintaining the confidentiality of these records. He must understand, however, that he cannot have it both ways. If he persists in asserting his right not to disclose the records, the trial court is empowered, based on the other evidence before it, to infer that these records would furnish no basis for resisting the forfeiture application and to conclude, therefore, that forfeiture should be ordered in the public interest. To minimize the intrusion on defendant\u2019s privacy, defendant may insist that judicial examination of these records be conducted <em>in camera, </em>and outside the presence of the attorney prosecuting the forfeiture action. Any disclosure of privileged information must be strictly limited to data necessary to substantiate the court\u2019s judgment of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">We therefore vacate the order of forfeiture in this matter, and remand for reconsideration in light of the principles we have posited.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-13\"> See <em>NJ.S.A. </em>43:7-12, distinguishing between an \"ordinary disability\u201d and an \u201caccidental disability,\u201d by defining the latter to be caused by \"a traumatic event occurring during the performance of duty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
