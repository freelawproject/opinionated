Land belonging to an institution of learning upon which the buildings or \u201cinstitutions\u201d are not located, and which is not shown to be \u201cused exclusively\u201d for the interests of the corporation, is subject to taxation, and is not exempt, under the present legislation.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b578-10\" pgmap=\"578\">Appeal from the County Court of Cook county; the Hon.

Gotjdy, for the appellant, contended that the five acres which is taxed was real estate on which an institution of learning is located, within the meaning of the statute, and consequently, exempt from taxation. The division of it from the other land does not change its character. ' The exemption is of all the property of an institution of learning, and not merely of. the real estate on which the institution is located.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-5\" pgmap=\"579\">It is clear that if the clause, viz: \u201cincluding the real estate on which the institutions are located, \u201d was not in the statute, all the property, real and personal, of this appellant, \u201cnot leased or otherwise used with a view to profit, \u201d would, beyond any question, be exempt from taxation, for the word \u201cproperty, \u201d in tax exemptions, includes everything capable of ownership.

The fact that by sub-section 2 of the exemption section of the Revenue act, church property only is exempt when actually used for public worship, is no argument against this appellant\u2019s view.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b579-8\" pgmap=\"579\">Mr. Consider H.

Among other lands against which judgment was sought was a tract of land, consisting of five acres, belonging to the Presbyterian Theological Seminary of the Northwest. That institution is a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Illinois, and the object, as set forth in the preamble to the act creating the corporation, is to establish an institution for the education of young men for the Christian ministry.</p> <p id=\"b581-4\" pgmap=\"581\">Evidence introduced shows the corporation acquired the tract of land assessed, by deed dated May 1, 1863. The school buildings are situated on another tract of land owned by the corporation, which consists of twenty acres. The deed for the tract assessed contains, among other provisions, one that the buildings of the seminary should be erected on the large tract of land conveyed to it, and should be maintained for the purposes of the institution during a period of twenty-five years, and also a provision that unless the corporation observed the conditions written in the deed, the land should revert to the donors. The two tracts were obtained from different grantors by deeds bearing the same date, and are now separated by Fullerton avenue,\u2014a street, although the width is not stated, may be understood to be of the usual width. Concerning the facts of the case there is no disagreement.</p> <p id=\"ALQ\" pgmap=\"581(117) 582(119)\">Section 3, art. 9, of the constitution, provides that property, both real and personal, used \u201cexclusively\u201d for certain charitable purposes enumerated, may be exempted from taxation. Accordingly the General Assembly has enacted, that among property that shall be exempt from taxation is \u201call property of institutions of learning, including the real estate on which the institutions are located, not leased by such institutions, or otherwise used with a view to profit. \u201d It is under this clause of the statute the objecting corporation seeks exemption from taxation. The act of the General Assembly cited must be read in connection with the section of the constitution on the same subject. It must, therefore, be understood the legislature only intended to exempt such property of institutions of learning as \u201cmay be used exclusively\u201d for the objects and purposes of such institutions. The buildings or \u201cinstitutions \u201d of the corporation are not located on the tract of land assessed. As we have seen, the buildings are situated on a much larger tract, separated from it by a street of the usual width. Nor can it be said the tract assessed is \u201cused exclusively\u201d for the benefit of the seminary. It is fenced all around, but according to this record it does not appear to be used for any purpose. It is not even leased, so as to make it a source of income to the institution.</p> <p id=\"b582-4\" pgmap=\"582\">It is to be observed the real estate belonging to institutions of learning that shall be exempt from taxation is limited by the express .terms of the statute to that upon which the \u201cinstitutions are located, \u201d and it is not within the province of the courts, by construction, to declare that other property shall be exempt. The General Assembly could rightfully exempt only such property as \u201cmay be used exclusively\u201d for the purposes of institutions of learning. It is not to be understood the act of the General Assembly on this subject is broader in its scope than the constitution itself.</p> <p id=\"b582-5\" pgmap=\"582\">As the \u201cinstitutions\u201d of the corporation defending are not \u2022located on the tract of land assessed, and as it does not appear, from anything in the record, it is \u201cused exclusively\u201d for the interests of an \u201cinstitution of learning, \u201d it is subject to taxation as other property of the citizen, or that of a private corporation.</p> <p id=\"b582-6\" pgmap=\"582\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b582-7\" pgmap=\"582\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b582-8\" pgmap=\"582\">Mr. Chief Justice Craig, Mr. Justice Dickey, and Mr. Justice Sheldon, dissent.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
