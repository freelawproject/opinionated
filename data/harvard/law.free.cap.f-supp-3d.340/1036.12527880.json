The first is the interpretation suggested by Monterey, that \"without the consent of all parties to the communication\" modifies both \"intercepts or receives\" and \"intentionally records.\" (ECF No. 100-1 at 16) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20632.7\">\n    Cal.

Under this interpretation, a party who receives a communication with the consent of the communicator and records that communication without the communicator's consent does not violate \u00a7 632.7.

Bill No. 2465 (1992), at 1. At the time \u00a7 632.7 was being debated, a party to a call conducted on a landline violated \u00a7 632 by recording that call.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20632\">\n    Cal.

However, the FAC does not allege facts showing that Brinkley would not have made the calls that Monterey recorded, or would have ended those calls sooner, if Monterey had not recorded the calls, or if Monterey had informed Brinkley that the calls were being recorded.

Monterey contends that, even if the FAC adequately alleged a real and immediate risk of Monterey disseminating a recording, that would not give Brinkley standing to pursue her claims for injunctive relief because \"the violation alleged by Brinkley is\n   <em>\n    unconsented recording\n   </em>\n   , not dissemination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"To establish standing to pursue injunctive relief, a plaintiff must allege a 'real and immediate threat of repeated injury' in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Chapman v.
