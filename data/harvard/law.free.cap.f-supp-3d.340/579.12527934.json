Health-insurance policy is therefore a politically charged affair-inflaming emotions and testing civility. But Article III courts, the Supreme Court has confirmed, are not tasked with, nor are they suited to, policymaking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, courts resolve discrete cases and controversies. And sometimes, a court must determine whether the Constitution grants Congress the power it asserts and what results if it does not. If a party shows that a policymaker exceeded the authority granted it by the Constitution, the fruit of that unauthorized action cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Here, the Plaintiffs allege that, following passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), the Individual Mandate in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) is unconstitutional. They say it is no longer fairly readable as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power and continues to be unsustainable under the Interstate Commerce Clause. They further urge that, if they are correct, the balance of the ACA is untenable as inseverable from the Invalid Mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Resolution of these claims rests at the intersection of the ACA, the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   , and the TCJA. In\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held the Individual Mandate was unconstitutional under the Interstate Commerce Clause but could fairly be read as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power because it triggered a tax. The TCJA eliminated that tax. The Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   -buttressed by other binding precedent and plain text-thus compels the conclusion that the Individual Mandate may no longer be upheld under the Tax Power. And because the Individual Mandate continues to mandate the purchase of health insurance, it remains unsustainable under the Interstate Commerce Clause-as the Supreme Court already held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Finally, Congress stated many times unequivocally-through enacted text signed by the President-that the Individual Mandate is \"essential\" to the ACA. And this essentiality, the ACA's text makes clear, means the mandate must work \"together with the other provisions\" for the Act to function as intended. All nine Justices to review the ACA acknowledged this text and Congress's manifest intent to establish the Individual Mandate as the ACA's \"essential\" provision. The current and previous Administrations have recognized that, too. Because rewriting the ACA without its \"essential\" feature is beyond the power of an Article III court, the Court thus adheres to Congress's textually expressed intent and binding Supreme Court precedent to find the Individual\n   Mandate is inseverable from the ACA's remaining provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Construing the Plaintiffs' Application for Preliminary Injunction, (ECF No. 39), as a motion for partial summary judgment, the Court therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' request for an injunction but\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment on Count I of the Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   More than any factual developments, the background to this case involves the nuances of the ACA,\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   , and the TCJA, which the Court traces below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Congress intended the ACA to achieve \"near-universal\" health-insurance coverage and to \"lower health insurance premiums\" through the \"creation of effective health insurance markets\" and new statutory requirements for individuals and insurance companies.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2018091\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(D), (2)(F), and (2)(I). It pursued these goals through a carefully balanced restructuring of the Nation's health-insurance ecosystem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For starters, the ACA established a \"[r]equirement to maintain minimum essential coverage\"-commonly known as the \"Individual Mandate.\" 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(a). To compel compliance with the Individual Mandate, Congress imposed a tax penalty on individuals who were subject to the requirement but chose to disobey it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2018091\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5000A(b).

Hospitals lose those reimbursements; but they benefit from the decrease in uncompensated care, for under the insurance regulations it is easier for individuals with pre-existing conditions to purchase coverage that increases payments to hospitals. Insurance companies bear new costs imposed by a collection of insurance regulations and taxes, including \"guaranteed issue\" and \"community rating\" requirements to give coverage regardless of the insured's pre-existing conditions; but the insurers benefit from the new, healthy purchasers who are forced by the Individual Mandate to buy the insurers' product and from the new low-income Medicaid recipients who will enroll in insurance companies' Medicaid-funded managed care programs.

Accordingly, Section 5000A's\n   <em>\n    individual mandate\n   </em>\n   is unconstitutional.\" (emphasis added) ). The Court cannot ignore that the Individual Mandate, \u00a7 5000A(a), is separate and distinct from the shared-responsibility penalty, \u00a7 5000A(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Other ACA text and functionality demand \u00a7\u00a7 5000A(a) and (b) not be lumped together, too. Most obviously, Congress exempted some individuals from the shared-responsibility penalty\n   <em>\n    but not the Individual Mandate. See\n   </em>\n   26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(e).

As the Plaintiffs argue, those \"findings identify the individual mandate itself-'[t]he\n   <em>\n    requirement\n   </em>\n   ' to purchase health insurance\"-while \"making no mention of the separate tax penalty that attaches to some individuals' failure to comply with the mandate.\" Pls.' Br. 8-9, ECF No. 40 (citation omitted) (emphasis in Plaintiffs' Brief). The Court agrees the findings highlight that Congress believed that, \"if there were no\n   <em>\n    requirement\n   </em>\n   \"-i.e., no Individual Mandate-\"many individuals would wait to purchase health insurance until they needed care.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2018091\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(I) (emphasis added).

The 2017 Congress solidified that intent. Section 11081 of the TCJA is entitled \"Elimination of shared responsibility payment for individuals failing to maintain minimum essential coverage.\" TCJA \u00a7 11081. This section amends\n   26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(c) -the provision setting the amount of the shared-responsibility penalty,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2018091\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5000A(b) -to \"[e]liminat[e]\" the existing payment and replace it with \"Zero percent\" and \"$0.\" TCJA \u00a7 11081(a). It does not eliminate the Individual Mandate. So, just as the 2010 Congress subjected\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   individuals to the Individual Mandate but no shared-responsibility payment, the 2017 Congress subjected\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   applicable individuals to the Individual Mandate but no shared-responsibility payment. Congress never intended the two things to be one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As described below, the Supreme Court's Tax Power analysis in\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   proceeded along these lines-recognizing the Individual Mandate as separate and distinct from the shared-responsibility penalty. This distinction is critical to the Court's remaining legal analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    b.

To the extent the Supreme Court held \u00a7 5000A could be fairly read as a tax, it reasoned only that the Individual Mandate could be viewed as part and parcel of a provision supported by the Tax Power-not that the Individual Mandate\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   was a tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Supreme Court stated its \"precedent demonstrate[d] that Congress had the power to impose the\n   <em>\n    exaction\n   </em>\n   in \u00a7 5000A under the taxing power\"-and \u00a7 5000A(b) is the exaction-\"and that \u00a7 5000A need not be read to do more than impose a tax.

In other words, it was only because of the totally distinct shared-responsibility payment, or exaction, that the Supreme Court could construe \u00a7 5000A as a tax provision. As the Government argued at the time, and as Chief Justice Roberts recognized, that meant \"the mandate [could] be regarded as establishing a condition-not owning health insurance-that\n   <em>\n    triggers a tax\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 563,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Roberts, C.J.) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Put plainly, because Congress had the power to enact the shared-responsibility exaction, \u00a7 5000A(b), under the Tax Power, it was fairly possible to read the Individual Mandate, \u00a7 5000A(a), as a functional part of that tax also enacted under Congress's Tax Power. Therefore, \u00a7 5000A\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   could be viewed as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The majority's analysis compels this conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its very first breath under Part III-C, the majority reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   The exaction the Affordable Care Act imposes on those without health insurance looks like a tax in many respects. The \"[s]hared responsibility payment,\" as the statute entitles it, is paid into the Treasury by \"taxpayer[s]\" when they file their tax returns. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(b). It does not apply to individuals who do not pay federal income taxes because their household income is less than the filing threshold in the Internal Revenue Code. \u00a7 5000A(e)(2). For taxpayers who do owe the payment, its amount is determined by such familiar factors as taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing status. \u00a7\u00a7 5000A(b)(3), (c)(2), (c)(4). The requirement to pay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by the IRS, which-as we previously explained-must\n   assess and collect it \"in the same manner as taxes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   , 567 U.S. at 563-64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (majority) (final citation to ACA omitted).

In other words, to the extent the majority construed the Individual Mandate as something other than a standalone mandate, it did so only because it was possible to construe the provision as triggering a tax. That \"fundamental construct,\" as the Intervenor Defendants call it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 66:15, was just that-a construct. And in light of this Court's finding on the Tax Power today, the construct no longer holds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   But even under the\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   construct, the Individual Mandate created an obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the majority noted, \"the individual mandate clearly aims to induce the purchase of health insurance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   , 567 U.S. at 567,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (majority).

But this means the Individual Mandate is no more optional than the tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   If an individual can satisfy the law only by satisfying either Condition 1 (the Individual Mandate) or Condition 2 (the tax), then both conditions are equally optional and mandatory. To state it differently, under the\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   construct, failing Condition 1 no more triggers Condition 2 than failing Condition 2 triggers Condition 1. So, an individual who disobeys the Individual Mandate can satisfy the law only by paying a tax, but an individual who disregards the tax can satisfy the law only by obeying the Individual Mandate. And only in a world where the Individual Mandate were truly non-binding could an individual disobey the Individual Mandate and forego the tax. But under the\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   majority's construct, that is not the case. That is because logic demands that the Individual Mandate was never-pardon the oxymoron-a non-binding law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The remainder of the ACA proves that, too. As noted above, \u00a7 5000A(e), did and still does exempt some individuals from the eliminated shared-responsibility payment\n   but not the Individual Mandate-\"a distinction that would make no sense if the mandate were not a mandate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 665,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (joint dissent). What is more, Congress exempted, and continues to exempt, certain individuals from the Individual Mandate itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(d)(1). Why would Congress exempt individuals from a mandate that is not mandatory To ask is to answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   At least five Justices agreed the Individual Mandate reads more naturally as a command to buy health insurance than as a tax,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   and those five Justices agreed the mandate could not pass muster under the Interstate Commerce Clause. Given that the Individual Mandate no longer \"triggers a tax,\" the Court finds the Individual Mandate now serves as a standalone command that continues to be unconstitutional under the Interstate Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Court today finds the Individual Mandate is no longer fairly readable as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power and continues to be unsustainable under Congress's Interstate Commerce Power. The Court therefore finds the Individual Mandate, unmoored from a tax, is unconstitutional and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory relief as to Count I of the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Intervenor Defendants' argument that the 2017 Congress manifested an intent of severability is therefore unavailing. Indeed, one would have to take the incorrect view that the shared-responsibility payment\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   the Individual Mandate to accept the argument that the 2017 Congress, by eliminating the\n   <em>\n    payment\n   </em>\n   , intended to sever the\n   <em>\n    Individual Mandate\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Secondly, the 2017 Congress did not repeal\n   <extracted-citation index=\"355\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2018091\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which every Supreme Court Justice to review the ACA cited and which definitively establishes Congress's intent that the Individual Mandate be \"an essential part of\" its \"regulation of the health insurance market.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"356\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2018091\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(H) ;\n   <em>\n    see generally supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.C.1.a.

Plus, the TCJA repeals nothing \"by implication.\" And at any rate,\n    <em>\n     Frost\n    </em>\n    is not a license for courts to reach out and hold unchallenged constitutional acts unconstitutional as a remedial safety valve.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Josh Blackman,\n    <em>\n     Undone: the New Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare\n    </em>\n    , 23 Tex.

United States\n    </em>\n    for a simple reason. Because of how Texas structured its challenge, the district court is presented with a narrower menu of options with respect to severability. No one-not the Plaintiffs, not the Intervenors-has challenged the constitutionality of the TCJA. Federal courts lack a roving license to flip through the U.S. Code with a red pencil to void one statute in order to save another. Invalidating the 2017 tax cut is simply not an option in the Texas litigation because it has not been challenged.\" (citations omitted) ). To the extent\n    <em>\n     Frost\n    </em>\n    is relevant here, it stands only for the proposition that a court should hold unconstitutional acts invalid and constitutional ones valid. The unconstitutional act in this case is the Individual Mandate, not the TCJA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
