S\u00e1nchez, C.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this declaratory judgment action, Plaintiff Nautilus Insurance Company seeks a declaration that it has no duty to defend or indemnify Bike &amp; Build, Inc., to which Nautilus issued a commercial general liability policy, in connection with a lawsuit filed against Bike &amp; Build by Bridget Anderson. Defendant/Crossclaimant United Specialty Insurance Company, Bike &amp; Build's excess insurer, seeks similar relief. Bike &amp; Build seeks the opposite: a declaration that both insurers are required to defend and indemnify it in the underlying lawsuit and to provide coverage for Anderson's claims. All parties have moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts giving rise to the underlying lawsuit are undeniably tragic. In that lawsuit, Anderson seeks damages for serious injuries she sustained when she was struck by a car while participating in a cross-country charity bike trip organized by Bike &amp; Build. The other rider who was struck along with Anderson was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident. Anderson alleges Bike &amp; Build was negligent and grossly negligent in the planning, operation, and execution of the bike ride, including the selection of the route for the ride, which Anderson contends exposed riders to an unreasonable risk of harm from passing vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The coverage issues in this case turn on the applicability of certain exclusions in the Nautilus and United Specialty insurance policies. Because the Court finds two of those exclusions-the Auto Exclusion in the Nautilus Policy and the Athletic or Sports Participants Exclusion in the United Specialty Policy-unambiguously preclude coverage for the claims in the underlying lawsuit, summary judgment will be granted in favor of Nautilus and United Specialty. Bike &amp; Build's motion for summary judgment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bike &amp; Build is a nonprofit corporation whose core mission is to benefit affordable housing and empower young adults for a lifetime of service and civic engagement through service-oriented cycling trips.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nautilus Ex.

Nautilus Ex. G (hereinafter \"Anderson Dep.\") 41-42, 44, 64. Anderson had applied to participate in the trip seven months earlier in November 2014,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 64, and in the months leading up to the June departure date, she engaged in fundraising to support the trip, ultimately raising approximately $9,200 in charitable donations for affordable housing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 30, 2015, while riding through the State of Oklahoma on Oklahoma State Highway 152 as part of the ME2SB trip, Anderson and another rider were struck by a motor vehicle driven by Sarah Morris.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 45, 58, 60, 66-67. The collision catapulted Anderson from her bicycle into the air and threw her approximately 156 feet, causing her to sustain serious injuries, including open knee dislocation and vascular injury to the left knee, grossly contaminated wound secondary to vascular injury, lateral condyle fracture, popliteal vascular injury, left foot metatarsal fracture, and L-3 spine fracture. Bike &amp; Build Ex. G (hereinafter \"Underlying Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 15, 22; Anderson Dep. 61-62. Anderson has undergone at least eleven surgeries for her injuries to date. Anderson Dep. 61. The other rider who was struck along with Anderson was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident as a result of his injuries. Underlying\n   Compl. \u00b6 16. Morris was not affiliated in any way with Bike &amp; Build, and Bike &amp; Build had no ownership interest in the vehicle Morris was driving at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 31, 2015, the day after the accident, Bike &amp; Build notified its general liability carrier, Nautilus, of the accident. Villere Dep. 284; Bike &amp; Build Ex. L. A few weeks later, on August 17, 2015, Nautilus sent a reservation of rights (ROR) letter to Bike &amp; Build, advising that Nautilus was investigating the matter to determine whether the commercial general liability policy it issued to Bike &amp; Build (the Nautilus Policy) provided coverage for Anderson's injuries or the other rider's death as a result of the accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Nautilus Policy includes the following grant of coverage for bodily injury and property damage liability, referred to in the Policy as \"Coverage A\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   We will pay those sums that the insured [i.e., Bike &amp; Build] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking damages for \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance does not apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Bike &amp; Build Ex. D at BIKE0001464. The Policy specifies the insurance provided by Coverage A applies to bodily injury if the bodily injury (1) \"is caused by an 'occurrence,' \" i.e., an accident, \"that takes place in the 'coverage territory,' \" which includes the United States; (2) \"occurs during the policy period,\" i.e., May 7, 2015, to May 7, 2016; and (3) was not known by the insured to have occurred before the policy period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at BIKE0001464;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at BIKE0001451, 0001475, 0001477. The insurance provided in Coverage A is subject to numerous exclusions, some of which are set forth in the body of the form Policy and some of which are set forth in separate endorsements appended to the form Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the August 17, 2015, ROR letter, Nautilus noted that although Anderson and the other rider appeared to have suffered \"bodily injury\" caused by an \"occurrence,\" as required to trigger the Policy's bodily injury liability coverage, there were certain endorsements to the Policy that might restrict coverage for the riders' injuries and damages. Bike &amp; Build Ex. M; Nautilus Response Ex. C. In the signed version of the letter, Nautilus identified two specific endorsements that could result in a denial of coverage: (1) an endorsement captioned \"EXCLUSION - INJURY TO EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, VOLUNTEERS AND WORKERS\" (the Volunteer Worker Exclusion), and (2) an endorsement captioned \"EXCLUSION - PARTICIPANTS\" (the Participant Exclusion). Nautilus Resp. Ex. C. The unsigned version of the letter identified the Volunteer Worker and Participant Exclusions as well as a third endorsement, captioned \"EXCLUSION - AIRCRAFT, AUTO OR WATERCRAFT\" (the Auto Exclusion), which could result in a denial of coverage. Bike &amp; Build Ex. M. On September\n   11, 2015, Nautilus sent a revised ROR letter to Bike &amp; Build. Nautilus Resp. Ex. D. The revised ROR letter mentioned all three of the endorsements that Nautilus believed could result in a denial of coverage, and included an expanded discussion of the Auto Exclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The revised ROR letter differed from the initial ROR letter primarily with respect to the discussion of the Auto Exclusion, which was either new altogether or expanded, depending on which version of the August 17, 2015, ROR letter was sent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 16, 2015, Nautilus sent a disclaimer letter to Bike &amp; Build, setting forth its position that the Nautilus Policy did not provide coverage for claims by Anderson relating to the accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nautilus Resp. Ex. E. The disclaimer letter again cited the Auto, Volunteer Worker, and Participant Exclusions, advising that all three Exclusions precluded coverage for claims by Anderson.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In June 2016, Anderson filed a complaint against Bike &amp; Build in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, seeking damages for the injuries she sustained during the ME2SB trip (the Underlying Action). The complaint in the Underlying Action alleged that while riding her bicycle on a narrow highway in Oklahoma as part of the ME2SB ride, on a route that had been planned, set up, and supervised by Bike &amp; Build, Anderson was struck by a vehicle driven by Morris, causing her to sustain multiple serious injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Underlying Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8, 11-15, 22, 24. The complaint further alleged Bike &amp; Build was negligent and grossly negligent with respect to the planning, operation, and execution of the ME2SB trip, including the selection of a dangerous route for the trip, and that Bike &amp; Build's negligence was the cause of Anderson's injuries.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After receiving Anderson's complaint, Nautilus sent additional disclaimer letters to Bike &amp; Build on June 6, 2016, and July 1, 2016, notifying Bike &amp; Build it would not be providing defense or indemnification for the Underlying Action based on the same three exclusions previously invoked. Nautilus Resp. Exs. F &amp; G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In September 2016, Nautilus commenced this declaratory judgment action against Bike &amp; Build, seeking a declaration that it has no obligation to defend or indemnify Bike &amp; Build in connection with the Underlying Action or to provide coverage for claims arising out of the accident in which Anderson was injured because coverage is precluded under the Auto, Volunteer Worker, and Participant Exclusions in the Nautilus Policy. Nautilus also named Anderson and United Specialty Insurance Company (Bike &amp; Build's excess insurer) as Defendants. United Specialty, in turn, asserted a crossclaim against Bike &amp; Build, seeking a declaration that it has no obligation to defend or indemnify Bike &amp; Build for the Underlying Action under the commercial excess liability policy it issued to Bike &amp; Build (the United Specialty Policy), which follows form to the\n   controlling underlying Nautilus Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Bike &amp; Build asserted a counterclaim against Nautilus and a crossclaim against United Specialty, seeking a declaration that both insurers are obligated to defend and indemnify Bike &amp; Build in connection with the Underlying Action and to provide coverage for claims arising out of the accident in which Anderson was injured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 29, 2016, while this action was pending, Anderson and Bike &amp; Build entered into a Settlement Agreement in the Underlying Action. Under the terms of the Agreement, Bike &amp; Build assigned to Anderson all claims and causes of action it had against Nautilus, United Specialty, or its insurance broker, and the parties agreed to enter into a consent judgment in the amount of $10 million to be filed in the Underlying Action. Bike &amp; Build Ex. I \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4. The parties further agreed that the proceeds from any action or lawsuit against Nautilus, United Specialty, or Bike &amp; Build's insurance broker would be the sole recourse available to Anderson for her claims in the Underlying Action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Anderson's counsel assumed representation of Bike &amp; Build in this action in February 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following discovery, Nautilus, United Specialty, and Bike &amp; Build each moved for summary judgment. Nautilus and United Specialty argue summary judgment is warranted because the claims asserted in the Underlying Action fall entirely within the scope of the Nautilus Policy's Auto, Volunteer Worker, and/or Participant Exclusions. United Specialty also argues the claims in the Underlying Action fall entirely within the scope of the Employee and Athletic or Sports Participants Exclusions in the United Specialty Policy. Bike &amp; Build argues it is entitled to a defense and indemnity under the Nautilus and United Specialty Policies because Underlying Action seeks damages for bodily injury caused by an occurrence, and none of the policy exclusions on which Nautilus and United Specialty rely unambiguously excludes coverage for the claims in the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Summary judgment shall be granted \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Whereas the version of the exclusion in the form Policy precludes coverage for \" 'bodily injury' ... arising out of the ... use ... of any ... 'auto' \" only if the auto in question was \"owned or operated by or rented or loaned to\" the insured, the operative Auto Exclusion in the endorsement precludes coverage for \" 'bodily injury' ... arising out of the ... use ... of any ... 'auto.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nautilus argues the Auto Exclusion unambiguously precludes coverage for bodily injury arising out of the use or operation of any motor vehicle, even if the vehicle was neither owned nor operated by insured at the time of the accident. Thus, in Nautilus's view, the Auto Exclusion precludes coverage for Anderson's claims against Bike &amp; Build in the Underlying Action because those claims seek damages for bodily injury Anderson sustained when she was struck by the motor vehicle Morris was using and operating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Bike &amp; Build argues Nautilus should be estopped from arguing the Auto Exclusion precludes coverage for the Underlying Action because Nautilus previously took the position, in the initial ROR letter it sent to Bike &amp; Build, that the Exclusion would apply only if the bicycle Anderson was riding at the time of the accident was considered an \"auto\" under Oklahoma law. Bike &amp; Build maintains that by suggesting the applicability of the Auto Exclusion was dependent upon the equipment being used by Anderson, Nautilus conceded the fact that a third party involved in the accident was using a motor vehicle was irrelevant, and should not now be permitted to argue to the contrary. Bike &amp; Build also disputes Nautilus's interpretation of the Auto Exclusion, arguing (1) adopting Nautilus's broad construction would defeat Bike &amp; Build's reasonable expectation that the Auto Exclusion would apply only to Bike &amp; Build's own use, operation, or entrustment of a motor vehicle, and (2) at a minimum, the Auto Exclusion is ambiguous as to whether it applies only to Bike &amp; Build's own use, operation, or entrustment of a motor vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Bike &amp; Build's estoppel argument is meritless. Nautilus's initial ROR letter was sent on August 17, 2015, more than nine months before Anderson filed the Underlying Action, and the letter advised Bike &amp; Build that Nautilus was conducting an investigation\n   of the matter and \"d[id] not intend to waive its rights or conditions under the [P]olicy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bike &amp; Build Ex. M at NAUT 00214. While Nautilus's current position regarding the Auto Exclusion was not reflected in the initial ROR letter, Nautilus sent an amended ROR letter to Bike &amp; Build less than a month later, on September 11, 2015, advising that the Auto Exclusion might preclude coverage for Anderson's injuries because, inter alia, \"[t]he subject incident involved an 'auto' that was operated by Sarah Morris which hit ... Ms. Anderson, which may constitute ownership or use of any 'auto.' \" Nautilus Resp. Ex. D at BIKE0002748. This coverage position is also reflected in Nautilus's October 16, 2015, disclaimer letter advising Bike &amp; Build there was \"no coverage for Ms. Anderson's claims\" under the Auto Exclusion since those claims \"arose out of use of an 'auto.' \" Nautilus Resp.

The Court disagrees that defining \"work\" broadly to include any activity in which a person exerts strength or faculties to do or perform something is appropriate here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Given the context in which the term \"volunteer worker\" is used in the Nautilus Policy-as one of the types of workers, in addition to employees, for whom the Policy does not provide coverage for bodily injury claims-the definition of a volunteer worker as a person who is not an employee of the insured, but who \"donates his or her work and acts at the direction of and within the scope of duties determined by [the insured],\" can reasonably be understood to refer to a person who, while not an employee, stands in the shoes of an employee or otherwise has an employment-like relationship, albeit unpaid, with the insured.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pupello v.

Apr. 23, 2008) (interpreting a policy exclusion for bodily injury to \"employees,\" a term defined to include \"any member, associate, leased worker, temporary worker or any person or persons loaned to or volunteering services to [the insured],\" to \"contemplate[ ] the exclusion of persons who served in an employment or at least employment-like relationship with the insured\"). Consistent with this understanding, and with the aspect of the dictionary definition that ties \"work\" to the employment context, the term \"work\" within the definition of a volunteer worker can reasonably be understood to refer to activity of a type that would be performed by the insured's employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Applying this definition, the Court is not persuaded that Anderson donated her \"work\" to Bike &amp; Build through her participation in the ME2SB ride. In arguing the complaint in the Underlying Action establishes that Anderson was donating her work to Bike &amp; Build by biking and fundraising in connection with the ME2SB trip, Nautilus relies on the complaint's allegations that Anderson was a \"volunteer rider\" on the ME2SB \"charity ride\" arranged by Bike &amp; Build as part of its business \"arrang[ing] cross-country bicycle rides where participants raise money for charitable causes.\" Underlying Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Nautilus Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 6-7; Nautilus Opp'n 12-13. Contrary to Nautilus's assertion, however, these allegations make clear that Anderson was not donating her work to Bike &amp; Build by participating in the ME2SB ride. While the complaint alleges Bike &amp; Build's business is \"arrang[ing] cross-country bicycle rides,\" Underlying Compl. \u00b6 2, it does not allege Anderson had any involvement in organizing the ME2SB trip. Nor is Anderson alleged to have played any role in leading the trip. Rather, the complaint characterizes Anderson as a participant (or rider) in a trip \"planned, set up and supervised\" by Bike &amp; Build.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5, 7-10, 12, 21(c). That the complaint describes Anderson as a \"volunteer rider\" does not make her a \"volunteer worker\" because cycling by participants in the trip (as opposed to trip leaders who direct and supervise the trip) is not part of the business of organizing and managing the trip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Moving beyond the allegations of the complaint in the Underlying Action, Nautilus argues the undisputed facts show Anderson was donating her work by biking on the ME2SB trip because she was serving as a representative of Bike &amp; Build by wearing the required Bike &amp; Build jersey while riding her bike and because she had been assigned by Bike &amp; Build to ride in the sweep position on the day of the accident. While having riders on the road in Bike &amp; Build jerseys may have furthered Bike &amp; Build's mission to raise awareness of affordable housing, neither the fact that Anderson was part of a group visibly associated with Bike &amp; Build nor the fact that she was expected to perform chores while on trip, including serving as a sweep rider on a rotational basis, is not enough to change the nature of her role from that of participant in a ride organized by Bike &amp; Build to that of worker for Bike &amp; Build. The same is true of Anderson's fundraising activity. As a prospective rider, Anderson had to raise money to fund her participation in the trip. However, she did not thereby become a worker for Bike &amp; Build.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Anderson was not donating her work to Bike &amp; Build by biking and fundraising as part of the ME2SB trip, and was therefore not a volunteer\n   worker for Bike &amp; Build, the Court concludes the Volunteer Worker Exclusion in the Nautilus Policy is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   While the United Specialty Policy follows form to the underlying Nautilus Policy and is subject to any exclusions in that Policy, the United Specialty Policy also includes a separate Employee Exclusion, which precludes coverage for\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   \"Injury or damage\" to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (1) An \"employee\" of the insured arising out of and in the course of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (a) Employment by the insured; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (b) Performing the duties related to the conduct of the insured's business....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   United Specialty Ex.

Elsewhere in the Policy, the term \"employee\" is defined to include \"a leased worker, a temporary worker and a volunteer worker.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at USIC000029.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Although the term \"volunteer worker\" is not specifically defined in the United Specialty Policy, the Court's conclusion that Anderson was not a worker for Bike &amp; Build for purposes of the Nautilus Policy applies equally to the United Specialty Policy. Hence, the Court also concludes the Employee Exclusion in the United Specialty Policy does not preclude coverage for the claims in the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Participant/Athletic or Sports Participants Exclusions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Participant Exclusion in the Nautilus Policy precludes coverage for bodily injury to \"participants\" in certain types of athletic, sports, or entertainment \"events\" managed, operated, or sponsored by the insured. Specifically, the Participant Exclusion provides that the Policy's bodily injury liability coverage \"does not apply to 'bodily injury' or medical payments to any 'participant' while in the 'activity area.' \" Bike &amp; Build Ex. D at BIKE0001513. For purposes of this Exclusion, the terms \"activity area,\" \"event,\" \"limited duration,\" and \"participant\" are defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   \"Activity area\" means any site specifically set aside for the purpose of preparing for, participation in, or assembly before, during or after, any \"event\" including, but not limited to, the arena, chute, corral, course, field, infield, pit, ring, sideline, stage, or track.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   \"Event\" means any activity of an athletic or sports, or entertainment nature of \"limited duration\" that you manage, operate, or sponsor including, but not limited to, a carnival, circus, concert, contest, demonstration, exhibition, fair, game, match, parade, race, rodeo, show, stunting activity, or theatrical performance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n   \"Limited duration\" means a time period that can be established by a beginning and ending date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n   </strong>\n   \"Participant\" means any person practicing, preparing or rehearsing for, instructing, participating or sparring in, any \"event\" including, but not limited to, animal handlers, announcers, assistants, attendants, coaches, cheerleaders, clowns, contestants, \"employees\", entertainers, independent contractors, mechanics, musicians, officials, operators, producers, promoters, referees, singers, speakers, sponsors, stage crews, stock contractors, \"temporary workers\", vendors or their \"employees\", \"volunteer workers\", or workers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869364\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/844/6869364/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Bike &amp; Build argues the Participant Exclusion is inapplicable here because the stretch of highway where Anderson was injured was not an \"activity area\" within the meaning of the Policy. Bike &amp; Build contends the list of examples\n   of sites that may constitute an activity area within the definition of the term \"activity area\" shows that an activity area must be a \"definitively confined space[ ] that can be controlled by the insured for the insured's exclusive use,\" such as an arena or concert hall, and cannot be interpreted to include an \"expansive geographical area\" like the cross-country route for the ME2SB ride. Bike &amp; Build's Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 25-26. Bike &amp; Build also relies on the definition of the term \"event,\" noting the examples of the types of activities that may constitute an event are activities \"that are confined within a specifically 'set aside' space for the sole and exclusive use of the insured and its guests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Nautilus disputes that the term \"activity area\" is limited in the manner suggested by Bike &amp; Build, noting the list of sites that can be an \"activity area\" is non-exclusive and includes sites like a course or a field, which may not be \"definitively confined spaces that can be controlled by the insured.\" In Nautilus's view, the site of the accident in this case was an \"activity area\" because it was on the route for the ME2SB ride, which was \"mapped out and planned, created, set up and supervised by Bike &amp; Build.\" Nautilus Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 8,\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (noting the route selected by Bike &amp; Build \"was mapped out on cue sheets that identified the specific roads and distances for the particular day\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Insofar as Bike &amp; Build argues the term \"activity area\" is limited to \"definitively confined spaces,\" this interpretation appears to be overly restrictive. Under the definitions set forth in the Participant Exclusion, a course may constitute an activity area if it is specifically set aside for an event such as a race. Because a race course may constitute an activity area, it is unlikely that the term \"activity area\" is limited \"definitively confined spaces.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court agrees with Bike &amp; Build that the phrase \"specifically set aside\" in the definition of an \"activity area\" is ambiguous. While Bike &amp; Build argues the term \"set aside\" means something akin to selected or designated, this term can also reasonably be interpreted to require that the area be under the insured's control or reserved for the insured's use.\n   <em>\n    See Set aside\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/set% 20aside (last visited Oct. 17, 2018) (defining the phrase \"set aside\" to mean \"to put to one side\" or \"to reserve for a purpose\"). Under this interpretation, even the course for a race taking place over an \"expansive geographical area\" could constitute an \"activity area\" if, for example, the course were reserved for use by race participants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Although the complaint in the Underlying Action alleges that at the time of the accident, Anderson was \"traveling on a route that had been planned, set up and supervised by ... Bike &amp; Build,\" Underlying Compl. \u00b6 12, nothing in the complaint or the record in this case suggests the route was \"specifically set aside\" for participants in the ME2SB ride. On the contrary, the complaint faults Bike &amp; Build for, inter alia, requiring its riders to travel along an open highway in close proximity to vehicles traveling at high speeds and for not closing portions of the highway during the ride.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21(h), (i), (l)-(n), (p)-(r);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9 (alleging that before the riders on the ME2SB trip set out on the morning of the accident, Bike &amp; Build supervisors emphasized that the day's route \"would be a dangerous ride, as the shoulder of the road was very narrow and the cars would be traveling at high speeds, sometimes only inches away from their bicycles\"). Construing the ambiguity in the\n   definition of an \"activity area\" in favor of Bike &amp; Build, the insured in this case, and construing the Participant Exclusion strictly against Nautilus, the Court finds the Participant Exclusion does not preclude coverage for the claims in the Underlying Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The United Specialty Policy contains a similar exclusion for \"Athletic or Sports Participants,\" which precludes coverage for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   \"Injury or damage\" to any person while practicing for; promoting, participating in; observing or officiating at:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   a. Any sports or athletic contest; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   b. Any athletic endeavor; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   c. Any sports or athletic exhibition;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   whether:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   d.

You are not a sponsor but you or your \"employees\" are guests are participants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   United Specialty Ex. G at USIC000026.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The applicability of this Athletic or Sports Participants Exclusion turns on whether the ME2SB ride was an \"athletic endeavor\" within the meaning of the United Specialty Policy. The remaining requirements for the Exclusion are clearly satisfied here, as Anderson was injured while participating in the ME2SB ride, and Bike &amp; Build sponsored the ME2SB by, inter alia, \"assist[ing] in the planning, promotion, or execution\" of the ride.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Underlying Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7, 12 (alleging Bike &amp; Build was responsible for creating, planning, setting up, and supervising the route for the ME2SB trip, which \"was mapped out and planned from Bike &amp; Build's headquarters in Philadelphia\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19 (alleging that while participating in the ME2SB trip, Anderson was at all times \"under the direction and supervision of ... Bike &amp; Build\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Bike &amp; Build argues the term \"athletic endeavor\" is ambiguous and can reasonably be interpreted as a competition. Under this interpretation, the ME2SB ride would not qualify as an \"athletic endeavor\" because it was not a race but a ride in which riders could travel at their own pace, stop to eat at restaurants along the route, and ride in the passenger van.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Court disagrees. The Athletic or Sports Participants Exclusion applies when a person is injured while participating in one of three categories of events: (a) \"[a]ny sports or athletic contest,\" (b) \"[a]ny athletic endeavor,\" or (c) \"[a]ny sports or athletic exhibition.\" USIC000026. Injuries sustained while participating in an athletic competition would fall within the first of these categories-\"[a]ny sports or athletic contest\"-as a contest is, in essence, a competition.\n   <em>\n    See Contest\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contest (last visited Oct. 17, 2018). Hence, the term \"athletic endeavor\" cannot reasonably be interpreted to mean athletic competition, as such an interpretation would render the second category of events redundant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

And while the term \"athletic endeavor\" is not defined in the United Specialty Policy, the\n   Court agrees with United Specialty that a 3,987-mile cross-country bike ride qualifies as such an endeavor under any reasonable definition of the term.\n   <em>\n    See Athletic\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/athletic (last visited Oct. 17, 2018) (defining \"athletic\" as, inter alia, \"vigorous\" or \"active\").

The question was whether coverage for their claims was precluded by policy exclusions for bodily injury to employees and independent contractors of the insured. For purposes of the policy, the term \"employee\" was defined to include leased workers, temporary workers, casual labor, or volunteer workers. Siding with the insurer, the court held coverage was precluded regardless of whether the plaintiffs were properly classified as employees, volunteer workers, or independent contractors as they admittedly were doing work for the insured-i.e., performing floor refinishing-at the time of the accident.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at *4.
