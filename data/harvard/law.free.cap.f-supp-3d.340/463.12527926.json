Habeas Mem. at 15 (citing N.T. 2/22/10 at 16). This did not demonstrate bias because the court cut off a line of irrelevant inquiry and focused counsel's questions on relevant issues.\n   <em>\n    Van Arsdall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207521\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/673/#p684\">\n    475 U.S. at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207521\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/673/#p684\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Later in the cross-examination of Lewis, Bass claims the court further interrupted defense counsel and spoke to him \"in a demeaning manner.\" Habeas Mem. at 15. The record, however, shows the court sustained a valid hearsay objection, allowed the same question to go forward in a non-hearsay form, assisted defense counsel when he misspoke, and then assisted defense counsel again when Officer Lewis failed to answer his question. N.T. 2/22/10 at 21-23, 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Bass next contends that, during Officer Fox's testimony, the court was respectful to the prosecution, \"acting as Commonwealth's advocate, explaining evidence,\" but changed tone \"during trial counsel's cross-examination.\" Habeas Mem. at 15 (citing N.T. 2/22/10 at 41, 44, 51-53, 56, 67-68).

Habeas Mem. at 15 (citing N.T. 2/22/10 at 228-30). The transcript shows only that the trial court sustained a valid hearsay objection. N.T. 2/22/10 at 228-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Bass's fourth, fifth, and sixth objections revisit his prior complaints about the court's cross-examination management of Cook, Cassandra, and Sanders.

Habeas Mem. at 16 (citing N.T. 2/25/10 at 69-72). In the pages Bass cites, however, the court merely suggested Gerard's testimony was not strong defense evidence during an off-the-record witness proffer. N.T. 2/25/10 at 70-72. The court did not prevent trial counsel from calling him, and did not interrupt once during his direct or re-direct testimony. N.T. 2/26/10 at 18-23, 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Bass's final claim is that the court called him \"stupid\" for wanting to put a defense before the jury. Habeas Mem. at 15. The trial court did not describe Bass as stupid, but rather \"not unintelligent\" and \"intelligent,\" outside the presence of the jury. N.T. 3/1/10 at 21-22. The court did note that Bass had insisted on pursuing a \"stupid strategy for his defense,\" but this comment was also made outside the jury's presence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (\"it's very clear to all of us that he's hurting himself with these witnesses\"). The colloquy, in which the court questioned Bass's decision to call witnesses against the advice of counsel, was also outside the presence of the jury. N.T. 2/25/10 at 140-52. The court's comments reflect concern for Bass, not disdain or bias.

Counsel, however, requested a\n   <em>\n    Kloiber\n   </em>\n   instruction. N.T. 2/26/10 at 43-44. The court found the charge unwarranted because the only identification was by Cook, who did not equivocate or fail to identify Bass: \"The\n   <em>\n    Kloiber\n   </em>\n   case is not about failing to immediately tell the police the name.... there are no grounds here for the jury to receive [Cook's identification] with caution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.

Nov. 9, 2015) (\"The Court concludes that the interest of justice does not require consideration of the new claims because all such claims could have been presented to the magistrate judge by\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    petitioner, and he failed to do so. Thus, the objections purporting to raise new claims not presented to the magistrate judge are overruled.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The Court agrees with the conclusions of the thorough R &amp; R. Briefly, it was not unreasonable for the state courts to conclude that there was sufficient evidence at trial to establish that Petitioner shot and killed Emine Hadredinaj, who was pregnant, and wounded Kevin Cook, because of a dispute with Cook's sister. Although various witnesses gave conflicting statements before trial, the credibility of the witnesses (including Cook, who identified Petitioner as the shooter) was for the jury to determine. There was also evidence in connection with the arson-related charges that Petitioner had brought a gas can and Molotov cocktails with him to Cook's house. Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the trial court's limiting of certain lines of inquiry as the record shows that trial court directed both the prosecution and defense to keep questioning to relevant matters and refrain from referring to excluded evidence. The R &amp; R also correctly rejected Petitioner's claims that the trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the jury instructions as the claims are unsupported by the record. Nor has Petitioner shown that a witness, Jillian Sanders, was intimidated by the police before testifying; Sanders answered every question asked of her at trial and the only inconsistency in her testimony was the date that Cassandra Cook broke Petitioner's windows. Petitioner also claims that trial counsel should have interviewed Sanders about Petitioner's alibi sooner than he did. However, the record shows that, at trial, Petitioner requested that his investigator testify that Petitioner had raised an alibi defense around the time of his arrest. This was meant to counter the prosecution's argument that Sanders concocted Petitioner's alibi just before testifying. Trial counsel expressed concern over this tactic because the testimony would concede that the investigator was unable to corroborate Petitioner's alibi, even during earlier conversations with Sanders. Thus, the record shows that (1) Sanders was previously interviewed and (2) that she was not able to corroborate Petitioner's alibi claim at that time, which would have been damaging to Petitioner's case. Petitioner agreed with counsel's strategy at the time. As set forth in the R &amp; R, Petitioner has not shown constitutional error regarding any other witnesses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    With regard to issues raised by Petitioner for the first time in his objections to the R &amp; R (including that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to request a \"lesser-included offense\" instruction on the arson charge, failing to submit police statements of two witnesses into evidence, failing to file a motion to suppress evidence obtained from the search of Petitioner's cell phone pursuant to a warrant, failing to object to evidence linking a cell phone number to Petitioner, allowing a witness to invoke her Fifth Amendment right not to testify, and failing to call character witnesses), the Court is not required to consider issues not raised in the Petition itself and Petitioner has not shown that these claims have been exhausted or that the failure to exhaust may be excused.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    There is no basis for concluding that \"reasonable jurists could debate whether...the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\"\n    <em>\n     Slack v.
