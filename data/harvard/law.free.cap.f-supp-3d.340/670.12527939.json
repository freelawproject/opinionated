BOYKO, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes before the Court following Defendant State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Company's (\"State Farm\") Motion to Dismiss with prejudice (ECF DKT # 8) Plaintiff Charles Cranfield's class action lawsuit. (ECF DKT # 1, Ex. 1). For the following reasons, the Court grants this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 22, 2016, Cranfield filed a class action lawsuit alleging one count of Breach of Contract against State Farm with the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. (ECF DKT # 1, Ex. 1). State Farm gave notice of removal to the Northern District of Ohio. (ECF DKT # 1). State Farm then moved the Court to certify a question to the Supreme Court of Ohio clarifying whether Ohio law requires insurers to exclude labor costs from depreciation calculations when determining the actual cash value (\"ACV\") of damaged property. (ECF DKT # 7). State Farm also moved to dismiss the case with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (ECF DKT # 8). Cranfield opposed the Motion to Dismiss (ECF DKT # 10) and the Motion to Certify a Question to the Supreme Court of Ohio. (ECF DKT # 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   State Farm filed replies to both motions. (ECF DKT # 13; ECF DKT # 14). On December 2, 2016, this Court ordered State Farm's question sent to the Supreme Court of Ohio (ECF DKT # 18), and dismissed the case. (ECF DKT # 19). On February 22, 2017, the Supreme Court of Ohio declined to certify the question (ECF DKT # 23, Ex. 1), and Cranfield motioned to reopen the case in federal court. (ECF DKT # 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cranfield's home was damaged by a storm on October 14, 2014 and he submitted a claim to State Farm requesting coverage. (ECF DKT # 1, Ex. 1 at 4). An adjuster inspected the damage and an estimate for repair was sent to Cranfield. (ECF DKT # 1, Ex. 1 at 5). The total estimated cost to repair the damage, the replacement cost value, was $4,044.86. (ECF DKT # 1, Ex. 1 at 14). State Farm calculated the depreciation amount at issue in this case to be $1,348.57. (ECF DKT 1, Ex. 1 at 14). It subtracted this amount and Cranfield's deductible of $1,854.00 from the replacement cost value to arrive at a Net ACV of $842.29, which Cranfield received in two payments. (ECF DKT # 1, Ex. 1 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cranfield's policy had a two-step loss settlement provision which provided that State Farm would pay the ACV at the time of loss. (ECF DKT # 8, Ex.2 at 17) (\"(1) until actual repair or replacement is completed, we will pay only the actual cash value at the time of the loss of the damaged part of the property....\"). Once the repair was completed, State Farm would pay the additional amount that the policy owner actually spent. (ECF DKT # 8, Ex. 2 at 17) (\"(2) when the repair or replacement is actually completed, we will pay the covered additional amount you actually and necessarily spend to repair or replace the damaged part of the property....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Cranfield takes issue with the manner in which State Farm calculated ACV. (ECF DKT # 1, Ex. 1 at 6). He claims that its inclusion of labor along with materials in the depreciation calculation resulted in an ACV payment that was less than he was contractually entitled. (ECF DKT # 1, Ex. 1 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Law and Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Plain Meaning Analysis of ACV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To determine whether State Farm's depreciation calculation breached the contract, the Court examines the term ACV, which is undefined within the policy. (ECF DKT #1, Ex. 1 at 5). Giving the wording in the policy its natural and reasonable construction, ACV is not ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"ACV\" has been defined as \"[r]eplacement cost minus normal depreciation\" or fair market value.\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). Either of these definitions could fit within the contract clause without resulting in absurdity. In fact, in the estimate provided to Cranfield that was included with the Complaint, State Farm defined \"Net ACV\" in a similar manner. (ECF DKT # 1, Ex. 1 at 13) (\"The repair or replacement cost of the damaged part of the property less\n   <em>\n    depreciation\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    deductible\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Cranfield seeks to limit the definition of ACV to exclude labor from depreciation. However, there is nothing within the text of the contract to indicate that this was the intent of the parties at the time that the contract was formed. Further, the plain meaning of depreciation is inclusive of labor. The ordinary meaning of \"depreciation\" has been defined as \"[a] reduction in the value or price of something; specif., a decline in an asset's value because of use, wear, obsolescence, or age.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). A \"depreciation method\" is \"[a] set formula used in estimating an asset's use, wear, or obsolescence over the asset's useful life or some portion thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=374%20N.E.2d%20146\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As evidenced by\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , depreciation commonly\n   focuses on the value of the whole product, rather than the component parts.\n   <em>\n    Graves v.

Therefore, as used in the policy, ACV cannot reasonably be interpreted to exclude labor from a depreciation calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ambiguity is also determined by \"reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the [contract] as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Placing the term depreciation within the definition of ACV as used in the contract at issue, it is clear that depreciation is intended to include labor as well as materials. The property that the contract insures is Cranfield's home. The policy does not separately insure the labor and building materials, but the sum total of these parts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Redcorn v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.

Subsection (b) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [i]f the insured's interest is limited because his property has nominal or no economic value, or a value disproportionate to replacement cost less depreciation, the insurer is not required to comply with paragraph (I)(2)(a) of this rule regarding the determination of actual cash value.
