Local Civ. R. 56.1(b) &amp; (d) ; (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br., Docket Entry 73, at 2-4; Pl.'s Opp., Docket Entry 75, at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff submitted his first non-compliant Rule 56.1 Response in advance of a pre-motion conference in this matter. (Pl.'s 56.1 Resp., Docket Entry 69-2.) At the December 18, 2017 conference, the Court highlighted the Response's deficiencies and directed Plaintiff to file a compliant\n   56.1 Response. (Dec. 2017 Minute Entry, Docket Entry 71.) Plaintiff submitted an amended 56.1 Response that again failed to comply with Local Civil Rule 56.1. (Pl.'s Am. 56.1 Resp., Docket Entry 72, \u00b6\u00b6 1-97.) In his opposition to Defendants' summary judgment motion, Plaintiff explains his curious choice to flout the Rule and the Court's order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   At the pre-motion conference ... Plaintiff's Counsel noted--quite accurately--that the vast majority of statements included in the multiple declarations and documentation [cited in Defendants' Rule 56.1 Statement] were irrelevant to the case-at-hand. The Court held that it was within the purview of the Court to determine the relevance of the Defendants' assertions ... and provided a deadline for Plaintiff to file a revised Statement that matched paragraph-by-paragraph for the benefit of the Court's review as to which assertions are in contest....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Unfortunately, Defendants' 56.1 Statement was replete with superfluous and irrelevant assertions and materials seeking to prove the overall unethical, unprofessional and--in some instances--illegal conduct of Stratton Oakmont.... Plaintiff's allegations in the Complaint and assertions throughout this litigation have always been that he did not behave in the same fashion as the firm gained a reputation for....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Pl.'s Opp. at 7-9.) Accordingly, despite Plaintiff's clear understanding of Local Civil Rule 56.1 and this Court's directive, he disregarded both and instead filed what amounts to a commentary--without citations to admissible evidence--on Defendants' evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Am. 56.1 Resp.) The Court thus disregards Plaintiff's Responses and deems the facts in Defendants' 56.1 Statement to be admitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Stratton Oakmont, the Memoir, and the Movie\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   From 1993 to 1996, Plaintiff served as a director, general counsel, and head of the corporate finance department at Stratton Oakmont, Inc. (\"Stratton Oakmont\"). (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 51-52; Pl.'s Dep. 44:18-21, 64:5-12.) Stratton Oakmont was an infamous over-the-counter securities broker-dealer based in Long Island, New York that was subject to a host of disciplinary actions and charges involving, among other things, securities fraud and market manipulation. (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 20.) Jordan Belfort, one of Stratton Oakmont's cofounders, eventually pled guilty to securities fraud, money laundering, and related charges, for which he served prison time and was ordered to pay over $100 million in restitution. (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26, 28;\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Belfort, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 98-CR-0859, J., Docket Entry 135.) In 2007, Belfort published\n   <em>\n    The Wolf of Wall Street\n   </em>\n   , a memoir chronicling his time operating Stratton Oakmont and overseeing its securities fraud (the \"Memoir\"). (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 2);\n   <em>\n    Greene I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193705\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/138/226/\">\n    138 F.Supp.3d at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff is prominently featured in the Memoir. It identifies Plaintiff by his full name, Andrew Greene, and a nickname, \"Wigwam\"--a reference to the toupee he wore during his time at Stratton Oakmont. (Memoir pp. 1-224, Belfort Decl. Ex. 1 Pt. 1, Docket Entry 73-3, at 65.) Plaintiff is described as Stratton Oakmont's lawyer\n   and Belfort's \"old and trusted friend,\" whose job was \"to sift through dozens of business plans Stratton received each day and decide which, if any, were worth passing along to [Belfort].\" (Memoir at 65.) Physically speaking, he is described as \"frump[y]\" and having a \"prodigious potbelly,\" (Memoir at 66), and his toupee is mocked incessantly throughout the Memoir. For example, in the chapter introducing Plaintiff to readers, Belfort describes Plaintiff's toupee as \"the worst toupee this side of the Iron Curtain.\" (Memoir at 65.) The Memoir further describes Plaintiff as engaging in various types of illegal conduct related to Stratton Oakmont's securities fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Movie--starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Martin Scorsese--is based on the Memoir and was released in the United States on December 23, 2013. (Def.s' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5.) As stated in the closing credits, the Movie purports to be \"based on actual events\"--that is, the story told in the Memoir. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Movie; Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 90.) For the most part, the Movie's screenplay tracks the Memoir's storyline. However, as the closing credits explain, the Movie contains some dramatic elements. While purporting to be \"based on actual events,\" the credits indicate that some of the events depicted are fictional and that some of the characters have fictional names or are composites of real-life individuals depicted in the Memoir. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Movie, Closing Credits (\"[C]ertain characters, characterizations, incidents, locations and dialogue were fictionalized or invented for purposes of dramatization.\"); Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 90.) The closing credits further include a disclaimer that \"[w]ith respect to such fictionalization or invention, any similarity to the name or to the actual character or history of any person ... or any product or entity or actual incident, is entirely for dramatic purposes and not intended to reflect on an actual character, history, product or entity.\" (Movie, Closing Credits; Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Koskoff Character\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff claims that a character from the Movie, Nicky Koskoff (\"Koskoff\" or the \"Koskoff Character\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   --also known as \"Rugrat,\" a nickname mocking the toupee that the character wears--is one that viewers understood to be a depiction of Plaintiff. (Suppl. Compl., Docket Entry 2, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 20, 21, 28; Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff avers that on thirty-three occasions, the portrayal of Koskoff defamed him by showing him engaged in or condoning criminal activity, drug use, sexual relations with prostitutes, and other unprofessional behavior ranging from the mundane--\"depicting the boardroom as chaotic\"--to the outrageous--depicting Koskoff \"shaving a woman's head in the boardroom,\" for which she received $10,000. (App'x A to Pl.'s Interrogatory Responses, Cox Decl. Ex. 15, Docket Entry 73-28, ECF pp. 11-12; Suppl. Compl. \u00b6 30; Def.s' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 7; Memoir at 104.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Generally, the complained-of scenes are dramatized versions of events discussed in the Memoir. For instance, the Memoir describes drug use and prostitution activity in the boardroom, (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Memoir at 54); criminal activity, including the arrest of Gary Kaminsky, the Chief Financial Officer of a Stratton Oakmont client, (Memoir at 121, 137-48; Memoir Pt. 2 pp. 225-End, Docket Entry 73-4 at 339), and Plaintiff's role in a transaction arising out of the\n   initial public offering of Steven Madden Ltd.--Steve Madden's well-known shoe company--for which Madden pled guilty to money laundering, (Memoir at 415-19); and the immorality at Stratton Oakmont, such as the head-shaving incident and a discussion involving Plaintiff of whether to host a \"[m]idget [t]ossing [c]ompetition,\" (Memoir at 64-67, 104-06).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While Koskoff and Plaintiff share certain traits, Koskoff was created as a \"composite character\" inspired by three individuals discussed in the Memoir, not as a carbon copy of Plaintiff. (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.) Specifically, Koskoff incorporates elements of Plaintiff, Elliott Loewenstern, and Gary Kaminsky, as Belfort portrayed them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 74.) Loewenstern was Belfort's childhood friend and one of the first people to work at Stratton Oakmont as a retail cold-caller and broker. (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 75.) As discussed, Plaintiff is described in the Memoir as Belfort's childhood friend and is mocked for wearing a toupee. (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 75.) Kaminsky is portrayed as the toupee-wearing Chief Financial Officer of Dollar Time Corporation, a company that used Stratton Oakmont's corporate finance services. (Def.s' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 75.) According to the Memoir, Kaminsky accompanied Belfort on a trip to Switzerland, during which Belfort arranged a money-laundering scheme with a Swiss banker. (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 56, 75.) Additionally, the Memoir provides that Kaminsky was arrested in Florida with the Swiss banker. (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Individuals who saw the Movie and who knew Plaintiff while he worked for Stratton Oakmont testified that they believed Koskoff was a depiction of Plaintiff because, like Plaintiff, he wore a toupee and was a lawyer involved in corporate finance at the firm. (Pl.'s 56.1 Counterstmt. \u00b6 103.) Specifically, Howard Gelfand, a Stratton Oakmont employee, (Gelfand Dep., Cox Decl. Ex. 42, Docket Entry 73-51, 10:2-11:5), testified that he knew Koskoff referred to Plaintiff because \"he was a corporate finance guy and he was wearing a toupee,\" (Gelfand Dep. 37:17-20). Neil Kaufman, a securities lawyer who worked on an initial public offering underwritten by Stratton Oakmont, (Kaufman Dep., Cox Decl. Ex. 46, Docket Entry 73-55, 13:18-25), testified that it was obvious that Koskoff was a portrayal of Plaintiff because they were both in-house lawyers at Stratton Oakmont with the similarly punned nicknames of \"Rugrat\" and \"Wigwam,\" (Kaufman Dep. 50:17-51:5). Norman Arnoff, who represented Stratton Oakmont in connection with securities arbitrations and state regulatory matters, (Arnoff Dep., Cox Decl. Ex. 47, Docket Entry 73-56, 12:14-13:23), testified that he believed Koskoff identified Plaintiff because \"[o]ne, [ ] the wig[, a]nd two[,] because of the involvement ... in the [initial public offerings] in the business aspect of Stratton in the [M]ovie,\" (Arnoff Dep. 61:9-18). Ross Portenoy, who was friends with Plaintiff and Belfort and did printing work for Stratton Oakmont, (Portenoy Dep., Cox Decl. Ex. 48, Docket Entry 73-57, 10:13-15:10), testified that he believed Koskoff was Plaintiff because \"the hairpiece, his\n   nickname of Rugrat,\" and \"his role in the [M]ovie was corporate finance and dealing with corporate finance,\" (Portenoy Dep. 45:5-15). Stacy Rettinger, Plaintiff's ex-fianc\u00e9e, (Rettinger Dep., Cox Decl. Ex. 49, Docket Entry 73-58, 34:7-21), testified that she thought \"[t]he attorney with the ... toupee and the glasses\" was a depiction of Plaintiff, (Rettinger Dep. 31:20-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Notably, each of these individuals also testified that they did not associate Plaintiff with the defamatory aspects of Koskoff. (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 88.) Gelfand testified that he did not believe that Koskoff's actions mirrored Plaintiff's, because while the typical Stratton Oakmont employee \"was a drug monger, prostitute monger,\" Plaintiff \"wasn't particularly that guy.\" (Gelfand Dep. 44:20-45:5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Gelfand Dep. 64:12-22.) According to Kaufman, \"the depiction of [Koskoff] in the [Movie] was a ... gross distortion of\" Plaintiff. (Kaufman Dep. 42:11-24.) Arnoff testified that he recognized that not every character from the Movie \"matche[d] somebody 100 percent,\" (Arnoff Dep. 62:3-6), and that while Koskoff resembled Plaintiff more than anyone else at Stratton Oakmont, Koskoff was \"an extreme caricature\" of Plaintiff (Arnoff Dep. 51:13-21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Arnoff Dep. 51:22-52:12 (\"There were similarities [between Koskoff and Plaintiff] ... but I don't think it was identical.\") ). Plaintiff \"was one of the good guys.\" (Arnoff Dep. 61:19-62:20.) Portenoy testified that he believed that Koskoff made a \"mockery ... of [Plaintiff] ... [by] mak[ing him] look like a drug addict, partying and having sex with all these girls, doing the things he was doing in Stratton Oakmont, when I know for a fact that [Plaintiff] was the one that dealt with the regulations, that was trying to keep that firm going, and all of a sudden [Belfort] is mocking him, making him look like this character, and that is definitely not who [Plaintiff] was.\" (Portenoy Dep. 44:8-24;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Portenoy Dep. 90:12-17 (\"[Plaintiff] was depicted as a character that absolutely did not--was not the [Plaintiff] that I knew that worked at Stratton Oakmont.\").) Finally, Rettinger testified that she did not recall anything about what Koskoff did in the Movie, but only that he was Belfort's sidekick. (Rettinger Dep. 29:3-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on February 18, 2014, asserting two causes of action for invasion of his privacy under New York Civil Rights Law \u00a7 51, one cause of action for invasion of his privacy under New York common law, and two causes of action for libel\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   --one alleging actual malice and the other alleging negligence.\n   <em>\n    Greene I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193705\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/138/226/\">\n    138 F.Supp.3d at 230-31, 236-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the September 2015 Order, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's invasion of privacy claims with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193705\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/138/226/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193705\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/138/226/\">\n    at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, for example, Defendants combined aspects of Plaintiff and others in creating the Koskoff Character: Koskoff shared several of Plaintiff's characteristics but engaged in actions carried out by others--for instance, Kaminsky's trip to Switzerland and arrest in Florida. (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 75.) Therefore, if Koskoff is \"of and concerning\" Plaintiff, then certain aspects of Koskoff are false as to Plaintiff, and Defendants acted with knowledge of that falsity. If Koskoff is not \"of and concerning\" Plaintiff, however, then any statement about that character is not false, and thus, not knowingly false. In other words, under a literal application of the test, actual malice is \"automatic\" if the character is \"of and concerning\" Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New Times, Inc. v.

Finding that such a rule would be incompatible with the First Amendment, it articulated the question of actual malice in satire cases as follows: \"[D]id the publisher either know or have reckless disregard for whether the article could reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9149716\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/146/144/#p162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9149716\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/146/144/#p162\">\n    at 162-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The actual malice inquiry for fictional characters can likewise be reframed to avoid \"automatic actual malice.\" As discussed, a statement will only be false if the character is found to be \"of and concerning\" the plaintiff. Thus, determining whether the defendant acted with knowledge or reckless disregard in making a false statement is dependent on whether the defendant acted with knowledge or reckless disregard in making a statement \"of and concerning\" the plaintiff through the portrayal of a fictional character. This inquiry collapses into whether the defendant knew or acted with reckless disregard for whether the portrayal of the character would be \"of and concerning\" the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rest. 2d of Torts \u00a7 564, cmt. f. (\"The common law position was that if the recipient reasonably understood the communication to be made [of and] concerning the plaintiff, the defamer was subject to liability even though he was not at fault .... This position is now held to be in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution. The Supreme Court holds that there must be intent [or] recklessness ... on the part of the defamer.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendants argue that there is no evidence that Red Granite, Paramount, or Appian Way acted with actual malice because they did not act with knowledge or reckless disregard for whether Koskoff would be perceived to be \"of and concerning\" Plaintiff. (Defs.' Br. at 8-13.) In response, Plaintiff contends that Defendants acted with reckless disregard of falsity by (1) failing to properly research aspects of the Memoir, (2) relying on Belfort in their due-diligence efforts, when Belfort \"has admitted to regularly and pathologically lying to customers, colleagues, law enforcement and Courts,\" (3) engaging in \"limited research regarding portrayals of real-life incidents and individuals,\" (4) lacking knowledge about legal clearance procedures, and (5) being unconcerned with factual accuracy. (Pl.'s Opp. at 10-15.) However, Plaintiff ignores Defendants' argument that they did not act with knowledge or recklessness in portraying him in the first place. And critically, while Defendants support their position with the evidence below, Plaintiff has not established a genuine issue of material fact by introducing or highlighting conflicting evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Red Granite was the manager of TWOWS, LLC, the production company for the Movie. (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 107.) Christopher McFarland, a Producer and Vice Chairman of Red Granite, supervised the team that vetted the Movie to avoid violating third parties' reputational rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (McFarland Decl., Docket Entry 73-62, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7, 16.) McFarland explains that the Movie was \"based upon events seen from the distinctive point of view of Jordan Belfort.\" (McFarland Decl. \u00b6 3.) To portray Belfort and the atmosphere of Stratton Oakmont, the Movie \"had characters employed by Stratton Oakmont doing things similar to events that actually occurred, [though] no attempt was made to have any characters that would reasonably be understood as [ ] specific Stratton Oakmont employee[s].\" (McFarland Decl. \u00b6 3.) Specifically, McFarland provides that the Movie was \"not intend[ed] to have any character that would reasonably be seen as the Plaintiff.\" (McFarland Decl. \u00b6 3.) Further, he explains that he did not believe viewers would understand the Koskoff Character to refer to any specific or real person because (1) Koskoff was a composite character with a \"made-up name ... and a job and personal history different from the people who helped to inspire the character,\" (2) the disclaimer in the Movie's credits explained that certain characters were fictionalized,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) \"the style and content of the [Movie].\" (McFarland Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 16.) Finally, he provides that \"[e]ven if someone mistakenly believed that Koskoff was not a composite fictional character, but instead was a depiction of a real person, it seemed to me that such a viewer would think that the real person's name was Koskoff.\" (McFarland Decl. \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Paramount acted solely as the Movie's distributor and did not produce or develop its screenplay. (Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 91.) According to Lola Langner, Senior Vice President in Paramount's legal department, Paramount distributed the Movie based on: (1) \"chain of title documents showing that the [Movie] was based upon an underlying non-fiction book\"; (2) information from a Red Granite attorney that there had been no lawsuits brought against the Movie or Memoir, and that the only claim against the Movie or Memoir had come from an attorney representing Daniel Porush, Stratton Oakmont's former president; (3) an agreement pursuant to which the Movie's producer and copyright owner, TWOWS, LLC, represented and warranted to Paramount that the Movie would comply with libel and slander laws; and (4) assurances that TWOWS, LLC had \"conducted a detailed analysis regarding the compliance of the [Movie] ... with the laws pertaining to rights of ... defamation.\" (Langner Decl., Docket Entry 73-59, \u00b6\u00b6 2-8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Appian Way's involvement in the Movie included persuading Warner Brothers to acquire the underlying motion picture rights and assisting in the initial stages of development, which led to the commitment by Martin Scorsese's production company, Sikelia,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   to furnish Scorsese's services. (Def.s' 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 101.) According to the declaration of Jennifer Davisson, head of production at Appian Way, the company's development work occurred in 2007 and 2008, when she and Leonardo DiCaprio met with Winter to discuss his \"broad-stroke idea of how he would like to adapt\n   [the Memoir] as a motion picture screenplay.\" (Davisson Decl., Docket Entry 73-70, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8.) After Scorsese agreed to become involved and Appian Way had provided comments on the first draft of the script in 2008, its direct involvement in the Movie's development ended. (Davisson Decl. \u00b6 8.) The film project ceased to be actively developed in 2008, but in 2011, Davisson learned that Red Granite was willing to finance the project. (Davisson Decl. \u00b6 9.) Thereafter, Appian Way furnished DiCaprio's acting services, while TWOWS, LLC and Sikelia took over the \"hands-on\" production of the Movie. (Davisson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) Davisson knows of no one at Appian Way who had any role in creating or developing any aspect of the Koskoff Character, and she believed that Appian Way had no right to determine the content of the Movie, \"except insofar as it furnished the services of Leonardo DiCaprio as the lead actor performing the role of Jordan Belfort.\" (Davisson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) She believed that vetting the Movie to ensure that it did not violate third parties' rights was under Sikelia's or TWOWS, LLC's control, and that Appian Way played no role in that process. (Davisson Decl. \u00b6 13.) Finally, Davisson provides that (1) she understood that the Movie \"did not say anything that was false about any real persons,\" (2) she knew of no pending defamation claims with respect to the Movie, (3) she had no belief that anyone would be defamed by the Movie, and (4) she \"believed that the [Koskoff C]haracter was a fictional character inspired by several people in the [Memoir].\" (Davisson Decl. \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In light of the above, even if Koskoff is a depiction of Plaintiff, the Court concludes that Defendants did not act with knowledge or reckless disregard for whether Koskoff was \"of and concerning\" Plaintiff, and thus, that they did not act with actual malice. Specifically, based on (1) the fictionalized nature of the Movie; (2) the undisputed facts that the Koskoff Character is a composite of three people and has a different name, nickname, employment history, personal history, and criminal history than Plaintiff; (3) the Movie's disclaimer; (4) evidence of each Defendant's subjective understanding that no real person was portrayed--or defamed--by the Koskoff Character; and (5) the lack of evidence to the contrary, Plaintiff cannot establish that Defendants \"in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of [the] publication.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Amant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178083\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/727/#p731\">\n    390 U.S. at 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178083\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/727/#p731\">\n    88 S.Ct. at 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
