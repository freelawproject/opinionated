He subsequently brought this lawsuit, alleging that the company's manner of paying its servers violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and the D.C. Minimum Wage Revision Act. His allegations focus on Defendant's use of a so-called \"tip credit\" - a method of compensation in which an employer pays its employees a base wage below the minimum level set by law; this is permissible so long as the employees' tips ultimately bring their wages up to the minimum. Here, however, Plaintiff claims that Mastro's violated the law by employing a tip-credit system while requiring servers to share tips with employees -\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , wine runners and baristas - who did not \"customarily and regularly receive tips.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(2)(A).

Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The central question for the Court is whether Plaintiff agreed to be bound by the arbitration agreement Defendant attaches to its Motion or one substantially identical to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mot., Exh. A (Arbitration Agreement). The parties agree that this question is governed by D.C. contract law and resolved under the summary-judgment standard discussed above. But that's about all they agree on. Mastro's insists that Plaintiff assented to the arbitration agreement, even though it cannot produce a document bearing his signature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mot. at 6-10. Plaintiff, on the other hand, attests that he never saw the agreement, never signed it, and never otherwise agreed to arbitrate any disputes he might have with Mastro's.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 23 (Pl. Opp.), Exh. 1 (Declaration of Koly Camara), \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court starts by considering whether Mastro's has met its initial burden of showing that Camara assented to an arbitration agreement. Finding that to be the case, the Court then considers whether Plaintiff has offered evidence creating a genuine dispute of material fact as to the issue of his agreement. Concluding that he has, the Court need not consider his back-up argument that any agreement is unenforceable as a matter of D.C. law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   a. Defendant's Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mastro's musters the following evidence that Plaintiff agreed to pursue any claims against it only in arbitration. First, it declares that since June 2015, \"it has been Defendant's policy to require all employees to execute\" arbitration agreements like the\n   one attached to its Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mot., Exh. B (First Declaration of Laura Jasso), \u00b6 4. Consistent with that policy, it says that \"virtually every Washington, D.C. Mastro's employee has signed an individual Arbitration Agreement.\" Def. Mot., Attach. 1 (Declaration of Stephen Carcamo), \u00b6 3. Mastro's reasons that, because it required employees to sign such agreements and most employees did sign such agreements, Plaintiff must also have signed one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mot. at 4, 7. Second, Mastro's internal database that tracks compliance with the company's arbitration policy shows that Plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Jasso Decl., \u00b6 7. Third, Mastro's suggests that Camara\n   <em>\n    impliedly\n   </em>\n   agreed to arbitration by continuing to work at the restaurant after the arbitration program was rolled out.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 25 (Def. Reply) at 3-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This evidence satisfies Defendant's initial burden of showing that Plaintiff assented to an arbitration agreement. Taken together, the company's general arbitration policy and its internal data could lead a reasonable jury to find that he agreed to arbitrate disputes with Mastro's. The burden thus shifts to Camara to show a genuine dispute of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   b. Plaintiff's Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Camara contests Defendant's position on each front, contending that he never expressly or impliedly agreed to arbitrate disputes with Mastro's. As to the question of\n   <em>\n    express\n   </em>\n   agreement, he declares under penalty of perjury that he \"did not see [the arbitration] agreement when [he] worked at Mastro's, did not sign it, and [ ] never agreed to its terms.\" Camara Decl., \u00b6 3. Even though it has found and produced arbitration agreements signed by\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   employees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply, Exhs. A &amp; B, Mastro's has been unable to locate any for Camara.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Carcamo Decl., \u00b6 8. Neither has it offered evidence of any specific communication between the restaurant and Plaintiff concerning the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This is a prototypical dispute of fact. On the one side is Camara's sworn statement that he never saw, signed, or otherwise assented to an arbitration agreement. On the other is Mastro's general arbitration policy and the notation by an unnamed manager in an internal database. And that dispute is material insofar as it determines whether the parties had a meeting of the minds as to an arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant's only possible rejoinder is that the dispute is not\n   <em>\n    genuine\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that no reasonable jury could side with Camara on this question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply at 6. In that vein, the company states that Camara fails to \"support his assertions with 'affidavits, declarations, or other competent evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753162,3561423\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/360/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wackenhut\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4009050\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/865/84/#p89\">\n    865 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   89 ). This argument would have been better left in the meat locker. Camara submitted a\n   <em>\n    sworn declaration\n   </em>\n   specifically denying that he had signed an arbitration agreement; the declaration is competent and persuasive evidence on the question of his assent. When faced with a specific and sworn denial on the one hand, and an internal company directive and the absence of a signed contract on the other, a reasonable jury would have good reason to side with Camara. The dispute over whether Plaintiff expressly assented to arbitrate disputes with Mastro's is therefore genuine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Yet Defendant also maintains that Camara\n   <em>\n    impliedly\n   </em>\n   agreed to arbitration. In support of this position, the steakhouse looks to the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).

Mastro's extracts from the decision\n   an additional holding: that employees impliedly agree to binding arbitration when they remain in their position after receiving notice of their employer's new arbitration policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply at 6-7. Defendant reasons that Camara should be found to have done the same. Once again, the Court disagrees: Mastro's chars both\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   and its purported application to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To start,\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   did not decide any question about the formation of arbitration agreements by implied assent. It is true that Justice Ginsburg noted in dissent her concern that the arbitration agreement in one of the underlying cases was not properly formed because it was not bilateral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1636 n.2.

In\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   , as mentioned, the plaintiff received an email telling him that if he continued working there, he would be deemed to have accepted an arbitration agreement. No such email apparently exists in this case, nor is it clear that a comparable message\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have been sent, since Camara may have begun working for Mastro's contemporaneously with the rollout of the arbitration policy. The upshot: Mastro's offers no evidence that Plaintiff was aware of the arbitration agreement, and Camara avers that he was not. Implied assent would come into play only if the employee were aware (or, at a minimum, constructively aware) that his continued employment would have as a consequence an agreement to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 19(2) (1981) (\"The conduct of a party is not effective as a manifestation of his assent unless he intends to engage in the conduct and knows or has reason to know that the other party may infer from his conduct that he assents.\");\n   <em>\n    Nicosia v.

Plaintiff has introduced evidence to the contrary, so there is, at the very least, a genuine dispute of material fact over whether he impliedly assented to any arbitration agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   One final note of caution to Defendant on this issue. In its Reply Brief, the company makes the following statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, Plaintiff agreed to submit his claims to arbitration because he saw the \"agreement when [he] worked at Mastro's,\" signed it, and had \"reason to believe,\" that he agreed to arbitrate any claims through his continued employment with Mastro's. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. (ECF No. 23) at 3.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Def. Reply at 4. The statement quotes Plaintiff's brief to suggest that he saw and signed the arbitration agreement. Yet the quoted sections of Plaintiff's brief say precisely the opposite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 3 (emphasizing that plaintiff \"did not see that agreement\" and \"did not sign it\") (quoting Camara Decl., \u00b6 3).

The Court trusts such errors will not recur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As there is a genuine dispute of material fact over whether Plaintiff agreed to pursue all claims against Mastro's through arbitration, the Court will deny the Motion to Compel Arbitration. In doing so, it notes that Defendant has also challenged on similar grounds the presence in this case of other servers who have filed notices to become party Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 28 (Def. Surreply). Since the action will continue with Camara as named Plaintiff and given that briefing has hardly been had as to the new party Plaintiffs, the Court will not address at this point whether those other servers must go to arbitration.

Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The question of conditional certification in this case turns on whether Plaintiff is similarly situated to other Mastro's servers who were paid a base hourly wage below the federal minimum. The Court first addresses Camara's allegation on this point before turning to Defendant's arguments about the various differences between Plaintiff and other Mastro's servers. After explaining why it finds conditional certification appropriate, the Court last addresses a separate issue related to the scope of notice to putative Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   a. Plaintiff's Showing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Camara says that other servers are subject to the same unlawful employment practices he challenges in this case, and that they are thus similarly situated to him. In particular, he says that Mastro's\n   maintained (1) \"a common policy and practice of paying the hourly tipped minimum wage to servers\"; (2) \"a common policy and practice of requiring servers to put approximately 42-45% of the tips they received into a 'tip pool' to be shared with other employees including wine runners, food runners, bartenders, bussers, and baristas\"; and (3) \"a common policy and practice of certain participants in the tip pool not having customary and regular interaction with restaurant customers as part of their job duties.\" Pl. Mot. at 10. He backs those allegations up with sworn declarations from servers at a number of different Mastro's locations around the country.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. Mot., Attachs. 2-5 (Server Declarations). The Court finds, as a result, that Plaintiff has easily made the \"modest factual showing sufficient to demonstrate that [named] and potential plaintiffs together were victims of a common policy or plan that violated the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Chase\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8965969\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/374/196/#p200\">\n    374 F.Supp.2d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   b. Defendant's Objections\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant's principal objection to certification appears to be its position that it does not in fact maintain an unlawful tip pool.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. at 2-12 (taking issue with Plaintiff's factual allegations). It attaches to its Opposition numerous declarations of other Mastro's servers to that effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8965969\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/374/196/#p200\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8965969\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/374/196/#p200\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Exh.

Acosta's declaration, for example, merely contradicts a declaration Plaintiff submitted from Daniel Pena.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mot., Attach. 3 (Declaration of Daniel Pena), \u00b6 4.

Such factual disputes are left for another day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Mastro's remaining briefing is somewhat scattershot, but it appears to identify three purported differences between Camara and other servers that preclude conditional certification, none of which the Court finds persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (i). It first suggests that Camara is not similarly situated with servers at Mastro's other restaurant locations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. at 11, 16, 19. The only differences it points out, however, are (1) the percentage of servers' tips placed in the tip pool (from 40 to 50% depending on location), and (2) the level of interaction wine runners and baristas have with customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18. The first difference is immaterial to conditional certification and the second is illusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In asserting that the differences in the percentage of tips placed in the tip pool preclude certification, Mastro's forgets that Plaintiff needs \"show only that [his] position[ ] [is] similar, not identical, to the positions held by the putative class members.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Grayson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9053031\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/79/1086/#p1096\">\n    79 F.3d at 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A minor difference in tip-pool percentage thus does not make conditional certification inappropriate. In fact, as far as the Court can tell, the particular percentage of tips placed in the pool does not even affect whether Mastro's violated the FLSA or the DCMWRA - it matters only in calculating damages. The Supreme Court has upheld the certification of classes - a higher bar than collectives - with far more wide-ranging and difficult damages calculations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyson Foods, Inc. v.

Opp. at 16-18. Here's what the declarations said: Pena, the New York server, averred that servers would retrieve wine from wine runners \"at a meeting point outside of the view of customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (quoting Pena Decl., \u00b6 4). Mary Still, a Chicago server, declared that servers obtain wine from wine runners at \"a meeting point outside of the view of customers, such as near the point of sales system or the main bar.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Mary Still Decl., \u00b6 4). Cory Warfield, also in Chicago, stated that servers get wine from wine runners at a \"meeting point 'like the bar or the point of sales terminal.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (quoting Cory Warfield Decl., \u00b6 5). Mastro's asserts that the declarations are inconsistent -\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the bar is within the view of customers - and thus show that servers across locations are not similarly situated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This argument is not ready to come of the grill. Even if the particular meeting point were different in New York from Chicago and D.C. and even if customers might\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   wine runners near the bar, that would be consistent with declarants' (and Plaintiff's) averment that wine runners in all locations did not regularly\n   <em>\n    interact\n   </em>\n   with customers. The declarations thus fully support Plaintiff's allegation that servers at Mastro's restaurants nationwide, like Camara in D.C., participate in a tip pool that includes employees who do not regularly interact with customers. More generally, Defendant's attacks on the servers' credibility are misdirected, for \"the Court does not resolve factual disputes, decide substantive issues going to the ultimate merits or\n   <em>\n    make credibility determinations\n   </em>\n   \" at this stage of the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Summa v.

The company does not maintain, for example, that its restaurants are independently run or that they maintain varying employment and personnel practices. Just the opposite.

For now, in showing that he \"and potential plaintiffs together were victims of a common policy or plan that violated the law,\"\n   <em>\n    Chase\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8965969\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/374/196/#p200\">\n    374 F.Supp.2d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Camara has done all he is required to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (iii). Finally, Mastro's suggests that individual factual determinations as to liability preclude conditional certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mot. at 12. The only individual factual determinations it mentions, though - apart from those already discussed - center around the duties of wine runners and baristas. Its concern in that respect is overdone. Because Plaintiff is a server and seeks only to represent other servers, variations among other Mastro's employees only matter to the extent they affect the restaurant's liability as to servers. And, variations among wine runners and baristas\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   one restaurant will not affect Mastro's liability as to servers under the FLSA and DCMWRA: If a single wine runner or barista does not regularly interact with customers but joins a location's tip pool, Mastro's will presumably have contravened the Acts. Neither do such intra-restaurant variations appear to matter for purposes of calculating damages, which do not depend on individual facts about non-tipped\n   employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montano v. Montrose Restaurant Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054984\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/186/#p192\">\n    800 F.3d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 189 &amp; n.6 (5th Cir. 2015) (noting that damages would be equal to difference between base wage and minimum wage plus amount of tips plaintiff contributed to unlawful tip pool).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   While one might imagine that wine runners' and baristas' duties could vary\n   <em>\n    among\n   </em>\n   different restaurants, thus requiring factual determinations about Mastro's liability to servers by location, the Court has already explained why any such variations are illusory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 57-59. Indeed, the steakhouse has affirmed that it takes the same approach to service in all of its restaurants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Jasso Decl., \u00b6 6. Because Defendant fails to identify any other differences among servers that would require individual adjudication, the Court rejects its conclusory assertion that the need for individual factual determinations precludes conditional certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   c. Notice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The only remaining issues concern the scope of notice to putative collective members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   First, Mastro's briefly asserts that notice should not issue to servers in all of its restaurants in the United States because it \"does not own or operate all Mastro's restaurant locations in the United States.\" Def. Opp. at 9. It is not entirely clear what Defendant is arguing on this score. Insofar as Mastro's suggests that servers at certain restaurants are not \"employed\" by Defendant, such that it would not be liable for any FLSA or DCMWRA violations, such questions are properly addressed at the second stage of certification.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera v. Power Design, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345808\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/321/#p327\">\n    172 F.Supp.3d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327 (D.D.C. 2016) (collecting cases). Plaintiff has offered sufficient unrebutted evidence that Mastro's employs servers at all of its locations to satisfy the \"modest showing that plaintiffs must make at the conditional certification stage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345808\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/321/#p327\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To the extent it means that servers at the Mastro's locations it supposedly does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   own or operate are not similarly situated to servers like Camara who work at a location it\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   own and operate, that assertion flies in the face of its declaration that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   its restaurants take the same approach to service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Jasso Decl., \u00b6 6. Finally, insofar as Mastro's disputes its ability to facilitate such notice, the Court is unpersuaded. Defendant has obtained declarations from employees at the locations it suggests it does not fully own or operate -\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , the Chicago and Pittsburgh locations - and seeks to enforce arbitration agreements involving employees at those locations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Jasso Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 8-10. The company thus has enough control over those restaurants to obtain putative Plaintiffs' contact information and provide it to Camara in this action.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345808\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/172/321/#p327\">\n    172 F.Supp.3d at 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting defendants' argument that they should not be required to provide putative Plaintiffs' contact information because it was in the hands of a subcontractor).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Second, Mastro's argues that it should not be required to disclose putative Plaintiffs' social-security numbers or phone numbers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. at 26-27. When deciding whether to require disclosure of potential plaintiffs' information, courts balance \"plaintiffs' need\" for the information \"against the privacy interests of the current and former employees.\"\n   <em>\n    Gieseke v. First Horizon Home Loan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20445202\">\n    2007 WL 445202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Kan. Feb. 7, 2007). Upon consideration of that balance, the Court agrees that disclosure of social-security numbers is unnecessary at this stage of the proceedings because it could compromise putative Plaintiffs' privacy without any countervailing benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delaney v. Geisha NYC, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266367\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/261/55/#p60\">\n    261 F.R.D. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). (Even Camara concedes\n   in his Reply that such information is not necessary at this point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply at 15.) Telephone numbers are a different matter. While this information is private, it does not pose the same confidentiality concerns as social-security numbers; it is also highly useful in contacting putative Plaintiffs. Because \"Defendant[ ] raises no special concerns\" about disclosing this information, the Court finds that \"the balance favors requiring Defendant[ ] to provide phone numbers.\"\n   <em>\n    Ayala v. Tito Contractors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4218425\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/12/167/#p172\">\n    12 F.Supp.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 172 (D.D.C. 2014). Mastro's does not contest Plaintiff's other discovery requests associated with providing notice, including its request for email addresses, mailing addresses, and employment IDs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mot. at 13. The Court, accordingly, need not question the propriety of such disclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court will therefore order notice of this action be provided consistent with this Opinion to \"[a]ll employees who worked as servers and received an hourly wage less than $7.25 an hour at any Mastro's location in the United States from May 22, 2015 to the present.\" Pl. Reply at 2. In connection with this Notice, Defendant shall provide Plaintiff with the full names, telephone numbers, mailing addresses, email addresses, and employee IDs for all putative Plaintiffs. As both parties agree, the notice period shall be sixty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For the reasons given in this Opinion, the Court will deny Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and grant Plaintiff's Motion for Conditional Certification of a Collective Action under the FLSA and DCMWRA. A separate Order so stating will issue this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
