On December 19, 2014, Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in this Court (the \"2014 Petition\").

Respondent appealed this Court's Order, and on February 17, 2017, the Second Circuit vacated the Order and remanded the matter back to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On remand, Petitioner sought to advance a habeas claim consistent with the Second Circuit's decision. To that end, on April 14, 2017, Petitioner filed a supplemental memorandum in support of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus (the \"2017 Petition\"), which memorandum amplified his earlier claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

In sum, the Second Circuit held that this Court did not exercise proper deference when evaluating the state court's ruling under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), codified in relevant part at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    at 548-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   AEDPA, the Second Circuit emphasized, establishes a highly deferential standard of review, a standard that prohibits a federal court from granting a writ of habeas corpus simply because the state court applied federal law incorrectly or erroneously.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carmichael III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277561\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/536/\">\n    848 F.3d at 548-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Similar to this Court, the Second Circuit did not reach Petitioner's second claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The 2017 Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 14, 2017, Petitioner filed a supplemental petition for a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in this Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. Br.). Petitioner renewed his ineffective assistance of counsel claim from the 2014 Petition that this Court previously, upon resolution of the substantive\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claim, had declined to address. However, the two claims are interrelated, inasmuch as Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel relies on the underlying\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   issue. In relevant part, Petitioner argues that his trial attorney was unaware of New York law that requires attorneys to cite \"other facts or circumstances,\" in addition to numerical evidence, to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    People\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1061767\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/97/500/#p507\">\n    97 N.Y.2d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1061767\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/97/500/#p507\">\n    743 N.Y.S.2d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1061767\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/97/500/#p507\">\n    769 N.E.2d 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) ) ). At trial, Petitioner's counsel raised several\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   objections on the basis of the prosecution striking black venirepersons at a disproportionate rate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). However, counsel failed to supplement his objections with \"other facts or circumstances\" to show an inference of discrimination, as Petitioner claims was required by New York law and requested by the court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Petitioner argues that both prongs of the two-step test established in\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   are met: (i) counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (ii) Petitioner was prejudiced by the deficient performance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. Br. 2-18). Specifically, Petitioner claims that counsel's inadequate challenge to a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation under New York law meets\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's first prong of defective performance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-17). Next, Petitioner alleges that\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   errors are structural errors, rendering a proceeding fundamentally unfair. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-18). As a result, he asserts, prejudice is presumed and the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   is satisfied. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Reasonable arguments exist in support of both positions: that\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claims are structural errors for which prejudice is presumed, and, alternatively, that they are subject to harmless error review. In support of the former, one may argue that\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claims are structural in nature, and that\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , a case about presence of counsel, did not overrule Second Circuit precedent.

Whether\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   conclusively determines that\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenges are structural errors, or subject to harmless error analysis, is immaterial.

(Pet. Br. 6). When objecting to the prosecution's peremptory strikes of black venirepersons, defense counsel pointed to the number of black venirepersons excluded, in relation to the total number of black venirepersons. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). According to Petitioner, it is immaterial whether counsel's failure to draw the court's attention to any additional evidence of discrimination was in violation of New York law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. Reply 1-2). Because the trial court directed counsel to supplement his\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenges with additional information, counsel's failure to do so rendered his performance deficient \"under any standard,\" regardless of New York law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, Petitioner argues that supplemental information was \"right under [defense counsel's] nose\" and should have been readily apparent to him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. Reply 2). Specifically, counsel should have highlighted to the court that at least four of the six challenged black jurors had close ties to law enforcement through family or friends. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet. Br. 6). Presumably, their relationships with law enforcement would make those venirepersons more amenable to the prosecution's case, and therefore desirable members of the jury. In Petitioner's estimation, the fact that the prosecution struck those venirepersons despite their pro-prosecution tendencies, combined with the numerical evidence, indicates that the peremptory strikes were motivated by racial intent. Ultimately, Petitioner argues, defense counsel's failure to make this readily available argument to the court renders his performance deficient. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   While the combination of numerical evidence and venirepersons with pro-prosecution backgrounds may give rise to a successful\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge under certain circumstances, \"there are no fixed rules for determining what evidence will ... establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1061767\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/97/500/#p507\">\n    97 N.Y.2d at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1061767\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/97/500/#p507\">\n    743 N.Y.S.2d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1061767\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/97/500/#p507\">\n    769 N.E.2d 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    People\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bolling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4423285\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/79/317/#p323\">\n    79 N.Y.2d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 323-24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=582%20N.Y.S.2d%20950\">\n    582 N.Y.S.2d 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=591%20N.E.2d%201136\">\n    591 N.E.2d 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) ). In this case, evidence of pro-prosecution tendencies is less probative of\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   discrimination, primarily because the prosecution also challenged white prospective jurors with similar ties to law enforcement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report 45). Presumably, if defense counsel had supplemented his\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge as proposed by Petitioner, the prosecution could have drawn the court's attention to the ostensibly-pro-prosecution white jurors who were also excluded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller-El\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dretke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/#p232\">\n    545 U.S. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/#p232\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/#p232\">\n    162 L.Ed.2d 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (\"More powerful than the bare statistics are side-by-side comparisons of some black venire panelists who were struck and white ones who were not.\"). The exclusion of those venirepersons indicates that the prosecution did not place a great deal of value on obtaining jurors who had personal relationships with law enforcement officers that might suggest a natural sympathy towards law enforcement\n   . As a result, the exclusion of \"pro-prosecution\" black venirepersons is not compelling evidence that the prosecution challenged otherwise desirable jurors on the basis of race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Therefore, the fact that the prosecution challenged black venirepersons who may have been sympathetic to law enforcement is hardly a smoking gun. This is not the case where counsel \"failed to make a 'sure winner' argument.\"\n   <em>\n    Eze\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Senkowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9359767\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/321/110/#p137\">\n    321 F.3d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Leonardo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11797978\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/162/81/#p85\">\n    162 F.3d 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85 (2d Cir. 1998) ). Instead, counsel's alleged mistake was that he failed to proffer a relatively weak argument. Without clear evidence that counsel's failure to offer the pro-prosecution theory did not arise from \"the vagaries of ignorance, inattention or ineptitude,\" but rather his assessment that the supplemental information was relatively weak and would therefore be ineffective, \"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's strong presumption must stand.\"\n   <em>\n    Lynn\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bliden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045676\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/238/#p249\">\n    443 F.3d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249 (2d Cir. 2006).
