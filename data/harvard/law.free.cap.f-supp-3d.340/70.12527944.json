D.1. The Court previously allowed Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the claims for breach of contract (Count I), breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count II), fraudulent inducement (Count III), unjust enrichment (Count IV), D. 81. Defendants now move for summary judgment as to the remaining claims against them, namely for trademark infringement (Count V), false designation of origin under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (Count VI), trademark dilution under Mass.

D. 90; D. 180. For the reasons stated below, the Court ALLOWS Defendants' motion as to Plaintiffs' remaining claims and DENIES Defendants' motion with respect to their counterclaims against Plaintiffs. The Court also DENIES Defendants' request for attorney's fees, D. 180 at 19-20, without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1, the party opposing a motion for summary judgment must \"include a concise statement of the material facts of record as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried, with page references to affidavits, depositions and other documentation.\" Local Rule 56.1. Plaintiffs have failed to do so consistently here.

D. 182 \u00b6 9 H; D. 187 \u00b6 9 H; D. 184-4 at 2-3. It further promoted the opening of the Boston Little Lamb restaurant on its website. D. 182 \u00b6 51. Linkage's representative, Yu, also visited the Little Lamb restaurant in Boston in September 2012. D. 182 \u00b6 9K. On December 29, 2013, Linkage filed two specimens, which consisted of photographs of a restaurant fixture and menu from the Little Lamb restaurant with the USPTO. D. 182 \u00b6 9J; D. 183-5 at 51-52. Although the term of the Cooperation was for five years (until July 6, 2016), D. 184-1 at 6, Defendants ceased using the Trademark in February 2016, D. 182 \u00b6 59; D. 184 \u00b6 14, and changed the name of the restaurant from Little Lamb to \"Hulun Beir.\" D. 182 \u00b6 60; D. 184 \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    2.

D. 184-5. The Jointly Agreement contemplated the parties \"jointly\" developing the Little Lamb restaurant in Boston under its Trademark, D. 184-5. The Jointly Agreement recognized that Xu and Qin had \"obtained exclusive right to the [Little Lamb] restaurant franchise and the exclusive right to operate any and all marketing and business operations associated with [Little Lamb] restaurant franchise system.\" D. 184-5 \u00b6 1. It also provided that Xie had \"completed the initial technical training required by 'Linkage,' and [ ] the preparation and investigation in relevant restaurants operations in China.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C550%2C357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants contracted to open at least three Little Lamb restaurant chains in the U.S. within three years after setting up Xiao Wei Yang USA, Inc.

It further provides that Xie was\n   obligated to travel promptly to the United States to participate in the development of the Boston Little Lamb restaurant requiring Xie to participate in the \"completion of the business and related qualification[,]\" engage in comprehensive training by Linkage, pass the English proficiency examination and apply for entry visa at the U.S. Embassy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C550%2C357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C550%2C357\">\n    \u00b6 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants contend that Xie misrepresented his skills, received salary, food and transportation and then absconded with the Little Lamb restaurant's property without, among other things, sharing in the losses of the restaurant and going to work for other franchises in other cities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs instituted this action on January 16, 2015. D. 1. Defendants originally moved to dismiss all counts. D. 8. The Court denied that motion to dismiss without prejudice as to Counts I, II, III and IV (the \"contract claims\"), and denied the motion to dismiss as to the remaining claims with prejudice. D. 26. As to the contract claims, the Court granted limited discovery solely on the forum-selection clause issue and noted that it would allow for a renewed motion to dismiss once discovery had been completed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C550%2C357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thereafter, Defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss the contract claims, D. 63, which the Court converted into a motion for summary judgment. The Court allowed that motion as supplemented, D. 73, as to Counts I-IV. D. 81. Defendants have now moved for summary judgment with respect to the remaining Counts V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX (the \"trademark infringement claims\") and Defendants' counterclaims against Plaintiffs. The Court heard the parties on the motion and took the matter under advisement. D. 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

D. 182 \u00b6 9D. Plaintiffs dispute this contention, however, and argues that because Defendants failed to satisfy the express condition under paragraph\n   10 of the Cooperation Agreement, Defendants used their Trademark without authorization. D. 186 at 11-13. Paragraph 10 of the Cooperation Agreement provides that Defendant Xu is required to \"open at least one restaurant/store or secure at least one franchisee within [one] year after the 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   'Little Lamb' store opening date\" and that failure to do so would void the rights afforded to Defendants in Paragraph 9. D. 184-1 \u00b6 10; D. 186 at 11-13. These rights, Plaintiffs argue, included appointment of Defendant Xu as its exclusive agent and authorization to operate under its Trademark. \"A condition precedent defines an event which must occur before an obligation to perform arises under a contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Santana-Colon v.

The plain language of the Cooperation Agreement supports the conclusion that opening at least one restaurant/store or securing at least one franchisee within one year of opening the Boston Little Lamb restaurant was a condition precedent to the rights framed in Paragraph 9 of the Cooperation Agreement. D. 184-1 \u00b6 10. The Court concludes, however, that this condition was met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Defendant Qin testified that on May 2, 2013, Defendants opened the Boston Little Lamb restaurant and in March 2014, they also opened a Little Lamb franchise in Chicago - well within the one-year obligation. D. 188-2 at 5-7. Second, Defendants provided the Court with a copy of a bank statement demonstrating a transfer of one half of the franchise fee ($22,500.00) from the Chicago franchise to Linkage, as required by the Cooperation Agreement, for the purpose of opening the Chicago franchise. D. 188-1 at 11. Plaintiffs offer no contradicting evidence challenging the wire transfer it received from Defendants' business bank account and this Court finds no reason to question its authenticity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs instead assert that the Cooperation Agreement was rescinded pursuant to a demand letter it sent Defendants on or about February 10, 2014. D. 187-1; D. 186 at 12. While the Defendants acknowledge receiving this letter, they argue it was of no legal significance because it was sent by Attorney Frank Xu (\"Attorney Xu\"), who was not \"authorized to act on behalf of Linkage.\" D. 188 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 187-1. To support this contention, Defendants maintain that it made a direct inquiry to Yu who confirmed Attorney Xu was not acting on behalf of Linkage. D. 188 at 3. Moreover, Defendants followed up with a letter, dated March 26, 2014, which it sent to Attorney Xu, explaining that Linkage was not aware of his attempt to rescind the Cooperation Agreement and that Linkage confirmed that Attorney Xu was not authorized to act on behalf its behalf. D. 188-1. The record does not reflect that Attorney Xu challenged or responded to Defendants' letter. 188-1 \u00b6 7. Even assuming Attorney Xu was acting on behalf of Linkage, however, Linkage could not terminate the license in this matter under the terms of the Cooperation Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mercado-Salinas v.

D. 186 at 12. The undisputed material facts do not support a finding of fraudulent misrepresentation. Here, Plaintiffs fail to show how Defendants' marital status affected the ability to negotiate in good faith when it entered into the Cooperation Agreement authorizing Defendants, among other things, to use its Trademark. Plaintiffs do not argue that Defendants misinformed them about their marital status, but rather that Defendants somehow purposely concealed this information with the specific intent to induce them to enter into the Cooperation Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 186 at 14-15. Plaintiffs, however, offer no evidence to demonstrate this contention. Furthermore, Plaintiffs have also failed to demonstrate how it relied on the allegedly fraudulent misrepresentation and did so to their detriment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The Court dismissed the contract claims arising from same only because of its binding forum selection clause. D. 81 at 8-12. Nothing about that legal analysis makes the Cooperation Agreement unenforceable or bars Defendants' reliance upon it here for asserting that they had a license from Plaintiffs for use of the Trademark and in defense against Plaintiffs' trademark infringement claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Taken together, the facts here indicate that Plaintiffs have not satisfied its burden of showing disputed issues of material fact as to the trademark infringement claim. To the contrary, the uncontested record demonstrates that Linkage appointed Defendant Xu as \"its exclusive agent of restaurant franchise market in the [U.S.] under the [T]rademarks 'Little Lamb' and 'Happy Grassland,' \"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, and as mentioned above, it granted Defendant Xu the right \"to operate solely or jointly with other third party franchise restaurants under the above [T]rademarks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition to the express authorization outlined in the Cooperation Agreement, the undisputed facts demonstrate that Linkage participated and supported Defendants' use of its Trademark when it partook in the selection of the \"Little Lamb\" location, D. 182 \u00b6 33; D. 187 \u00b6 33, and announced the opening of the Boston Little Lamb restaurant in its corporate newsletter including a photograph of its Trademark, D. 182 \u00b6 9H; D. 187 \u00b6 9H; D. 184-4 at 2-3. Linkage promoted the opening of the Little Lamb restaurant in Boston, including its use of the Trademark. D. 182 \u00b6\u00b6 49-51; D. 184 \u00b6 12. Xie admits that he helped with the\n   design of the restaurant's menu, website and marketing materials that included the Trademark.

Moreover, Plaintiffs' action in regard to the Trademark in the wake of the Cooperation Agreement evidenced that Defendants were authorized to use same. For one example, the specimens that Plaintiff Linkage filed with the USTO on December 29, 2013 were photographs of fixtures and the menu at the Little Lamb restaurant in Boston that Defendants were operating pursuant to their agreement.

Accordingly, the Court denies summary judgment on Counterclaim VI as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    b) Counterclaim III: Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants argue that Xie owed them a fiduciary duty because they were \"partners\" in the Boston Little Lamb restaurant. D. 181 at 16. To prove a breach of fiduciary duty under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must establish \"(1) the existence of a duty of a fiduciary nature, based upon the relationship of the parties, (2) breach of that duty, and (3) a causal relationship between that breach and some resulting harm to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Amorim Holding Financeria, S.G.P.S., S.A. v.

Mass 2014). Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Xie had a fiduciary duty to Defendants Xu and Qin,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the\n   Court cannot find on this record as a matter of undisputed fact that Xie breached such duty. As noted above, the record reveals a factual dispute about the alleged contractual disputes and Defendants rely on some of the same to argue that Xie has also breached his fiduciary duty. D. 181 at 17. Defendants also contends that Xie's failure to share in Little Lamb's losses was also a breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060615\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/53/279/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although Xie contests same, he does so by relying upon excerpts of Defendants' bank accounts (including expenditures for golf and other matters) to suggest that such losses, if any, are inflated, but fails to connect such expenditures to Defendants' assertion of its losses. Defendants, however, have failed to explain the basis or calculation of losses attributable to Xie other than the conclusory attestation by Qin that such losses attributable to him are $122,000. D. 184 \u00b6 27. Neither is a sufficient basis to decide this as a matter of undisputed fact. Having concluded that any breach of fiduciary duty cannot be found as a matter of undisputed fact, the Court denies summary judgment to Defendants on Counterclaim III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    c) Counterclaim IV: Fraud/Misrepresentation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This Court also cannot resolve the counterclaim alleging fraud or misrepresentation by Xie on the present record. Defendants allege that Xie committed fraud by deliberately misrepresenting that he was an experienced master chef. D. 181 at 18; D. 182 \u00b6\u00b6 76, 83-87. \"The elements of fraud consist of '[1] a false representation [2] of a matter of material fact [3] with knowledge of its falsity [4] for the purpose of inducing [action] thereon, and [5] that the plaintiff relied upon the representation as true and acted upon it to his [or her] damage.' \"\n   <em>\n    Balles v.

Plaintiffs contest Defendants' assertion, contending that there was no misrepresentation about Xie's qualifications, D. 187 \u00b6\u00b6 86, 87 (relying upon Xu's affidavit). Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment to Defendants on Counterclaim IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    d) Counterclaim V: Conversion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants also argue that Xie is liable for conversion because he \"absconded\" with partnership property. D. 181 at 18. To prove conversion, Defendants must show that Plaintiffs \"intentionally or wrongfully exercised acts of ownership, control or dominion over personal property to which [they] ha[d] no right of possession at the time.\"\n   <em>\n    Grand Pac.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court ALLOWS Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to Counts V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX and DENIES the motion as Counterclaims I, II, III, IV, V and VI.
