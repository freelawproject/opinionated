Section 4247(b), in turn, permits this court to order an examination under section 4241 to determine \"whether the person is suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204247\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4)(A).

The trial date of November 29, 2018, is postponed. Instead, the court will hold a competency hearing on November 29, 2018. Pending the competency hearing, the court DENIES without prejudice White's motion to dismiss. If the court determines that White is not competent to proceed under section 4248, White can renew his motion to dismiss. The court DENIES in part White's motion to hold discovery in abeyance [D.E. 70], but relieves White from being deposed or responding to written discovery requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   SO ORDERED.
