Plaintiffs are healthcare providers who brought ten claims against defendant health insurers: four purportedly arising under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\") and six supplementary state law claims. Defendants initially moved under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (6) to dismiss the entirety of Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, challenging Plaintiffs' standing under ERISA. I denied Defendants' motion at that early stage of the litigation because I was persuaded that Plaintiffs alleged a plausible ERISA claim.\n   <em>\n    Bloom v. Indep. Blue Cross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288903\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/431/#p443\">\n    152 F.Supp.3d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 443 (E.D. Pa. 2015). Extensive discovery followed and Defendants now seek summary judgment, once again asserting that Plaintiffs lack standing to sue under ERISA, an argument that now has controlling force in light of a recent Third Circuit decision. Plaintiffs have had ample opportunity to develop their case in the last three years but have failed to unearth additional facts necessary to shore up their counterargument on ERISA standing. More importantly, the Third Circuit has since that time taken up and definitively answered the dispositive\n   legal questions in this case: anti-assignment clauses in ERISA-governed plans are enforceable and waivable only by a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act.\n   <em>\n    Am. Orthopedic &amp; Sports Med. v. Indep. Blue Cross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516958\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/445/\">\n    890 F.3d 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2018). A straight forward application of the rules articulated in\n   <em>\n    American Orthopedic\n   </em>\n   leads me to conclude that Plaintiffs have neither direct nor derivative standing under ERISA with the result that I must grant Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on all four ERISA claims. And because I decline to exercise discretionary supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims, I dismiss the entirety of Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Defendants also contract with healthcare providers to provide medical services to their members at negotiated rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dr. Bloom was a participating provider in Defendants' network of healthcare providers from May 2005 to October 2013 and rendered medical services to some of Defendants' members under the terms of their ERISA-governed healthcare plans. Pls.' Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 37. Things went fairly smoothly for a number of years: Dr. Bloom and his associates treated patients covered by Defendants' member plans and Defendants made direct payments to Dr. Bloom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. But, in 2006, Defendants began disputing covered services and payments due Dr. Bloom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-58. Dr. Bloom responded by seeking pre-approval of coverage from Defendants before administering medical treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-105. That is, Dr. Bloom, through the associates at his practice, began consistently telephoning Defendants' representatives and seeking confirmation that disputed services were indeed covered by member plans-before administering and billing for treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And, consistently, Dr. Bloom received such pre-approval from Defendants' representatives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nevertheless, in 2007, Defendants demanded reimbursement for alleged \"overpayments\" made to Dr. Bloom for certain procedures and unilaterally \"offset\" new claims due Dr. Bloom against the alleged past overpayments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-58, 100. Defendants also initiated an audit of Dr. Bloom's billing history by sending a financial investigator to Plaintiffs' offices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. And, by letter dated September 16, 2013, Defendants unilaterally terminated their agreement with Dr. Bloom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107. But if that weren't enough, Defendants took an aggressive stand and referred allegations of insurance fraud against Dr. Bloom to the state Attorney General.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-80. This led to Dr. Bloom's arrest for charges including insurance fraud, theft by deception, and receiving stolen property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.

Dr. Bloom asserts that Defendants' plan members transferred their ERISA standing to him via an assignment of rights. Pls.' Resp. Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. 35-36, ECF No. 73. He points to the standard \"Financial Policy\" form that he arranged for his patients to sign, patients that included Defendants' members. Pls.' Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 122-124. This form included the following assignment clause: \"For the professional or medical benefits allowable and otherwise payable to me under my current insurance policy as payment toward the total charges for the benefit services rendered. THIS IS A DIRECT ASSIGNMENT OF MY RIGHTS AND BENEFITS UNDER THIS POLICY.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.

But the Third Circuit went further in\n   <em>\n    American Orthopedic\n   </em>\n   and also ruled that healthcare providers such as Plaintiffs here lack\n   <em>\n    derivative\n   </em>\n   standing to sue under ERISA where members' healthcare plans contain valid anti-assignment clauses.\n   <em>\n    Am.

The anti-assignment clause here is valid under\n   <em>\n    American Orthopedic\n   </em>\n   and therefore barred Defendants' plan participants from assigning their rights-including their standing to sue under ERISA-to Plaintiff healthcare providers here. This differs from my ruling at the pleading stage. But I reached my \"somewhat unsatisfying conclusion\" at that time because it wasn't clear that the anti-assignment clause here prohibited both the right to receive benefit payments and the right to sue under ERISA.\n   <em>\n    Bloom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288903\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/431/#p443\">\n    152 F.Supp.3d at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That ambiguity is now resolved. In evaluating an anti-assignment clause nearly identical to the one at issue here, the Third Circuit affirmed that, due to the valid and enforceable anti-assignment clause, the plaintiff healthcare provider did not have either the right to receive payments or the right to sue under ERISA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288903\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/431/#p443\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288903\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/431/#p443\">\n    at 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs have offered no additional argument to circumvent the newly issued ruling from the Third Circuit and I can conjure none.
