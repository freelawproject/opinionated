Batten, Sr., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case involves a failed real estate sales transaction. The purported buyer, Plaintiff Ridgeline, has sued the two Defendants (collectively, \"MidCap\") under theories of breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment. Now before the Court is MidCap's motion [18] to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   MidCap was the lender holding a note and security deed with respect to a medical office building in Acworth, Cobb County, Georgia, known as Governors Pavilion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As of September 2017, the amount owing under the loan was approximately $5.7 million, and the loan was in default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before foreclosing on the property, MidCap and Ridgeline discussed the possibility of Ridgeline purchasing the property from the borrower. On August 16, Ridgeline's principal, Jeff Axley, sent an email to MidCap's authorized agent, Lawrence Brin, to \"make sure [Ridgeline was] understanding this deal accurately.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the email, Axley outlined five points summarizing the deal, the most salient being that: (1) Ridgeline would offer to purchase the property from the defaulting borrower; (2) Ridgeline would pay the existing $5.7 million loan balance down to $5 million; and (3) MidCap would loan Ridgeline the $5 million to purchase the property at an agreed-upon interest rate. Ridgeline made the offer to the defaulting borrower, but it rejected the offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the default of the loan, MidCap told Ridgeline that it intended to foreclose on the property and that after doing so it would sell the property to Ridgeline on the same terms-a purchase price of $5.7 million with MidCap financing $5 million of the purchase price at an agreed-upon interest rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before the foreclosure sale, MidCap requested that Axley visit and inspect the property-which he did-so that Ridgeline would be ready to close shortly after the foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In October, MidCap sent Ridgeline several documents related to the property, including lease agreements, a survey, and various reports. MidCap advised Ridgeline that the terms of MidCap's proposed sale to Ridgeline would not be reduced to writing prior to the foreclosure sale because MidCap did not want it to appear as if it was chilling the bidding at the foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 7, MidCap credit bid the amount of the debt at the foreclosure sale and thus acquired the property. Axley was present at the foreclosure sale but did not bid because of his understanding that MidCap would purchase the property and then sell it to Ridgeline. After the sale, Axley and Brin met and agreed that MidCap would sell the property to Ridgeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 8, Axley emailed Brin and requested a term sheet and stated that after MidCap dealt with the paperwork from the foreclosure sale, the parties could \"address the contract between us.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 9, MidCap emailed a letter (the \"term sheet\") to Ridgeline, outlining in detail the proposed financing terms for the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In response, Ridgeline paid the good faith deposit, and on November 14 the parties held a conference call to discuss the closing process. Then things changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 7, Brin told Axley that MidCap might not sell the property to Ridgeline because it had received a lucrative offer to lease all the vacant space in the property which greatly increased its value-perhaps even doubling it. He also told Axley that MidCap would reimburse Ridgeline for the deposit, expenses incurred, and an additional amount to be determined. Five weeks later, on January 12, 2018, Brin confirmed that MidCap would not go forward with the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 30, Ridgeline informed MidCap that it was willing and able to close on the property on the financing terms in the term sheet or for cash. MidCap refused. Ridgeline sued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 27, Ridgeline filed an amended complaint, alleging six counts. First, it seeks specific performance of the alleged verbal contract to sell the property. It also asserts claims for breach of contract for the sale of the property and breach of the\n   contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing. Ridgeline alternatively asserts claims for promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment, and it seeks to recover its expenses of litigation pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-6-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 18, MidCap filed this motion to dismiss, arguing that it has no contractual or other obligation to Ridgeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard on a Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint provide \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]\" This pleading standard does not require \"detailed factual allegations,\" but it does demand \"more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaparro v.

Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ridgeline is not suing MidCap for breach of the November 9 term sheet. Rather, it contends that the parties formed a binding\n   <em>\n    oral\n   </em>\n   contract\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   the delivery of the term sheet for the sale of the property, and that the term sheet related only to financing. MidCap responds that its promise to sell the property is unenforceable because the promise was one to sell land, and such promises must be in writing. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-5-30(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although Ridgeline points to emails between the parties, there is no writing signed by MidCap containing a promise to sell the property. Moreover, the term sheet pertained only to the financing of the purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ridgeline responds that there was sufficient part performance of MidCap's promise to remove it from the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds does not apply \"[w]here there has been performance on one side, accepted by the other in accordance with the contract[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-5-31(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In order for the part-performance exception to the statute of frauds to apply, \"such performance must be essential to the terms of the contract sued upon, and substantial enough to result in a detriment to one party and a benefit to the other to such an extent that the refusal to enforce the contract will result in fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Breckenridge Creste Apartments, Ltd. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff's promissory estoppel claim was based upon the defendant's alleged promises to the plaintiff that the parties \"would appear on a reality show\" and \"pursue a wig venture\" together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The promises in\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   were indeed vague and indefinite. But they were not like MidCap's simple and straightforward\n   promise to sell the property to Ridgeline. Accepting the well-pleaded facts in Ridgeline's amended complaint as true, MidCap promised to sell the property to Ridgeline for approximately $5.7 million. At the motion to dismiss stage, these allegations are \"sufficiently definite to support an action for promissory estoppel under Georgia law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273228\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/609/994/#p1001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   MidCap next contends that its alleged promise to sell the property to Ridgeline was a mere promise to \"work something out regarding a future business venture.\" MidCap again cites\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that such promises are unenforceable agreements to agree. While\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   does state this principle of law, it is again inapposite; MidCap specifically promised to sell the property to Ridgeline at an agreed-upon price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Next, MidCap argues that Ridgeline's reliance on MidCap's alleged promise to sell the property was unreasonable as a matter of law. Citing paragraph 1 of the amended complaint (\"Ridgeline acquires and sells commercial real estate, including small medical office buildings.\"), MidCap asserts that Ridgeline \"is a sophisticated corporate entity that can be assumed to know the risks and advantages of real estate transactions that make doctrines such as the Statute of Frauds necessary.\" [22] at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   MidCap similarly argues that \"Plaintiff's reliance on MidCap's discussions and representations regarding the Property was unreasonable in the face of Plaintiff's extensive experience in the commercial real estate market.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Indeed, Ridgeline's counsel conceded at oral argument that Ridgeline's principal, Axley, is a sophisticated businessperson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"Questions of reasonable reliance are usually for the jury to resolve.\"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v.

However, where the reliance is unreasonable as a matter of law, the promissory estoppel claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   There are several problems with Ridgeline's purported reliance on MidCap's promise to sell it the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, Axley understood that MidCap's promise was to bid at the foreclosure sale the approximately $5.7 million that the then-owner of the property owed to MidCap. The parties never discussed what would happen if a third party (or even the then-owner) had outbid MidCap at the foreclosure sale, which would have prevented MidCap from selling the property to Ridgeline. This raises a question as to the reasonableness of Ridgeline's reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   More problematic for Ridgeline is the fact that it is a sophisticated business with years of experience purchasing and selling commercial real estate. This Court is dubious about the Georgia doctrine of promissory estoppel being used to allow a multi-billion-dollar real estate manager with years of business experience to enforce an oral promise to sell a $5.7 million piece of commercial real estate. Although the Court has found no Georgia cases directly on point, the promissory estoppel law of other jurisdictions supports the Court's skepticism.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    168th &amp; Dodge, LP v.

The benefit for which Ridgeline seeks compensation is the benefit MidCap fortuitously obtained when a third party offered to lease the entire building, thereby increasing the property's value. Ridgeline does not allege that it caused the third party to offer to lease the property, and Ridgeline's conduct in not bidding at the foreclosure sale is not what conferred upon MidCap the increase in the property's value.
