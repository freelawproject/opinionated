This market is critical to the short selling of stocks, a not-uncommon investment tool. The thrust of Plaintiffs' allegations is that Defendants conspired to boycott new market entrants - specifically, AQS, SL-x, and Data Explorers - in order to maintain their monopoly grip as prime broker intermediaries, and, by extension, to charge excessive fees under the cover of price opacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants have jointly moved to dismiss the Amended Class Action Complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\" or \"AC\") under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on five primary bases: the allegations are implausible; the alleged conduct as to SL-x and Data Explorers neither qualifies as\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unlawful nor violates the rule of reason; Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing; Plaintiffs' claims are untimely; and Plaintiffs' claim of unjust enrichment fails for the same reasons as their antitrust claim. Defendant EquiLend adds, in a supplemental motion to dismiss, that its alleged conduct was consistent with rational business strategy, and that the Court lacks specific personal jurisdiction over EquiLend Europe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As set forth in the remainder of this Opinion, the Court rejects these arguments and denies Defendants' motions to dismiss. While it remains to be seen whether Plaintiffs' factual allegations will be borne out in discovery, the Court is not permitted to dismiss them at this early stage of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Amended Complaint alleges the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the class period, Defendants Bank of America,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Credit Suisse,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Goldman Sachs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.P.

(AC \u00b6\u00b6 50, 56, 61, 69-70, 77-78, 86-87). The Prime Broker Defendants are each partial owners of Defendant EquiLend, and their employees served on EquiLend's Board of Directors during the Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Employees from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley also served on the Boards of Directors for the Options Clearing Corporation (\"OCC\") and the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (\"DTCC\"), which are\n   central clearinghouses for stock loan transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 50, 61, 69, 77). Defendant UBS's employees served on the Board of Directors for DTCC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86). Defendant EquiLend is a \"dealer consortium,\" which, it is alleged, Defendants used as a front for their conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System (\"IPERS\"), Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (\"LACERA\"), Orange County Employees Retirement System (\"OCERS\"), and Sonoma County Employees' Retirement Association (\"SCERA\") provide retirement and other benefits to public employees. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 40-43). Each manages many billions of dollars in assets and each has lent significant volumes of stock to the Prime Broker Defendants and their clients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). SCERA has also borrowed significant volumes of stock from Defendant Credit Suisse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43). Plaintiff Torus Capital, LLC (\"Torus\") is a trading firm, headquartered in Connecticut, that has borrowed significant volumes of stock from Defendants Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. IPERS, LACERA, OCERS, SCERA, and Torus (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") bring this suit as a class action on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated persons and entities who entered into stock loan transactions with the Prime Broker Defendants from January 7, 2009, to the present (the \"Class Period\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). The proposed class in this action includes borrowers and lenders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Stock Loan Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Stock lending transactions are used primarily to facilitate the short selling of stocks, in which short sellers predict that a stock price will decrease. (AC \u00b6 94). Short sellers generally do not own the stocks they sell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 95). Instead, they typically use the services of a broker-dealer to \"borrow\" the stock, in exchange for cash collateral and a lending fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 95, 97). In a stock \"loan\" transaction, the lender transfers title of the security to the borrower, and the borrower promises to return equivalent securities in the future, in exchange for return of the collateral. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 105-06). A short seller who accurately predicts that a stock price will decrease can profit by borrowing the stock, selling the \"borrowed\" stock at a high price to a third party, waiting for the stock price to fall, and then buying back the equivalent stock at the lower price to return to the \"lender.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 95, 97, 105-06). This process is risky in part because stock loans typically have no set termination date; either the lender or borrower can terminate the loan at will. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 106).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A stock lending transaction generally involves a number of different parties. (AC \u00b6 97). The owner of the stock is known as the \"stock lender\" or the \"beneficial owner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). An intermediary agent, called an \"agent lender,\" works for the lender in exchange for a portion of the lending fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Agent lenders are often banks that service many lenders, and thus have large aggregate collections of stocks to loan out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 107). A \"broker-dealer\" acts as an intermediary matchmaker between the agent lenders and prospective borrowers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 97). The broker-dealer collects a fee from the borrower, takes a cut, and pays the remainder to the lender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At present, broker-dealers do not reveal to either lenders or borrowers what their counterparty has paid or received, or what percentage of the fee the broker-dealer has pocketed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"Stock borrowers\" are\n   generally investors who borrow stocks to facilitate short selling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The stock loan market is known as an \"over-the-counter\" (or \"OTC\") market because it has no central marketplace where participants can engage in direct exchanges, or obtain real-time data about trading prices and transaction volumes. (AC \u00b6 98). These characteristics of the market leave prospective lenders and borrowers dependent on the broker-dealer intermediaries, who often set the price of a trade without negotiation, and who keep data about the prices and volume of trades hidden from the market as a whole. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 98-99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Prime brokers\" are broker-dealers who offer an array of services that include stock lending. (AC \u00b6 102). Between 2014 and 2017, the Prime Broker Defendants controlled between 76% and 80% of market share for prime brokerage services, and, accordingly, the vast majority of real-time price and volume data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 102-03). In 2016, the Prime Broker Defendants' share of lending fees amounted to approximately 65% of total industry revenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 113). In presumed justification, Defendants represented to their clients that one aspect of their role as prime brokers was to \"protect[ ] clients from credit and counterparty risk by standing between clients and lenders in every stock loan trade.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 147).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the stock loan market has failed to evolve alongside other, more efficient markets for financial services that take advantage of central electronic trading exchanges, where buyers and sellers can transact more directly, and more transparently, such as the publicly-traded stock exchange. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 114-16). Financial markets with central electronic trading exchanges operate through a central counterparty, called a \"clearinghouse,\" which acts as an intermediary between lenders and borrowers, and which guarantees the obligations of each to the other, thereby reducing risk from counterparty default. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9 n.3, 116 n.25). \"The clearinghouse becomes the borrower to every lender and the lender to every borrower ... [and] maintains sufficient capital to stand behind every trade it clears.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 145). Participants on these central electronic trading exchanges transact with the clearinghouse via \"clearing brokers,\" who match buyers and sellers, and who sponsor the participants' access to the central clearing platform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 115, 116 n.25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Clearing brokers are generally members of the clearinghouse who have contributed to its capitalization. (AC \u00b6 120 n.26). They \"vouch for a counterparty's credit with the clearinghouse ... [and t]he clearinghouse then clears the trade, having marked the transaction against the sponsoring clearing member's credit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In 2016, OCC was the only major clearinghouse that both was licensed by the SEC to clear securities lending transactions and offered clearing of stock loan trades. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 289). It is alleged that central clearing threatened Defendants' prime brokerage business in part because, with central clearing, the clearinghouse assumed the risk of counterparty default against which Defendants purported to protect their clients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 147).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the lack of a central electronic trading exchange, and the opacity of price and volume data, in the stock loan market impede price consistency, obstruct performance benchmarking of service providers, and enable the Prime Broker Defendants to charge excessive fees as middlemen. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 103-04, 116, 118). Plaintiffs allege that a regulated, centralized exchange would lower borrowing costs and increase returns for stock loan transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The New Market Entrants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Quadriserv/AQS:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During the period relevant to the Amended Complaint, several entities attempted to bring innovation to the stock loan market. In 2001, industry veterans founded Quadriserv to provide new financial services to that market. (AC \u00b6 127). One early Quadriserv product offered a \"give to get\" data-sharing service for daily stock loan transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 128-29). Quadriserv launched another early product that acted as a registered broker-dealer, raised capital to make it a creditworthy counterparty, and matched borrowers and lenders anonymously for a flat, transparent fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 140-42). By 2005, more than $2 billion in stock loan transactions were matched on the Quadriserv platform, which maxed out the platform's credit exposure limit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 143).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Quadriserv then began developing a second platform through its subsidiary, Automated Equity Finance Markets, Inc. (\"AQS\"). (AC \u00b6 144). In or about 2005 or 2006, AQS began negotiating a partnership whereby OCC would provide central clearinghouse services for AQS transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 148). As noted, the Prime Broker Defendants viewed central clearing as a threat to their control of the stock loan market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 147). Accordingly, AQS undertook a series of moves to evade the influence of the Prime Broker Defendants' representatives on the OCC Board, following which the Board passed a proposed deal with AQS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 149-52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On January 7, 2009, Quadriserv launched AQS and announced its agreement with OCC. (AC \u00b6 154). According to an OCC newsroom release dated January 7, 2009, AQS offered a platform to \"match lenders and borrowers using a hybrid auction and continuous price discovery mechanism\" where \"matched loans [would] be processed through the OCC, which [would] provide central counterparty guarantees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). OCC began providing central clearing services for AQS transactions in early 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 156). In late 2009, AQS announced that Eurex, a European clearinghouse, had agreed to provide central clearing services for AQS transactions involving European equities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By September 2009, AQS was \"primed\" to offer direct stock loan transactions via clearing brokers, in partnership with OCC and SunGard's Loanet platform, which is an \"accounting and settlement processing system for securities lending[.]\" (AC \u00b6\u00b6 161-62). In October 2010, SunGuard integrated its technology with AQS, and a SunGuard vice president and general manager stated that SunGuard's customers had \"responded favorably\" to the integration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 162-63).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   AQS provided trade matching, access to central clearing via a broker, live pricing data, daily liquidity data, and the option to trade anonymously. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 146, 159).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   AQS received \"strong encouragement\" from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which thought AQS had potential to improve systemic risk controls in the stock loan market. (AC \u00b6 155). AQS also received support from Barclays Global Investors, an asset manager and stock lender; Renaissance Technologies, a quantitative hedge fund and stock borrower; Bessemer Ventures, a venture capital fund; and Deutsche Bourse, an exchange that supported AQS through its subsidiaries, one of which was Eurex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 160). AQS received approximately $100 million in investment funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 299). Citi was an early investor in AQS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 157 n.37). Defendant Bank of America made equity\n   investments in AQS in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 205). Some hedge fund clients switched their prime brokerage services to Bank of America, \"\n   <em>\n    expressly referencing AQS\n   </em>\n   in their decisions to do so.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 157 (emphasis in original) ). AQS also received support from \"numerous agent lenders\" because of its ability to reduce fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 165). AQS's own analysis of the market predicted that its services would \"increase the market volume\" and reduce broker-dealer fees by over 30%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 167-69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    b. SL-x:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   SL-x, which stands for \"securities lending exchange,\" was founded in late 2010. (AC \u00b6 172). SL-x was designed to enable \"prime brokers, broker-dealers, and agent lenders\" to communicate bids and offers simultaneously to all of their existing market contacts, and to engage in simultaneous negotiations, without requiring a phone call, Bloomberg message, instant message, fax, or other one-to-one means of communication. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 173-75). SL-x provided an automated matching service for \"easy-to-borrow stock\" transactions, and a preliminary screening service for potential counterparties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 175, 180). Broker-dealers and agent lenders could trade anonymously on the SL-x platform, which could \"progressively reveal information about each party, and important criteria such as number and price of securities and the nature and amount of collateral.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 179-80). SL-x also permitted access to central clearing through Eurex for trades in certain European stocks, and \"took steps to access central clearing in the U.S.,\" such as beginning negotiations with, and building a platform that could connect to, OCC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 178, 233). Centrally-cleared SL-x transactions \"were estimated\" to provide broker-dealers with \"more than $8 billion in capital savings benefits through balance sheet risk weighting and the zeroing out of counterparty credit risk when facing a central counterparty[,]\" in addition to \"reduced operational and administrative costs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 181).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   SL-x also planned to offer \"a real-time display of the price and quantity of completed loans\" (which would reveal the fees taken by the Prime Broker Defendants). (AC \u00b6\u00b6 175, 183-84). SL-x intended to provide \"real-time pricing information (including stock name, trade time, trade quantity, and trade price) on a live ticker viewable by all platform participants, providing an up-to-the-minute stream of available, actionable stock loan prices for all SL-x users.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 177). In addition, SL-x \"worked to integrate data and analytics from other market sources.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   SL-x received initial positive reception. One Prime Broker Defendant called SL-x \"the most intelligent, thoughtful and usable approach to the [stock loan] market that we have ever seen.\" (AC \u00b6\u00b6 227, 230-32). And on December 4, 2012, UBS executives told SL-x that transitioning to a centrally-cleared market would in principle help market participants, and recognized \"the unmistakable momentum arising from regulatory considerations and other pressures\" toward central clearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 231). In an October 16, 2012 meeting, Karl von Buren, HSBC's Global Head of Equity Finance, told SL-x executives that the stock loan market was moving towards central clearing, and that HSBC might embrace SL-x. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 232). J.P. Morgan Chase executives also acknowledged that central clearing would benefit the stock loan market overall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In meetings with SL-x executives on February 26, March 19, May 9, July 10, and September 6, 2013, executives from Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and UBS praised the SL-x platform. (AC \u00b6 230). Specifically, on February\n   26, 2013, in a meeting in London, Karl Bishti, the European Prime Brokerage Desk Head at Credit Suisse and an Associate Director of EquiLend, told SL-x executives that the stock lending market would \"change overnight\" to increase automation and efficiency if SL-x gained broad support. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 240-41). Bishti raved that SL-x had \"all the bells and whistles\" he expected, lacked nothing, and had \"no shortcomings\" that would impede its marketability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 230). Kevin Soobadoo, Head of Supply Trading at Deutsche Bank, called the SL-x platform \"brilliant,\" \"impressive,\" and the \"most state-of-the-art piece of kit to hit the securities lending space.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On February 28 and October 17, 2013, executives from Nomura and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale called the platform \"fantastic\" and \"really an awesome product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). And on September 6, 2013, UBS executives Casey Whymark and Laurent Issner called the platform \"very cool\" and noted that they were \"impressed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Data Explorers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In 2002, securities market participants founded Data Explorers, which initially offered a \"give to get\" data-aggregation service for stock loan transactions that enabled customers to compare the prices for their own transactions to those of comparable market participants. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 130-34). By 2007, every major agent lender and 20 borrower clients were participating in the service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 137). By 2009, Data Explorers had acquired market data from both agent lenders and beneficial owners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 185). Several Prime Broker Defendants also shared pricing data with Data Explorers in return for market analytics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 138).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Data Explorers provided separate products for agent lenders and borrowers, and strictly segregated the data for each. (AC \u00b6 136). Plaintiffs allege that Data Explorers maintained this segregation for the benefit of the Prime Broker Defendants, who remained the sole actors in the market who knew the \"spread\" between what borrowers were charged and what lenders received. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 136, 139). However, in or about 2010, Data Explorers began to offer \"performance\" data, and also started successfully marketing its product to other types of customers, including hedge funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 187-88). The performance data service enabled end-user borrowers and lenders to compare the financial terms of their own trades to those of comparable trades. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 188).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    4. EquiLend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   If AQS, SL-x, and Data Explorers were the\n   <em>\n    enfants terribles\n   </em>\n   of the stock loan world, EquiLend was the anachronism against which they rebelled. EquiLend was founded in 2001 and provides primarily post-trade \"reconciliation\" services for stock loan transactions, verifying that the shares, the margins, and the collateral were handled correctly, as well as other post-trade services such as billing delivery and recalls. (AC \u00b6 305). EquiLend also offers a daily automated service to effect transactions for stock loans between agent lenders and broker-dealers at predetermined fixed rates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 306). However, it \"does not offer fully electronic, price-transparent trading capabilities or the ability to negotiate terms with multiple potential counterparties simultaneously, nor does it offer central clearing to market end users.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 307).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the Prime Broker Defendants \"used their positions on the EquiLend Board to co-opt EquiLend as a vehicle through which to promote and achieve their anticompetitive objectives.\" (AC \u00b6 304). For most of the Class Period, EquiLend had ten owners, six of whom were the Prime Broker Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 122, 309). Numerous members of EquiLend's\n   Board of Directors were employees of the Prime Broker Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 309). EquiLend's directors met regularly to discuss \"industry challenges such as central clearing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 249-50). Under the Prime Broker Defendants' control, EquiLend acted \"in illegitimate, non-competitive ways ... that in many cases did not further its own economic interests.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 304). Specifically,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [t]he Prime Broker Defendants used EquiLend to: (i) suppress price transparency by refusing to release pricing data to its customers, despite having access to this data and despite a clear market demand for such data; (ii) force competitors out of the market by coercing their customers to use EquiLend ... even though EquiLend ... offered lower quality or entirely different services than what their customers desired and what prospective competitors offered; and (iii) stymie pro-competitive market developments by purchasing valuable patents and trading platform technology from SL-x and AQS for valuable consideration, and then refusing to use or capitalize on those assets in any way[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 311).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants' conspiratorial communications in emails, Bloomberg chats, text messages, internal memoranda, and recorded phone calls are allegedly housed on EquiLend's servers (as well as those of the individual Prime Broker Defendants). (AC \u00b6 312). These communications show that Defendants told EquiLend's representatives, including its CEO, Brian Lamb, not to \"break rank,\" and not to take action \"until the 'EquiLend banks' determined as a group whether they would support any of the new platforms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). Of note, when EquiLend Board member William Conley discussed ensuring that data transparency would not \"kill our business,\" the businesses to which he was referring were those of the Prime Broker Defendants, not of EquiLend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 313). During the Prime Broker Defendants' individual meetings with AQS and SL-x, they \"made clear that they considered themselves bound by understandings reached in EquiLend board meetings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Amended Complaint proffers several allegations to support an inference of counter-profit behavior. In or about August 2011, Palamon Capital Partners and SL-x jointly proposed to acquire EquiLend at a price that would have yielded a profit for all parties. (AC \u00b6 314). The EquiLend Board refused to engage or negotiate the offer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). And in late 2014 or 2015, the tables were turned: \"[T]he Prime Broker Defendants directed EquiLend to purchase [SL-x and AQS] to complete the elimination of them as competitors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 270). Plaintiffs argue that, if \"EquiLend had truly behaved as a profit-maximizing firm, it would naturally have ... capitalized on the valuable assets and technology\" purchased from AQS and SL-x. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 315). One EquiLend executive \"complained that EquiLend needed to upgrade its services and build something like SL-x, and EquiLend never did so.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Based on these actions, Plaintiffs conclude that EquiLend \"is not the independent joint venture that it purports to be[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 319).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Defendants' Anticompetitive Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Allegations Concerning AQS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To review, Plaintiffs allege that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs led the other Prime Broker Defendants in a conspiracy to block new market entrants from offering electronic trading and clearing platforms and services to enhance price transparency. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 198-99, 212). As one facet of this conspiracy, the Prime Broker Defendants \"agreed on a common stance vis-\u00e0-vis\n   AQS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 210). Following initial meetings with AQS executives in or about 2009, Goldman Sachs refused to support the AQS platform at all. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 196, 209). At a 2009 meeting between the head of the Stock Loan Desk at Bank of America and William Conley of Goldman Sachs, Conley said that he was \"opposed to transparency in any form\" because of the \"spread\" fees that Goldman Sachs made on stock loan transactions; indeed, Conley \"got so angry at the mention of [AQS's] name that spit was coming out of his mouth.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 200). Conley pressured Bank of America to \"reverse course and to join the opposition to Quadriserv/AQS[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At the same time, Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and UBS each communicated to AQS \"that the only way they would support the platform was if AQS made it ... a broker-only platform ... [and] lenders and borrowers would be barred from trading on the platform.\" (AC \u00b6 210). When AQS refused, the Prime Broker Defendants agreed to starve AQS \"by collectively refusing to participate on the platform, and thereby to keep their trade flow and trade data outside of the platform's electronic market.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 211-12). This collective boycott of AQS compromised its utility for other market participants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 212).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In preparation for an SEC roundtable discussion on securities lending held on September 29 and 30, 2009, the Bank of America executive whom Conley had pressured \"convened what he characterized as a meeting of 'the five families' ... so the Prime Broker Defendants could settle on their collective messaging[.]\" (AC \u00b6 202). Around the same time, Goldman Sachs's Conley, a Credit Suisse employee named Shawn Sullivan, and others held a private meeting in which they discussed electronic trading platforms, where \"each agreed to oppose AQS and disparage AQS and central clearing during the roundtable discussion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 203). One participant in that meeting later stated that she felt \"sorry for what [they were] about to do\" to AQS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At the subsequent SEC meeting, Sullivan spoke out against AQS, arguing that central clearing would reduce liquidity and expose beneficial owners to greater credit risk from counterparties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 204).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   By 2011, under pressure from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and unspecified \"others,\" Bank of America withdrew its support for AQS. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 205-06). More pointedly, \"Bank of America/Merrill Lynch personnel who had formerly supported AQS were purged.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 206). Specifically, Mike Stewart, Global Co-Head of Equities and an advocate for AQS, \"was abruptly replaced with ... Stuart Hendel, the former head of prime brokerage at Morgan Stanley and UBS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Hendel directed Bank of America personnel to disavow AQS, limited the volume of transactions that the Bank of America stock loan desk was permitted to place on AQS to a small fraction of prior volume, and made no further investments in AQS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 207).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Prime Broker Defendants also undertook to stop other market participants, including their clients, from using AQS. In 2012, Goldman Sachs threatened executives at agent lender BNY Mellon, including James Slater, its Head of Global Collateral Management and Securities Finance: If BNY Mellon used AQS for stock loan transactions, \"Goldman Sachs would return all of the open stock borrowing trades with BNY and stop trading with the BNY stock loan desk altogether.\" (AC \u00b6 218). Thereafter, BNY Mellon abruptly withdrew an offer to AQS of $50 million in credit and an agreement to participate actively on the AQS platform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). And Defendants also threatened to\n   cut off an array of services to their own hedge fund clients - including Renaissance Technologies, D.E. Shaw, Millennium Management, and SAC Capital - if those clients transacted on AQS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 213, 215-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, Defendants blocked access to AQS by refusing to serve as clearing brokers. OCC's by-laws required \"that\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   broker-dealer members of OCC, such as the Prime Broker Defendants, could transact on AQS, either as the lender or borrower.\" (AC \u00b6 214). Accordingly, the Prime Broker Defendants refused to \"sponsor\" their hedge fund clients' access to AQS by \"stand[ing] in to facilitate and clear their trades.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs allege that the Prime Broker Defendants would not have refused to provide their hedge fund clients with access to AQS if they were acting unilaterally, as each would have been concerned about losing customers to other prime brokers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 217).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   By the end of 2014, AQS was struggling to maintain sufficient liquidity to act as a financially viable stock lending platform, and was marginalized in the market. (AC \u00b6 269). However, around the same time, a regulatory development sparked new interest in AQS. On January 1, 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision had issued a set of measures, known as \"Basel III,\" that \"required the Prime Broker Defendants to carry more capital on their balance sheet to cover the same risk\" in stock loan transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 274). One way banks could comply was to centrally clear stock loan transactions, \"thereby offloading the risk to a central clearing counterparty.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 276). According to Plaintiffs, staff at each Prime Broker Defendant were siloed to such a degree that the \"loan trading staff did not know, and were not told by senior management until later, that a move toward central clearing of stock loan transactions - while superficially beneficial under Basel III - would be disastrous to the bank's profitability on a much larger scale.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 278). Hence, the following drama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In 2014, Susan O'Flynn, Global Head of CCP Strategy, Governance and Optimization at Morgan Stanley, began promoting central clearing of stock loan transactions as a way to comply with Basel III while reducing balance sheet costs and increasing returns on Morgan Stanley's stock lending business. (AC \u00b6 281). O'Flynn publically supported central clearing through Eurex and OCC, though she did not share her support with senior management or executives on Morgan Stanley's stock loan desk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 282-83). In late 2015 or early 2016, executives from Morgan Stanley's stock loan business became aware of O'Flynn's activities and told O'Flynn and her direct supervisor, Thomas Wipf, Global Head of Bank Resource Management, that central clearing threatened Morgan Stanley's business as a prime broker intermediary for stock loan transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 281, 284).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Rather than retreat from the balance sheet cost savings that central clearing would provide, Wipf maintained the budget projections that O'Flynn had provided while imposing three conditions on centrally cleared trades. (AC \u00b6 287). Specifically, Wipf required that (i) central clearing maintain price opacity, meaning that neither the borrower nor the lender would know the price at which their counterparty transacted; (ii) the clearinghouse not link to an independent trading platform; and (iii) the clearinghouse not publish market data from Morgan Stanley transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Wipf also wanted the Prime Broker Defendants to gain complete control of access to the clearinghouses so that market participants would have no other choice but to use the Prime Broker Defendants' services to clear trades. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 288). That meant controlling OCC because, in 2016, OCC was the only clearinghouse licensed by the SEC that cleared stock loan trades. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 289).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   At that time, OCC was negotiating a deal to acquire AQS, and AQS was developing a new service to assist lenders in investing the cash collateral from their loans through what are known as \"repurchase agreements.\" (AC \u00b6\u00b6 291-92). Wipf devised a plan to stop the acquisition and gain exclusive control over all the pathways to central clearing, a plan that he and his colleagues at Morgan Stanley code-named \"Project Gateway.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 293). Between late 2015 and January 2016, Wipf and William Conley from Goldman Sachs met over a series of dinners in New York City that were paid for by Wipf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 294). Wipf and Conley agreed that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs should acquire AQS in order to shut it down. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Specifically, Wipf and Conley planned to persuade the other Defendants to use EquiLend to purchase AQS in order to destroy it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In a January 2016 internal call, Wipf communicated the plan to his team at Morgan Stanley, which included Susan O'Flynn; Matthew Collins; Tejash Patel, the Managing Director and Co-Head of U.S. Securities Lending; and Thomas Kinnally, the Global Head of Client Financing, Firm Financing and Collateral Risk Management. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 22, 295). During the call, Wipf stated that he and Conley had agreed to \"get a hold of this thing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 296). By use of that phrase, Wipf meant that \"Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley needed to act together to acquire AQS and shut it down.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 296).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At a series of private dinners, meetings at industry conferences, and EquiLend board meetings, executives at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs persuaded the other Defendants to join Project Gateway in order to maintain control over the \"universal gateway\" to central clearing. (AC \u00b6 297). Defendants also agreed to clear all stock loan transactions through their own pipelines to OCC, which pipelines were not connected to an electronic trading platform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). And Defendants agreed to exert influence, as Directors of OCC and EquiLend, to prevent OCC's acquisition of AQS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 298).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Late in the negotiations between OCC and AQS, OCC abruptly pulled out of the deal and stopped returning AQS's calls. (AC \u00b6 298). Shortly thereafter, on August 1, 2016, EquiLend purchased AQS's assets - the fruits of nearly $100 million in investment - for less than $5 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 299-300). Following the purchase, \"the Prime Broker Defendants did not increase their participation in the new electronic trading platform or take other action to make it prosper.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 301).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Allegations Concerning SL-x\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As with AQS, Goldman Sachs refused to support SL-x from the outset. (AC \u00b6 196). In a private meeting in 2011, William Conley told other Goldman Sachs employees that any central trading platform with counterparty clearing threatened Goldman Sachs's market position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 219). Conley told SL-x executives: \"I ain't supporting this,\" informing them that the Prime Broker Defendants would only support the evolution of central clearing through an entity that they controlled, specifically EquiLend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 220). Brad Levy, Global Head of Goldman Sachs' Principal Strategic Investments Group, told SL-x executives: \"You ain't going to get this done.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 220).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On August 1, 2011, SL-x sent a letter to EquiLend's Chairman, Jeffrey Benner, proposing a joint venture between SL-x and EquiLend that would afford EquiLend \"strong governance rights and a meaningful\n   'seat at the table' in the development of the SL-x marketplace and shift to a CCP-model.\" (AC \u00b6 221). The EquiLend Board members met in August and September 2011, decided against SL-x's proposal, agreed that no EquiLend member bank would support SL-x, and further agreed only to support such market innovations if developed within EquiLend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 223).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On September 21, 2011, EquiLend's CEO, Brian Lamb, declined SL-x's offer. (AC \u00b6 224). The same day, a Morgan Stanley employee, Edward McAleer, told SL-x that he had spoken (also on that day) with Anthony Schiavo, a Managing Director at Morgan Stanley and a Director at EquiLend, who said that SL-x should deal directly with EquiLend, not with Morgan Stanley, and that \"approaching a group of brokers outside the EquiLend arena is not an approach he wants to take.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 226). On October 12, 2011, McAleer reiterated to SL-x, copying Schiavo on the communication, that \"all the relevant people at MS\" shared the \"house view\" that \"we do not want to participate in a separate consortium,\" and noted Morgan Stanley's view \"that any solution ... needs to involve EquiLend.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 227).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Thereafter, none of the Prime Broker Defendants supported SL-x individually. (AC \u00b6 225). Each \"withheld capital and support from SL-x through the fall of 2011 and throughout 2012[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 228). From 2012 to 2014, SL-x executives met with and pitched its product to high-ranking stock loan executives at each of the six Prime Broker Defendants (Bank of America, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and UBS), all of whom sat on the board of EquiLend USA or EquiLend Europe. Each refused to support SL-x, allegedly as a result of the EquiLend agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 229). In an October 2012 meeting with SL-x executives, some unspecified prime brokers expressed concern that SL-x provided \"too much transparency,\" or \"too much immediate transparency.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 184). SL-x refused a request from J.P. Morgan for \"the ability to turn off the real-time ticker, or block certain trades from being included[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Prime Broker Defendants doubled down on this position in mid-to-late 2013, when they \"agreed to boycott SL-x, collectively refused to use its platform, and took steps to ensure that other market participants turned their back on SL-x as well.\" (AC \u00b6 236). Following initially enthusiastic meetings with SL-x executives, \"each bank went cold and, without explanation, refused to engage or proceed further with SL-x.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 237-38). In July 2013, Credit Suisse declined to join the SL-x platform, explaining that it would only join if and when the \"Big Boys\" committed to doing so and SL-x had acquired substantial liquidity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 241). Also in July 2013, UBS declined to join the SL-x platform, saying that it would not do so until SL-x had secured \"commitments from other large market participants and demonstrate[d] evidence of significant liquidity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 242). In meetings on July 26, 2013, and September 26, 2013, James Buckland, UBS's Global Head of Securities Lending, \"frequently referenced EquiLend in the context of discussing SL-x's strategy to gain widespread market acceptance of its platform, noting the benefit of being '\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     inside the club\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ' of EquiLend member banks to effectuate market changes and suggesting that any market transition towards an SL-x platform and central clearing of stock loan trades would need to come from inside EquiLend.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As with AQS, the Prime Broker Defendants \"in some instances threatened their clients with the loss of other prime brokerage services if they signed on to the SL-x\n   platform[.]\" (AC \u00b6\u00b6 237, 243). On October 12, 2012, Andrew Clayton, the Global Head of Securities Lending at stock lending agent Northern Trust, told SL-x executives that Northern Trust would not support SL-x without approval from Goldman Sachs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 252). In 2015, OCC's Chief Operating Officer told SL-x executives that \"nothing was going to happen\" between SL-x and OCC without approval from the Prime Broker Defendants and specifically from Goldman Sachs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 253). DTCC's Managing Director also told SL-x that it could not offer central clearing services to SL-x without approval from the Prime Broker Defendants and, specifically, from Goldman Sachs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Prime Broker Defendants were aware that EquiLend was an \"archaic\" and \"entrenched although unexciting system,\" with poor functionality that could not compete with SL-x's capacity. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 247-49). Nonetheless, they communicated \"similar statements\" that they would only support innovations such as SL-x's from within EquiLend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 245). On February 26, 2013, Credit Suisse representatives told SL-x executives that \"a successful launch will require cooperation of EquiLend.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 246). On June 18, 2014, in a meeting in Berlin, Morgan Stanley executives, including EquiLend Board member Edward McAleer, told SL-x that Morgan Stanley would only support central clearing through EquiLend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 243). At a meeting on July 19, 2013, Bishti told SL-x that winning market support would mean \"facing off against EquiLend\" and that transitioning to central clearing would require \"cooperation\" and \"collaboration\" with EquiLend; described EquiLend's Directors as \"key players\" and \"members of the club\"; and compared EquiLend to \"the mafia run by five crime families[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 241, 249). On August 7, 2013, John Shellard, Managing Director of Trading Services at J.P. Morgan and EquiLend Board member, told SL-x executives that there was a \"general agreement among Directors\" of EquiLend \"that industry advances should be achieved from within EquiLend,\" rather than through third parties like SL-x. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 239). In July 2014, Bank of America told SL-x executives that there was internal controversy about how endorsing SL-x's product would affect Bank of America's relationship with EquiLend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 244).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   By September 2014, SL-x had exhausted its financial resources, cancelled its U.K. trading license, and abandoned plans to enter the U.S. market. (AC \u00b6 268). After SL-x \"shut its doors,\" the Prime Broker Defendants began negotiating with SL-x's private equity owner to purchase SL-x's intellectual property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 271). In 2015, EquiLend purchased SL-x's intellectual property, without undertaking full due diligence, and allegedly with no intent to actually use it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 272). EquiLend has since shelved the patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Allegations Concerning Data Explorers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   With its 2010 offering of \"performance\" data, the Prime Broker Defendants became \"increasingly wary that Data Explorers would eventually package data that would expose the breadth of the price gap between borrowers and lenders[.]\" (AC \u00b6 186). During ten meetings that spanned 2011-2012, two Goldman Sachs employees, Shawn Byron and William Conley, \"grilled Data Explorers\" about \"siloing borrower and lender data, despite Data Explorers' constant assurances that there was no leakage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 189). Defendants \"gradually decided they could not entrust market data to a firm they did not control.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 190). Accordingly, Goldman Sachs began contacting hedge funds, including SAC Capital Advisors, to stop them from sharing data with Data Explorers, achieving\n   mixed success. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 191). \"In approximately the second or third quarter of 2010, a representative from Goldman Sachs contacted Peter Economou at State Street (a large, influential agent lender) and demanded that State Street not report any of the trading data concerning State Street's trades with Goldman Sachs to Data Explorers, threatening State Street's business if it did not comply.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). State Street refused to comply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"[W]hen borrower clients instructed Morgan Stanley to provide Data Explorers with their market data, Morgan Stanley would provide a file that contained stale, sparsely populated data scrubbed clean of any timely or actionable information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 192).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At a meeting of the EquiLend Board of Directors, William Conley stated that transparency about the spread between the fees paid to beneficial owners and those collected from borrowers would \"kill our businesses.\" (AC \u00b6 255). In response, the Prime Broker Defendants agreed to \"neutralize\" Data Explorers by \"set[ting] up a competing business\" called DataLend, which was formed as a division within EquiLend in 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 255, 257).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Prime Broker Defendants each agreed (first amongst one another and subsequently with DataLend) to distribution agreements with DataLend that ensured that their data would not be disclosed to lenders or borrowers, and specifically that data about what borrowers paid for stock loans would not be disclosed to beneficial owners. (AC \u00b6 257). Plaintiffs allege that DataLend's purpose was to offer a bare minimum of data to compete with Data Explorers while still withholding transparency about the Prime Brokers' fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 258). Accordingly, the Prime Broker Defendants allegedly told Data Explorer's customers that it was \"inaccurate and unreliable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 259).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Prime Broker Defendants also attempted to stop borrowers and lenders from accessing each other's data directly by seeking \"to monopolize access to\" agent lender data about aggregate stock loan supply. (AC \u00b6 260). To accomplish this, DataLend sought to lure away Data Explorer's agent lender customers by offering \"to provide the same data services to agent lenders effectively for nothing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 261-62). All major agent lenders except BNY Mellon were members of EquiLend and were \"offered DataLend's products for no additional fee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 261). \"Agent lenders used the new stream of low-cost information provided by DataLend to renegotiate prices with Data Explorers,\" causing Data Explorers' revenues to drop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 264). The hobbled Data Explorers was acquired by another company over which Defendants allegedly wielded influence, and which has not indicated an interest in \"carrying out Data Explorers' original vision of bridging the data divide between wholesale and retail customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 265).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs filed an initial Complaint on August 16, 2017 (Dkt. # 1), and an Amended Complaint on November 17, 2017 (Dkt. # 73). On January 26, 2018, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all claims against Defendants Bank of America Corporation; Credit Suisse Group AG; The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.; J.P.

The Alleged Conspiracy Is Facially Plausible\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendants first argue that Plaintiffs' conspiracy theory is facially implausible. For the reasons that follow, the Court finds otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    Duration and Membership:\n   </em>\n   Defendants contend that it is facially implausible that \"just six prime brokers effected a nine-year conspiracy that blocked the migration of stock loans to an anonymous exchange[,]\" when borrowers, lenders, and agent lenders could have dealt with the \"dozens of other prime brokers\" in existence. (Def. Br. 17). Defendants cite no legal authorities to support this assertion, and the Court is aware of none. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that there is nothing facially implausible about the timeline of the alleged conspiracy, which began in 2009 with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, expanded by 2011 to include the other Defendants in a \"general agreement,\" and continued \"until the boycott achieved its objectives.\" (Pl. Opp. 20; AC \u00b6\u00b6 195-208, 239).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Foreign Exch.

(AC \u00b6\u00b6 102, 122; Pl. Opp. 20). Plaintiffs argue, not without force, that it is not facially implausible for market participants who control this percentage of market power to carry out an effective group boycott. (Pl. Opp. 21).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fashion Originators' Guild of Am.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fed.

Of course, at later stages of litigation, Plaintiffs will be required to show in more detail how Defendants effectuated the alleged conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fashion Originators' Guild of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"359332\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/312/457/#p462\">\n    312 U.S. at 461, 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"359332\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/312/457/#p462\">\n    61 S.Ct. 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that the boycott was effectuated through signed cooperation agreements and audits of members' books). But at the pleading stage, allegations of a conspiracy undertaken by six defendants that controlled 76% to 80% of the market are not rendered facially implausible by virtue of the existence of other market participants who could have transacted with the boycotted businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    EquiLend Board Meetings:\n   </em>\n   Defendants next argue, again without reference to legal authority, that it is implausible that the conspiracy was planned at EquiLend board meetings because those meetings included \"large agent-lenders\" who supported the victim businesses and whose clients would have been harmed by the conspiracy. (Def. Br. 17; Def. Reply 4). Plaintiffs respond that the agent lenders on EquiLend's Board were themselves \"entrenched\" actors who \"may well have their own incentives to preserve the status quo\" and align themselves with Defendants, including vulnerability to pressure from the Defendants. (Pl. Opp. 27-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The parties' dispute on this issue amounts to a battle of competing inferences about who had the agent lenders' greatest loyalty. On a motion to dismiss, the Court must draw \"all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Columbia Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055185\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/46/#p48\">\n    831 F.3d at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Amended Complaint alleges sufficient facts to support a reasonable inference in Plaintiffs' favor: namely, that the agent lenders were willing to align themselves with Defendants, even to the detriment of their own clients. For instance, the Amended Complaint alleges that \"the other owners of EquiLend effectively acquiesce[d] to the\n   Prime Broker Defendants\" due to the latter's overall market clout (AC \u00b6 122); that agent lenders BNY Mellon, State Street, and Northern Trust told SL-x that they \"could not support it\" because the Prime Broker Defendants \"were aligned against the platform\" and because their own conduct \"was subject to the approval of\" a Prime Broker Defendant (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 218, 251-52); and that Defendants \"lure[d]\" agent lenders with services provided \"at very little cost or, in some cases, virtually for free (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 261-62). Moreover, as Plaintiffs point out, the Amended Complaint also alleges numerous meetings in furtherance of the conspiracy that took place outside of EquiLend, such as at Wipf's dinner meetings with Conley and internal Morgan Stanley \"pipeline call,\" and other \"private dinners and meetings that often occurred at industry conferences[.]\" (Pl. Opp. 27; AC \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 297). Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, the mere presence of the agent lenders in some of the meetings where the conspiracy was allegedly formed does not undercut the Amended Complaint's explication of that formation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Access to OCC:\n   </em>\n   Defendants also argue that the conspiracy is implausible because the bylaws of the sole central clearinghouse, OCC, prevent lenders and borrowers from transacting directly and require instead that they clear stock loans through broker-dealer members of OCC. (Def. Br. 18; AC \u00b6\u00b6 120 n.26, 214). In essence, Defendants characterize the Amended Complaint as alleging that they unlawfully agreed not to provide clearing broker services that would have afforded borrowers and lenders access to OCC - even though, according to Defendants, providing such services was not required by regulation and would not have been in their economic self-interest, as shown by the fact that the Amended Complaint does not allege that any of the roughly 60 other broker-dealer members of OCC chose to provide the service either. (Def. Br. 19; Def. Reply 3; AC \u00b6\u00b6 120 n.26, 154 n.36;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 214).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendants point out that the Amended Complaint does not allege that they \"did anything to discourage or prevent\" other brokerage firms from offering clearing broker services. (Def. Br. 19). From this, they seek to analogize this case to\n   <em>\n    In re Interest Rate Swaps Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   , in which a sister court in this District dismissed as implausible an antitrust complaint that alleged a conspiracy to destroy central clearing platforms for all-to-all interest rate swaps (\"IRS\") trading, where there was no regulatory mandate that required central clearing of such transactions, and where the infrastructure for such platforms did not yet exist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Interest Rate Swaps Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267299\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/430/#p463\">\n    261 F.Supp.3d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 463-72 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   \") ). Defendants here posit that the lack of \"clearing brokers willing to clear stock loans through OCC\" in the present action is similar to the absence of infrastructure in\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Defendants misconstrue the Amended Complaint. It does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   allege that the conspiracy aimed to prevent borrowers and lenders from transacting directly without a clearing broker intermediary, and thus whether such transactions were permitted by OCC is of no moment. Nor does the Amended Complaint allege - or need to allege - that Defendants conspired to stop any of the roughly 60 other broker-dealer members of OCC from offering clearing broker services. Rather, the Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants refused to provide their own clients with clearing broker services, and threatened their clients, as well as other market participants, to prevent them from taking advantage of any such opportunities that\n   OCC's other broker-dealer members might have provided. In Plaintiffs' words, \"the Prime Broker Defendants controlled a sufficient share of the industry that other brokers alone could not provide sufficient liquidity,\" and \"Defendants threatened retaliation against other market participants that considered dealing with AQS and SL-x.\" (Pl. Opp. 21; AC \u00b6\u00b6 18-20, 102, 122, 215-18, 252-53). Those threats allegedly succeeded. (Pl. Opp. 22; AC \u00b6 382).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, the necessary infrastructure existed for services such as those promised by AQS and SL-x, and it was Defendants' conduct, not structural impediments, that caused these companies to fail. Accordingly, unlike\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267299\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/430/#p463\">\n    261 F.Supp.3d at 463-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , there is in this case no absence of enabling infrastructure that makes the alleged conspiracy implausible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Anonymous Exchange Trading:\n   </em>\n   Defendants further submit that the conspiracy is implausible because \"the clearing arrangements necessary to sustain anonymous exchange trading do not exist [in the stock loan market].\" (Def. Br. 18). In support, they present an array of additional factual issues that the Court may not resolve on a motion to dismiss. Defendants infer that anonymous exchange trading was unsustainable from the fact that, although the Amended Complaint alleges that the Basel III regulatory development encouraged some entities to take steps toward central clearing, no regulation\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   central clearing in this market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants also contend that stock loan transactions are \"ill-suited\" for anonymous exchange trading because lenders can terminate loans at will - a risk which, Defendants assert, causes borrowers to \"desire to know the source of their loans to assess the risk that the loan shares will be recalled[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18). While Plaintiffs point out that AQS was allegedly \"developed by industry insiders\" with knowledge of demand and feasibility, Defendants question any inference of demand for AQS's product by submitting that even industry insiders could have erred, and by challenging the credibility of the allegation that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York supported AQS's offering. (Pl. Opp. 24; Def. Br. 18; Def. Reply 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiffs offer competing inferences concerning the stock loan market's suitability for anonymous exchange. (Pl. Opp. 23-25). They submit that the absence of a regulatory mandate is immaterial because, even without such a mandate, AQS and SL-x attracted market support for their offerings of anonymous, centrally-cleared stock lending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 145-46, 154-61 (detailing AQS offerings and support);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 172-83 (detailing SL-x offerings and support) ). Plaintiffs also submit that most borrowers do not currently care about, or demand to know, the identity of the lenders from whom they borrow stock. (Pl. Opp. 23). And, according to the Amended Complaint, anonymity was optional on AQS and SL-x, both of which also provided competency assessments of trading partners, including lenders' historical recall rates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24; AC \u00b6\u00b6 179-80, 271). Plaintiffs point to allegations in the Amended Complaint that \"detail[ ] the demand for these new products\" and explain their feasibility. (Pl. Opp. 23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 7-8,\n   142-43, 179, 233, 279-84, 300, 311, 332-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   More fundamentally, Plaintiffs submit, and the Court agrees, that these are \"fact-laden arguments that cannot be credited\" on a motion to dismiss. (Pl. Opp. 23, 25).

While the Amended Complaint does name four individual Defendants as the source of the threats, it fails to allege additional details \"such as when these threats supposedly occurred or whether they were made in parallel,\" and why the hedge funds could not have worked with other prime brokers outside the conspiracy. (Def.

Finally, five of the Defendants are alleged to have held merely \"an indirect partial ownership interest in EquiLend,\" which Defendants challenge as the basis for inferring participation in the conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Plaintiffs respond, and the Court agrees, that the Amended Complaint specifically alleges that each Defendant agreed to participate in the conspiracy. (Pl. Opp. 29).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, group pleading is \"insufficient to withstand review on a motion to dismiss ...

Because the Amended Complaint alleges each Defendant's participation separately, it is not impermissible group pleading to refer to their collective actions in furtherance of the conspiracy using a more general phrase such as \"the Prime Broker Defendants.\" Further, the Amended Complaint identifies specific employees by name who held themselves out as representing the interests of their employers. Doing so provides each Defendant with sufficient notice of the claims against that Defendant and their grounds. As a result, it is proper to name a corporate sub-entity as a Defendant, such as \"Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,\" while pleading allegations using a more generic name, such as \"Credit Suisse.\" The Amended Complaint accordingly does not rely impermissibly on group allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

As an alternative to pleading direct evidence, a plaintiff may allege \"circumstantial facts supporting the\n   <em>\n    inference\n   </em>\n   that a conspiracy existed.\"\n   <em>\n    Citigroup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547293\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/129/#p135\">\n    709 F.3d at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiffs identify certain allegations that, they claim, suffice to plead direct evidence of a conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. 11-12). They include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   \u2022 John Shellard, a Managing Director at J.P. Morgan and EquiLend Board member, stated in an August 7, 2013\n   meeting that there was a \"general agreement among [the] directors [of EquiLend]\" that \"industry advances should be achieved from within EquiLend,\" rather than through third parties such as AQS, SL-x, and Data Explorers. (AC \u00b6 239).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   \u2022 On a recorded Morgan Stanley conference call that occurred in January 2016, Thomas Wipf stated that he and William Conley agreed that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs needed to \"get a hold of this thing,\" by which he meant that they needed to act together to acquire and shut down AQS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 295-96).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   \u2022 Carl Bishti, a Credit Suisse executive and EquiLend Associate Director, stated at meetings on February 6, 2013, and July 19, 2013, that SL-x could cause the stock lending market to \"change overnight,\" but not without the \"cooperation\" of EquiLend, which he described as, \"the mafia run by five crime families.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 240-41).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   \u2022 Emails and chats that are currently stored on Defendants' servers \"indicate that EquiLend representatives, including CEO Brian Lamb, had been instructed not to 'break rank' and not to take independent actions in the marketplace until the 'EquiLend banks' determined as a group whether they would support any of the new platforms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The alleged statements by Shellard and Wipf qualify as direct evidence of concerted action. It is true that, as Defendants point out, Shellard's statement describes an agreement among\n   <em>\n    EquiLend's directors\n   </em>\n   , not merely among the Prime Broker Defendants. (Def. Br. 21-22; Def. Reply 6). Yet the alleged conspiracy encompassed EquiLend as well as the Prime Broker Defendants. Defendants also observe that Shellard himself did not work as a prime broker for J.P. Morgan. (Def. Br. 21). The Court does not find this observation probative, as an employee need not work in a particular position to know of and describe his employer's collusive conduct. Both statements expressly describe agreements among the Defendants, and are thus direct evidence of concerted action (element one of a Sherman Act claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Bishti's statement, and the emails to Lamb and his colleagues, are different matters entirely. There are far too many layers of inference between Bishti's analogy to the mafia and any conclusions that might be drawn from it for the statement to qualify as direct evidence of anything much, except perhaps of Bishti's affinity for colorful speech. While the remainder of Bishti's statement might support an inference of EquiLend's strong hold on the market, it is a far cry from\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   evidence of conspiracy. The allegation of emails and chats telling Lamb not to \"break rank\" is similarly too vague to qualify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded at least some \"direct evidence\" allegations of conspiracy. Notably, while the qualifying allegations may be slim, even a failure to allege direct evidence of conspiracy would not necessarily be fatal to the pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Plaintiffs Adequately Allege Parallel Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   A plaintiff may also make a showing of concerted action by alleging \"circumstantial facts supporting the\n   <em>\n    inference\n   </em>\n   that a conspiracy existed.\"\n   <em>\n    Citigroup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547293\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/129/#p135\">\n    709 F.3d at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For instance, a plaintiff may state a Section 1 claim by alleging behavior \"that would plausibly contravene each defendant's self-interest in the absence of similar behavior by rivals.\"\n   <em>\n    Starr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5687224\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/314/#p321\">\n    592 F.3d at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Another way to plead circumstantial evidence of conspiracy is by alleging parallel conduct. \"Examples of parallel conduct allegations that might be sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Twombly's\n   </em>\n   standard include parallel behavior that would probably not result from chance, coincidence, independent responses to common stimuli, or mere interdependence unaided by an advance understanding among the parties[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Citigroup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547293\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/129/#p135\">\n    709 F.3d at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Because parallel conduct can result from many different factors, these allegations generally must be accompanied by \"plus factors\" that support an inference that the conduct resulted from a prior agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citigroup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547293\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/129/#p135\">\n    709 F.3d at 137-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court will first address whether Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded parallel conduct and then assess Plaintiffs' pleading of plus factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Plaintiffs argue - and the Court agrees - that the Amended Complaint adequately pleads parallel conduct by Defendants. To start, concerning AQS, the Amended Complaint alleges that Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and UBS each, in separate meetings, communicated an identical position to AQS: that they would not support AQS unless it became a \"broker-only platform.\" (Pl. Opp. 13; AC \u00b6 210). Defendants contend that this pleading lacks sufficient factual details about who said what to whom and when, and that the Defendants' shared position was simply a recognition that \"market standards\" and OCC by-laws required \"broker-dealers\" to transact on AQS. (Def. Br. 25-26). Defendants' argument is fallacious; that OCC required end users to clear their trades through clearing brokers is not the same as a requirement that AQS be a \"broker-only platform,\" the latter of which implies that no one but broker-dealers can use it. Moreover, the claim that the allegations of Defendants' identical positions regarding AQS lacks specificity only\n   works when reading paragraph 210 in total isolation. Taken holistically, the allegations of Defendants' parallel conduct toward AQS, including withdrawals and denials of support and threats to other market participants, are sufficiently specific to survive a motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 196-218).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Next, Defendants maintain that the Amended Complaint's allegations show divergent, rather than parallel, conduct. (Def. Br. 25-28). They point out that several Defendants allegedly joined ACS, while Bank of America was initially a strong supporter and continued to make substantial transactions on the platform through 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 119, 205, 207).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Defendants' view, any commonalities in their behavior toward SL-x resulted not from conspiracy, but rather from the fact that they were all responding to the same prompt,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , SL-x approaching the group of them with a proposal to form a \"consortium\" to invest in SL-x. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 226-28). Indeed, they posit, Defendants did not act alike toward SL-x because Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined support immediately, while the other Defendants waited for several years before making a decision. The Court disagrees. No doubt, the Amended Complaint contains allegations of divergent conduct, such as Susan O'Flynn's actions in support of central clearing as other Morgan Stanley decision makers schemed to prevent it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 281-87). But the presence of some divergent conduct does not negate the allegations of other, parallel conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   As to Data Explorers, Defendants argue that the Amended Complaint makes no allegations of parallel conduct. (Def. Br. 27). That is incorrect. The Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants entered into identical distribution agreements with DataLend in an attempt to undermine Data Explorers and push it from the market. (Pl. Opp. 14; AC \u00b6\u00b6 257-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In a variation on this theme, Defendants argue that, to the extent the Amended Complaint\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   plead parallel conduct, it fails to support an inference of conspiracy because the alleged parallel conduct was not contrary to Defendants' self-interest and made good business sense. (Def. Br. 26-31). After all, AQS and SL-x threatened Defendants' profits as stock loan middlemen, and the platforms they offered were new, untested, and bereft of critical mass and client demand. Precisely because of these deficiencies, it made business sense for Defendants to decline to run trades through the AQS and SL-x platforms. And the fact that SL-x allegedly failed in Europe suggests it had little to offer, and that Defendants were wise not to invest. (Def. Br. 27; AC \u00b6 268). Finally, according to Defendants, the refusals to invest do not support an inference of conspiracy to block all-to-all trading in the United States because SL-x had no immediate plans to offer such trading in the United States. (Def. Br. 27). Indeed, the SL-x platform was not even operational in the United States during the relevant Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 20, 253, 268). More generally, Defendants caution against drawing inferences from their failure to invest in SL-x, which they deem to be nothing more than an allegation of inaction, a \"particularly perilous\" basis from which to draw conclusions. (Def. Br. 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Court appreciates the challenges of drawing inferences from allegations of inaction. Nonetheless, on a motion to dismiss, all reasonable inferences must be\n   drawn in Plaintiffs' favor, including those arising from allegations of inaction. On the broader contentions that the parallel conduct pleaded in the Amended Complaint fails to support an inference of conspiracy, the Court turns to a \"plus factor\" analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    v. Plaintiffs Adequately Allege Plus Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Allegations that a defendant engaged in parallel conduct, without more, are often insufficient to plead circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy if \"such behavior could be the result of coincidence, independent responses to common stimuli, or mere interdependence unaided by an advance understanding among the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Apple, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274156,4275581\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/290/\">\n    791 F.3d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).

(Def. Br. 31-32). The Court has already rejected Defendants' contention that the mere presence of agent lenders at the EquiLend board meetings renders the allegations about those meetings implausible. Moreover, the inquiry into plus factors considers \"interfirm communications,\" which need not necessarily be conspiratorial communications. The EquiLend board meetings easily satisfy that standard. Defendants also claim that, other than the EquiLend board meetings, the Amended Complaint presents merely \"vague references to isolated discussions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32).

The Amended Complaint makes this allegation explicitly: \"The Prime Broker Defendants feared that, if borrowers and lenders saw what their counterparties were paying, they would use competition to reduce the Prime Broker Defendants' outsized intermediary profits.\" (AC \u00b6 24). The Court has little difficulty finding a common motive to conspire from these allegations. Conversely, the Court rejects Defendants' argument that, while the Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants each had a unilateral interest in waiting to see how the purported victim entities evolved instead of \"supporting ventures that supposedly threatened its profits,\" it falls short of alleging that Defendants had a common motive to conspire.

Br. 32-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <em>\n    Actions Against Individual Self-Interest:\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs contend that the Amended Complaint alleges actions against self-interest because, \"[a]bsent the conspiracy, it would have been in the self-interest of many of the Prime Broker Defendants to support the platforms to avoid the risk of being left behind[,]\" and to offer their clients access to AQS to avoid their jumping ship to a competitor. (Pl. Opp. 18-19). At this stage of the litigation, the Court accepts this inference as reasonable. The Court thus concludes that Defendants' lack of support for the new market entrants serves as an additional plus factor,\n   adding to other circumstantial evidence of conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Defendants contend that the Amended Complaint effectively alleges that they \"continued to conduct business as they always had,\" which - in Defendants' view - required no conspiracy to accomplish. (Def. Br. 33). That may well be the case, but it is not the appropriate inquiry for the moment. The law is clear that plus factors do not \"necessarily lead to an inference of conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    Apex Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1723396\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/822/246/#p254\">\n    822 F.2d at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And they do not need to; \"plus factors\" need not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   conspiracy in order to support an inference that parallel conduct by the defendants flowed from one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    Collusion in Other Markets:\n   </em>\n   The Amended Complaint additionally alleges that Defendants' \"stock loan conspiracy is but the latest in a string of anticompetitive conspiracies involving the financial markets in which the Prime Broker Defendants have participated[.]\" (AC \u00b6 346;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 347-62 (detailing alleged conspiracies in other markets) ). \"Allegations of anticompetitive wrongdoing in [other venues] - absent any evidence of linkage between such foreign conduct and conduct here - is merely to suggest ... that if it happened there, it could have happened here.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Elevator Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5526453\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/47/#p50\">\n    502 F.3d at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The Court agrees squarely with Defendants that these allegations are irrelevant, and will not consider them for purposes of evaluating the sufficiency of the Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In sum, the Amended Complaint adequately pleads plus factors in addition to parallel conduct, and thereby supports an inference of concerted action from circumstantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    vi. Plaintiffs' Allegations Are Adequate As Against Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, UBS, and Credit Suisse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    Bank of America\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    :\n   </em>\n   Defendants seek dismissal of the claim against Bank of America on the basis that its membership in the conspiracy is implausible because it was an early supporter of, and investor in, AQS before allegedly joining the conspiracy in 2011, at which point it declined to invest additional funds in AQS, and limited its transactions with AQS. (Def. Br. 34-36;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 157, 205-07). Defendants observe that Bank of America never withdrew its\n   <em>\n    initial\n   </em>\n   investment in, or eliminated\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   transactions with, AQS. (Def. Br. 35; Def. Reply 13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 205, 207). Defendants infer from these observations, respectively, that joining the conspiracy would have been contrary to Bank of America's interests, and that Bank of America would not have wanted to harm AQS. (Def. Br. 35). Plaintiffs respond that it is entirely plausible that Bank of America initially supported AQS but changed its mind and joined the conspiracy as a result of pressure from the other Defendants, especially given that the transfer of Morgan Stanley's and UBS's head of prime brokerage to be head of Global Prime Brokerage at Bank of America allegedly facilitated such pressure. (Pl. Opp. 22; AC \u00b6\u00b6 200, 205-07).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Defendants also suggest an alternate explanation for Bank of America's decision not to invest more funds and to reduce its transactions with AQS in or about 2011: AQS was failing. (Def. Br. 35;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 212-13, 269). But, as Plaintiffs point out, AQS was not failing when Bank of America withdrew its support in 2011; it was not failing until the end of 2014, following the trade-flow hypoxia caused by Defendants. (Pl. Opp. 22; AC \u00b6\u00b6 206, 266, 269).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   As to SL-x and Data Explorers, Bank of America allegedly continued meetings with SL-x longer than the other Defendants,\n   and further had independent reasons not to support SL-x due to Bank of America's support of its rival AQS. (Def. Br. 36; AC \u00b6\u00b6 234, 239-40, 244). According to Defendants, the sole plausible allegation against Bank of America in relation to Data Explorers is that it held a seat on EquiLend's board. (Def. Br. 36). Unfortunately for Bank of America, presence on EquiLend's board, combined with allegations of parallel conduct supported by plus factors, is enough at this stage of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   To be sure, Defendants do hit on a weakness: the Amended Complaint arguably contradicts itself by alleging that Bank of America convened a meeting of the \"five families\" in furtherance of the conspiracy in 2009, a point in time when it was allegedly still a strong supporter of AQS. (Def. Br. 36; Def. Reply 13-14). Nonetheless, Defendants' counter-explanations for Bank of America's behavior improperly draw inferences against Plaintiffs. (Pl. Opp. 22). While the Court may be skeptical about the strength of the claims against Bank of America, at least as concerns conduct toward AQS, Plaintiffs' arguments, when taken as a whole, are not entirely implausible and thus cannot be rejected at the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <em>\n    J.P. Morgan, UBS, and Credit Suisse:\n   </em>\n   Defendants argue that the allegations against J.P. Morgan, UBS, and Credit Suisse are insufficient because the Amended Complaint fails to allege that these Defendants threatened or discouraged AQS, SL-x, or their potential customers, or that they participated in any conspiratorial meetings. (Def. Br. 37). According to Defendants, the Amended Complaint also fails to allege that J.P. Morgan or UBS used the phrase \"five families.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The primary allegations against these three Defendants are that they did not invest in or transact with AQS and SL-x, which decisions are, in Defendants' view, consistent with the Defendants' unilateral interests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 210, 239, 242, 245).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   These arguments are not meritorious. As explained above, the Amended Complaint does allege that these Defendants participated in conspiratorial meetings. And because, as also explained above, the Court is not relying on references to the \"five families,\" the fact that not every Defendant used that term does not matter. Not every member of a conspiracy needs to issue the same threats for the conspiracy to exist. Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded that these Defendants' failures to invest in or support new market entrants was part of a conspiracy to reduce competition in the market. More broadly, Plaintiffs adequately plead the first element of a Sherman Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Amended Complaint Adequately Alleges an Unreasonable Restraint on Trade Under Either a\n    <em>\n     Per Se\n    </em>\n    or a Rule of Reason Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Plaintiffs respond that the conduct alleged should be deemed\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   illegal, but that, in the alternative, the allegations also suffice to plead a claim even under the rule of reason. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs on both issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

(Def. Br. 38). Even though the Amended Complaint pleads at one point that EquiLend \"is not the independent joint venture that it purports to be,\" Defendants observe that it elsewhere characterizes EquiLend as \"organized as a joint venture.\" (Def. Br. 38; AC \u00b6\u00b6 310, 319). In Defendants' words, \"Plaintiffs' antitrust claim primarily rests on allegations regarding EquiLend that are entirely consistent with lawful joint-venture conduct.\" (Def. Reply 14). Further, Defendants reiterate that the fact that EquiLend's ownership and board included agent lenders \"contradict[s] any suggestion that it is illegitimate.\" (Def. Br. 38;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 308, 378).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Plaintiffs argue in contrast that \"[t]he question of whether to apply\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   or rule of reason turns on the type of\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   at issue, not on isolated allegations that make up the claim.\" (Pl. Opp. 31). Plaintiffs argue that, taken as a whole, the Amended Complaint alleges a group boycott, which Plaintiffs contend automatically falls within a category of\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   illegal conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8, 31). Even taking elements of the Amended Complaint in isolation, and even if EquiLend may have been a joint venture in some respects, Plaintiffs argue that the alleged conduct should still be analyzed under the\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule because it was undertaken \"\n   <em>\n    outside of the joint venture\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33 (emphasis in original) ). In other words, Defendants' alleged concerted actions, aimed at starving AQS, SL-x, and Data Explorers of data and liquidity, took place in circumstances that exceeded Defendants' service on EquiLend's Board, even if the conduct was planned and agreed to at EquiLend meetings.

The Amended Complaint alleges that EquiLend's joint venture status was a smokescreen behind which the Prime Broker Defendants could operate. The full relevant allegation in the Amended Complaint is that, \"[t]hough EquiLend is nominally organized as a joint venture, this fact does not shield it - or the Prime Broker Dealers - from the antitrust laws. This is because EquiLend does not act as an independent, rational market participant[.]\" (AC \u00b6 310). In other words, the Amended Complaint is entirely consistent in its allegations regarding EquiLend's joint venture status. More importantly, the Amended Complaint alleges that the Prime Broker Defendants, acting as separate\n   and individual economic decision-makers, conspired to boycott SL-x, Data Explorers, and also AQS, and that this conduct was undertaken on behalf of each Prime Broker Defendant, and not in furtherance of a legitimate joint venture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Texaco Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dagher\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court held that it was not\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   illegal for \"a lawful, economically integrated joint venture to set the prices at which the joint venture sells its products.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276255\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/1/#p3\">\n    547 U.S. at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276255\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/1/#p3\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, in contrast, the parties have not disputed that the Prime Broker Defendants are direct competitors in the stock loan market. To be sure, some of the Prime Broker Defendants' alleged conduct toward SL-x and Data Explorers may arguably have been \"\n   <em>\n    consistent with\n   </em>\n   lawful joint-venture conduct\" (Def. Reply 14 (emphasis added) ), rather than conduct undertaken by \"separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

But mere consistency with an alternate inference supporting the Defendants' position is not enough at this stage of the litigation, where the Court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In any event, plenty of relevant allegations cannot be so characterized. For instance, the Amended Complaint alleges that, at EquiLend board meetings in August and September 2011, the Prime Broker Defendants each agreed not to support SL-x. (AC \u00b6 223). Thereafter, each Prime Broker Defendant separately and individually \"withheld capital and support from SL-x through the fall of 2011 and throughout 2012[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 228). A Morgan Stanley employee told an SL-x representative to deal directly with EquiLend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 224-26). In late 2013, the Prime Broker Defendants allegedly agreed to a collective boycott of SL-x, and began threatening other market participants to deter them from using SL-x. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 236-37). Similarly, the Amended Complaint does not allege that EquiLend, acting as an \"independent center[ ] of decisionmaking,\"\n   <em>\n    Am. Needle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641836,12449199\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/183/\">\n    560 U.S. at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641836,12449199\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/183/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , launched DataLend because it wished to compete with Data Explorers. Rather, the thrust of the allegations is that the Prime Broker Defendants used EquiLend to launch a subpar product in an attempt to undermine Data Explorers so as to maintain opacity in pricing data\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   their lucrative roles as prime broker intermediaries. These allegations are a far cry from\n   <em>\n    Dagher\n   </em>\n   , and the alleged conduct is not immunized from the\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule by virtue of EquiLend's presence in the fact pattern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Alleged Conduct Violates the Rule of Reason\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Despite the Court's conclusion that the allegations in the Amended Complaint qualify as\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unlawful restraints of trade under the Sherman Act, for completeness the Court also undertakes a rule of reason analysis. The Second Circuit has defined anticompetitive conduct as \"conduct without a legitimate business purpose that make[s] sense only because it eliminates competition.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Adderall XR Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055344\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/128/#p133\">\n    754 F.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133 (2d Cir. 2014). Plaintiffs argue that, even if a rule of reason applies, the Amended Complaint satisfies this standard. (Pl. Opp. 33-41). The Court also finds that it has.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   With respect to AQS, Defendants argue that the Amended Complaint alleges nothing improper about EquiLend's purchase of AQS, which it acquired at a low price after the platform failed and OCC declined to buy it. (Def. Br. 41-42;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 294, 299). Indeed, according to Defendants, the Amended Complaint does \"not allege any facts suggesting that the Prime Broker Defendants undermined AQS's discussions with OCC.\" (Def. Br. 42;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 292, 298). While acknowledging that the Amended Complaint alleges that the purchase was made to \"bury\" AQS (AC \u00b6 21), Defendants contend that, in fact, after the acquisition, EquiLend continued to operate the AQS technology, and the Amended Complaint has not alleged \"facts suggesting otherwise\" (Def. Br. 42). Plaintiffs respond that EquiLend's purchases of both SL-x and AQS were anticompetitive because \"it would have been irrational for Defendants to buy platforms they had no intention of using in the absence of an anticompetitive motive,\" and, further, that when considered in the context of the Amended Complaint as a whole, both purchases confirm Defendants' alleged anticompetitive intent. (Pl. Opp. 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Drawing all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, as required on a motion to dismiss, the Court concludes that the Amended Complaint adequately pleads that Defendants purchased both AQS's and SL-x's intellectual property for anticompetitive purposes, as evidenced by the underuse of the products after purchase. Defendants' contention that EquiLend\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   operate the AQS technology post-purchase, and that the Amended Complaint has not alleged \"facts suggesting otherwise\" (Def. Br. 42), improperly draws inferences in Defendants' favor. Further, the Amended Complaint does allege that, \"the Prime Broker Defendants agreed to exert their influence as Directors of OCC and Directors of EquiLend to prevent OCC from acquiring AQS.\" (AC \u00b6 298). That allegation supports an inference that \"Defendants undermined AQS's discussions with OCC,\" even without specific factual allegations of precisely how Defendants went about doing so. (Def. Br. 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   As to SL-x, Defendants contend that EquiLend's decision not to merge with SL-x cannot support an antitrust claim because there is no indication that a merger would have been in EquiLend's interest. (Def. Br. 41;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 224, 253, 268). Separately, Defendants argue that the Amended Complaint fails adequately to allege specific action by Defendants impeding SL-x's access to central clearing, or collusion not to invest in SL-x, and that any such allegation would fail a rule of reason analysis because each Defendant had rational unilateral reasons not to pursue the investment. (Def. Br. 41). Similarly, Defendants maintain that EquiLend's purchase of SL-x's intellectual property, and subsequent non-use of it, was \"legitimate joint venture conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; AC \u00b6 272). Plaintiffs respond that the Amended Complaint alleges more than a declined merger. For instance, Conley \"told SL-x\n   executives that the Prime Broker Defendants would not support SL-x\" and would only permit this type of market evolution from within EquiLend, and the Prime Broker Defendants each declined to support SL-x\n   <em>\n    as a result of\n   </em>\n   their agreed boycott. (Pl. Opp. 37). Taking Plaintiffs' allegations as true and drawing all inferences in their favor, these allegations are sufficient to support a reasonable inference that Defendants' conduct toward SL-x was a result of an agreement among the Defendants, rather than of unilateral decision-making, and that EquiLend's purchase and non-use of SL-x's intellectual property was anticompetitive conduct that lacked \"a legitimate business purpose\" and made sense \"only because it eliminates competition.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Adderall XR Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055344\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/128/#p133\">\n    754 F.3d at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Defendants next argue that EquiLend's creation of DataLend was pro-competitive, as shown by its lower prices, and that the Amended Complaint does not allege any anticompetitive use of trading data or other anticompetitive conduct. Indeed, Defendants observe, the Amended Complaint does not even allege that Defendants failed to subscribe to Data Explorer's data service or forced Data Explorers to shut down. (Def. Br. 40; AC \u00b6\u00b6 261, 257). Plaintiffs respond by identifying allegations that Defendants overlook, allegations that evince both insult and injury: Defendants created DataLend not to compete with, but rather to \"kill,\" Data Explorers by agreeing \"in lockstep, to distribution agreements with DataLend\" that limited price transparency but still provided a product that, while anemic and subpar, could nonetheless \"undermine Data Explorers,\" and then aggressively underpriced that product. (Pl. Opp. 36-37). Plaintiffs argue as well that the restrictions limiting the distribution of pricing data were not pro-competitive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37). Plaintiffs are correct. At this stage of the litigation, the possibility that Defendants' conduct could conceivably be characterized as improving competition does not warrant dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the joint-venture allegations (which comprise everything except the AQS boycott) fail the rule of reason. They form this conclusion because, in their view, the Amended Complaint (i) lacks allegations as to EquiLend's market power and the joint venture's competitive benefits and harms, and (ii) relies solely on assertions \"that Defendants' conduct generally caused anticompetitive harm\" and lacked a \"pro-competitive rationale.\" (Def. Br. 38-39; AC \u00b6\u00b6 323-35, 389). Plaintiffs respond that they\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   alleged circumstantial evidence of Defendants' market power in the form of an allegedly successful boycott that drove out competitors. (Pl. Opp. 40).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Todd\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Exxon Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9454201\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/275/191/#p206\">\n    275 F.3d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 206-07 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"If a plaintiff can show an actual adverse effect on competition, such as reduced output ... we do not require a further showing of market power.\"). Plaintiffs point as well to the uncontested allegation that the Prime Broker Defendants controlled approximately 70% of market share. (Pl. Opp. 40; Def. Br. 39-40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   This dispute boils down to whether the allegations concern conduct by EquiLend alone, or conduct undertaken by the Prime Broker Defendants using EquiLend. As explained above, the Amended Complaint alleges that the Prime Broker Defendants took concerted action outside the scope of their joint venture in regards to both SL-x and Data Explorers. It is therefore the Prime Broker Defendants' market power, not Defendant EquiLend's market power, that matters. The Amended Complaint has adequately alleged that the Prime Broker Defendants held substantial market power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   In sum, whether analyzed as\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unlawful conduct, or under the rule of reason, the Amended Complaint adequately pleads that Defendants' concerted actions amounted to an unreasonable restraint on trade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiffs Have Antitrust Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   In addition to a comprehensive attack on Plaintiffs' allegations of an antitrust violation, Defendants also contest whether Plaintiffs have standing to challenge any such violation. To confer antitrust standing, an alleged injury must be \"of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and [an injury] that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    Brunswick Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6310\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/477/#p489\">\n    429 U.S. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 489,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6310\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/477/#p489\">\n    97 S.Ct. 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6310\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/477/#p489\">\n    50 L.Ed.2d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977).

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' alleged boycott of AQS, SL-x, and Data Explorers deprived them \"of more efficient, competitive, and transparent trading options\" that would have increased price transparency and competition. (Pl. Opp. 41-42). Plaintiffs rely in particular on three allegations in the Amended Complaint, to the effect that the lack of a central marketplace for stock loan transactions (i) creates bottlenecks, (ii) wastes resources, and (iii) causes volatile, opaque, and artificially inflated prices. (AC \u00b6 118). Defendants allegedly preserved this \"inefficient, antiquated OTC structure,\" which conceals information about pricing and availability and leads to \"high search costs and inefficient pricing,\" by blocking the development of \"a fully electronic and transparent trading environment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 324-26, 328). Defendants thereby maintained themselves as middlemen and stopped Plaintiffs from trading directly, making negotiations \"cumbersome and difficult to do,\" and \"reduc[ing] the volume of trades that would otherwise occur[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 327, 329-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, these harms could have been avoided through centralized \"electronic trading\" for stock loan transactions. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 117, 119). More specifically, AQS and Data Explorers would have provided price transparency to the stock loan market (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 146, 255), and SL-x would have made more lender stocks visible to potential borrowers (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 176). If \"Defendants had acted unilaterally,\" they would have taken \"the pro-competitive path to central clearing[,]\" which in turn would have enhanced borrower choice in selecting brokers, increased competition, and lowered transaction costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 302, 344-45). The likely effect of centralized electronic trading in the OTC stock loan market - and thus the injury Defendants caused by blocking its development - could reasonably be expected to surpass that of electronic trading in futures exchange markets, which has been researched and quantified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 334-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Defendants do not challenge that the injury alleged is \"of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Brunswick Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6310\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/477/#p489\">\n    429 U.S. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6310\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/477/#p489\">\n    97 S.Ct. 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor do they contest that Plaintiffs have satisfied three of the four factors to plead \"efficient enforcer\" standing. Instead, Defendants argue the remaining factor - the speculativeness of the alleged injury - disfavors standing for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Defendants argue that the alleged injury is \"base[d]\" on the loss of an all-to-all trading platform, but Data Explorers and SL-x had no plans to offer such a trading platform in the United States. (Def. Br. 42-43;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 179, 193). Defendants describe Data Explorers as \"a pricing service,\" and SL-x as \"a non-operational platform that lacked central clearing in the United States and did not plan to offer anonymous trading.\" (Def. Reply 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Plaintiffs counter that Data Explorers and SL-x would have \"increased efficiency and price competition and transparency in the market in different ways from AQS.\" (Pl. Opp. 43). Plaintiffs point to the Amended Complaint's allegations that Data Explorers offered \"performance\" data and other products to enhance borrowers' and lenders' insight into whether their terms were consistent with comparable market trades (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 188), and that it would have reduced pricing opacity (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 193). As for SL-x, the Amended Complaint alleges that it would have alleviated the need \"to contact the Prime Broker Defendants by telephone or instant messages in order to get a quote\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 173); provided \"real-time\" data about pricing and quantity, potentially \"integrat[ing] data and analytics from other market sources\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 174-75, 177); increased the visibility of lenders' stocks to potential borrowers (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 176); permitted central clearing for certain European transactions (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 178); enabled anonymous trading by, and provided automated matching for, broker-dealers and agent lenders while also making possible \"simultaneous one-to-one and one-to-many negotiations\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 179-80); and was \"poised to clear U.S. stock loan trades\" and would have done so but for Defendants' wrongful conduct (Pl Opp. 29;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 233-35). According to the Amended Complaint, SL-x would have afforded broker-dealers $8 billion in capital savings benefits in addition to reduced operational and administrative costs. (AC \u00b6 181).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Defendants argue that AQS lacked the ability to enable all-to-all trading due to rules requiring broker-dealer intermediaries. (Def. Br. 42-43). Plaintiffs counter that AQS accounted for this limitation by enabling all-to-all trading using clearing agents. (Pl. Opp. 43;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6 154 n.36). Further, Plaintiffs contend that the fact that many buy-side parties embraced\n   AQS shows that AQS would have benefitted investors, and AQS's own quantitative analysis shows the same. (Pl. Opp. 43;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 160, 162-63, 168-69). Specifically, AQS would have reduced lending risks (AC \u00b6 158), provided useful centralization (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 159), promised direct execution of transactions via clearing brokers (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 161), and afforded \"daily price discovery and transparency\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 164). Defendants respond that the Amended Complaint fails to allege that Defendants blocked the more than 60 other brokerage firms from acting as enabling clearing-agent intermediaries. (Def. Br. 42-43; Def. Reply 20;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6 154 n.36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Defendants theorize that AQS, SL-x, and Data Explorers were the direct victims of the alleged conspiracy and thus the proper plaintiffs to bring this claim. (Def. Br. 45). Plaintiffs counter that those entities' decisions not to sue have no bearing, and in any event, AQS has since filed a related action. (Pl. Opp. 44). Plaintiffs maintain that they have antitrust standing as both the \"direct purchasers\" and the \"consumers\" of the financial product at issue, and that their injuries were \"logical, foreseeable, and [the] intentional object of Defendants' conspiracy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Defendants' arguments are thought-provoking, but insufficient to merit dismissal. To start, Defendants challenge merely one of the four factors to plead \"efficient enforcer\" standing. The efficient enforcer inquiry is a general balancing test in which the importance assigned to each factor \"will necessarily vary with the circumstances of particular cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Gatt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804516\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/68/#p78\">\n    711 F.3d at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, even if the injury alleged veers closer to speculative than prudence would advise, it would not eliminate Plaintiffs' standing. Again for the sake of completeness, the Court has also assessed the parties' arguments on speculativeness and has concluded that Plaintiffs' position is the stronger. The circumstances of this case are distinct from those in\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   , where the court rejected antitrust standing because it was \" 'entirely uncertain' that, absent the scheme, the necessary infrastructural preconditions for [the alleged lost benefit] ... would have developed.\"\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267299\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/430/#p463\">\n    261 F.Supp.3d at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gatt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804516\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/68/#p78\">\n    711 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   79 ).

Accordingly, as Defendants' fourth line of attack, they contend that Plaintiffs' antitrust claim is time-barred to the extent it seeks damages for conduct committed before August 16, 2013, which time period would include the aspects of Plaintiffs' claim that are based on the alleged boycott of Data Explorers and the bulk of Plaintiffs' antitrust claim related to SL-x. (Def. Br. 46 (citing AC \u00b6\u00b6 254-65, 219-32) ). Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim is time-barred for conduct prior to August 16, 2014, because, as Plaintiffs seek monetary damages, the three-year limitations period applies. (Def. Br. 46; AC \u00b6 397).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

(Pl. Opp. 45-46). At a minimum, the Court agrees that the\n   Amended Complaint adequately pleads inherent self-concealment because the alleged conspiracy required numerous participants, was designed to endure, and depended on concealment for its success.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hendrickson Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549048\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/840/1065/#p1083\">\n    840 F.2d at 1083-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that a \"bid-rigging conspiracy\" was inherently self-concealing where it had at least six members and discovery \"would have defeated the enterprise\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Defendants retort that a finding of inherent self-concealment would conflict with the Amended Complaint's allegation that they \"openly threatened industry participants.\" (Def. Br. 47). Not so. That Defendants made \"open[ ] threat[s]\" does not necessarily mean they made\n   <em>\n    public\n   </em>\n   threats. The Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants communicated threats directly to individual executives at hedge funds, and that these were threats to withhold bespoke services, such as official and unofficial assistance to former employees of the Defendants, the sharing of \"proprietary research,\" and special access to initial public offerings. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 191, 213, 218). If any inferences are to be drawn from the nature of these services, the Court infers that such services were likely provided quietly, in the context of personal relationships, and that threats to eliminate them would have been similarly personalized and discrete. Accordingly, the threats do not undermine a finding that the conspiracy was inherently self-concealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Defendants next assert, incorrectly, that the conspiracy alleged here cannot be inherently self-concealing because it \"is essentially the same as\" that alleged in\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   . (Def. Reply 23). In point of fact, the court in\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   considered the issue of equitable tolling solely in relation to a set of allegations that \"overwhelmingly\" centered on a trading platform that the defendants stifled after taking over its majority ownership.\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267299\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/430/#p463\">\n    261 F.Supp.3d at 447-49, 487-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reasoned that those allegations did not qualify as inherently self-concealing because both the takeover and the platform's subsequent failure to evolve \"occurred in plain sight and in contrast to the market's expectations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267299\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/430/#p463\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267299\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/430/#p463\">\n    at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case is distinguishable because, unlike a known majority owner acting in full public view to starve the evolution of an innovative platform under its direct governance and control, Defendants here allegedly used boycotts and threats to starve new market participants of data and liquidity without exercising governance ownership or wielding any publically visible control over those entities. The\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   court expressly distinguished circumstances like those in the present action from its own reasoning about concealment, recognizing that \"a group boycott of exchange trading, like a cover price fixing scheme, could be of [a self-concealing] nature, where the perpetrators' collective venture must remain concealed to be successful.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267299\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/430/#p463\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267299\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/430/#p463\">\n    at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The Court's finding that Plaintiffs have alleged an inherently self-concealing conspiracy discharges Plaintiffs' burden to plead concealment. Still again, for the sake of completeness, the Court also considers whether the Amended Complaint pleads affirmative acts of concealment. Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants took affirmative steps to conceal the conspiracy by (i) conducting\n   secret meetings, (ii) using code words, (iii) misrepresenting their support for both EquiLend and central clearing, and (iv) using threats to silence victims and witnesses. (Pl. Opp. 45-46). Plaintiffs rely on the Amended Complaint's allegations that Defendants conducted the conspiracy through \"private meetings of the EquiLend board,\" using the code name \"Project Gateway,\" and that Defendants misrepresented EquiLend's purpose as \"optimiz[ing] efficiency in the securities finance industry\" when its true purpose was to prevent such efficiency. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 374, 378). The Amended Complaint also alleges that Defendants made encouraging statements to SL-x executives about the platform and about central clearing more broadly,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   which statements misrepresented their true lack of enthusiasm as shown by the fact that, after several meetings with SL-x executives, Defendants allegedly \"went cold,\" refused to engage further, and \"reported that they were no longer willing to be first movers on SL-x.\" (AC \u00b6\u00b6 237-38). Finally, the Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants threatened to terminate certain services if their hedge fund clients decided to trade on AQS or on SL-x. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 213, 237, 243). For instance, the Amended Complaint alleges that a Goldman Sachs representative threatened influential agent lender State Street in an unsuccessful attempt to stop it from sharing data with Data Explorers (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 219), and that the quantitative hedge fund Renaissance Technologies \"opted not to participate in AQS\" after facing threats from each Defendant (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 215).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   In Defendants' view, the Amended Complaint's pleadings of secret meetings and communications are too \"general and conclusory,\" especially because Defendants' participation in and support of EquiLend was not concealed from the market. (Def. Br. 48). Defendants also argue that the Amended Complaint fails the Rule 9(b) requirement to plead with particularity that any alleged misrepresentations by Defendants were \"intentionally false when made.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49). On this point, the Court agrees. While the Amended Complaint does allege that Wipf and Conley met over private dinners in New York\n   City (AC \u00b6\u00b6 21, 294); that Wipf informed his team of the planned conspiracy over an internal (albeit routine) Morgan Stanley call (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 295); and that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs persuaded the remaining Defendants to join the conspiracy during meetings at industry conferences and of the EquiLend Board (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 297), alleging that Defendants conspired during private meetings, without more, is insufficient to plead affirmative acts of concealment.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Precision Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Panalpina World Transp.

Jan. 4, 2011) (allegation that the defendants \"formulated the conspiracy during secret meetings,\" without alleging efforts to avoid detection, such as \"pretextual press announcements,\" did not adequately plead affirmative acts of concealment),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hendrickson Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549048\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/840/1065/#p1083\">\n    840 F.2d at 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding affirmative acts of concealment where defendants allegedly burned and shredded documents to avoid their discovery).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   As to pleading intentional misrepresentations, the Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants described EquiLend's purpose as promoting the broad goal of efficiency, and made supportive statements about both central clearing in general and Plaintiffs' products in particular before turning cold. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 237, 377-80). Even taken in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the allegation that Defendants' initial enthusiasm dissipated does not support a reasonable inference that the enthusiastic statements were knowingly false when made. Nor do any facts alleged in the Amended Complaint support an inference that Defendants' threats against their hedge fund clients were made in furtherance of concealment, rather than merely to stop the clients from using Plaintiffs' products. The Amended Complaint also does not support Plaintiffs' arguments that Defendants used threats to silence victims and witnesses. The word \"silence\" appears once in the Amended Complaint, in a conclusory and unsupported assertion that Defendants abused their market power \"to silence, punish, and exclude those who dared to cross them[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 382). What the Amended Complaint does allege is that Defendants made threats \"privately and in confidence\" to stop market participants from using and sharing data with the victim platforms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 191, 213, 215, 237, 243). These allegations do not support an inference that threats were made to silence anyone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   However, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs at this stage of litigation leads the Court to conclude that the phrase \"Project Gateway\" may have been designed as a code name rather than as mere shorthand. For this reason, the Amended Complaint plausibly alleges at least one affirmative act of concealment. When combined with the inherently self-concealing nature of the alleged conspiracy, the Amended Complaint adequately pleads concealment for tolling purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Plaintiffs Adequately Allege Ignorance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that they had no prior knowledge of the collusion, which was brought to light only by counsel's recent investigation revealing \"critical, non-public facts.\" (Pl. Opp. 47). That other industry participants and market regulators did not catch wind of the conspiracy shows, in Plaintiffs' view, that Plaintiffs could not have acquired knowledge of it through the exercise of reasonable diligence.

EquiLend's Supplemental Motion to Dismiss Is Denied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   EquiLend's supplemental motion to dismiss advances four main arguments: (i) its conduct was consistent with rational business strategy; (ii) the alleged use of its\n   board meetings to plan the conspiracy is insufficient to support a claim against it; (iii) the allegations against it do not pass muster under a rule of reason analysis; and (iv) this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over EquiLend Europe. The Court addresses, and rejects, each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   To start, EquiLend contends that its purchase of AQS, its refusal to merge with SL-x, its subsequent purchase and shelving of SL-x's intellectual property, and its creation of the DataLend product were all \"consistent with rational business strategy,\" and therefore cannot serve as evidence of its joining a conspiracy. (EquiLend Br. 4-8). Of course, the fact that conduct may be consistent with an innocuous explanation does not permit the Court, on a motion to dismiss, to ignore other inculpatory inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the same allegations when considered in light of the complaint as a whole. To be sure, pleading a Section 1 claim requires \"allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with) agreement[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is why pleading parallel conduct that is consistent with unilateral action, unaccompanied by other circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy in the form of \"plus factors,\" is insufficient to state a Section 1 claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the Amended Complaint does not rest on bare allegations that EquiLend engaged in parallel conduct; Plaintiffs also allege circumstantial evidence of conspiracy, in that EquiLend acted against its own economic self-interest under direction from the Prime Broker Defendants. For example, the Amended Complaint alleges that: \"EquiLend representatives, including CEO Brian Lamb, had been instructed not to 'break rank' and not to take independent actions\" (AC \u00b6 16); the Prime Broker Defendants \"instruct[ed] EquiLend's then-CEO, Brian Lamb, to advance an agenda through EquiLend to halt the widespread dissemination of pricing data to the market at large\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 124); EquiLend's refusal to allow itself \"to be sold at any price,\" and its underuse of the assets purchased from AQS and SL-x, were counter-profit behaviors (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 314-15); and EquiLend's joint venture status was a sham (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 313, 319). That\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of EquiLend's alleged conduct may be consistent with rational business strategy does not negate the presence of other \"allegations plausibly suggesting ... agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   In an apparent attempt to bolster its consistency arguments, EquiLend ignores the allegations that it acted against economic self-interest and at the direction of the Prime Broker Defendants, instead making a series of assertions about what is missing from the Amended Complaint. EquiLend asserts, for instance, that the Amended Complaint \"alleges no facts\" connecting EquiLend's purchase of AQS to a boycott conspiracy. (EquiLend Br. 5). It follows up by noting that the Amended Complaint fails to allege that, following the purchase of AQS, EquiLend stopped operating the AQS platform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Instead, the Amended Complaint merely alleges that, following the purchase, EquiLend failed to develop AQS assets further or to license those assets to third parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6 315). EquiLend acknowledges here the allegation that it purchased AQS at a rock-bottom price of $5 million, which price was a direct result of the harm caused by the boycott. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 301). But, it reasons, the mere fact that EquiLend may have benefited from the boycott, without more, is insufficient to infer its participation. EquiLend argues as well that there is nothing suspicious about its refusal to merge with SL-x, its purchase of, and subsequent failure to use, SL-x's intellectual property, or its launch of the DataLend product. (EquiLend\n   Br. 6-8). EquiLend advances the innocuous inference that it purchased and shelved SL-x intellectual property in order to protect itself from patent trolls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Finally, it asserts that the Amended Complaint fails to plead that the launch of DataLend to complete against Data Explorers \"is more consistent with conspiracy than it is with the 'wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy' that cannot support an inference of conspiracy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Unfortunately for EquiLend, the isolated facts it presents regarding its purchase of AQS's and SL-x's intellectual property and its launch of DataLend are not the only allegations connecting it to the boycott and the conspiracy more generally. As detailed above, the Amended Complaint alleges that EquiLend acted against self-interest, and at the direction of the Prime Broker Defendants. Those allegations support a reasonable inference that EquiLend acted on behalf of the conspiracy, not as an independent economic decisionmaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Next, EquiLend argues that the allegation that the conspiracy was planned at its board meetings is insufficient to implicate it in the conspiracy. (EquiLend Br. 3-4). It relies here on the reasoning of the court in\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   , which dismissed a complaint against an organization that EquiLend contends was analogous. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). The analogy is inapt. In\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   , the relevant allegations were threefold: the alleged conspirators had used the organization as a forum for conspiratorial discussions; the organization had failed to launch the product that the plaintiffs felt would have been attractive; and the organization had priced its existing products in a manner that the plaintiffs claimed was designed to be inaccessible to certain customers.\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267299\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/430/#p463\">\n    261 F.Supp.3d at 486-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, in contrast, the Amended Complaint alleges not merely that Defendants used EquiLend meetings as a forum to plot the conspiracy, but also that EquiLend engaged in active conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy, namely purchasing SL-x's intellectual property to shelve its enabling technology and launching DataLend to underprice and block the development of Data Explorers. These allegations of active conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    In re IRS\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   For similar reasons, EquiLend's contention that the Amended Complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support a rule of reason violation also fails. EquiLend argues that a rule of reason analysis would require \"allegations of a geographic market, a product market, market power in that market, and anticompetitive effects.\" (EquiLend Br. 11). But because the Amended Complaint pleads sufficient facts to support an inference that EquiLend was a member of the conspiracy, the allegations concerning the Prime Broker Defendants' market power in the U.S. stock lending market, and anticompetitive conduct including boycotts, also implicate EquiLend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Finally, EquiLend argues that there is no specific personal jurisdiction over EquiLend Europe, which is incorporated in the United Kingdom and Wales and headquartered in London. (EquiLend Br. 11). Plaintiffs respond that the Amended Complaint attributes the EquiLend Board members' alleged \"general agreement\" not to allow \"industry advances\" outside of EquiLend to EquiLend Europe, as well as to the other EquiLend entities. (Pl. EquiLend Opp. 12). Plaintiffs point out that some of the alleged statements evidencing involvement in the conspiracy were made by individuals who sat on EquiLend Europe's board, and not on the board of the U.S. EquiLend entity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 239-46). Plaintiffs argue that,\n   drawing all inferences in their favor, EquiLend Europe was part of the conspiracy. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that it has jurisdiction over EquiLend Europe because its co-conspirators' \"overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy\" may be imputed to it for purposes of exercising jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Charles Schwab Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bank of Am.

These include, for example, an unnamed executive's statement that Credit Suisse would pursue an exchange through EquiLend rather than invest in SL-x, which Defendants argue is a natural unilateral decision not to invest in a competitor. (AC \u00b6 17; Def. Br. 22; Def. Reply 6). In this regard, Defendants contend that the allegation of a 2009 \"meeting of 'the five families' ... [to] settle on their collective messaging\" for an anticipated discussion with the SEC does not plead direct evidence of conspiracy. (AC \u00b6 202; Def. Br. 20). Defendants argue that (i) this meeting \"could not have been conspiratorial\" because it was organized by Bank of America, which was not alleged to have joined the conspiracy until 2011; (ii) the Amended Complaint fails to specify either who attended the meeting or when and where it occurred; and (iii) a meeting to coordinate messaging to a public official is not an antitrust violation. (Def. Br. 20). Defendants also contest that the reference to \"five families\" fails adequately to allege direct evidence because Plaintiffs never identify to whom the phrase refers or connect the phrase to the alleged conspiracy. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). And the allegation of use of the \"Project Gateway\" code word does not, in Defendants' view, plead direct evidence because the phrase was used to refer to lawful joint venture discussions by Thomas Wipf and William Conley about Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs potentially purchasing AQS. (Def. Br. 21; Def. Reply 7;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    AC \u00b6\u00b6 11, 21-22, 294-97, 363). Finally, Defendants claim that the allegation that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs conspiratorially secured the participation of the other Defendants lacks the specifics necessary to count as direct evidence of conspiracy. (Def. Br. 21). However, the fact that these, and perhaps many more, allegations in the Amended Complaint do not satisfy the standard to plead direct evidence does not mean that the Amended Complaint does not contain other, well-pleaded allegations of direct evidence of conspiracy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    Defendants suggest that the 2011 date is significant because it is \"two years after the alleged conspiracy commenced.\" (Def. Br. 25). This reasoning lacks merit because the Amended Complaint does not allege that Bank of America joined the conspiracy until 2011.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    The parties dispute whether a claim accrues when \"the defendant commits an act that injures the plaintiff\" (Def. Br. 45), or \"when\n    <em>\n     the injury occurs\n    </em>\n    \" (Pl. Opp. 50). Despite Defendants' apparent attempt to capitalize on the ambiguity of the phrase \"commits an act that injures the plaintiff\" (Def.
