Plaintiff alleges that Par 2, as a successor in interest to Paragon, is bound by the 2007 injunction. Defendants deny that Par 2 is a successor to Paragon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   An evidentiary hearing was held on February 26-27, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff was represented by Karen E. Bobela, attorney for the United States Department of Labor. Defendants were represented by Rick Sutherland. Par 2, an intervening party, was represented by Jeffrey Matura. The testimony of witness was heard and several exhibits and joint stipulations by the parties were received. After considering all of the evidence and the arguments of counsel, it is determined that Par 2, as a successor to Paragon and Brian Jessop, individually, violated the permanent injunction on November 29, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FINDINGS OF FACT....1197\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CONCLUSIONS OF LAW....1210\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A.

A Permanent Injunction against Defendants Paragon, Brian Jessop, and James Jessop was entered on November 29, 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to the injunction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants shall not, contrary to Sections 12(c) and 15(a)(4) of the FLSA, employ, suffer or permit minors to work in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, within the meaning of the FLSA under conditions constituting oppressive child labor as defined in \u00a7 3(l) of the FLSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (l), and in occupations therein declared to be hazardous as defined in the regulations found at 29 C.F.R. Part 570 (Subparts C and E).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   2. The Injunction enjoins and restrains \"defendants, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of [the injunction].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   3. On June 1, 2016, following an evidentiary hearing, Defendants Paragon and Brian Jessop were found to be in contempt of the 2007 injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   4. A Sanctions Order was entered on December 6, 2016, finding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, shortly after being caught using child labor in the construction industry and agreeing to the entry of the Injunction, Defendants secretly began profiting from child labor once again. Defendants sought to conceal their knowing and willful violation of the Injunction. They told employees to lie about the child labor and even developed signals and strategies for hiding child workers during inspections. They failed to maintain records of work performed on the Ranch, denied the Department access to the Ranch, refused to provide names of employees who worked at the Ranch, refused to respond to subpoenas, and made incredible denials of their involvement with the work at the Ranch.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Additionally, a specific finding was entered that Defendants were \"not credible,\" and their testimony was \"evasive and often ... contradicted by other witnesses' testimony.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   5. It was also determined that \"Defendants have left the Court with no assurance that they are in compliance with its order or that they will, on their own accord, comply in the future.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a remedy for Defendants' contempt, a special master was appointed to monitor Defendants' compliance with the injunction, and Defendants were ordered to make an initial payment of $200,000 to the Department of Labor to place into an interest bearing account to serve as a fund to compensate children for their work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   6. Plaintiff filed another show cause motion on September 25, 2017, alleging that Defendants and Par 2 Contractors, LLC, as successor in interest to Paragon, were again in contempt of the 2007 injunction, as well as the Order Appointing Special Master.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   7. Defendants appealed the sanctions order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In March 2018, the Tenth Circuit affirmed Judge Campbell's finding of contempt and the compensatory damages contempt sanction, but reversed the appointment of a special master.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   8. In light of the Tenth Circuit's decision, the parties stipulated that the only issue currently before this Court is whether Defendants and Par 2, as a successor in interest to Paragon, violated the 2007 Permanent Injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Par 2 is a Successor in Interest to Paragon\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     There has been a substantial continuity in operations, work force, location, management, working conditions and methods of production between Paragon and Par 2\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   9. Par 2 is a commercial framing company, as was Paragon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   10. Par 2 filed Articles of Incorporation with the Utah Secretary of State on December 2, 2013, but it did not begin to operate as a business until August 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   11. While Paragon remains an active company, it has no contracts for work, jobs, or employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paragon sold most of its tools and equipment over the last few years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   At most, Paragon had \"a job or two\" that was \"still going on\" in 2016 somewhere in Louisiana, but Brian Jessop does not remember any details of the job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paragon had no jobs or contracts for work in 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   12. Brian Jessop testified that he has been downsizing Paragon's operations since 2011 for personal reasons, but his testimony is inconsistent with Paragon's tax records, that he read into the record, establishing that Paragon's gross receipts and sales were $5,619,108 in 2010, $6,683.579 in 2011, and $6,088,107 in 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   13. Porter Brothers is a general contractor located in Gilbert, Arizona.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Porter Brothers hired Paragon as a subcontractor for various jobs between 2013 and 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   In May 2015, Porter Brothers received a bid from the same individuals it worked with at Paragon, but under the company name Par 2 Contractors, LLC, and Porter Brothers has worked with Par 2 (and not Paragon) ever since.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   14. Like Paragon, Par 2 does work for large commercial hotels like Hyatt and Marriott, universities, and other large scale commercial projects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   15. Par 2's annual dollar volume of business was $1,030,998 in 2014, $5,753,562 in 2015, and $8,022,510.87 (YTD at the time of Wage Hour's investigation) in 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   16. Paragon's address is 1065 W.

Paragon's phone number was (435) 874-1310.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Par 2 used the same phone number for several years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jake Barlow claimed that Par 2 eventually got a new phone number but he could not recall when and there is no evidence to support\n   his testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Don Jessop also could not recall when Par 2 got a separate phone number.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   18. All of Par 2's upper level employees are former employees or management of Paragon:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Brian Jessop:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   a.

When contractors like Porter Brothers sent bid requests to Par 2, they sent the requests to Brian Jessop, and the bids Porter Brothers received from Par 2 had Brian Jessop's name at the bottom of them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   f. Brian Jessop communicated with estimators and project managers from Porter Brothers-on behalf of Par 2-to clarify proposals and contracts for work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   g.

Brian Jessop's involvement is not limited to the bidding process; he also oversees the day to day operations of Par\n   2's work sites through the completion of Par 2's work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Don Jessop:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   a.

Don Jessop's declaration states he was employed by Paragon until 2004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, in August 2017, Don Jessop told the U.S. Department of Labor, Wage Hour Division (\"Wage Hour\") that he worked for Paragon between 1998 and 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, Don Jessop testified that he worked as a foreman for Paragon between 2013 and 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dennis Porter also confirmed that Don Jessop worked as a foreman for Paragon between 2013 and 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   c. In contrast, Brian Jessop testified that Don Jessop worked for Paragon between 2002 and 2004, but he acknowledged that Don Jessop appears on Paragon's employee list provided to Wage Hour pursuant to a subpoena in 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Jake Barlow:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   a.

Par 2 has between 20 to 30 employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   In August 2017, Don Jessop told Wage Hour that he has hired only two or three former Paragon employees to work at Par 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, a comparison of employee lists provided by Paragon and Par 2 reflect that at least nineteen employees overlap between the companies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   These employees include: William Barlow, Williamson Dutson, Kimball Barlow, Randall Barlow, Leonard Barlow, Tobias Dutson, Leroy Barlow, Jr., Winston Barlow, Winston Zitting, Aaron Barlow, Philip Barlow, Jared Dutson, Derek Jessop, Thomas Jessop, Tennyson Barlow, Keith Dutson, Benjamin Barlow, Jake Barlow, and Don Jessop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, although Brian Jessop and James Jessop deny being employed by Par 2, there evidence to the contrary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   20.

Paragon and Par 2 use the same proposal forms to solicit work from contractors and Brian Jessop signed the proposals for both companies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paragon and Par 2 produced employee lists on nearly identical forms as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an effort to explain this, Don Jessop testified that he is not sure whether Par 2 inherited the same software used by Paragon or purchased something different.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   24.

Par 2 received some tools, equipment, and vehicles from Paragon; but neither Don nor Brian Jessop would elaborate with respect to what tools, equipment, or vehicles were transferred from Paragon to Par 2.

This finding is supported by sufficient evidence in the record that Brian Jessop and Don Jessop went to great lengths to conceal and minimize Don Jessop's level of involvement with Paragon before Par 2 was up and running;\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n   and similarly, their attempt to conceal and minimize Brian Jessop and James Jessop's involvement in Par 2 after Paragon transferred its business operations to Par 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n   To further their deception, they produced altered documents to a federal agency pursuant to a subpoena.\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was done with the intent to conceal evidence of Brian Jessop's role with Par 2. As was specifified at the conclusion of the hearing, this amounts to \"falsification without justification.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n   The deception also includes Brian Jessop's failure and Par 2's refusal to produce emails sent to or from Brian Jessop's Par 2 email account pursuant to a subpoena.\n   <footnotemark>\n    181\n   </footnotemark>\n   The emails obtained by the Plaintiff through an independent source unequivocally implicate Brian Jessop as an employee and agent of Par 2 and demonstrate his extensive involvement in Par 2's day to day business operations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    182\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only reason for Par 2 to alter these documents and withhold Brian Jessop's emails is to evade court orders that bind Brian Jessop (and consequently impact Par 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   More broadly, Don Jessop's and Brian Jessop's testimony was reluctant and replete with pauses, vague answers, and an absence of recall that affects the assessment of their credibility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    183\n   </footnotemark>\n   Three other federal judges who have made adverse credibility findings against Brian Jessop in prior proceedings related to this case have reached the same finding as is entered here: Brian Jessop is not credible. Similarly, Don Jessop is also not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The impression of Porter Brothers is accurate: Paragon simply changed its name to Par 2 and continued business as usual. Brian Jessop is the owner of Paragon and his brother, James Jessop, served as the Vice President of the company. Par 2 is owned by their brother, Don Jessop, and Brian Jessop and James Jessop have continued working for Par 2. While Paragon is not formally dissolved, it ceased operations around the same time Par 2 began operations and Par 2 continued Paragon's business under the individual control of family members. Under\n   <em>\n    Walling\n   </em>\n   , the extent to which Par 2, as successor to Paragon, was bound by the 2007 Injunction must be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Successor Liability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Successor liability under the FLSA has yet to be specifically addressed by the Tenth Circuit. However, in\n   <em>\n    Chao v. Concrete Management Resources, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the district court permitted the plaintiff to amend her complaint, in part, based on a theory of successor liability under the FLSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    184\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court found that while the Tenth Circuit had not addressed the issue, the only circuit court that had \"held, with no difficulty whatsoever, that successorship liability exists under the\n   FLSA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    185\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since then, the Third, Seventh and Eleventh Circuits have addressed the merits of the issue and concluded that application of the federal common law standard of successor liability to claims under the FLSA is the logical extension of existing case law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    186\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Tenth Circuit has expressly adopted the \"\n   <em>\n    MacMillan\n   </em>\n   factors\" in analyzing the federal common law standard for a successor corporation's liability in the Title VII context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    187\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those factors include whether the successor company had notice of the charge; the ability of the predecessor to provide relief; and whether there has been a substantial continuity in operations, work force, location, management, working conditions and methods of production.\n   <footnotemark>\n    188\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"nature and extent of [successor] liability is subject to no formula, but must be determined upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    189\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The liability of a successor is not automatic, but must be determined on a case by case basis.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    190\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Federal courts have developed a similar common-law doctrine of successorship liability in the labor and employment context which includes some or all of the \"\n   <em>\n    MacMillan\n   </em>\n   factors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    191\n   </footnotemark>\n   This common law doctrine extends to legal obligations arising under the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\"), the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), and the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), among others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    192\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Resilient Floor Covering\n   </em>\n   , the court found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   Striking a \"balance between the need to effectuate federal labor and employment ... policies and the need ... to facilitate the fluid transfer of corporate assets,\" the successorship doctrine, when applicable, holds legally responsible for obligations arising under federal labor and employment statutes businesses that are substantial continuations of entities with such obligations. \"The inquiry [in these successorship cases] is [therefore] not merely whether the new employer is a 'successor' in the strict corporate-law sense of the term. The successorship inquiry in the labor-law context is much broader.\" Sullivan, 623 F.3d at 781. \"The primary question in [labor and employment] successorship cases is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, there is 'substantial continuity' between the old and new enterprise.\" (internal citations omitted)\n   <footnotemark>\n    193\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \"Decisions on successorship must balance,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   the national policies underlying the statute at issue and the interests of the affected parties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    194\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the origins of successor liability are equitable, fairness is a prime consideration in its application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    195\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   iii.\n   <em>\n    Par 2 as a successor to Paragon can be held liable for contempt of the 2007 Injunction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Turning to the application of this test and taking into account fairness and the policies and interests at stake, Par 2 is a successor with liability to Paragon. There has been a substantial continuity in operations, work force, location, management, working conditions, and methods of production between Paragon and Par 2; Par 2 had notice of the 2007 injunction; and Par 2 has the ability to provide relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Par 2 had substantial continuity in operations from Paragon\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    196\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In sum, Par 2 picked up operations where Paragon left off with its commercial framing company. Par 2 began operations when Paragon was slowing down its operations. Dennis Porter, one of the owners of Porter Brothers, explained the impact of the transfer of business operations between Paragon and Par 2 succinctly: Porter Brothers hired Paragon as a subcontractor for various jobs between 2013-2015; in May 2015, Porter Brothers received a bid from the same individuals it worked with at Paragon, but under the company name Par 2 Contractors, LLC; and Porter Brothers has worked with Par 2 (and not Paragon) ever since. In light of Paragon's name change to Par 2, Porter Brothers requested a new W-9, which Jake Barlow provided from a Par 2 email address with Paragon Contractors in his signature line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Par 2 continued to operate with Paragon's same address, phone number, email addresses in some instances, and several of the same form documents (i.e. employee list, proposals, etc.). At least 19 of Paragon's employees transferred to Par 2 (some of whom continued to identify their employer as Paragon even after the name change occurred). In addition, Paragon's upper level management transferred to Par 2 as well and continued their same roles in the company, including Don Jessop, Brian Jessop, James Jessop, Jake Barlow, and Benjamin Jessop. Par 2 also inherited and utilized Paragon's Occupational Safety and Health Policy, as well as several OSHA forms bearing Paragon's name to establish compliance with OSHA's record keeping requirements. Par 2 inherited some tools, equipment, and vehicles from Paragon. These facts establish a substantial continuity in operations, work force, location, management, working conditions, and methods of production. Paragon and Par 2 are one and the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Par 2 had notice of the 2007 Injunction\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    197\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Brian Jessop and James Jessop are individually named and their signatures appear on the 2007 Injunction. Both of these individuals had actual knowledge of the Injunction before Paragon changed its name to Par 2. In fact, the name change occurred shortly after Paragon and Brian Jessop were subject to subpoena enforcement litigation that culminated in a finding of contempt against them for violating the Injunction at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    198\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Defendants used Par 2 as an instrumentality to violate the injunction, Brian and James Jessop's actual knowledge of the Injunction is imputed to Par 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   There is sufficient evidence that supports a finding that Don Jessop and Jake Barlow also had actual notice of the Injunction. Don Jessop was a Director for Paragon's corporation from 2000-2010, during which time the Injunction was entered. He was also employed by Paragon over the course of ten years, and he facilitated the transfer of Paragon to Par 2 with his brothers who are individually named as parties to the Injunction. Although Don Jessop claims that he \"has never seen, been given of, or read\" the 2007 Permanent Injunction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    199\n   </footnotemark>\n   this testimony is not credible. Don Jessop's willful ignorance of the Injunction does not negate a finding that he had actual knowledge of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Similarly, Jake Barlow was the primary point of contact at Paragon before the name change to Par 2. He testified that he assisted Paragon with gathering and producing documents pursuant to the Department of Labor's subpoena issued to Paragon in 2013 in the course of Wage Hour's child labor investigation. Underlying that subpoena and investigation was the 2007 Injunction and Jake Barlow understood the purpose of the subpoena and Wage Hour's investigation. It is highly unlikely given his role in the company and his participation in the prior investigation that he had no knowledge of the Injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The credibility issues involving Defendants' witnesses, and the nature and extent of the deception involved in concealing the relationship between Paragon, Brian Jessop, James Jessop, and Par 2 are intertwined with and directly related to Defendants' and Par 2's attempt to evade the 2007 Injunction. As such, all parties involved in this action had actual knowledge of the Injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Par 2 has the ability to provide relief\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    200\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Par 2's annual dollar volume of business exceeded $8 million in 2016. Par 2 operates in several states and works with a variety of contractors. There was no evidence presented at trial to support a finding that Par 2 is unable to provide relief in this case. To the contrary, Par 2 does have the ability to provide relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Under the totality of circumstances in this case, there is substantial continuity between Paragon and Par 2 and that the name change of the entity from Paragon to Par 2 is the only real distinction to be made between the two companies. This finding is based on the national policies underlying the Fair Labor Standards Act and the interests of the affected parties with fairness being the prime consideration. Defendants and Par 2 cannot be permitted to avoid all responsibility for compliance with the 2007 Injunction entered against Paragon, Brian Jessop, and James Jessop, by the simple expedient of unofficially transferring Paragon's business operations to Par 2 under the individual control of the same family members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   As the instrumentality through which Defendants sought to evade the 2007 Injunction, Par 2 comes within the description of \"persons in active concert or participation with them\" in violation of the Injunction. Under this guise, and as a successor to Paragon, at all relevant times Par 2 was bound by the 2007 Injunction in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants and Par 2 are in Contempt of the 2007 Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In order to prove contempt of a court order, a plaintiff must establish by clear and convincing evidence, that (1) a valid court order existed, (2) defendants had knowledge of the order, and (3) defendants disobeyed the order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    201\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    A valid court order existed\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The 2007 Permanent Injunction entered by this Court on November 29, 2007, is a valid court order. The injunction permanently enjoins Paragon, Brian Jessop, James Jessop and \"their officers, agents, servants, employees, and those persons in active concert or participation with them\" from violating the provisions of Sections 12(c) and 15(a)(4) of the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Defendants had knowledge of the court order.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendants and Par 2, as an intervening party, had knowledge of the Injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   iii.\n   <em>\n    Defendants and Par 2 disobeyed the order\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    202\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Plaintiff has shown by clear and convincing evidence that Defendants and Par 2 disobeyed the 2007 Injunction by suffering or permitting minors to work in violation of the FLSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20212\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Brian Jessop prepared the bid for the job where the child labor occurred, he was designated as the primary point of contact for Par 2 on the subcontract for work, and he maintained communication\n   with the general contractor throughout the job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   As a result of the child labor violations, Wage Hour assessed a civil money penalty in the amount of $6,920.00. Par 2 accepted the violations, paid the penalty, and the case was administratively closed. By paying the penalty and not taking exception to the determination that the violations for which the penalty was imposed occurred, the administrative determination became a final order and not subject to administrative or judicial review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    203\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Less than two years ago, Defendants Paragon and Brian Jessop were found to be in contempt of the 2007 injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    204\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Sanctions Order begins with a finding that \"[b]ehind a veil of secrecy in Southern Utah's desert country the Defendants profited from the labor of a religious community's children in violation of the court's previous injunction.\" Judge Campbell found \"[a]t the hearing, as well as throughout discovery, it became clear that Paragon and Brian Jessop were not trustworthy and would go to great lengths to deceive the court and the Government.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    205\n   </footnotemark>\n   This finding was based in part on the fact that \"shortly after being caught using child labor in the construction industry and agreeing to the entry of the [2007] Injunction, Defendants secretly began profiting from child labor once again. Defendants sought to conceal their knowing and willful violation of the Injunction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    206\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Once more, Defendants' contempt of the Injunction and their extraordinary efforts to conceal their knowing and willful violation of it must be addressed. Shortly after being caught profiting from the labor of a religious community's children in violation of the 2007 Injunction, Defendants began profiting from child labor in the construction industry once again. Paragon and Brian Jessop have gone to great lengths, in active concert and participation with Par 2 and Don Jessop and Jake Barlow, to deceive and evade having to comply with court orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Plaintiff has proven by clear and convincing evidence that Par 2 Contractors, LLC, is a successor in interest to Paragon Contractors Corporation. Plaintiff has also proven by clear and convincing evidence that Defendants and Par 2, and Don Jessop and Jake Barlow as agents of Par 2, are in contempt of the 2007 Injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   For the foregoing reasons,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Par 2 Contractors, LLC, as a successor in interest to Paragon Contractors Corporation, is joined as a Defendant to this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    207\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED and ADJUDGED that Defendants Paragon, Brian\n   Jessop, and Par 2, Don Jessop, as Par 2's agent, and Jake Barlow as Par 2's agent, are in civil contempt of this Court's 2007 Injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    208\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In order to purge themselves of such contempt, Defendants, its officers, agents, successors and assigns shall:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   1. Provide a copy of the 2007 Injunction and this Order to every contractor, employer, or entity with whom it has entered into a contract to perform work over the last ten years. Defendants shall certify to Wage Hour that it has complied with this provision and provide a list of every contractor, employer, or entity to whom such notice was provided within 30 days of the entry of this Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    209\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   2. Provide a copy of the 2007 Injunction and this Order to each of their employees. Defendants shall certify to Wage Hour that it has complied with this provision and provide a list of every employee to whom such notice was provided within 60 days of this Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    210\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   3. Defendants shall place $50,000 into a fund to provide training on the child labor provisions of the FLSA and its implementing regulations to all of Defendants' employees and management, including all employees under the age of 18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    211\n   </footnotemark>\n   This remedy is imposed in order to compensate those who have suffered most from Defendants' contemptuous conduct, namely, Defendants' under-aged employees, by providing a fuller understanding of the child labor provisions of the FLSA to under-aged workers, their adult co-workers, and their managers. Imposing this requirement is directly attributable to the testimony from WHI Goehl regarding his closing conference with Par 2 following Wage Hour's child labor investigation in 2016. During that conference Par 2's attorney told WHI Goehl that Par 2, being from an extremely rural area in Hildale, UT, likely became accustomed to allowing 17-year olds to perform these types of tasks and was unaware that any rules existed to indicate that it was illegal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    212\n   </footnotemark>\n   This remedy squarely addresses this problem. Moreover, the training fund and associated training activities also serve to compensate the Plaintiff and the public for the harm caused by Defendants' contempt. Congress has deemed that it is in the public interest to eliminate detrimental labor conditions, including, most importantly, the use of illegal child labor. Defendants' continued exploitation of child labor for their own competitive advantage has harmed Plaintiff's ability to uphold that public interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    213\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties shall confer regarding the implementation and operation of this training fund and submit a proposed plan within 56 days of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   4. Defendants shall pay to Plaintiff the reasonable costs of prosecuting the contempt, including attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    214\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff\n   shall submit an affidavit and proposed order establishing such costs, including attorney's fees, travel and subsistence costs for Plaintiff's counsel and witnesses, witness fees and mileage allowances, transcript and court reporter costs, etc., within 14 days of the entry of this Order.

Thomas &amp; Betts Power Solutions, LLC\n    </em>\n    , Judge Posner, writing for the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, made a case for the ongoing vitality of the common law successorship standard and for its application to claims under the FLSA:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-368\">\n    The idea behind having a distinct federal standard applicable to federal labor and employment statutes is that these statutes are intended either to foster labor peace, as in the National Labor Relations Act, or to protect workers' rights, as in Title VII, and that in either type of case the imposition of successor liability will often be necessary to achieve the statutory goals because the workers will often be unable to head off a corporate sale by their employer aimed at extinguishing the employer's liability to them. This logic extends to suits to enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act. \"The FLSA was passed to protect workers' standards of living through the regulation of working conditions.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20202\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 202\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That fundamental purpose is as fully deserving of protection as the labor peace, anti-discrimination, and worker security policies underlying the NLRA, Title VII,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , ERISA, and MPPAA.\"\n    <em>\n     Steinbach v.

In the absence of successor liability, a violator of the Act could escape liability, or at least make relief much more difficult to obtain, by selling its assets without an assumption of liabilities by the buyer (for such an assumption would reduce the purchase price by imposing a cost on the buyer) and then dissolving. And although it can be argued that imposing successor liability in such a case impedes the operation of the market in companies by increasing the cost to the buyer of a company that may have violated the FLSA, it's not a strong argument. The successor will have been compensated for bearing the liabilities by paying less for the assets it's buying; it will have paid less because the net value of the assets will have been diminished by the associated liabilities.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-369\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805006\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/763/#p767\">\n     711 F.3d 763\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 765-67 (7th Cir. 2013).
