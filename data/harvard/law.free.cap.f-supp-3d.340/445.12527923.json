Before the Court are the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendants Cephalon, Inc., Cephalon Clinical Partners, L.P., and Cephalon Development Corporation (collectively \"Cephalon\"), and the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendants SciMedica Group, LLC and SciMedica Group Marketing Research and Consulting, LLC (collectively \"SciMedica\"). For the reasons that follow, we grant both Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This lawsuit concerns two advertisements that SciMedica faxed, on behalf of Cephalon, to an employee of PHS, Dr. Jose Martinez, in 2009. At that time, PHS employed Dr. Martinez as a primary care physician practicing in the area of pain management. (Martinez Dep. at 13, 15-16.) The first advertisement was faxed by SciMedica to Dr. Martinez on January 16, 2009 and invited Dr. Martinez to a dinner program regarding Amrix, a form of long-acting cyclobenzaprine that is prescribed for musculoskeletal pain. (Cephalon Ex. A; Martinez Dep. at 28.) On August 27, 2009, SciMedica, on behalf of Cephalon, faxed the second advertisement to Dr. Martinez, inviting him to a luncheon program in Las Vegas, Nevada that would include discussions on assessing breakthrough pain (\"BTP\") and the use of opioids for treating BTP. (Cephalon Ex. B.) Neither of these faxes included an opt-out notice setting forth the manner in which the recipient could ask the sender not to fax any advertisements in the future. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cephalon Exs. A, B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Complaint asserts one claim against Defendants for violating the JFPA by sending unsolicited advertisements that fail to contain an opt-out notice, as that statute requires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-39;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C).) PHS seeks to recover its actual monetary losses from these violations or statutory damages of $500.00 for each violation, whichever is greater.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 13.) Cephalon argues, in its Motion for Summary Judgment, that it is entitled to the entry of judgment in its favor on Plaintiff's single claim brought pursuant to the JFPA because it had express permission to fax to Plaintiff the two advertisements at issue in this case, so those advertisements were not subject to the JFPA's requirement that unsolicited advertisements contain opt-out notices. SciMedica has adopted the arguments set forth by Cephalon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

PHS relies on the Solicited Fax Rule, which was issued by the FCC in 2006 and \"require[d] a sender of a fax advertisement to include an opt-out notice on the advertisement, even when the advertisement [was] sent to a recipient from whom the sender 'obtained permission.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bais Yaakov\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277859\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/1078/#p1080\">\n    852 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1080 (citing 71 Fed.

They discussed both Cephalon's established drugs and new product and services offered by Cephalon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30.) Dr. Martinez specifically recalls talking to representatives of Cephalon about Amrix, Fentora, Provigil, Actiq, and Gabatril. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.) Cephalon's representatives left product information with Dr. Martinez and also obtained his permission to follow up by sending him additional information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.) At the same time, PHS left business cards containing its office fax number on its receptionist's desk, so that patients and drug company representatives could use that number to contact Dr. Martinez.

Defendants have submitted undisputed evidence that establishes that Dr. Martinez discussed his pain management practice with representatives of Cephalon, including the use of \"narcotic drugs for chronic pain.\" (Martinez Dep. at 28.)

We further conclude, accordingly, that the faxes at issue in this litigation were not unsolicited advertisements subject to the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    KHS Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204030699\">\n    2018 WL 4030699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because Defendants have established that the two faxed advertisements at issue\n   in this case were sent with the prior express permission of an employee of PHS, we conclude that the faxes were not unsolicited and that the provisions of \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C) requiring the inclusion of opt-out information did not apply to those faxes. Accordingly, we conclude that Defendants are entitled to the entry of judgment in their favor as a matter of law as to PHS's claim for violation of \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C) and we grant Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment. An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    PHS also seeks to represent a class consisting of all persons or entities that are holders of telephone numbers to which Defendants sent advertisements by fax in the four years preceding the filing of the Complaint.
