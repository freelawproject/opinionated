ECF No. 24 \u00b6 2. Kuang entered the United States on a CR2 visa, which is issued to children of a foreign spouse who is married or soon to be married to a U.S. citizen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A month later, Kuang obtained his green card pursuant to his father's marriage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.

ECF No. 24-1 at 2. Kuang enlisted in the military because of desire to serve his country. ECF No. 24 \u00b6 11. In addition, Kuang was motivated by the promise of financial assistance with his future college education and the understanding that he would be eligible to naturalize (i.e. become a U.S. citizen) once he entered basic training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on these representations, Kuang renewed his green card rather than applying to become a citizen through the much lengthier civilian process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Kuang's enlistment contract provided that he would be eligible to \"ship out,\" or enter active service, on July 5, 2018.

ECF No. 25 \u00b6 7; ECF No. 25-1 at 2. Cooke enlisted in order to give back to the United States, develop his career skills, and carry on his family's tradition of service in the military and law enforcement. ECF No. 25 \u00b6 9. Upon enlisting, Cooke was also informed that he would be eligible for an expedited naturalization process through the military.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Two weeks later, Cooke entered into an employment contract with the Air Force for an auto mechanic position, with a scheduled ship-out date of November 15, 2017.

Lawful Permanent Residents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In order to become LPRs, Kuang and Cooke had to undergo an application and screening process. As part of this process, LPR applicants must provide detailed information regarding their background (such as employment history and prior addresses), provide fingerprints, photos, and a signature, as well as participate in an in-person interview.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs. (Apr. 11, 2018), https://www.uscis.gov/i-485;\n   <em>\n    Green Card\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Servs. (Feb. 22, 2018), https://www.uscis.gov/greencard;\n   <em>\n    Fact Sheet: Immigration Security Checks-How and Why the Process Works\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Dep't of Homeland Security (Apr. 25, 2006), https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/pressrelease/security_checks_42506.pdf at 1-2 [hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    Fact Sheet\n   </em>\n   \"].\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") conducts an interagency background check for every applicants, as well as FBI fingerprint and name checks for many of those applicants, which reveal foreign criminal history.\n   <em>\n    See Fact Sheet\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   LPR applicants may be denied for a multitude of reasons, including criminal history and security risk grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Military Enlistment and Accession Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Kuang and Cooke are far from the only LPRs to enlist in the U.S. military. Approximately 5,000 LPRs do so every year. ECF No. 22-1 at 4. The process by which LPRs are enlisted and shipped into active military service (\"accession\") is governed by various statutory, regulatory, and DoD policy requirements. Because these requirements are at the heart of this dispute, the Court reviews them in some detail here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, Congress has enacted certain statutory requirements governing who may enlist in the military.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"No person who is insane, intoxicated, or a deserter from an armed force, or who has been convicted of a felony, may be enlisted\n   in any armed force,\" except that the relevant Secretary may authorize a meritorious exception for a deserter or convicted felon.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 504(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, and most relevant here, Congress has established citizenship or residency requirements for military service. In general, \"[a] person may be enlisted in any armed force only if the person is one of the following:\" (1) \"[a] national of the United States\"; (2) \"[a]n alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence\"; or (3) \"[a] person described in [the Department of Defense State Partnership Program,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]\" of compacts between the United States and the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 504(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Congress also provided for individualized exceptions to these citizenship requirements. Section 504(b)(2) permits the relevant Secretary to authorize the enlistment of someone who does not fall into any of the categories of section 504(b)(1), if the Secretary determines that the \"person possesses a critical skill or expertise - (A) that is vital to the national interest; and (B) that the person will use in the primary daily duties of that person as a member of the armed forces.\" Recruits enlisted under section 504(b)(2) are subject to additional procedures prior to entering active service, however. A person enlisted under section 504(b)(2) may not \"report to initial training until after the Secretary concerned has completed all required background investigations and security and suitability screening as determined by the Secretary of Defense regarding that person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   These applications were processed pursuant to the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (\"MAVNI\") pilot program.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kirwa v.

In turn, the manual provides that \"[t]he NACLC, or its equivalent, is the minimum investigation required for entry into the Military Departments.\" ECF No. 57 at 74. Currently, the government employs a \"Tier 3\" investigation (out of a five-tier scale of intensity) as the equivalent of the NACLC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22-5 at 1-2; ECF No. 57 at 95 \u00a7 7.6(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Based on the results of this investigation, DoD renders a Military Service Suitability Determination (\"MSSD\") and National\n   Security Determination (\"NSD\").

To determine the applicant's \"national security eligibility,\" DoD uses uniform adjudicative guidelines issued by the Director of National Intelligence (\"DNI\"). ECF No. 57 at 94 \u00a7 7.4.

Smith Declaration\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    First, the Court must determine whether the record properly includes the declaration of Roger Smith, which DoD submitted in support of its opposition to this motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 42-1. Plaintiffs initially sought to strike Smith's declaration, and the Court deferred ruling on the request until production of the administrative record, ECF No. 54, so that the Court could evaluate whether the declaration was \"necessary to explain technical terms or complex subject matter,\"\n    <em>\n     Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians\n    </em>\n    , 889 F.3d at 600.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    Having reviewed the administrative record and the Smith declaration, the Court finds that it cannot consider the Smith declaration as support for DoD's decision. As an initial matter, the Smith declaration is not \"necessary to explain technical terms or complex subject matter.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    DoD argues that the declaration offers further explanation of the classified information that it has withheld from the record. ECF No. 65 at 6. As explained above, DoD has not sufficiently supported its withholding of that information or shown that the proper course is to provide a post-hoc summary rather than providing the underlying information itself, in its entirety, with tailored redactions\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n    or for\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    review. Moreover, purportedly explanatory extra-record evidence cannot supply the basis for the Court \"to determine the correctness or wisdom of the agency's decision.\"\n    <em>\n     Asarco\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1392093\" index=\"456\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/616/1153/#p1160\">\n     616 F.2d at 1160\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    Even were the Court to accept the post-hoc Smith declaration as a substitute for a complete administrative record, the current record does not contain, even in summary form, any corresponding information with which to anchor the Smith declaration's \"additional\" explanation. The \"Most Significant Findings\" of the 2017 Study, as presented in the record, relate to information-sharing between different agency components and whether certain procedures are used. ECF No. 57 at 144-45. Regarding the key question in this motion - whether there is a rational connection between the evidence before DOD and its conclusion that LPRs as a class must complete all investigations and screening prior to accessing - the record contains only DoD's unadorned conclusion that \"current policy is insufficient to mitigate risk\" posed by LPRs.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 157. That single sentence does not permit DoD to bootstrap by vague assertion, in effectively unrebuttable form, that LPRs provide a greater classwide risk and that \"particular LPR enlistees have posed a grave threat to national security.\" ECF No. 42-1 at 7-8. Either there is no evidence to support the assertion or DoD has intentionally chosen not to provide it. Either way, the existing record gives the Court no assurance that the Smith declaration is \"explanatory in nature, rather than a new rationalization of the agency's decision.\"\n    <em>\n     Kunaknana v.

So, even if the Court accepted DoD's invitation to create a fifth exception for extra-record evidence that explains classified information,\n    <em>\n     cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians\n    </em>\n    , 889 F.3d at 600, it would not aid DoD here, because the record gives no contemporaneous indication that this type of evidence was considered by the decisionmaker,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kunaknana\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"613455\" index=\"458\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/742/1145/#p1149\">\n     742 F.2d at 1149\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (claim that extra-record evidence is explanatory \"must be sustained by the record\").

As relevant here, the 2017 Study concluded that the government was not doing certain things that rendered its background investigations of LPRs ineffective. First, because LPRs are never eligible to receive classified information,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 57 at 89 \u00a7 6.1, the DOD Consolidated Adjudication Facility did \"not review or adjudicate Tier 3 investigations,\" instead issuing \"a No Determination Made.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 144. Accordingly, this created a risk that \"derogatory information discovered in the investigation\" would not be \"acted upon accordingly.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Second, DOD's \"central biometric repository for terrorist data from a range of combatant commands and military services\" was \"not being systematically queried as part of the fingerprint check being conducted for military accessions.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \"[R]elying only on name-based [counterterrorism] checks,\" impaired \"DoD's ability to positively identify terrorists and other national security threats.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 144-45. Finally, DoD did not have access to LPRs' green card or visa applications.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 145. Likewise, DHS was not provided access to derogatory information identified by DoD.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    <footnotemark>\n     26\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    Even considering the Study's bare conclusions, none of these findings rationally support the October 13 Memo's policy change. Because nothing in the administrative record suggests that these information-sharing defects were\n    <em>\n     caused\n    </em>\n    by permitting LPRs to ship to basic training prior to the completion of background checks, there is no rational basis to believe that preventing LPRs from shipping to basic training will\n    <em>\n     fix\n    </em>\n    these problems.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Santillan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8924629\" index=\"472\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/388/1065/#p1078\">\n     388 F.Supp.2d at 1079\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nor does the record indicate that DoD could not fix those problems without requiring\n    completed investigations prior to LPRs shipping to basic training. For instance, the record does not state, and DoD does not now argue, that the timing change enacted by the October 13 Memo in any way impacted its ability to systematically query its biometric database or share information with DHS.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 57 at 144-45.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-241\">\n    DoD argues that its decision is supported by the finding that it was not adjudicating Tier 3 investigations for LPRs or acting on derogatory information that could have been revealed. ECF No. 65 at 2. That suggests, logically enough, that DoD should in fact adjudicate those investigations for LPRs and act on derogatory information.

DoD's post-hoc explanation of these factors is that, like MAVNI recruits, LPRs have more extensive relationships with foreign countries than do U.S. citizens. ECF No. 65 at 2-3. But DoD has given no reason to think that this was not the case during the prior policy.

But the precise policy change at issue is that DoD began to treat LPRs as presumptive security risks, while presuming that U.S citizens did not pose such a risk. If there was no evidence that LPRs posed a greater security risk, this policy change is by definition arbitrary and capricious.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Organized Vill. of Kake\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288600\" index=\"479\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/956/#p966\">\n     795 F.3d at 969\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    In sum, DoD has simply provided no evidence to support a rational connection between the facts and its choice, nor any indication that \"the process by which it reache[d] that result [was] logical and rational.\"\n    <em>\n     Michigan\n    </em>\n    , 135 S.Ct. at 2706 (citation omitted).

Plaintiffs' inability to begin basic training until after their complete investigations plainly delays this process.

ECF No. 42 at 54. The country's national security is obviously of the utmost importance, and the Court will give due deference to that consideration, when present, as it analyzes the balance of harms. Before it can do so, however, there must be evidence that the concern actually\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    present. Defendants have not given the Court anything from which it could reach that threshold conclusion. Simply put, \"[a] bare invocation of 'national defense' simply cannot defeat every motion for preliminary injunction that touches on the military.\"\n    <em>\n     Doe 1\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418268\" index=\"493\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/167/#p216\">\n     275 F.Supp.3d at 217\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-258\">\n    By contrast, there is substantial, uncontradicted evidence before the Court - including evidence from the military itself - that the policy set forth in the October 13 Memo actually impairs the military's recruitment goals and undermines military readiness.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 57 at 157 (Under Secretary Kurta's statement that the policy \"will impact the ability of some Military Service components to make recruiting mission in FY 2018\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 23 \u00b6\u00b6 19-24 (former Secretary of Army's declaration that policy impacts military objectives). Former Secretary of the Army Eric K. Fanning opines without rebuttal that \"the recently announced policy change is causing significant harm to both LPRs serving in the military and the efficacy of the military itself,\" ECF No. 23 \u00b6 17, and \"will likely dissuade many qualified LPRs from enlisting in the military due to the lengthy delays in accession and uncertainty surrounding shipment dates,\" making it difficult for the military to meet its recruiting goals,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 22.

Kuang and Cooke, and likely many other LPR class members as well, enlisted prior to the October 13 Memo, only to face an entirely different policy after enlistment.
