(\"Nanjing Byton\") from making, using, offering to sell, or selling within the United States, or importing into the United States, vehicles employing the accused functionality, ECF No. 47 at 2; and (2) Defendant Byton's motion to dismiss Thunder Power's patent infringement claims for U.S. Patent Nos. 9,547,373 (\"the '373 patent\") ; 9,563,329 (\"the '329 patent\") ; and 9,561,724 (\"the '724 patent\"), as directed toward patent-ineligible subject matter. ECF No. 37. The Court will grant the motion to dismiss and deny the preliminary injunction motion as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Both Thunder Power and Byton are foreign companies focused on developing and manufacturing electric vehicles; Thunder Power is based in Hong Kong, and Byton N.A. designs and develops electric vehicles under the direction of Defendant Nanjing Byton New Energy Vehicle Technology Development Co., Ltd., which is based in mainland China. ECF No. 35 (\"first amended complaint\" or \"FAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7, 8; ECF No. 20-1 \u00b6 3. Thunder Power alleges that several concept cars imported and advertised by Byton N.A. include operating and display systems that infringe its patents: specifically, Byton's \"Gesture\n   Control\" system ( '373 patent) and \"Shared Experience Display\" system ( '329 patent and '724 patent ).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-9, 39, 44, 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Generally, the '373 patent claims a vehicle operating system that captures and processes gesture signals from both a driver and a passenger, prioritizing signals from the driver where the two conflict. FAC \u00b6 20. The '724 patent claims an in-vehicle display system that shows two information panels on an LCD screen, switches the position of the panels in response to a user signal, then switches them back after a set period of time (\"switch-back feature\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. The '329 patent claims a similar display system, without specifying an LCD screen, which duplicates the first information panel at a third position on the dashboard in response to a user instruction (\"screen-duplication feature\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Byton N.A. now moves to dismiss all three of the patents at issue as abstract and therefore ineligible. ECF No. 37. Thunder Power opposes the motion. ECF No. 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court finds these assertions unconvincing. As Byton argues,\n   <em>\n    Interval Licensing\n   </em>\n   is instructive here.

Accordingly, Claim 1 of the '329 patent is ineligible for patent protection, for the same reasons outlined as to the '724 patent. The Court GRANTS Byton's motion to dismiss Count 2 of the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Byton N.A.'s motion to dismiss is GRANTED. Although the Court doubts whether the deficiencies in Thunder Power's complaint can be cured,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Papst Licensing GmbH\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12135574\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/193/1069/#p1090\">\n    193 F.Supp.3d at 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Federal Circuit has made clear that any doubt should be resolved in favor of permitting amendment.\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515907\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1121/#p1125\">\n    882 F.3d at 1126-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, dismissal is with leave to amend. Byton may amend its complaint within 21 days of the issuance of this order solely for the purpose of curing the deficiencies identified in this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Thunder Power's preliminary injunction motion is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court sets a further case management conference on January 9, 2019 at 2:00 p.m. An updated joint case management statement is due by January 2, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    As to each of the three patents-in-suit, Thunder Power's FAC asserts only that Byton has infringed \"at least Claim 1.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 39, 44, 49. However, in its opposition to the motion to dismiss, Thunder Power alleges that \"a number of dependent claims make material additions to the inventive concept found in each of the challenged independent claims.\" ECF No. 44 at 24. A district court may determine that addressing each claim of an asserted patent is unnecessary, if a claim is representative of the others because all the claims are \"substantially similar and linked to the same abstract idea.\"\n    <em>\n     Content Extraction &amp; Transmission LLC v.
