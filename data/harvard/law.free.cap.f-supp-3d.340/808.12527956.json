INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This patent case is before me on: (1) a motion (Doc. No. 90) for summary judgment on invalidity filed by defendant C &amp; B Manufacturing, Inc. (HitchDoc), (2) a motion (Doc. No. 92) for summary judgment as to HitchDoc's affirmative defenses, filed by plaintiff Meridian Manufacturing Inc. (Meridian) and (3) a motion (Doc. No. 88) for summary judgment to limit damages filed by HitchDoc. Meridian filed resistances (Doc. Nos. 101, 107) to both of HitchDoc's motions and HitchDoc filed replies (Doc. Nos. 108, 109). HitchDoc filed a resistance (Doc. No. 99) to Meridian's motion for summary judgment but Meridian did not file a reply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Meridian holds United States Patent No. 6,964,551 B1 ('551 Patent), which involves component claims for an agricultural trailer. In its complaint (Doc. No. 2), Meridian alleges that HitchDoc is a competitor that makes agricultural equipment, including trailers that infringe on the '551 Patent. On June 9, 2017, after conducting a\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   hearing, I filed an order (Doc. No. 52) in which I construed certain claims contained in the '551 patent (the\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   order). The parties then filed motions (Doc. Nos. 55, 56) for summary judgment on infringement. On October 27, 2017, I entered an order (Doc. No. 75) granting Meridian's motion for summary judgment and finding, as a matter of law, that HitchDoc's trailer infringes on claims 1, 2, 3, 9, 10 and 11 of the '551 Patent. The parties then filed the present motions addressing invalidity and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Trial is scheduled to begin on November 5, 2018. The motions are fully briefed and ready for decision. I find that oral argument is not necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. RELEVANT FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are undisputed, except where noted otherwise:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The '551 Patent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The '551 Patent, entitled \"Trailer for Transporting Bulk Seed Boxes,\" is an invention designed to help farmers transport large seed bags or boxes to planters in the fields. The following embodiment is depicted in Figure 1:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Meridian filed its complaint of patent infringement on November 23, 2015. Of the 19 claims contained in the '551 patent, Meridian alleged that HitchDoc's product, the Travis Seed Cart, infringes claims 1, 2, 3, 9, 10 and 11. These claims are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. An improved trailer for transporting a bulk seed box, the box having first and second sidewalls, a bottom, a top, and a flange extending along the sidewalls adjacent the bottom of the box, the trailer comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   a wheeled bed for supporting a bulk seed box, the bed having a perimeter edge;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   a hopper extending below the bed for receiving seed from the bulk seed box;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   a conveyor operatively connected to the hopper for unloading seed from the hopper; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   the bed having guide plates inclining upwardly and outwardly from the perimeter edge of the bed to facilitate centering of the box on the bed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2. The improved trailer of claim 1 wherein the bed has four corners and the guide plates are located at the corners of the bed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   3. The improved trailer of claim 1 further comprising lock bars on the bed to overlappingly engage the flange of the seed box to secure the seed box to the bed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   9. The improved trailer of claim 1 wherein the conveyor is an auger including a first inner section and a second outer section pivotally attached to the first section for movement between transport and discharge positions, and including a gas cylinder to facilitate movement of the second section between the transport and discharge positions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   10. The improved trailer of claim 1 wherein each guide plate extends outwardly at an obtuse angle from the bed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   11. The improved trailer of claim 1 wherein the guide plates define an enlarged box entrance sloping downwardly and inwardly toward the bed so that the box will automatically center on the bed when loaded onto the bed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Doc. No. 31 at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Claim 1 is the only independent claim at issue. The bulk of the parties' arguments focus on the guide plates \"inclining upwardly and outwardly from the perimeter edge of the bed.\" An example of a Meridian guide plate is circled in Figure 2:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. History of the '551 Patent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Garry Friesen, the inventor of the '551 Patent, has no engineering degree and had never observed a seed tender before he worked on the project that resulted in the '551 Patent. He believed there was an issue with loading and positioning seed boxes on a seed cart. Friesen initially used perpendicular guide plates and straps to secure the boxes. To improve the design, he decided to provide a bigger target for the forklift operator to hit and allow the seed box to slide into position. He then switched to plates that extend upwardly and outwardly from the bed of the cart and exchanged the straps for lock bars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Friesen filed his application for the '551 Patent on December 12, 2001. At that time, Claim 1 described the guide plates as \"extending upwardly and outwardly to facilitate centering the box on the bed.\" Doc. No. 107-1 at 4. The patent examiner rejected the application because of Patent No. 6,092,974 (the Roth Patent). The Roth Patent had guide plates around the perimeter extending straight upwardly, as depicted in Figure 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To overcome the Roth patent, Friesen amended Claim 1 to state, in relevant part, that the guide plates incline upwardly and outwardly from the bed. The patent examiner rejected this second attempt because of the Roth patent and Patent No. 1,675,701 (the Fitch patent). The Fitch Patent is depicted in Figure 4:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   While difficult to see in this depiction, the interior surfaces of the plates incline upwardly and outwardly from the bed. The Fitch patent is not directed toward an agriculture-specific device, but to trucks used to transport general containers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Friesen then amended Claim 1 to its present form, stating the guide plates inclined \"upwardly and outwardly\n   <em>\n    from the perimeter edge of the bed.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) The patent examiner rejected Friesen's application for a third time. On appeal, however, the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (the Board) overturned the examiner's rejection, noting that the Fitch brackets had inclined walls that were within the perimeter edge of the bed. The '551 Patent issued on November 15, 2005. Meridian is the current owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Infringement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In late 2001 or early 2002, before the '551 Patent issued, Friesen began selling his seed tenders with the patented features and showing them at farm shows under the \"Seed Titan\" name. Wyman Travis, creator of the Travis Seed Cart now sold by HitchDoc, often attended the same farm shows. He designed the Travis Seed Cart in late 2004 or early 2005. The guide plates of the Travis Seed Cart are depicted in Figure 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   HitchDoc acquired the right to sell the Travis Seed Cart in 2009. HitchDoc has known about the '551 Patent since at least July 1, 2011, when it submitted the '551 Patent to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as part of an information disclosure statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Between November 20, 2005, and September 24, 2008, Meridian purchased 1,000 patent decals for its tenders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Between 2005 and 2009, Meridian sold 2,283 box seed tenders. The parties dispute how many of the tenders sold had patent decals. On September 17, 2015, Meridian gave HitchDoc actual notice of infringement by sending HitchDoc a cease and desist letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   HitchDoc continued selling the Travis Seed Cart after receiving the cease and desist letter and did not seek counsel's opinion regarding infringement of the '551 Patent before Meridian filed its complaint. At no time has Meridian affirmatively consented to HitchDoc's infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Meridian filed its complaint for patent infringement on November 23, 2015. At the\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   stage, I found that \"perimeter edge of the bed\" meant the planar boundary around the bed, rather than the physical point where the side and top surfaces of the bed intersect. With that understanding, I found that HitchDoc's seed tenders literally infringed on Claim 1 (and by extension claims 2, 9, 10 and 11) of the '551 Patent. Doc. No. 75 at 16. I also found that Claim 3, which describes lock bars that \"overlappingly engage the flange of the seed box,\" was infringed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. After my ruling that the Travis Seed Cart infringed the '551 patent, HitchDoc started a redesign of its seed cart.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Additional facts will be discussed below as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Any party may move for summary judgment regarding all or any part\n   of the claims asserted in a case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

No. 107-2 at 3 \u00b6 14. Friesen testified that the guide plates were placed in a way to give the forklift more space for the boxes and to maximize the support from the legs of the seed tender. Doc. No. 107-3 at 92. Meridian also cites the patent itself and Hamilton's expert opinions. Doc. No. 107-2 at 2 \u00b6 13. The '551 Patent states that an objective of the invention is to \"facilitate loading of the box on the bed.\" Doc. No. 91-19 at 7. Hamilton's report states that Friesen was attempting to \"develop a means of placing a box containing seed onto a cart in as effective manner as possible while minimizing the risk of damaging the boxes.\" Doc. No. 107-3 at 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   HitchDoc cites the Fitch patent and the '551 Patent. Doc. No. 91-1 at 21. HitchDoc also refers to Heise's expert report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-32, 34, 37, 39-48 (cited as Morehead Aff. Ex. Q). Heise's report states that the problem is placing a box or container safely, efficiently and accurately on an elevated surface, meaning that the scope of prior art should include art from non-agricultural industries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   HitchDoc argues that the '551 Patent states that the problem it solves is centering and maintaining containers on a vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. The language of the patent, however, discusses only flat trailer beds and a \"trailer for bulk seed boxes.\" Doc. No. 31-19 at 7. This language could support either Meridian's or HitchDoc's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   As noted above, the parties dispute whether Fitch is prior art. HitchDoc argues that Meridian must concede Fitch is prior art because it relied on Fitch in arguing the interpretation of claim 1. Doc. No. 91-1 at 21, 29. HitchDoc does not cite any law for this argument. Meridian argues that the prosecution history is not determinative because prior art was never part of the discussion. Doc. No. 107 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   HitchDoc is correct that Meridian relied on the Fitch patent in arguing for summary judgment on the issue of infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 57 at 13-14. In addition, during the prosecution history, the patent examiner identified Fitch as being prior art. Doc. No. 91-10 at 7-8. Fitch deals with positioning a container on a freight truck and uses four brackets to center the freight containers. Doc. No. 91-15 at 55. Nothing indicates that the Fitch invention is specific to the field of agriculture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   I relied on Fitch to help define \"perimeter edge,\" as that term is used in the '551 Patent. Doc. No. 75 at 13-14. I noted that the patent examiner identified that it would have been obvious for a person of ordinary skill in the art to modify Fitch to create the invention described in the '551 Patent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. However, I find that the patent examiner's conclusion that Fitch is prior art is not determinative. Nor, as noted above, has HitchDoc provided legal support for the argument that Fitch must be considered prior art because Meridian relied on it when arguing that infringement occurred. Because the scope of the prior art is a factual question for the jury,\n   I will not undertake to determine that scope as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5.

I will also not separately address the dependent claims because if there is a question of fact on the scope of prior art on claim 1, there is a question of scope of prior art for the other claims as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     6.

Therefore, there is no evidence of a motivation to combine the Roth and Fitch patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.

Doc. No. 91-9 at 3. HitchDoc contends that the Board applied the TSM test too rigidly when it disagreed with the patent examiner and stated the determination of design expediency was not supported by any evidence. Doc. No. 91-14 at 10. However, the Board clearly stated that evidence could come from the prior art references, knowledge of someone of ordinary skill or from the nature of the problem.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board characterized the sources of evidence as \"broad\" but indicated some evidence was still required.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This seems to be in line with\n   <em>\n    KSR\n   </em>\n   's mandate of applying the TSM test flexibly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   HitchDoc relies on Friesen's deposition testimony, along with Heise's opinion that it would have been obvious to combine elements of certain pieces of prior art. Doc. No. 91-21 at 20. Meridian relies on Friesen's testimony as well, arguing that the design of the guide plates was \"not an expedient choice\" because there were other ways Friesen could achieve his goals. Doc. No. 107 at 22. Meridian also relies on Hamilton's opinion that the guide plate extension was not a design expediency but, instead, \"an intentional part of the problem solving\" that resulted in \"a lower cost and less labor intensive manufacturing process.\" Doc. No. 107-3 at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The parties disagree on the definition of \"design expediency.\" Meridian argues it is the \"convenient, though perhaps not optimal, design choice\" but does not cite any sources. Doc. No. 107 at 22. HitchDoc appears to use the \"design need\" definition as used in\n   <em>\n    KSR.\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 91-1 at 23. The dictionary definition of \"expediency\" is \"the quality of being suited to the end in view.\" Merriam-Webster Dictionary https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/expediency. I find \"design expediency\" for purposes of an obviousness analysis is more in line with the \"design need,\" so the fact that the choice to extend the guide plates was not necessarily the most convenient or the only option does not prohibit a finding of obviousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   However, there remains a question of fact as to whether a person of ordinary skill would be motivated to combine features of prior art. First, as stated above, the jury must make factual findings concerning the scope and content of the prior art. Second, the parties have presented conflicting expert testimony as to whether a design need and common sense would prompt the combination of certain features taught by the prior art.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   For all of the reasons set forth above, HitchDoc's motion for summary judgment as to the validity of the '551 Patent will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.
