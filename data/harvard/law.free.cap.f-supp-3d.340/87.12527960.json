The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Project Veritas\n   </em>\n   makes a similar, though broader, argument: that Section 99 violates the First Amendment insofar as it prohibits the secret audio recording of\n   <em>\n    government officials\n   </em>\n   performing their duties in public. The parties in each case also clash over certain ancillary issues that are discussed in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the core constitutional issue, the Court holds that secret audio recording of government officials, including law enforcement officials, performing their duties in public is protected by the First Amendment, subject only to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. Because Section 99 fails intermediate scrutiny when applied to such conduct, it is unconstitutional in those circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following facts, drawn from the summary judgment record in each case, are not subject to genuine dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Martin v. Gross\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiffs K. Eric Martin and Ren\u00e9 P\u00e9rez are two private citizens who live in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. The defendants are Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley and City of Boston Police Commissioner William Gross.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Plaintiffs' Secret Recordings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Since 2011, Martin has openly recorded police officers performing their duties in public at least 26 times; P\u00e9rez has done so 18 times, often live-streaming his recordings. The plaintiffs' recordings of police have included one-on-one interactions, traffic and pedestrian stops of others, and protests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Between the two of them, the plaintiffs have wanted to secretly record police officers performing their duties in public on at least 19 occasions since 2011, but have refrained from doing so. Both have stated that their desire to record secretly stems from a fear that doing so openly will endanger their safety and provoke hostility from officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiffs have not advanced any specific plans or intentions to surreptitiously record police officers in the course of this litigation. But P\u00e9rez stated that he would not rule out secretly recording police officers in various sensitive situations and that he intended to live-stream any secret recordings he is permitted to make. Neither Martin nor P\u00e9rez has ever been arrested for violating Section 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Enforcement of Section 99\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Since 2011, the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office (\"SCDAO\") has opened at least 11 case files that involve a felony charge under Section 99. These have included Section 99 charges where the person\n   recorded was a police officer performing her duties in public. During the same period, the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\") has applied for a criminal complaint on a Section 99 violation against at least nine individuals for secretly recording police officers performing their duties in public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When asked what governmental interest Section 99 advances, the district attorney asserted that it protects individuals' privacy rights -- specifically, the right of citizens and public officials alike to be on notice of when they are being recorded. Asked the same question, the police commissioner referred generally to Section 99, its legislative history, and judicial decisions interpreting the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Police Training on Section 99\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 99 is one of several topics on which BPD officers receive training. The methods of training include training bulletins, training videos, and in-service training. In all, BPD recruits receive 50 to 60 hours of criminal law instruction at the police academy. The instructor teaches from his own textbook, which touches on many, but not all, crimes under Massachusetts law. The text includes a segment on Section 99 -- one of over 150 sections discussing various criminal law topics. BPD officers are also instructed using at least two other criminal law manuals that similarly include segments on Section 99 among 150 to 200 other criminal laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Furthermore, BPD has created a training video and a training bulletin related to Section 99. Since 2009, BPD has published 28 training videos; one of them related to Section 99. In recent years, BPD has disseminated 22 training bulletins. One of them is related to Section 99, and it has been circulated three times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The video tells officers that Section 99 prohibits only\n   <em>\n    secret\n   </em>\n   recording. It depicts two scenarios of citizens recording police -- one openly and one in secret -- and instructs officers that the first is not a violation of Section 99, but the second is. The video became mandatory viewing for current officers. New recruits watch it as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The bulletin describes two court cases where defendants were convicted for secretly recording police officers performing their duties in public, instructing officers that they have a \"right of arrest\" whenever they have probable cause to believe an individual has secretly recorded a conversation. It was first circulated in November 2010, then again in October 2011, and most recently in May 2015. The 2011 and 2015 circulations are the only bulletins since 2011 that have required police commanders to read the bulletin aloud to their officers at roll call. A memo accompanying the 2011 recirculation explicitly references the First Circuit decision in\n   <em>\n    Glik v. Cunniffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828414\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/78/\">\n    655 F.3d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2011), discussed in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs' claim, brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleged that Section 99 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments as applied to the secret recording of police officers engaged in their duties in public places. Resolving a motion to dismiss, the Court held that the plaintiffs had adequately stated a claim that Section 99 violates the First Amendment. The Court also rejected a challenge to the plaintiffs' standing, held that the complaint adequately stated a claim for municipal\n   liability, and held that\n   <em>\n    Pullman\n   </em>\n   abstention was unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The defendants now challenge the claim on the grounds of standing, ripeness, and municipal liability. The district attorney also asks the Court to draw adverse inferences against Martin. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the constitutional claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Project Veritas Action Fund v. Conley\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The plaintiff, Project Veritas Action Fund (\"PVA\"), is a nonprofit organization that engages in undercover journalism. The defendant is the Suffolk County District Attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. PVA's Secret Recording Practices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   PVA has a history of investigating government officials, candidates for public office, and others through the use of secret recording. The organization also investigates suspected fraud, abuse, and corruption. PVA would like to secretly record government officials in Massachusetts, including when they make statements in public places while performing their public duties. PVA has refrained from doing so due to Section 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In general, PVA decides to investigate a story based on considerations like cost, time, level of public interest or newsworthiness, and the likelihood that it will obtain \"candid information\" from sufficiently high-level individuals. Once an investigation is assigned to a PVA reporter, he or she develops a \"cover story\" designed to develop trust with the source. The \"cover story\" is \"rarely\" true, but PVA enhances its verisimilitude by, for instance, creating fake email or social media accounts, printing false business cards, or creating a new business entity. Often the \"cover story\" involves volunteering or interning at a target organization, or donating to it. In other cases, PVA reporters use flattery, sex appeal, or romantic overtures to appeal to target sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   PVA reporters use \"sophisticated\" recording equipment, including hidden necktie cameras, purse cameras, eyeglass cameras, and cameras whose lenses are small enough to fit into a button or rhinestone. They have made recordings during campaign staff meetings, within a target's offices, and while meeting with representatives of a target organization. They have also recorded pretextual \"dates\" with target individuals and conversations at bars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   PVA's ultimate product is an edited \"video report\" that is released to the public via its website and/or YouTube channel. The final report leaves out portions of the raw footage. The record includes several examples of PVA's final reports and the raw footage used to create them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In this case, PVA identifies four specific projects that it has refrained from conducting on account of Section 99. The projects involve secretly recording: (1) landlords renting unsafe apartments to college students; (2) government officials, including police officers, legislators, or members of the Massachusetts Office for Refugees and Immigrants, to ascertain their positions on \"sanctuary cities\"; (3) \"protest management\" activities by both government officials and private individuals related to Antifa protests; and (4) interactions with Harvard University officials to research its endowment and use of federal funds. PVA would like to send its journalists into Massachusetts to develop leads on these and other stories that may emerge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   PVA's original complaint challenged the constitutionality of Section 99 facially and as applied to it, targeting the statute's\n   prohibition on secret recording in a public place (Count I) and secret recording of oral communications of individuals having no reasonable expectation of privacy (Count II). In March 2017, the Court dismissed PVA's claims insofar as they challenged the application of Section 99 to the secret recording of private conversations, and insofar as they presented facial and overbreadth challenges to Section 99.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Project Veritas Action Fund\n   </em>\n   , 244 F.Supp.3d at 264-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Having preserved its appellate rights as to those rulings, PVA has filed an amended complaint and has narrowed its claim to challenge only Section 99's application to the secret recording of government officials engaged in their duties in public spaces. The district attorney has moved to dismiss on ripeness grounds. Both parties seek summary judgment on the constitutional claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Summary Judgment Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A party is entitled to summary judgment when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The commissioner's line of argument is essentially identical to the one that the Court addressed, and rejected, in its prior opinion in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , 241 F.Supp.3d at 281-83.

Under\n   <em>\n    Vives\n   </em>\n   , the existence of a municipal \"policy\" depends on \"(1) whether the City had a meaningful choice as to whether it would enforce [the statute in question]; and (2) if so, whether the City adopted a discrete policy to enforce [the statute in question] that represented a conscious choice by a municipal policymaker.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822494\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/346/\">\n    524 F.3d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The roughly seven-minute video begins with a summary of the statute. It then reenacts two scenarios. In the first, a bystander holds up a cell phone and records police officers interacting with a couple arguing in the street. The video instructs that this does not constitute an \"interception\" under Section 99 because the bystander is openly, not secretly, recording the interaction. The second scenario parallels the facts of\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Hyde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080026\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/594/\">\n    434 Mass. 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=750%20N.E.2d%20963\">\n    750 N.E.2d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), in which the SJC affirmed the Section 99 conviction of a defendant who surreptitiously recorded his conversation with police during a traffic stop. The video instructs officers that charges are appropriate in this scenario, although it emphasizes that, in order to violate Section 99, the recording \"Must be SECRET!\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The bulletin, issued in November 2010, provides Section 99's definitions of \"interception\" and \"oral communication,\" and breaks down the crime into elements. It also summarizes\n   <em>\n    Hyde\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Manzelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3498478\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/68/691/\">\n    68 Mass.App.Ct. 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=864%20N.E.2d%20566\">\n    864 N.E.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007), two Massachusetts appellate cases interpreting Section 99. The bulletin describes Section 99 as \"designed to prohibit secret recordings of oral communications.\" It twice states, \"Public and open recordings are allowed under the Wiretap statute. There is no right of arrest for public and open recordings under this statute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The bulletin has been recirculated twice. In October 2011, the bulletin was accompanied by a memo from the Commissioner citing the\n   <em>\n    Glik\n   </em>\n   decision. The memo instructs officers that \"public and open recording\n   of police officers by a civilian is not a violation\" of Section 99. The cover memo for the May 2015 recirculation \"remind[s] all officers that civilians have a First Amendment right to publicly and openly record officers while in the course of their duties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Section 99 is discussed in other training materials as well. For instance, the Municipal Police Training Committee, a state agency that sets minimum training standards for police academies in Massachusetts, discusses Section 99 in at least two training manuals used by the BPD. The record includes four additional manuals or texts that appear to discuss the statute as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   These materials -- particularly the video and bulletin -- demonstrate why\n   <em>\n    Surplus Store\n   </em>\n   is inapt here. They instruct officers that Section 99 permits open, but not secret, recording of police officers' actions. But\n   <em>\n    Glik\n   </em>\n   did not clearly restrict itself to\n   <em>\n    open\n   </em>\n   recording. Rather, it held that the First Amendment provides a \"right to film government officials or matters of public interest in public space.\"\n   <em>\n    Glik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828414\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/78/\">\n    655 F.3d at 84-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The right is \"fundamental and virtually self-evident,\" subject only to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828414\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/78/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The BPD training materials narrowly read this holding, which amounts to more than mere enforcement of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The same considerations demonstrate the existence of a policy under the two-prong\n   <em>\n    Vives\n   </em>\n   test. The parties do not dispute the first prong. That is, they seem to agree -- correctly -- that local police have discretion about whether and when to enforce Section 99. The second prong asks whether BPD has adopted a \"discrete policy\" to enforce Section 99 that \"represent[s] a conscious choice by a municipal policymaker.\"\n   <em>\n    Vives\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822494\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/346/\">\n    524 F.3d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The police commissioner does not dispute that these training materials exist and have been disseminated to BPD personnel. Because there is no genuine dispute as to this factual basis for the alleged municipal policy, the only remaining question is one of law, appropriate for resolution on summary judgment: Do these training materials evince a \"conscious choice\" by BPD to enforce Section 99 ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The answer is yes. Although an individual police officer retains discretion about whether to arrest someone for violating Section 99, the training materials cited above make clear that BPD \"put flesh on the bones\" of Section 99 and \"apparently instructed officers that they could make arrests\" for what the plaintiffs now claim was constitutionally protected conduct.\n   <em>\n    Vives\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822494\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/346/\">\n    524 F.3d at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The video, bulletin, and manuals all speak with one voice regarding when Section 99 is and is not violated. The Court concludes, as a matter of law, that this evidence demonstrates a \"conscious choice\" and amounts to a municipal policy for purposes of a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The police commissioner protests that BPD's guidance was in accordance with, and pursuant to, cases interpreting Section 99, and it is unfair to subject BPD to liability for trying to ensure that its officers comply with the law. He also argues that finding a municipal policy here will create \"a perverse incentive not to train police officers.\" But the training materials go beyond telling officers when it is impermissible to arrest; taking a narrow construction of\n   <em>\n    Glik\n   </em>\n   , they also communicate that it is permissible to arrest for secretly audiorecording the police under all circumstances.

The motion concerns two sets of videos produced in discovery: one from the Boston Common and one from the Arizona BBQ restaurant in Roxbury. The district attorney argues that he is prejudiced by Martin's assertion of the privilege because it prevents him from learning details about these videos, such as whether Martin created them, whether the recorder was holding the recording device in plain view, and whether the recorder had the subjects' permission to record. As a consequence, the district attorney asks the Court to make certain inferences about the videos -- for instance, that Martin did create them, that the recording device was not held in plain view, and that Martin did not have permission to record from persons in the videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Martin opposes the motion only in two respects. First, he seeks to ensure that none of the adverse inferences can be used in any criminal proceeding. Second, he opposes one specific inference -- that the Arizona BBQ restaurant is a \"public place\" for purposes of the plaintiffs' requested relief on their constitutional claim. He argues that this inference is outside the scope of his assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In general, \" 'the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties in civil actions when they refuse to testify,' ... nor does it\n   <em>\n    mandate\n   </em>\n   such inferences, especially as regards topics unrelated to the issues they refused to testify about.\"\n   <em>\n    Mulero-Rodriguez v.

The hardship prong is not disputed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In the context of a First Amendment challenge like this one, Supreme Court and First Circuit precedent describes two types of cognizable injury. The first is when the plaintiff has alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by the statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Mangual v.

Both plaintiffs have attested to their prior recordings of police officers. The plaintiffs aver that they desire to secretly record police officers but have refrained from doing so because of Section 99. And the defendants have sought criminal complaints or charged persons for violating Section 99 numerous times since 2011.

Therefore, both the jurisdictional and prudential components of fitness are satisfied. That is, the plaintiffs have shown \"a sufficiently live case or controversy ... to create jurisdiction in the federal courts,\" while also satisfying the Court that resolution of the case need not (indeed, ought not) be postponed.\n   <em>\n    Reddy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176648\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/493/#p500\">\n    845 F.3d at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Roman Catholic Bishop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068016\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/78/#p89\">\n    724 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   89 ).

Further, according to PVA,\n   <em>\n    Glik\n   </em>\n   extends to secret recording, and therefore Section 99 chills them from engaging in protected conduct.
