Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Judith Zack required surgery by a specialist to repair a serious and recurring hiatal hernia. The specialist surgeon she needed did not participate in her husband's, Dr. Paul Zack's, health insurance plan, which was offered by McLaren Heath Advantage, Inc. The plan paid full benefits for \"in-plan\" doctors but only 60% of a \"reasonable and customary amount\" for \"out-of-plan\" doctors. The plan itself\n   does not say what \"reasonable and customary amount\" means or how it would be calculated. When the Zacks submitted their bill for $27,986.00, they received an explanation of benefits notice indicating they would be reimbursed for $726.79. After trying to appeal this determination of benefits and failing, the Zacks (Plaintiffs) brought this lawsuit against McLaren (Defendant) under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) of the Employment Retirement Security Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) (\"ERISA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties have filed cross motions for judgment on the administrative record. As set forth below, the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion, denies Defendant's motion, and remands the case to the Plan Administrator for full and fair consideration of Plaintiffs' claim for reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 8, 2016, Plaintiff Judith Zack underwent laparoscopic surgery to correct a hiatal hernia. Dkt. 16 at Pg ID 534-35. Her husband, Plaintiff Paul Zack, is currently employed as a physician at McLaren Medical Group.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 531. Both Plaintiffs were participants in the McLaren Health Advantage Plan on March 8, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dr. Constantine Frantzides performed the procedure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 535. At the time of Plaintiff's surgery, Dr. Frantzides was a professor of surgery at the University of Chicago and Chairman of the Department of Surgery at Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 275 (AR, D-000008). Dr. Frantzides is a leading expert on the type of procedure Judith Zack required.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He was one of the first surgeons in the United States to perform laparoscopic surgery, and he conducted the very first \"prospective, randomized trial of laparoscopic mesh repair of large hiatal hernias\" in the world.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Frantzides also had specific experience with re-do laparoscopic hernia repair-important because Plaintiff had already undergone surgery to repair this hernia in 1999.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 276 (AR, D-000009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Frantzides does not participate in the McLaren Health Advantage insurance plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For Out-of-Plan providers, Defendant reimburses participants 60% of the \"Reasonable and Customary\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   fee for the specific procedure performed. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 422 (AR, D-000155). Dr. Frantzides billed Plaintiff a total of $27,986.00 for two billing codes-the aforementioned laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair and an accompanying esophagus dilation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff submitted her benefits claim to Defendant after the procedure. In this claim, Plaintiff submitted the billing codes for the procedures as determined by Dr. Frantzides: 43450 and 43282 with modifier 22. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 297 (AR, D-000030).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To determine the reimbursement amount of Plaintiff's claim, the Plan Administrator first concluded that Dr. Frantzides, who performed the surgery, is not within the McLaren Health Advantage network (i.e., he is an \"Out-of-Plan provider\"), Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 298 (AR, D-000031), and thus plaintiff was responsible for the \"difference between what the [Out-of-Plan provider] charges for the service and [the Plan's] allowable amount,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   known as balance-billing\n   ,\" under the terms of her Plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 283 (AR, D-000016). Under Plaintiff's Plan and the accompanying McLaren Claims Department Procedure Manual, all claims submitted to Defendant by an Out-of-Plan provider are sent to a third-party, Zelis, which attempts to negotiate the invoice amount with the provider and then advises Defendant on what amount was ultimately charged to a Plan member. Dkt. 15 at Pg ID 463.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 18, 2016, Defendant notified Plaintiffs that the Reasonable and Customary reimbursement rate determined for procedure codes 43282 and 43450 were $1,451.40 and $96.01 respectively. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 298 (AR, D-000031). Defendant subtracted Plaintiffs' deductible and co-insurance from this amount to come to the final amount of reimbursement, $726.79.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Neither the May 18 letter nor the text of the Plan explained what method Defendant used to calculate the Reasonable and Customary amount. In Defendant's cross motion for judgment on the administrative record filed before this Court, Defendant offered the following explanation: the Plan \"simply applied the reasonable and customary charges set forth in its Fee Schedule for Billing Codes 43282 and 43450\" to determine the reimbursable amount of Plaintiff's claim. Dkt. 15 at Pg ID 476. The relevant \"Fee Schedule\" was not attached to Defendant's motion and no such schedule can be found in the administrative record. Defendant further explained in its cross-motion: \"the reimbursement amount is a median of what McLaren pays its In-Plan providers for that kind of service,\" Dkt. 15 at Pg ID 463. This indicates that the allowable fee is determined by calculating an\n   <em>\n    average\n   </em>\n   derived from various fees charged by In-Plan providers for the same kind of surgery. No schedule of such in-Plan fees, or other kind of information conveying how the reasonable and customary amount is determined, was ever produced in this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Likewise, there is nothing in the record that shows whether Defendant, in determining the reasonable and customary amount, ever considered the \"modifier 22\" Dr. Frantzides applied to the billing code 43282. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 309 (AR, D-000042). Healthcare providers use modifier 22 as an appendix to the procedure's billing code to denote that the procedure was more difficult or complicated than usual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Medicare Claims Processing Manual, 20.4.6 Payment Due to Unusual Circumstances (Modifiers \"-22 and \"-52\") (May 31, 2018)\n   <em>\n    https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/clm104c12.pdf\n   </em>\n   . Defendant thus reimbursed Plaintiffs at 60% of the Reasonable and Customary amount it had determined less Plaintiffs' deductible. The total amount of benefits paid was $726.79.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 298 (AR, D-000031).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs appealed the claim decision to the McLaren Appeals Committee. Specifically, Plaintiffs challenged Defendant's determination of the Reasonable and Customary amount on two grounds: (1) that it was objectively too low given the provider's charge;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) that Defendant had not applied modifier 22 to the billing code for the procedure when determining the appropriate reimbursement amount. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 275 (AR, D-000008). Defendant denied Plaintiffs' appeal, upholding\n   the Plan Administrator's initial determination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 279 (AR, D-000012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff then filed this action on April 21, 2017, renewing the two arguments above and adding a claim that Defendant had violated the terms of ERISA by failing to provide Plaintiffs with a copy of the fee schedule used to determine the Reasonable and Customary amount for the procedures she had. Dkt. 2 at Pg ID 6. Plaintiffs amended their Complaint on June 8, 2017 to properly name Defendant, McLaren Health Advantage Inc. Dkt. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 16, 2017, Defendant contacted Plaintiffs' counsel and requested that Plaintiffs voluntarily dismiss their claim. Dkt. 15 at Pg ID 455. When Plaintiffs refused, Defendant filed its Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record asking that the Court affirm the administrative decision below by denying Plaintiffs' appeal for Plan benefits and dismissing Plaintiffs' Complaint with prejudice. Dkt. 15 at Pg ID 465. Plaintiffs filed their own Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record on November 11, 2017. Dkt. 16. Courts do not use summary judgment procedures for deciding benefit claim denials; rather, parties can file cross motions for judgment on the administrative record as they have done here.\n   <em>\n    Wilkins\n   </em>\n   , 150 F.3d at 618 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

In addition to pointing out problems with how the values in the database were determined, the court found these errors to be \"compounded by the fact that [the Plan] did not provide [Plaintiff] access to this source\" and that Spectrum was thereby prevented from challenging the Plan's decision to reject the charges because it had no \"access to the data with which these charges were compared.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendant's errors were so fundamental that the court in\n   <em>\n    Spectrum\n   </em>\n   simply awarded the entire disputed benefits amount to the Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In this case, Plaintiffs never requested Defendant's fee schedule or an explanation to the method for calculating reasonable and customary fees prior to filing their claim-or at least, no such request is reflected in the record.

Dkt. 16 at Pg ID 538. That claim is substantially different from the claims in the cases cited above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In response, Defendant repeatedly states that Plaintiffs had access to the Plan's distinctions between In-Plan and Out-of-Plan providers and that the reason given for the denial of Plaintiffs' claim was procedurally adequate: that Dr. Frantzides is an Out-of-Plan provider. But Plaintiffs do not dispute that Dr. Frantzides was an Out-of-Plan provider or that choosing such a provider decreases the percentage of the provider's fee that is reimbursed. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 294 (AR, D-00027). Plaintiffs have always acknowledged Dr. Frantzides was Out-of-Plan-their dispute is over\n   <em>\n    the method of calculation of the reasonable and customary fee\n   </em>\n   upon which Defendant based its reimbursement decision. The central question is therefore whether ERISA and its accompanying regulations require full disclosure of pricing methodology absent a request from the insured.

Indeed, while Defendant finds fault with Plaintiffs for failing to \"explain\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   they believe that [the Reasonable and Customary] determination was incorrect...\" Dkt. 15 at Pg ID 481 (emphasis in original), this should be no surprise because Defendant did not tell them\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the Reasonable and Customary amount was calculated in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   This conclusion finds support in governing regulation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(5)(i) requires disclosure of any \"internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion [that] was relied upon in making the adverse determination.\" Here, Defendant clearly relied upon an internal criterion for determining how much of the Out-of-Plan fees would be covered in making the adverse determination, but did not disclose that criterion to Plaintiffs.

Dkt. 17 at Pg ID 601 (\"The Plan expressly provides for reimbursement of out-of-network services at rates that are lower than in-net-work services.\"). Again, there is no dispute that the Plan covers in-network surgery at 100%, while only covering out-of-network procedures at 60% of the \"reasonable and customary rate.\" Dkt. 11 at Page ID 422 (AR, D-000155).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The section of the Plan called \"Benefits in Brief\" contains a summary table describing the \"out-of-plan\" surgery benefits as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   To an ordinary person looking at the table setting out the Plan's benefits, it is clear that in-plan surgery is covered at 100% while out-of-network surgery will be reimbursed at 60% of the Reasonable and Customary amount. The term \"Reasonable and Customary\" is undefined. What is certainly not clear is that the coverage rate for out-of-network providers is calculated by taking 60% of\n   <em>\n    the median amount Defendant has negotiated to pay in-network providers\n   </em>\n   . Defendant's protestations that imposing a market rate standard would \"ignor[e] Plan terms,\" Dkt. 17 at Pg ID 603 are unavailing because the Plan\n   <em>\n    has no terms\n   </em>\n   defining Reasonable and Customary amount. Plaintiffs do not seek reimbursement of the entire out-of-network charges, nor are they requesting a higher\n   <em>\n    rate\n   </em>\n   of reimbursement-that is, they are not asking for 70% of the Reasonable and Customary amount as opposed to the 60% the Plan allows. Rather, Plaintiffs contend that the Plan's failure to disclose the base amount from which the reimbursement rate is calculated requires the application of a rate that a reasonable person would expect based on the plain meaning of the term, rather than based on the in-Plan negotiated rate. Defendant's arguments against the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Geddes\n   </em>\n   are inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   It is also worth noting that a reasonable person viewing the Plan's benefit levels would see that for both \"In Plan\" and certain \"Out of Plan\" providers who are part of the McLaren larger network, the reimbursement levels are set at 100% (for In-Plan) and at 60%-after deductible is met-(for certain Out-of-Plan) providers. For these two columns, though it is not expressly stated, the percentage of coverage clearly refers to the amount the provider charges. For Out-of-Plan providers who are not part of any McLaren network there is a final column. That column says that the 60% covered refers to a \"reasonable and customary amount,\" not to the amount that is actually charged. An ordinary person reading this table would be unlikely to assume that \"reasonable and customary amount\" would be derived from the rates for in-Plan providers (which are covered at 100% and in a different column), but would be more likely to understand that it must be derived from a distinct and independent source that was being used to estimate reasonable\n   and customary amounts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Under the facts of this case, where the Plan failed to provide a definition of Reasonable and Customary and where no explanation of the meaning of this term was provided during the benefit or appeal process, the Court finds that the Plan's denial of benefits based on its undisclosed interpretation of this term was arbitrary and capricious. On remand, the plain reading of the term \"reasonable and customary amount\" should be used in providing a full and fair consideration of the claim, using a definition that is based on the prevailing market rate generally charged for the service in the relevant geographic area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's failure to consider modifier 22\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The record is also clear that Plaintiffs submitted a claim to Defendant for billing code 48232 with modifier 22. Dkt. 11 at Pg ID 297 (AR, D-000030).

Dkt. 15 at Pg ID 463.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    At some points, the Plan uses the term \"allowable amount\" to describe the amount of benefits paid for out of plan doctors; at other points the Plan uses the term Reasonable and Customary amount.

The appeal decision states only that Dr. Frantzides is an Out-of-Plan provider and therefore that Plaintiffs would be reimbursed at Out-of-Plan rates (60% of the reasonable and customary fee).
