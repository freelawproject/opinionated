He completed the sixth grade, and has worked as a kitchen helper, laborer in a dairy, and janitor (Tr. 26, 349). The claimant alleges that he has been unable to work since March 21, 2012, due to depression, anxiety, heart disease, colon problems, learning disability, and illiteracy (Tr. 348).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 14, 2012, the claimant applied for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20401\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 434, and on September 27, 2012, he applied for supplemental security income benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201381\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 85. His applications were denied. ALJ John W. Belcher conducted an administrative hearing and determined that the claimant was not disabled in a written opinion dated December 22, 2015 (Tr. 11-28). The Appeals Council denied review, so the ALJ's opinion is the final decision of the Commissioner for purposes of this appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.981\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416.1481.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Decision of the Administrative Law Judge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The ALJ made his decision at step five of the sequential evaluation. He found that the claimant had the residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to perform light work,\n   <em>\n    i. e.\n   </em>\n   , he could lift/carry twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently, stand/walk six hours in an eight-hour workday, and sit for six hours in an eight-hour workday, but only occasionally climb, balance, bend, stoop, kneel, crouch, or crawl. Additionally, he determined that the claimant could perform simple and routine tasks, and have superficial contact with co-workers, supervisors, and the public, where \"superficial\" was defined as \"contact similar to that which a grocery clerk might have with those groups\" (Tr. 19). The ALJ then concluded that although the claimant could not return to his past relevant work, he was nevertheless not disabled because there was work he could perform in the national economy,\n   <em>\n    e. g.\n   </em>\n   , production inspector, press machine operator, and bench assembler (Tr. 25-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The claimant contends that the ALJ erred by: (i) failing to properly assess his mental impairments based on the state reviewing physician opinion in the record, and (ii) improperly considering and rejecting the opinion of a consultative examiner. The Court agrees with the claimant's first contention, and the decision of the Commissioner must therefore be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ALJ found that the claimant had the severe impairments of ischemic heart disease, right knee osteophytes, hypertension, obesity, depression, anxiety and PTSD, a learning disability, and borderline intellectual functioning (Tr. 14). The relevant medical records as to the claimant's mental impairments are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 14, 2012, Dr. Denise LaGrand conducted a mental status/diagnostic examination, and estimated that the claimant had borderline intellectual functioning, which was consistent with his education and job history (Tr. 521-524). She assessed him with major depressive disorder, polysubstance abuse /dependence, and tobacco use disorder (Tr. 524).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 11, 2012, state reviewing physician Laura Lochner, Ph.D., completed a review of the claimant's evidence to that point, and found that the claimant's mental impairments consisted of affective disorders and substance addiction disorders, and that he was moderately impaired in the three functional categories of activities of daily living, maintaining social functioning,\n   and maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace (Tr. 94). Dr. Lochner also completed a Mental RFC Assessment and found in the area referred to as \"Section I\" that the claimant was markedly limited in the typical three categories of ability to understand and remember detailed instructions, to carry out detailed instructions, and to interact appropriately with the general public, and that he was moderately limited in the ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods (Tr. 97-98). In the written comments section (\"Section III\"), Dr. Lochner wrote that the claimant could perform simple tasks with routine supervision, could relate to supervisors and peers on a superficial work basis, and could adapt to a work situation, but could not relate to the general public (Tr. 98).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 20, 2014, nearly two years later, Dr. Brian Snider conducted a mental status examination of the claimant (Tr. 541-545). Among other things, the claimant appeared to have a limited fund of knowledge and impaired judgment, and Dr. Snider estimated the claimant's intellectual ability in the extremely low to borderline range (Tr. 543). He assessed the claimant with major depressive disorder, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder in sustained remission (Tr. 545). Additionally, Dr. Snider completed a mental RFC assessment, in which he indicated that the claimant had extreme limitations in the ability to interact appropriately with supervisors and co-workers; marked limitations in the ability to interact appropriately with the public, understand and remember complex instructions, carry out complex instructions, and make judgments on complex work-related decisions; and had moderate limitations in the ability to respond appropriately to usual work situations and to changes in a routine work setting (Tr. 538-539). He cited the claimant's intellectual deficit and poor judgment, as well as irritability, history of conflict on the job, and anxiety around others, in support of his assessment (Tr. 538-539).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the administrative hearing, the ALJ elicited testimony from a VE to determine if there were jobs a hypothetical person could perform with the following limitations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ... limited to lifting no more than 20 pounds occasionally, 10 pounds frequently, with pushing and pulling consistent with lifting and carrying limitations. He could stand or walk for six hours in an eight hour day, sit for six to eight hours in an eight hour day. He could climb, balance, bend, or stoop, kneel, crouch, or crawl on an occasional basis. He could simple tasks, simple and routine tasks. He should have superficial contact with coworkers, supervisors, and the public, and by superficial I mean contact similar to that that a grocery clerk might have with others, groups like that - coworkers, supervisors, and the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Tr. 62). The VE identified that the claimant could perform the jobs of production inspector, DICOT \u00a7 712.684-050; light press machine operator, DICOT \u00a7 690.685-326; and bench assembler, DICOT \u00a7 780.684-062 (Tr. 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his written opinion, the ALJ summarized the claimant's hearing testimony and the medical evidence in the record. Based on the evidence in the record regarding the claimant's cognitive and intellectual functioning, the ALJ found that the claimant's ability to perform more than simple tasks was limited (Tr. 22). In the next sentence, however, he stated that the claimant's learning disability and borderline intellectual functioning were not as severe as alleged because he had a good understanding of most questions, had an adequate fund of knowledge, and exhibited the ability to read and follow simple instructions (Tr. 22). As to his depression, anxiety, and PTSD, the ALJ found that\n   they limited the claimant's ability to perform complex tasks and to get along with others, including co-workers and supervisors (Tr. 22). He then stated in the immediately-following sentence that these impairments were not consistently severe because: (i) he had no problems with personal care, (ii) he prepared simple meals on a daily basis, (iii) he had no difficulty concentrating during a Social Security interview, (iv) he exhibited the ability to perform simple math, and (v) at times had denied anxiety and depression (Tr. 22-23). As to Dr. Snider, he afforded the opinion \"some weight\" because Dr. Snider only examined the claimant once, and his assessment regarding interacting with others was inconsistent with the evidence, but his assessment with regard to instructions and decisions was consistent with the evidence (Tr. 23-23). The ALJ likewise afforded \"some weight\" to Dr. Lochner's reviewing opinion, finding the opinion generally consistent with the record regarding impaired concentration and memory, but that the inability to relate to the general public was inconsistent with the record (Tr. 24). The ALJ determined the claimant's RFC as set forth above, then adopted the VE's testimony that he could perform the jobs of production inspector, light press machine operator, and bench assembler (Tr. 19, 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The claimant argues that the ALJ failed to properly assess Dr. Lochner's opinion, despite giving it some weight. Specifically, he contends that the ALJ failed to account for Dr. Lochner's Section I finding that the claimant was markedly limited in his ability to understand, remember, and carry out detailed instructions, which means that he could not usefully perform or sustain such activities, because her Section III RFC failed to account for this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Social Security Ruling 96-6p instructs that the ALJ \"must consider and evaluate any assessment of the individual's RFC by a State agency medical or psychological consultant and by other program physicians and psychologists.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20374180\">\n    1996 WL 374180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (July 2, 1996). These opinions are to be treated as medical opinions from non-examining sources.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.

Here, although the ALJ found the claimant could perform simple and routine tasks, and only have superficial contact with co-workers, supervisors, and the public, he did not account for Dr. Lochner's findings related to the claimant's ability to perform detailed work (Tr. 24-25).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hardman v.

For the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that the decision of the Commissioner should be reversed and the case remanded to the ALJ for proper analysis of the medical opinions of record.

Accordingly, the decision of the Commissioner is hereby REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Step one requires the claimant to establish that he is not engaged in substantial gainful activity. Step two requires the claimant to establish that he has a medically severe impairment (or combination of impairments) that significantly limits his ability to do basic work activities. If the claimant\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    engaged in substantial gainful activity, or his impairment\n    <em>\n     is not\n    </em>\n    medically severe, disability benefits are denied. If he\n    <em>\n     does\n    </em>\n    have a medically severe impairment, it is measured at step three against the listed impairments in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, App. 1. If the claimant has a listed (or \"medically equivalent\") impairment, he is regarded as disabled and awarded benefits without further inquiry. Otherwise, the evaluation proceeds to step four, where the claimant must show that he lacks the residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to return to his past relevant work. At step five, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to show there is significant work in the national economy that the claimant\n    <em>\n     can\n    </em>\n    perform, given his age, education, work experience, and RFC. Disability benefits are denied if the claimant can return to any of his past relevant work or if his RFC does not preclude alternative work.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Williams v.
