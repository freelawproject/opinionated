HERRERA, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant's Opposed Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction [ECF. No. 26] brought under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(2). For 70 years the State of New Mexico prosecuted crimes occurring on the Maxwell Housing area of Kirtland Airforce Base in Albuquerque. On March 13, 2018, however, the New Mexico Legislature allegedly ceded state jurisdiction over Base property to the United States, giving the federal government the right to prosecute crimes on that property. Five days later, on March 18, 2018, Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated on the Base. Under the United\n   States Constitution, if a state cedes jurisdiction over federal property in the state, the United States has exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute offenses committed on that federal property. But because federal jurisdiction over state held land implicates federal-state relations, jurisdiction must be ceded following the state's cession statutes, and the federal government must give notice that it is accepting jurisdiction. If these steps are not followed - and Defendant contends that they were not - the federal government does not obtain jurisdiction over such lands. In the critical five-day period between the alleged cession and her arrest, Defendant argues the United States had not taken jurisdiction and thus her crimes are not prosecutable in federal court. After careful consideration of the motion, briefs, evidence, and relevant, the Court finds that the motion should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 3, 2018 the Department of the Air Force sent New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez a Letter of Request to acquire legislative jurisdiction over three parcels of land - (1) Maxwell Housing, (2) Pershing Housing/Commissary/Gibson Gate, and (3) New Mexico National Guard - on the Base that were under state criminal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Susana Martinez, Gov. of New Mexico, to Members of the Legislature 1 (Feb. 5, 2018) (Martinez Letter), ECF No. 30-1; Affidavit of Lauren A. Shure \u00b6 4, ECF No. 28-1 (Shure Aff.). The last jurisdictional cessation of Base land to the federal government occurred 54 years ago.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 15. Governor Martinez transmitted a February 5, 2018 letter to New Mexico legislators, explaining that she supported the federal government's \"intent[ion] to clarify jurisdictional issues dating back to the early 1940s\" and that she recommended that the legislature cede jurisdiction of the requested parcels to the federal government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martinez Letter at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 14, 2018, state legislators adopted the governor's recommendation, ceding to the United States \"exclusive legislative jurisdiction\" over the three parcels identified in the Air Force's Letter of Request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.M. H.R.J. Res. 13, 53rd Leg., 2d Sess. (Joint Resolution). The Joint Resolution gave the federal government broad power \"to legislate with respect to such land and persons present or residing on it, subject only to the United States and state constitutional restraints.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Joint Resolution said that it was \"in reference to the notice received by the legislature from the governor\" -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   Governor Martinez's February 5, 2018 letter to legislators in which she recommended ceding jurisdiction to the federal government. Pursuant to New Mexico's cession statute, which prescribes the manner in which jurisdiction is transferred,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.M.S.A. \u00a7 19-2-2, the governor's office recorded the Joint Resolution in the Bernalillo County Clerk's Office on March 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Five days later, in the early morning hours of March 18, 2018, Defendant got off work from Circle K, met some friends for drinks, and then drove home to the Maxwell Housing area, which is the name of the military-civilian family housing neighborhood on the Base.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 2; Crim. Compl. 1, ECF. No. 2. As she approached Maxwell Gate - the manned control point that regulates traffic into and out of the Maxwell Housing area - Defendant rode her brakes, drove extremely slowly, nearly hit three bollards, and had bloodshot eyes and slurred speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crim. Compl. \u00b6 5. Airmen manning the gate breathalyzed Defendant twice, returning blood alcohol content results of .15 and .12, levels unlawful under New Mexico's driving while intoxicated statutes.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Relying on the federal Assimilative Crimes Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ACA),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which borrows, or \"assimilates,\" state criminal law to \"federal enclaves,\" federal prosecutors by Information charged Defendant on March 20, 2018 with two misdemeanor counts under New Mexico's driving while intoxicated statutes, N.M.S.A. 1978 \u00a7 66-8-102(A) (Count 1) and \u00a7 66-9-102(C)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Information, ECF No. 9. The United States superseded the Information on April 4, 2018, maintaining the same two counts but adding an increased state law penalty provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseded Information, ECF No. 14. The Superseded Information alleged that Defendant drove while intoxicated \"within ... the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 16, 2018 Defendant moved to dismiss the Information under Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2), asserting that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Defendant submitted to the Court documents showing four instances of state cession of jurisdiction of Base land to the federal government occurring between 1952 and 1964.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Exs. D, E; Mot. at 13-15. Defendant's analysis of the Public Land Survey System\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   tended to show that none of these four jurisdictional transfers included the Maxwell Gate where Defendant was arrested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 16-21. Defendant therefore argued that for the case to be prosecutable in federal court the United States had to \"come forward with evidence of [ ] a fully executed transfer from the State of New Mexico to the federal government, subsequent to the four cessions [ ], that encompasses Maxwell Gate,\" and that the federal government had to show that it filed a \"notice of acceptance\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203112\">\n    40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which is the federal statute prescribing how the federal government accepts state offered jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The United States responded by submitting to the Court official government maps, an affidavit from an Air Force Judge Advocate, and the New Mexico Legislature's Joint Resolution to prove that the federal government acquired \"exclusive/federal legislative jurisdiction on\" March 13, 2018 and that the state had no criminal jurisdiction over the Base after that date. Shure Aff. \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Govt.'s Exs. 1-3. As for the federal government's acceptance of the jurisdiction, the United States argued that the Joint Resolution's language that it was passed \"in reference to the notice received by the legislature from the governor,\" was evidence of the federal government's acceptance of the jurisdiction. Govt.'s Resp. 4, ECF. No. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In her reply brief, Defendant argued that the United States was confusing things - the \"notice\" mentioned in the Joint Resolution was referring to Governor Martinez's February 5 letter to the legislature in which she recommended granting jurisdiction; it was not a \u00a7 3112 notice of acceptance the Air Force had to file to receive the offered jurisdiction. In supplemental briefing, Defendant submitted evidence showing that the United States never filed a \u00a7 3112 notice of acceptance for Base property with the state governor's\n   office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Notice of Supplemental Authority, ECF No. 32; Exs. B, C, ECF Nos. 32-2, 32-3. The United States filed no supplemental briefing countering this evidence. Section 3112 acceptance aside, Defendant additionally argued that the state and federal governments did not comply with New Mexico's cession statute in the first place. Specifically, Defendant contended that New Mexico's cession procedures required the governor to record the Department of the Air Force's January 3, 2018 letter, and that the governor's office never did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In sum, Defendant's principal challenges are that the state did not properly cede criminal jurisdiction because of the defective recording, and that the United States did not accept the jurisdiction because it did not file a \u00a7 3112 notice of acceptance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Specifically, if the United States acquires an interest in state property, it does not automatically acquire jurisdiction over it.

Here, the record shows that the governor's office recorded the Joint Resolution in the Bernalillo County Clerk's Office, and thus complied with that requirement of the cession statute. However, as Defendant correctly notes, \"while the joint resolution regarding the cession has been recorded ... it does not appear that the Air Force's notice of intention ever was, and the state cession statute explicitly predicates cession on the recordation of both documents.\" Def.'s Notice of Supplemental Authority 1. Defendant repeatedly highlighted this deficiency in her reply brief and supplemental briefing. Yet the United States failed to respond to it. Thus, there is neither evidence nor any contention from the United States that the federal government's notice of intention was recorded. Nor did the United States explain whether \u00a7 19-2-2(C) permits any exceptions or whether the doctrine of \"substantial compliance\" applies to that provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4249989\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/149/92/\">\n    2010-NMCA-108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4249989\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/149/92/\">\n    149 N.M. 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4249989\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/149/92/\">\n    244 P.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (doctrine of substantial compliance recognizes that sometimes \"a party's actions satisfy the will of the Legislature despite that party's clear failure to comply with a statute's mandatory language.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The United States bears the burden of quieting any doubts about the Court's subject matter jurisdiction, and it has not done so here. It has not shown that New Mexico's cession statute was complied with such that the federal government acquired criminal jurisdiction over Maxwell Gate at the time of Defendant's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Whether the Federal Government Accepted the Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant contends that the federal government did not accept the offered jurisdiction because it did not file a \u00a7 3112 notice of acceptance. And indeed, the United States submitted no evidence that it filed any such notice. However, much like the defendant in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's case in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , Defendant \"ignores that \u00a7 [3112] sets out\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   distinct ways for the federal government to accept jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516585\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/980/#p984\">\n    994 F.2d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). Namely, the federal government can accept ceded jurisdiction by formal \u00a7 3112 acceptance \"or in another manner prescribed by the laws of the State where the land is situated.\" \u00a7 3112(b). This second method of acceptance \"authorizes the United States to accept jurisdiction by complying with state law requirements governing succession. The act of compliance with those requirements is tantamount to formal acceptance.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516585\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/980/#p984\">\n    994 F.2d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals, interpreting New York's cession statutes, held that the federal government satisfied the acceptance requirement when a federal official formally requested cession and enclosed the necessary documents as required by New York's cession statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516585\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/980/#p984\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516585\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/980/#p984\">\n    at 985-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, the federal government did not file a \u00a7 3112 notice of acceptance. But it had the alternative option of accepting jurisdiction by complying with New Mexico's\n   cession statute. It appears from the record that the United States complied with that statute in every way it could. However, as described above, the Air Force's notice of intention was not recorded. Had that notice been recorded under \u00a7 19-2-2(C), then the federal government could have accepted the jurisdictional transfer by complying with New Mexico cession statute without the need to file a \u00a7 3112 notice. However, because the United States has not carried its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to show that the recording requirements of \u00a7 19-2-2(C) were complied with, the Court grants Defendant's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Opposed Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction\n   <strong>\n    [ECF.
