The Plaintiff alleged gender, race and national origin-based employment discrimination and retaliation, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" \u00a7 1981\"), and New York Executive Law \u00a7 296 (\"NYSHRL\"). In her opposition brief, Amaya asserted causes of action arising under the New York City Human Rights Law (\"NYCHRL\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 14, 2018, the Court granted the Defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\" FED.

Specifically, the Court dismissed the Plaintiff's causes of action that stemmed from Title VII and precluded the Plaintiff from advancing a wrongful termination, retaliatory discharge or constructive discharge theory pursuant to \u00a7 1981 or the NYSHRL. The Plaintiff's attempt to assert NYCHRL claims through her motion papers was also denied. Amaya was allowed to proceed with a hostile work environment theory pursuant to NYSHRL and \u00a7 1981 as well as a retaliatory workplace theory pursuant to \u00a7 1981 and the NYSHRL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 20, 2018, the Court issued an order (the \"April Order\") which (1) dismissed Janine Wheaton from the case; (2) amended the caption to correct a name misspelling; (3) directed the Plaintiff to file her Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") on or before April 24, 2018; and (4) ordered the Defendants to answer or otherwise respond to the Second Amended Complaint on or before June 15, 2018. The April Order also noted that the parties agreed that the Plaintiff's SAC would (1) strike sections that were dismissed by the MTD Order; (2) add causes of action under the NYCHRL; and (3) add factual allegations only insofar as they were relevant to the issue of whether she was an employee covered by the NYCHRL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Plaintiff filed her proposed SAC on April 24, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Presently before the Court is a motion by the Defendants, pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6) and 12(f), seeking to partially dismiss the SAC and to strike certain factual allegations in the SAC.
