Miceli has been employed with NY Paving since 1991 and serves as Director of Operations. Miceli Decl. \u00b6 1.

Enclosure of a notice in a pay envelope, however, is not always ideal because it may suggest either that the notice originates with the employer or that filling it out may actually be required or expected by the employer. Accordingly, the request is denied at this time. The Court would consider a request to require that a separate envelope be delivered to the collective action members, either with a pay envelope or at another time, as long as the envelope containing the notice is clearly marked as emanating from a non-employer source. Any such envelope should be in lieu of, not in addition to, an original or reminder mailing.
