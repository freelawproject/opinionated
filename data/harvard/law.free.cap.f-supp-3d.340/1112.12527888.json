The Court held a hearing on the Motion and the Motion to Strike on June 21, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether the Court should reconsider its determination in the Memorandum Opinion and Order,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525358\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/1164/\">\n    312 F.Supp.3d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (Doc. 55)(\" MOO\"), that Defendant United States Department of Health and Human Services' (\"HHS\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   risk adjustment\n   formula is arbitrary and capricious, because, HHS contends, it had no obligation to explain its decision to operate the program in a budget-neutral manner, it never stated budget neutrality was compelled by statute, and its decision not to use any budget authority to operate the program was unreviewable; (ii) whether the Court should reconsider its decision to vacate HHS' risk adjustment formula and instead remand without vacatur because, as HHS contends, the Court has equitable discretion to remand without vacatur or to limit the vacatur to New Mexico; (iii) whether the Court may consider the remarks in the Declaration of Jeffrey Wu (executed March 3, 2018), filed March 28, 2018 (Doc. 57-1)(\"Wu Decl.\"), because, as Plaintiff New Mexico Health Connections (\"Health Connections\") contends, it is improper evidence under rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Administrative Procedure Act; and (iv) whether the Court should grant America's Health Insurance Plans (\"AHIP\") and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (\"Blue Cross\") leave to file a joint statement as amici curiae, because, as Health Connections contends, the request is untimely, irrelevant, and moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   While the Court carefully reconsiders its MOO, the Court stands by both its determination that HHS' risk adjustment formula is arbitrary and capricious, and that vacating the formula and remanding to HHS for further consideration is the appropriate remedy. The Court also concludes that it is appropriate to consider recent developments and the consequences of its decision in this case and, thus, may consider the remarks in the Wu Decl. and the statement that AHIP and Blue Cross wish to file as amici curiae. Accordingly, the Court denies the Motion and the Motion to Strike, and grants the Motion for Leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Congress enacted The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub.

Several state insurance commissioners have expressed concern about the risk adjustment program. For example, Maryland's Insurance Commissioner testified to Congress:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Over the past few years, new innovative health insurance plans have been created that are providing enhanced competition and patient care. And it is working. For year-end 2014, CareFirst had a 91% market share of the individual market in Maryland. Today, it is 57%, due in part to a more competitive marketplace. These carriers have the potential to continue but their ability to do so is severely jeopardized by the adverse and perhaps fatal financial impact caused by the technical shortcoming of the current risk adjustment and risk corridor programs....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The risk adjustment formula is of concern to state regulators because it has proven to place newer carriers at a distinct disadvantage. For example, the risk adjustment formula quantifies an enrollee's health status based on age, sex and diagnoses recorded during the course of the year. New carriers have very limited information on the health status or previous claims history of the applicants. Therefore, the carrier's population may appear healthier than it actually is if some diagnoses are not captured which may result in improper risk adjustment payments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Written Testimony for: Mr. Al Redmer, Jr., Commissioner, Maryland Insurance Administration (NMHC001331). The New York Superintendent of Financial Services had similar concerns:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   DFS [ (New York State Department of Financial Services) ] is concerned that the risk adjustment program has created inappropriately disparate impacts among health insurance issuers in New York and unintended consequences.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Specifically, it is DFS's understanding that, based on the data accumulated by [Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") ] for the upcoming report on June 30, 2016, new and smaller issuers generally are considered to have had relatively healthy members than their larger and more established competitors. CMS's anticipated determination appears to be unduly impacted by the dates of diagnoses or recording of diagnoses of members' medical conditions rather than actual relative health of the members. This disparity may be because the new and smaller health insurers have not been in operation long enough to have amassed the long term data and records management systems that have helped to allow the large, established health insurers to convince CMS that their members are relatively unhealthy and, concomitantly, will allow\n   them to receive large payments from the risk adjustment program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Letter from Maria T.

HHS gives three reasons why, in its view, reconsideration is appropriate. First, HHS argues that, \"under black-letter principles of administrative law, HHS was not required to explain -- and NMHC was largely foreclosed from challenging -- HHS's budget-neutral approach to the risk adjustment program, because at no point during the 2014-2017 rulemakings did NMHC or any other commenter challenge or question that approach.\" Motion at 2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 11 (\"Furthermore, when NMHC did finally raise the budget neutrality issue to the agency during the 2018 rulemaking (after it filed this lawsuit), it largely argued only that budget neutrality is not statutorily mandated, not that it is irrational.\"). HHS asserts that, when commenters finally objected to the budget-neutral approach during the 2018 rulemaking, it adequately addressed the objections by explaining that \"the absence of additional funding for the HHS-operated risk adjustment program\" requires budget neutrality. Motion at 2 (internal quotations and emphasis omitted)(quoting HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2018,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2094\">\n    81 Fed.

HHS avers that risk adjustment charges are the only funding source from which the agency can make risk adjustment payments, because Congress has not made a risk-adjustment-specific appropriation or permitted HHS to use its program management appropriation to fund risk adjustment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 15-16, 15 n.4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Motion at 14-15 (\"[T]he ACA neither authorized nor appropriated additional funding for risk adjustment payments beyond the amount of charges paid in, nor authorized HHS to obligate itself for risk adjustment payments in excess of charges collected.\"). It follows, according to HHS, that \"the Court clearly erred in holding that HHS's budget-neutral approach ... was a discretionary policy choice subject to notice and comment rulemaking as opposed to a straightforward application of binding appropriations law.\" Motion at 18 (citation omitted). Third, HHS contends that, \"[e]ven if HHS had the authority to design the risk adjustment program in a non-budget neutral manner, its decision not to\n   exercise that authority would be committed to agency discretion as a matter of law and thus exempted from judicial review.\" Motion at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   HHS then argues that -- if the Court stands by its determination that HHS acted arbitrarily and capriciously -- the Court should reconsider the remedy it imposed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 3-4.

Mr. Wu nowhere explains why HHS has not simply commenced a new rulemaking to address the errors found by the Court. The only conclusion is either that the agency does not consider risk adjustment important enough to act upon, in which case the cry of disruption rings hollow, or the agency cannot address the Court's critique, in which case the remedy is wholly appropriate to address a serious deficiency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   In addition, the reliance interests are overstated. The administrative record contains substantial evidence that carriers are unable to predict risk adjustment transfers and thus cannot rely upon them.... NMHC's 2018 comments pointed out that every carrier in New Mexico built into its 2017 premium the assumption that it would make a risk adjustment payment -- a mathematical impossibility under the risk adjustment formula which always has a balance of payments in and out within a state.

It follows, according to HHS, that \"the\n   <em>\n    Moda\n   </em>\n   decision concluded that Congress, in certain circumstances, can create an enforceable payment obligation absent an appropriation,\" but \"nothing in\n   <em>\n    Moda\n   </em>\n   supports Plaintiff's suggestion that\n   <em>\n    HHS\n   </em>\n   could have done so via regulation.\" Notice at 2 (emphasis in original)(citing\n   <em>\n    Moda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517202\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/1311/\">\n    892 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1320-22 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    11.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court held a hearing on June 21, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Motion Proceedings at 1 (taken June 21, 2018), filed July 3, 2018 (Doc. 77)(\"Tr.\"). At the hearing, HHS began by asserting that it is entitled to reconsideration of the judgment in the MOO under rule 59, because the judgment was \"based on misapprehensions of the parties' positions and the controlling law, and that they result in manifest injustice.\" Tr. at 5:8-14 (Powers). HHS then repeated its argument that Health Connections \"was foreclosed from challenging the budget neutrality determination for the 2014\n   to 2017 rules,\" because \"there were no comments to the agency in those rules challenging the decision to structure the program in a budget neutral fashion.\" Tr. at 6:23-7:3 (Powers). According to HHS, \"there needs to be some sort of raising of the issue before the agency out of the simple fairness to the agency to allow them to apply their expertise in the first instance, and to explain themselves further or to change their decision as the case may be.\" Tr. at 7:11-16 (Powers). HHS conceded, however, that this issue exhaustion requirement is satisfied as long as someone -- and not necessarily \"the particular party before the court\" -- raises the issue before the agency. Tr. at 7:7-11 (Powers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court then asked for Health Connections' perspective regarding HHS' argument on the issue exhaustion requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 9:22-10:2 (Court). Health Connections contended that \"the comment rule exists to give the agency an opportunity to address an issue, and exercise its expertise and its reasoned decision making and rule making.\" Tr. at 10:5-8 (Bassman). Health Connections asserted that this rationale means that, \"when an agency actually addresses an issue, and does it itself without needing a comment or product, there is no exhaustion requirement from commenters.\" Tr. at 10:9-12 (Bassman).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:22-23 (\"There is no requirement for a commenter to ask an agency to engage in analysis it already did.\"). Health Connections then averred that \"the agency action being challenged [is] the decision the agency made in setting the original formula to use the statewide average premium instead of each issuer's own premium,\" and \"[t]hat was a decision that the agency made itself and analyzed.\" Tr. at 10:13-19 (Bassman). Health Connections contended that there is no issue exhaustion issue, because HHS recognized and addressed the statewide average premium decision, so there was no need for commenters to challenge it from 2014-2016, and that, in 2017 and 2018, commenters had \"directly challenged\" the decision. Tr. at 15:12-15 (Bassman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In reply, HHS clarified that \"we don't contend there has been waiver with respect to challenging statewide average premium itself.\" Tr. at 16:8-10 (Powers).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   The argument we're making is that there is waiver as to challenging the budget neutrality determination. Now, we recognize that [Health Connections] contends that it is challenging the statewide average premium. But the Court's decision relied on the fact that there was a failure to explain the budget neutrality determination. And we believe that ... is necessarily a determination that that decision, that antecedent decision, was arbitrary and capricious, because if the budget neutrality determination was simply a parameter of the program, we believe the agency was entitled to treat that as one of the kind of factors that it would consider in deciding how to proceed. And that would be a sufficient basis to support the use of the statewide average premium.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Tr. at 16:11-25 (Powers). HHS then contended that \"the sua sponte exception\" does not apply, because \"[i]t concerns when the agency has actually addressed the particular challenge that's raised,\" which HHS asserted \"is that the program could have been nonbudget neutral because it could have been backfilled with lump sum appropriations or with resort to the Judgment Fund.\" Tr. at 17:19-22 (Powers). HHS contended that it \"did not address those points, so it has not sua sponte addressed\" the issue. Tr. at 17:22-24 (Powers). HHS then averred that when it did address the budget neutrality issue, with the 2018 rule, it did so \"sufficiently,\" in \"an application of binding appropriations principles,\" because the rule \"says that, '[i]n the absence of additional appropriations\n   the program will be operated in a budget neutral fashion.' \" Tr. at 20:4-9 (quoting 2018 Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 94,101 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Health Connections rejoined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [I]n coming up with the original 2014 rule, Your Honor's opinion does an extremely thorough analysis of what the agency said then. And what the agency said then was that it was under the belief that the Risk Adjustment Statute mandated budget neutrality, and that that was Congress' intent in the text of the statute. That was the explanation they gave. There was not an absence of explanation for why they took the position they did. It's laid out in the 2011 white paper. Defendants don't seem to be willing to defend anymore what the agency actually said in its contemporaneous reasoning. But that's the reason that was given.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   This is not a case where the agency failed to explain itself. The agency wrote a very thick white paper explaining itself, and then detailed rule making in 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Tr. at 23:3-20 (Bassman). Health Connections then noted that the justification to which HHS points for budget neutrality in the 2018 rule does not seem to be sufficient, because it raises the question whether \"the agent [is] adopting a new position and rationale,\" Tr. at 25:3 (Bassman), because \"the prior position was the statute mandated it,\" Tr. at 25:12-13 (Court). Health Connections stated: \"If it were changing its rationale, then under the Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars[, LLC v. Navarro\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597950\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2117/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597950\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2117/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) ], it was required to acknowledge that there was [a] change in position and give a reasoned explanation for the change in position.\" Tr. at 25:6-10 (Bassman). Health Connections continued by addressing HHS' argument that, \"to have a nonbudget neutral formula, even though the statute doesn't require a budget neutral formula, there needs to be some separate, new Congressional appropriations bill that says: Thou shalt spend X dollars on risk adjustment.\" Tr. at 26:20-24 (Bassman). Health Connections pointed to\n   <em>\n    Moda\n   </em>\n   as authority showing that the absence of a line-item appropriation for risk adjustment does not require risk adjustment to be budget neutral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 28:18-23 (Bassman)(\"[T]he DOJ argued to the Federal Circuit [that] the Risk Corridor Program had to be budget neutral from the get-go because there was no separate specific line item appropriations bill for it. And the Federal Circuit said that was hogwash.\"). Health Connections then asserted that the CMS' lump sum appropriation was available to fund risk adjustment payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 28:24-29:24 (Bassman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   HHS responded that budget neutrality is \"mandated by the absence of the authority or appropriations that would have permitted the agency to operate the program in a different fashion,\" not that it was \"commanded by Congress.\" Tr. at 32:6-10 (Powers). HHS then attempted to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Moda\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [In t]he\n   <em>\n    Moda\n   </em>\n   decision by the Federal Circuit, the Court held or concluded that the Risk Corridor statute sets forth a payment formula that, you know, is mandatory and does create an obligation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Now, as the plaintiff has raised, the DOJ has disagreed with that conclusion as well. But even if you take that conclusion on its face and move from there, that is something where Congress has loosened the purse strings, so to speak, rather than the agency. And under the appropriations clause of the Constitution and the Antideficiency Act, administrative agencies, executive officials, are limited in their capacity to obligate the government or to authorize spending in\n   advance of statutory authorization to do so. And so the fact that the\n   <em>\n    Moda\n   </em>\n   Court held that there could have been an obligation by product of statute is irrelevant to the question here of whether or not the agency itself could have created such an obligation of its own, you know, exercise of discretion. And I think that that really shows the distinguishing characteristics there, the dispositive distinguishing characteristics to\n   <em>\n    Moda\n   </em>\n   , and why that is largely irrelevant to the Court's consideration here of the issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Tr. at 32:15-33:13 (Powers). HHS also argued that CMS' lump sum appropriation was not available to fund risk adjustment payments, because \"those lump sum appropriations are for things like salaries, for administrative expenses of the agency.\" Tr. at 43:6-8 (Powers). Alternatively, HHS asserted that, \"even if they were available, and the Court were to conclude they're available, the agency's discretion to tap those funds for any particular program is not reviewable under the APA.\" Tr. at 43:11-15 (Powers).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 55:22-25 (Powers)(\"[W]hen it comes to the allocation of a lump sum appropriation, the agency is not obligated to explain its decision making in regard to how it will allocate that.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court then turned from the merits to the remedies issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 57:1-10 (Court). The Court began by stating that its understanding is that \"vacatur is the general rule\" when a court concludes that a regulation is arbitrary and capricious, Tr. at 57:6 (Court), and HHS agreed that the Court's understanding is correct,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 57:11-16 (Powers). The Court then asked HHS why -- in its view -- the general rule does not apply to this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 57:17-21 (Court). HHS replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   I think it comes from a weighing of the equities, of evaluating the error identified by the Court, which is a failure to explain the budget neutrality determination, and weighing the disruption that will be caused by vacatur, in light of the potential that that error can be rectified on remand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   And so I think that, you know, when one weighs those equities in that manner, the clear, you know, equitable outcome would be remand without vacatur, here the only area, as I said, is a failure to explain. And there is little doubt, in our view, that the agency can adequately resolve this and adequately explain the decision to treat the program in a budget neutral fashion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Tr. at 57:22-58:11 (Powers). The Court asked HHS for \"the strongest case that you would say that I got ... this relief issue wrong.\" Tr. at 59:20-22 (Court). HHS indicated that\n   <em>\n    WildEarth Guardians v. United States Bureau of Land Management\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275507\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/1222/#p1239\">\n    870 F.3d 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2017), supports its view \"that when an error has been identified ... equitable considerations may inform the Court's decision about whether or not to simply remand without vacating the challenged agency action.\" Tr. at 62:18-22 (Powers). As to the equities, HHS averred that, \"absent a change to the Court's order or further administrative proceedings,\" it would not be able to collect charges or to make payments under the 2017 rule, as it planned to do in August through October. Tr. at 65:16-19 (Powers). HHS noted that the Court's order affects \"the whole nation\" and not just New Mexico. Tr. at 66:8-9 (Powers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court then noted that its order \"doesn't really impact the government,\" yet it appears that \"nobody else seems to be too interested in this case.\" Tr. at 68:8-11 (Court). The order, in the Court's mind, \"really impacts ... the recipients of these risk adjustment payments; that's who would want this to be a remand rather than a vacatur.\" Tr. at 68:11-14 (Court). The Court then asked: \"Why have I not\n   seen, for example, Blue Cross and other large insurance companies that are the typical recipients of these payments coming in and telling me, [']Look, you've just got to change this part of the relief, because it's just going to be so inequitable to us.[']\" Tr. at 68:19-24 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In response, HHS reiterated that \"it's important to evaluate in reflection of the particular error identified,\" Tr. at 69:7-9 (Powers), although it agreed that the Court will also have to \"consider the equities of the parties that are the recipients or payers of the funds,\" Tr. at 69:12-15 (Court, Powers). HHS argued that issuers \"are expecting to receive hundreds of millions of dollars or at least millions of dollars in payment to help cover the exorbitant cost of covering higher than average actual risk folks [and] are going to be harmed by delays in receiving these funds, which they have anticipated receiving.\" Tr. at 71:2-8 (Powers). Vacatur of the rules for previous years in which charges and payments have been completed, HHS asserted, also \"create[s] some uncertainty about the status of payments and charges already issued for those years.\" Tr. at 72:5-9 (Powers). Remanding without vacatur would, as HHS stated, \"help the Department, because it would mean that there was no question that the rules had ever ceased to be effective, but rather that the agency then would undertake administrative process that would be consistent with the Court's opinion.\" Tr. at 72:13-17 (Powers). HHS also argued that its error -- lack of explanation on the budget neutrality decision -- could be fixed with just a remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 76:1-5 (Powers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court questioned why, if the error is \"such a minor defect that ... it's not worth any sort of remedy,\" HHS has not corrected it. Tr. at 77:4-7 (Court). HHS responded: \"[B]ecause we have been pursuing this relief here.\" Tr. at 77: 8-9 (Powers). Health Connections argued against HHS' classification of this case as \"a failure to explain case. This is a case where the explanation given was found to be arbitrary and capricious.\" Tr. at 81:18-20 (Bassman). Health Connections asserted that vacatur is proper here, because HHS provided an explanation for budget neutrality and that explanation was insufficient under the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 82:4-13 (Bassman). Further, that \"the Blue Crosses of the world\" have not appeared as amici curiae, Health Connections averred, calls into doubt HHS' assertion that vacatur will cause a \"great disruption.\" Tr. at 82:14-83:3 (Bassman). Heath Connections also averred that the big insurance companies receiving the payments do not really care that payments are halted, because they are \"very well capitalized.\" Tr. at 85:1-16 (Bassman). Health Connections then noted that HHS has not identified any insurance company that is \"actually upset that ... risk adjustment is right now on hold.\" Tr. at 83:10-12 (Bassman). Health Connections also argued the equities weigh in favor of vacatur, because HHS has not acted in the four months since the Court's MOO -- when it would have been easy to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and review comments, especially in light of the fact that HHS has already \"thought through these issues really well, [and] got their answers at the ready.\" Tr. at 83:13-84:10 (Bassman).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 84:7-8 (Bassman)(\"The disruption is either a self-inflicted wound or an admission of a serious deficiency.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   HHS then moved to argue its alternative request that, because Health Connections \"point[s] to the particular situation involving this state, ... we've also requested that Your Honor narrow the relief to New Mexico to only accord full relief to the plaintiff.\" Tr. at 70:6-10 (Powers). It asserted that \"the Court in exercising its equitable discretion also has discretion to fashion narrower relief than a full vacatur,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Tr. at 90:16-18 (Powers), and should do so here so to avoid \"having an effect on plans across the county that have nothing to do with the New Mexico marketplace\" while still granting Health Connections' relief, Tr. at 90:25-91:2 (Powers). HHS argued that a limited vacatur is consistent with the APA, because \"the APA does not disturb courts' equitable discretion to deny equitable relief on any ground.\" Tr. at 93:6-8 (Powers). Health Connections noted that HHS' rules are \"not New Mexico-specific,\" Tr. at 94:1 (Bassman), but allowed \"that for our particular injuries as one plaintiff, an order about New Mexico, as opposed to an order about the United States, would leave us equally whole and in the same position,\" Tr. at 94:5-9 (Bassman). Neither party could, however, point to a time where HHS has made a similar argument or any case in which a court has granted a limited vacatur.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 91:14-92:18 (Court, Powers); Tr. at 94:14-21 (Court, Bassman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As to the Motion to Strike, Health Connections argued that the Wu Decl. is \"improper under Rule 59, because this is not newly discovered evidence that was not previously available\" and, thus, HHS should have presented this evidence in the motion-for-summary-judgment briefing. Tr. at 96: 9-15 (Bassman). Health Connections also requested that, should the Court consider the Wu Decl., it should also consider the \"additional affidavits and other materials\" it attached to its Response. Tr. at 96:18-24 (Bassman). HHS conceded that it would be fair for the Court to consider the Wu Decl. only on the equity issues, but argued that the declaration is properly considered under rule 59 for the reasons stated in its Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 13-23 (Court, Powers). Health Connections then asked the Court for the opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Wu should the Court \"engage in fact finding and find based on Mr. Wu's declaration that the defendants have proven some sort of remedy equity facts that entitle them to a change in relief.\" Tr. at 107:22-108:2 (Bassman). HHS then reiterated its position that \"[t]here is no need for discovery.\" Tr. at 109:18-19 (Powers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    12.\n    <em>\n     Suspension of Risk Adjustment Transfers\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   On July 7, 2018, sixteen days after the Court's June 21, 2018, hearing, CMS suspended risk adjustment transfers for the 2017 benefits year, \"[i]n light of the current status of litigation\" in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico.

The Court cannot describe the reasons for Justice Scalia's abandonment of the doctrine better than the Justice himself:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   For decades, and for no good reason, we have been giving agencies the authority to say what their rules mean, under the harmless-sounding banner of \"defer[ring] to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations.\" This is generally\n   called\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   The canonical formulation of\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference is that we will enforce an agency's interpretation of its own rules unless that interpretation is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" But of course whenever the agency's interpretation of the regulation is different from the fairest reading, it is in that sense \"inconsistent\" with the regulation. Obviously, that is not enough, or there would be nothing for\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   to do. In practice,\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference is\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference applied to regulations rather than statutes. The agency's interpretation will be accepted if, though not the fairest reading of the regulation, it is a plausible reading -- within the scope of the ambiguity that the regulation contains.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   Our cases have not put forward a persuasive justification for\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference. The first case to apply it,\n   <em>\n    Seminole Rock,\n   </em>\n   offered no justification whatever -- just the\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   that \"the administrative interpretation ... becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" Our later cases provide two principal explanations, neither of which has much to be said for it. First, some cases say that the agency, as the drafter of the rule, will have some special insight into its intent when enacting it. The implied premise of this argument -- that what we are looking for is the agency's\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   in adopting the rule -- is false. There is true of regulations what is true of statutes. As Justice Holmes put it: \"[w]e do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means.\" Whether governing rules are made by the national legislature or an administrative agency, we are bound\n   <em>\n    by what they say\n   </em>\n   , not by the unexpressed intention of those who made them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   The other rationale our cases provide is that the agency possesses special expertise in administering its \" 'complex and highly technical regulatory program.' \" That is true enough, and it leads to the conclusion that agencies and not courts should make regulations. But it has nothing to do with who should interpret regulations -- unless one believes that the purpose of interpretation is to make the regulatory program work in a fashion that the current leadership of the agency deems effective. Making regulatory programs effective is the purpose of\n   <em>\n    rulemaking\n   </em>\n   , in which the agency uses its \"special expertise\" to formulate the best rule. But the purpose of interpretation is to determine the fair meaning of the rule -- to \"say what the law is.\" Not to make policy, but to determine what policy has been made and promulgated by the agency, to which the public owes obedience. Indeed, since the leadership of agencies (and hence the policy preferences of agencies) changes with Presidential administrations, an agency head can only be sure that the application of his \"special expertise\" to the issue addressed by a regulation\n   <em>\n    will be given effect\n   </em>\n   if we adhere to predictable principles of textual interpretation rather than defer to the \"special expertise\" of his successors. If we take agency enactments as written, the Executive has a stable background against which to write its rules and achieve the policy ends it thinks best.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   Another conceivable justification for\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference, though not one that is to be found in our cases, is this: If it is reasonable to defer to agencies regarding the meaning of statutes that\n   <em>\n    Congress\n   </em>\n   enacted, as we do per\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   , it is\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   reasonable to defer to them regarding the meaning of\n   <em>\n    regulations\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    that they themselves crafted\n   </em>\n   . To give an agency less control over the meaning of its own regulations than it has over the meaning of a congressionally enacted statute seems quite odd.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   But it is not odd at all. The theory of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   (take it or leave it) is that when Congress gives an agency authority to administer a statute, including authority to issue interpretive regulations, it implicitly accords the agency a degree of discretion, which the courts must respect, regarding the meaning of the statute. While the implication of an agency power to clarify the statute is reasonable enough, there is surely no congressional implication that the agency can resolve ambiguities in its own regulations. For that would violate a fundamental principle of separation of powers -- that the power to write a law and the power to interpret it cannot rest in the same hands. \"When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person ... there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.\" Congress cannot enlarge its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   power through\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   -- whatever it leaves vague in the statute will be worked out\n   <em>\n    by someone else\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   represents a presumption about who, as between the Executive and the Judiciary, that someone else will be. (The Executive, by the way -- the competing political branch -- is the less congenial repository of the power as far as Congress is concerned.) So Congress's incentive is to speak as clearly as possible on the matters it regards as important.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   But when an agency interprets its own rules -- that is something else. Then the power to prescribe is augmented by the power to interpret; and the incentive is to speak vaguely and broadly, so as to retain a \"flexibility\" that will enable \"clarification\" with retroactive effect. \"It is perfectly understandable\" for an agency to \"issue vague regulations\" if doing so will \"maximiz[e] agency power.\" Combining the power to prescribe with the power to interpret is not a new evil: Blackstone condemned the practice of resolving doubts about \"the construction of the Roman laws\" by \"stat[ing] the case to the emperor in writing, and tak[ing] his opinion upon it.\" And our Constitution did not mirror the British practice of using the House of Lords as a court of last resort, due in part to the fear that he who has \"agency in passing bad laws\" might operate in the \"same spirit\" in their interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference encourages agencies to be \"vague in framing regulations, with the plan of issuing 'interpretations' to create the intended new law without observance of notice and comment procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   is not a logical corollary to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   but a dangerous permission slip for the arrogation of power.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   It is true enough that\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference has the same beneficial pragmatic effect as\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference: The country need not endure the uncertainty produced by divergent views of numerous district courts and courts of appeals as to what is the fairest reading of the regulation, until a definitive answer is finally provided, years later, by this Court. The agency's view can be relied upon, unless it is, so to speak, beyond the pale. But the duration of the uncertainty produced by a vague regulation need not be as long as the uncertainty produced by a vague statute. For as soon as an interpretation uncongenial to the agency is pronounced by a district court, the agency can begin the process of amending the regulation to make its meaning entirely clear. The circumstances of this case demonstrate the point. While these cases were being briefed before us, EPA\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   issued a rule designed to respond to the Court of Appeals judgment we are reviewing. It did so (by the standards of such things) relatively quickly: The decision below was handed down in May 2011, and in December 2012 the EPA published an amended rule setting forth in unmistakable terms the position it argues here. And there is another respect in which a lack of\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   -type deference has less severe pragmatic consequences for rules than for statutes. In many cases, when an agency believes that its rule permits conduct that the text arguably forbids, it can simply exercise its discretion not to prosecute. That is not possible, of course, when, as here, a party harmed by the violation has standing to compel enforcement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   In any case, however great may be the efficiency gains derived from\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference, beneficial effect cannot justify a rule that not only has no principled basis but contravenes one of the great rules of separation of powers: He who writes a law must not adjudge its violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <em>\n    Decker v.

There are a number of problems with HHS' prior position and its current position regarding the risk adjustment program. HHS has flip-flopped between stating that Congress designed the program to be budget neutral and that the program must be budget neutral because of a lack of funding authority. Many of HHS' problems with the Court's MOO start with this change in position. Now that HHS has abandoned its view that the statute compelled budget neutrality, it must come to grips with the reality that it -- not Congress -- made the decision to embrace budget neutrality. Once HHS grips that reality, it must decide what to do following the Court's conclusion that this decision was arbitrary and capricious. The Court stands by both its initial determination that HHS' risk adjustment formula is arbitrary and capricious and that vacating the formula and remanding to HHS for further consideration is the appropriate remedy.

The Federal Circuit concludes that those riders evince a congressional intent to cap the United States' liability for risk corridors payments so that those payments would never exceed the risk corridors charges that the United States collects,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the appropriations riders impose a de facto budget neutrality requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517202\" index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/1311/\">\n    892 F.3d at 1325-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whether the Anti-Deficiency Act applies, however, is irrelevant to whether the lump sum portion of the Program Management Appropriation is available for risk adjustment payments. The Anti-Deficiency Act prevents \"[a]n officer or employee of the United States Government\" from incurring obligations \"exceeding an amount available in an appropriation\" or \"before an appropriation is made\"; it says nothing about whether particular funds are available for a particular purpose.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Thus, while HHS' observation is accurate -- Congress is not an officer or employee of the United States -- it does not successfully distinguish\n   <em>\n    Moda\n   </em>\n   ; the Anti-Deficiency Act restricts agency action absent an available appropriation, but it is silent on whether a particular appropriation is available for a particular purpose. Consequently, the Federal Circuit's and the GAO's analysis concluding that the lump sum portion of the Program Management Appropriation is available for risk corridors payments applies equally to risk adjustment payments. That this lump sum is available for risk adjustment payments means that HHS could have adopted a risk adjustment formula where risk adjustment payments might exceed risk adjustment charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

This error, then, is much more than just the agency's failure to provide an explanation for its budget neutrality decision; this flaw is the agency making all its subsequent decisions assuming budget neutrality is a given and not making any decision on budget neutrality itself. There is no attempt to justify budget neutrality until 2016, in the 2018 Final Rule, when commenters noted that budget neutrality may not be furthering the risk adjustment program's goals. 2018 Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 94,101 (A.R.009638). Here, HHS provides an explanation which the Court finds inadequate to support the budget-neutrality decision -- \"the absence of additional funding\" -- but again this explanation contradicts HHS' position that Congress designed the statute to be budget\n   neutral. 2018 Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 94,101 (A.R.009638).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1170-74. While the Court is mindful that operating the program in a budget-neutral manner and using the statewide average premium to promote that goal may be the correct choice, that choice is one the agency must actually make instead of taking for granted. Building a rule on an erroneous assumption -- not even a conscious decision -- is at the heart of an arbitrary and capricious action, especially where the assumption may not promote the authorizing statute's goals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WildEarth Guardians v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275507\" index=\"392\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/1222/#p1239\">\n    870 F.3d at 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the 2014-2018 rules' deficiencies are not minor, and this fact supports vacatur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Further, it is hard for the Court to determine the consequences of vacating the 2014-2018 rules, because HHS has not enlightened the Court on this front. To attempt to determine what will likely happen if it vacates the rule, and properly weigh the equities, the Court concludes it is proper to consider all the information it can as to better make an informed decision. It will thus consider the Wu Decl. and the Amici Statement to gain a sense of vacatur's consequences. These sources, however, are also unhelpful in enlightening the Court's understanding of the consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   The Wu Decl. first states that vacatur will prevent CMS from \"invoic[ing] issuers, collect[ing] charges, or mak[ing] billions of dollars of disbursements in risk adjustment payments\" for 2017 and 2018. Wu Decl. \u00b6 13, at 4. Wu, Associate Deputy Director for Policy Coordination at the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, makes this statement under oath. While CMS did initially state it would suspend payments in July, two and a half weeks later CMS expressly decided not to suspend payments. Once again, HHS told the Court something that, like every time HHS speaks to the Court, reveals its new position. The Court's experience with HHS' changing positions has not been good. HHS' hyperbole does not appear to be an equity that weighs against vacatur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   Second, Wu states that, for 2015-2016, \"vacatur raises questions about the legal status of these already-administered payments and charges.\" Wu Decl. \u00b6 14, at 4. Vacatur does not, itself, raise questions about the legal status of prior payments and charges; the merits of the decision of the MOO -- not just the remedies analysis -- has already done that. It is likely that payees like Health Connections will seek this money back, regardless of what the Court chooses on the remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   Third, HHS then tries to frighten the Court by saying its decision will cause the sky to fall. Wu states that both consequences he has claimed may \"create strong financial incentives for insurance companies to raise their rates, avoid sick enrollees, or otherwise attempt to insulate themselves against the financial uncertainty of riskier enrollees.\" Wu Decl. \u00b6 15, at 4. Wu states that vacatur of the risk adjustment methodology will also impact the risk corridors program, forcing revisions of \"billions of dollars of risk corridors calculations,\" disrupting expectations, and burdening health insurance companies. Wu Decl. \u00b6 19, at 5. According to Wu, both the risk adjustment and risk corridors revisions will impact companies' medical loss ratio reporting as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wu Decl. \u00b6 21, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   The statements in the Wu Decl. do not persuade the Court. The problem with Wu's predictions is that the Court issued its decision on February 28, 2018, and none of what Wu has predicted has come true. He has proven to be a poor prognosticator. First, insurance premiums are predicted to rise less in 2019 than they have in the past, and may go down for a few\n   states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alison Kodjak, Analysts Predict Health Care Marketplace Premiums Will Stabilize for 2019 Coverage, NPR (Sept. 3, 2018, 5:06 AM), https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/03/643457582/analysts-predict-health-care-marketplace-premiums-will-stabilize-in-2019. Second, insurance companies cannot avoid sick enrollees, because the ACA still requires them to cover people with pre-existing health connections and prevents them from charging these enrollees higher premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Third, the Court notes that HHS has not been prevented in collecting payments under the risk adjustment program for 2017 and 2018, because it promulgated a new rule for 2017, and is in the process of doing so for 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second HHS Notice at 1-2; Third HHS Notice at 1. Thus, although HHS temporarily suspended taking payments under the risk adjustment program -- for seventeen days -- it is now collecting and dispersing money owed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second HHS Notice at 2. The Court does agree that there is uncertainty as to the legality of payments collected and made during 2014-2016, but without knowing more about this issue it is difficult for the Court to consider this in equity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, the Court concludes that the effect on prior payments weighs slightly against vacatur. The effect on the risk corridors program does not, however, weigh against vacatur, because, as Health Connections notes, \"HHS has defaulted on its risk corridors obligations,\" so that program already faces havoc. Response at 20. The Court also does not believe that vacating the rules for 2014-2018 will create uncertainty for insurance companies as to rate-setting or cause them to raise premiums, as the administrative record shows that insurance companies are already unclear as to how the risk adjustment program affects them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Daniel J. Perlman &amp; David M. Liner, Milliman,\n   <em>\n    Financial Analysis of ACA Health Plan Issuers\n   </em>\n   at 3 (February 2016)(NMHC001007)(\"Over half of ACA health plan issuers recorded $0 in risk adjustment transfers ... [which] could represent an acknowledgement that it was not possible to determine whether a receipt or payment was the more likely outcome ....\"); CHOICES,\n   <em>\n    Improving Risk Adjustment to Improve the Market Today\n   </em>\n   (March 29, 2016)(NMHC000190)(\"Transfer payments for Risk Adjustment have been difficult to predict, highly variable, and in some cases vary large in relation to insurers' premium amounts.\"). First, deciding whether one will be a payee or payor is so uncertain that insurers do not even make a receipt on financial statements; predictability is that poor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Perlman &amp; Liner,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 3 (NMHC001007). Second, there is at least a two-year gap between when premiums are set and when risk adjustment calculations are made, meaning the risk adjustment calculation may be impacted in ways insurers cannot predict when setting their\n   rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Victoria Boyarsky &amp; Rong Yi, Milliman,\n   <em>\n    EHB, MLR and Risk Adjustment: Stakeholder Considerations on the 2019 Proposed Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters\n   </em>\n   at 6 (January 2018). So risk adjustment is a non-factor in setting premiums. Further, the record shows the program itself has harmed insurers and the insured, with exorbitant charges forcing some insurers to close their doors, decreasing market competition, and increasing premiums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1124-26. It is unclear how vacatur will impact medical loss ratio reporting, as HHS has not provided further information besides saying it will be impacted. On balance, then, these equities weigh slightly in favor of vacatur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   Finally, the Amici Statement discusses only AHIP and Blue Cross' surprise with HHS' suspension of the risk adjustment program and how the suspension affects the market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amici Statement at 1-2. It notes that the suspension \"jeopardizes the future market participation of plans\" and \"creates profound uncertainty for future health plan pricing.\" Amici Statement at 2. The Amici Statement states that the suspension also brings uncertainty into insurers' \"calculation of their medical loss ratio.\" Amici Statement at 3. While the Court appreciates that AHIP and Blue Cross filed this Statement, the concerns are mooted now, because the risk adjustment program is no longer suspended. Accordingly, none of these concerns add anything to the Court's equitable considerations. The Court notes, however, that, because the Amici Statement came only after HHS suspended the program and does not discuss any harms to insurance companies resulting from vacatur of the prior years, it appears that insurance companies -- at least AHIP and Blue Cross -- do not seem to be concerned by this issue of remedies. The insurance companies did not file the Amici Statement after the Court issued its MOO on February 28, 2018, but only after HHS suspended payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   In sum, it is difficult for the Court to determine how disruptive vacatur will be. So far -- nearly eight months after the MOO -- vacatur has not been very disruptive. Although HHS could arguably justify budget neutrality and the resulting decision to use the statewide average premium if the Court remanded without vacating the rules, the Court concludes this remedy would be contrary to the APA's mandate. HHS operated with the conclusion that the program had to be budget neutral, and all its reasoned decisionmaking stemmed from this erroneous assumption -- until commenters noted that budget neutrality may not promote the program's goals. This combined with HHS' later justification that it did not have money to operate the program any differently -- which again, was erroneous -- counsels that the Court should vacate the 2014-2018 rules. This situation is not a case where the Court did not have sufficient information to decide whether HHS had acted arbitrarily and capriciously. There is a sufficient record here to conclude HHS acted arbitrarily and capriciously. HHS merely providing additional justification for budget neutrality and the use of the statewide average premium would not fix its error in assuming that the ACA required the risk adjustment program to be budget neutral. HHS must consciously make the decision to conduct the program in a budget-neutral manner and provide sufficient justification for this decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Finally, the Court cannot, in an intellectually honest manner, limit vacatur of the rules to the state of New Mexico. The Court does not know how a court vacates a rule only as to one state, one district, or one party. The main Department of Justice lawyer advised that he was not sure if the department had ever asked for relief to be limited to one state before doing so in this case and did not know of anyone else in the United States asking for such relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 91:14-92:7 (Court, Powers). The rules do not apply only to New Mexico; they apply nationwide and, thus, have nationwide harms. Further, the deficiencies with the rules are not specific to New Mexico but, again, rather inherent in the rules themselves. The Court vacates only the 2014-2018 rules as to the statewide average premium rules,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   so this is a limited and tailored vacatur as to the deficiencies in the rules; the remaining provisions stand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that: (i) the Defendants' Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), filed March 28, 2018 (Doc. 57), is denied; (ii) the Plaintiff's Motion to Strike the Declaration of Jeffrey Wu or in the Alternative Grant Plaintiff Leave to Take Discovery, filed April 23, 2018 (Doc. 61), is denied; and (iii) the Motion of America's Health Insurance Plans and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association for Leave to File Statement on New Developments in\n   Support of Rule 59(e) Motion as Amici Curiae, filed July 19, 2018 (Doc. 80), is granted.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-289\">\n    HHS is not the only Defendant in this case, but Plaintiff New Mexico Health Connections challenges the agency's actions, so the Court will, for simplicity's sake, refer to HHS only.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-290\">\n    The Court refers to HHS' published risk adjustment methodology in general terms even though HHS has five different published risk adjustment methodologies at issue, one for each year from 2014 to 2018, because, while those methodologies differ in detail, they have the same basic structure.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , 2017 Final Rule, 81 Fed.

L. Rev. 417\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 418 (2017). The criticism seems to be mostly due to the fact that there have been twenty-nine preliminary injunctions entered against the current administration. The critics see these courts as blocking the democratic process. A few years ago, a more liberal administration criticized judges for blocking its executive orders and its laws, including the ACA. What seems clear is that the rule on national injunctions should not depend on whether the injunction blocks legislation the critics like. In the end, the discussion should be governed by more rational principles than whether the critics or proponents like or dislike the legislation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-342\">\n    Whether the nation will allow or not national injunctions is less of a legal issue and more of a policy issue. The critics have not really said that current law -- Congress or some statute -- precludes national injunctions; rather, critics mostly argue that prudential concerns counsel against national injunctions. Congress or the Supreme Court will have to make that call. It would be easy to be aggressive. As a conservative, cautious judge, the Court is inclined not to go any further than the case requires and leave nonparties' law for another day. It is not always clear whether a national injunction has been entered. For example, in this case, there is no national injunction, but vacatur may affect non-parties to this case. On the other hand, even when an injunction limited to the parties, it may effectively impact nonparties. Finally, the national injunctions that seem to draw criticism the most are those against the federal government and not other entities, so it is unclear whether critics are concerned, for example, with national injunctions against corporations in some or all instances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-343\">\n    Critics of federal district court judges issuing national injunctions argue that this practice \"encourages forum shopping and that it arrests the development of the law in the federal system.\" Bray,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 419. The grant of an injunction in one circuit, for example, may discourage plaintiffs from bringing similar challenges in different circuits, thus preventing other circuits from developing their views on the issue.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Bray,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 461. This reality means that, when the issue reaches the Supreme Court, it is \"more likely to hear a case without the benefit of disagreement from the courts of appeals,\" and its \"resolution may be accelerated and relatively fact-free,\" leading to a bad development of law. Bray,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 461-62. Criticism also stems from the fact that, in the multiple-judge federal system, a number of judges may be deciding the same issue in different courts, so conflicting injunction orders may issue.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Bray,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 420. According to critics, these conflicting orders creates absurdity in that, to carry out its policies, the United must win every case brought against it seeking to halt a policy, yet a plaintiff need win only once for the policy to be invalidated.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Suzanne Monyak,\n    <em>\n     New House Bill Seeks to Bar Nationwide Injunctions\n    </em>\n    , Law 360 (Sept. 10, 2018, 6:09 PM), https://www.law360.com/articles/1081108/new-house-bill-seeks-to-bar-nationwide-injunctions. Accordingly, the House Judiciary Committee has recently introduced a new bill -- the Injunctive Authority Clarification Act of 2018 -- which, as it is currently written, provides that \"[n]o court of the United States ... shall issue an order that purports to restrain the enforcement against a non-party of any statute, regulation, order, or similar authority, unless the non-party is represented by a party acting in a representative capacity pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" Injunctive Authority Clarification Act of 2018, H.R. 6730, 115th Cong. (2018), available at https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6730/text.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-344\">\n    While the Court agrees that national injunctions often are anti-democratic and messy, the Court also is inclined to think that national injunctions have their place in a federal court's arsenal of equitable relief. There is nothing inherently wrong in a federal court issuing a national injunction. The criticisms against the national injunction do not completely move the Court from this stance. First, the Court notes that, as to the issue of forum shopping, prohibiting national injunctions will not solve this issue, and the Court is not convinced that forum shopping is a strong issue here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Suzette M. Malveaux,\n    <em>\n     Class Actions, Civil Rights, and the National Injunction\n    </em>\n    , 131 Harv. L. Rev. F. 56, 57 (2017) (\"Forum shopping is hardly new and, in fact, the American legal system tacitly encourages with its charge that lawyers zealously represent their clients within the bounds of the law.\" (footnote omitted) ). Zealous litigators are inclined to head to the Ninth Circuit as compared to the Tenth, regardless whether a national injunction is available or not. Second, the national injunction does not create bad development of law. Courts do not issue injunctions lightly. The standard to receive an injunction is high, and litigants have every incentive to zealously argue for their position. There must be some facts presented for a court to determine whether a plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of the case. While deciding an issue on such a bare record is not ideal, this is the standard for receiving a preliminary injunction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Winter v. NDRC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"491\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n     555 U.S. 7\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 20,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"492\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n     129 S.Ct. 365\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"493\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n     172 L.Ed.2d 249\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2008) (\"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\"). The protections that Congress has put in place balance this uncertainty: (i) the requirement for a hearing,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a) ; (ii) the requirement for \"security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained,\" unless the party seeking the injunction in the United States government, Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) ; (iii) the requirement that an order granting an injunction state the reasons for and the terms of the injunction,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1) ; (iv) the ability to stay an injunction during an appeal,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1)(c) ; and (v) the right to immediately appeal an injunction order,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"494\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Restraining the conduct of another is a serious remedy, but, as discussed, there are many safeguards in place to ensure this remedy is provided in a reasoned manner. That the Supreme Court may have to decide whether to overturn a preliminary injunction on a bare record is not ideal, but many times these cases involve a key legal issue and thus ultimately rarely create bad law. Again, the standard is based on the likelihood of success on the merits; there is not a ruling on the merits. Further, a preliminary injunction is just that -- preliminary. It is not meant to, and cannot, last forever. The decision to grant a permanent injunction is done with a full factual record once the merits have been decided, allowing for a full review at the Supreme Court when the law will be decided on the merits.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-345\">\n    Critics of the national injunction also note the apparent lack of legal authority for federal courts to issue national injunctions. The argument is that, because equitable remedies must be grounded in traditional equity as it existed in the Court of Chancery in 1789 and because traditional equity had nothing similar to a national injunction, federal courts today lack the ability to issue national injunctions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Bray,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 425. In traditional equity, the Court of Chancery, as it originated from the Crown, would not enjoin the Crown and would normally issue decrees affecting only the parties before it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Bray,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 425-27. Broader relief could be obtained, however, where it resolved the \"common claims of cohesive group,\" which allowed \"a successful plaintiff to obtain an injunction protecting all similarly situated persons\" and, thus, affecting nonparties. Bray,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 427.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-346\">\n    The Court also has issues with this ground for prohibiting national injunctions. The federal government is one of checks and balances, and all three branches must work together to promote an organized society. \"The legislative department has been committed the duty of making laws, to the executive the duty of executing them, and to the judiciary the duty of interpreting and applying them in cases brought before the courts.\"\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Mellon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142497\" index=\"495\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/262/447/#p488\">\n     262 U.S. 447\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 488,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142497\" index=\"496\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/262/447/#p488\">\n     43 S.Ct. 597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142497\" index=\"497\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/262/447/#p488\">\n     67 L.Ed. 1078\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1923). The constitutional requirement of standing thus requires a plaintiff to show some concrete injury resulting from the law's enforcement, for a federal court to properly enjoin enforcement without stepping on the toes of the other two branches.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts v.

It is the federal judiciary's role to \"say what the law is\" and, thus, determine whether Congress' action violates the Federal Constitution.\n    <em>\n     Marbury v. Madison\n    </em>\n    , 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177-78,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"505\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/\">\n     2 L.Ed. 60\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1803). Federal courts may not give weight to unconstitutional laws, for doing so \"would be giving to the legislature a practical and real omnipotence, with the same breath which professes to restrict their powers within narrow limits.\"\n    <em>\n     Marbury v. Madison\n    </em>\n    , 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 178. Deciding the law of a case to uphold the Constitution as\n    <em>\n     Marbury v. Madison\n    </em>\n    counsels and enjoining the enforcement of an unconstitutional statute as to the plaintiff bringing the case certainly restricts the Legislature to a degree. This narrow relief is not enough for due justice in all situations. If there is a conviction is that \"an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void,\"\n    <em>\n     Marbury v. Madison\n    </em>\n    , 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 177, then it is not enough to enjoin enforcement only as to one person. This narrow relief provides no justice for those who, for some reason, cannot bring a case to prevent the executive from applying this void law to them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-347\">\n    Limiting the injunction also does nothing to prevent the broader effects of the void law. In effect, then, while the law is void as to the deciding case, it still stands as to everyone else who has not challenged it. This result means that the law, which should be void for conflicting with the Supreme Law of the land, is still influencing conduct. Thus, the Legislature still has \"a practical and real omnipotence,\" and is still able to \"do what is expressly forbidden.\"\n    <em>\n     Marbury v. Madison\n    </em>\n    , 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 178 ). Where a plaintiff has standing to challenge the law -- therefore showing an actual, concrete injury -- and shows that the law is unconstitutional, then to fully provide justice a federal court should have the power to void the statute and uphold the sanctity of the Constitution by striking the statute down, i.e., enjoining its enforcement broadly.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-348\">\n    Critics also note a number of doctrinal inconsistencies that the issuance of national injunctions creates. These inconsistencies include: (i) national injunctions render meaningless the legal principle that nonmutual, offensive issue preclusion cannot be used against the federal government; (ii) the use of rule 23(b)(2) class actions are unnecessary if a national injunction provides the same relief to an individual plaintiff; (iii) the inability of nonparties to enforce an injunction order; and (iv) the ability of federal district court judges to \"recognize and determine the law\" for nonparties through a national injunction, when their decisions cannot and should not bind other district courts or create precedent or clearly established law. Bray,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 464-65. Again, these criticisms do not sway the Court's belief that national injunctions have their place in promoting a just society, but they counsel extreme caution in using them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-349\">\n    An injunction has been issued as to a party -- the defendant -- who had a full and fair chance to litigate. Enjoining that defendant's enforcement of an unconstitutional law means that law cannot stand. Should that defendant then attempt to enforce the law against a nonparty, that person would not be able to sue for contempt under the injunction, but would rather have to relitigate the issue. The point of the injunction is to attempt to prevent the defendant from enforcing the law at all, which a federal court could do because the defendant is a party in front of it. Finally, a national does not create binding precedent, and does not create clearly established law for qualified immunity purposes. A national injunction, as with any other injunction, is enforceable via contempt of court only by the court that issued the injunction. It is true that the national injunction is an \"imperfect and crude form[ ] of justice,\" but the Court is inclined to believe that, without it, there are situations in which justice cannot be served.

Congress and/or the Supreme Court will decide the issue. On balance, the Court agrees with the criticism that they should be used sparingly and carefully, but that there is some room in the nation's democratic society for them. Cases have to get started somehow, and most get started in the district court, which either gets the issues right or wrong in the first instance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-351\">\n    Finally, if Congress or the Supreme Court limits national injunctions, it should not do so in a way that displays some form of elitism. The critics seem uncomfortable with national injunctions in Hawaii, California, or New Mexico, but less so if they come out of S.D.N.Y. or the District of Columbia. Again, that limitation would not be a national principle, but only would reflect a distaste for everyone and everything that is not on the East Coast.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
