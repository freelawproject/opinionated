The applicable insurance policy covers \"sudden and accidental direct physical loss to [the] property.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex. A\n   </em>\n   [# 39-1] at 24. It does not cover loss to the property caused by \"design,\" \"workmanship,\" or \"construction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. It also does not cover loss \"when there are two or more causes of loss to the covered property, and the predominant cause of loss is excluded\" by other provisions of the policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A hail storm hit the property in May of 2015.\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   [# 39] at 4;\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   [# 45] at 3.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In their Response [# 45], Plaintiffs assert four arguments in support of their contention that summary judgment is not appropriate in this case. The Court need only address two here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Policy Language\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that because the applicable insurance policy expressly covers \"sudden and accidental direct physical loss to property\" without defining \"sudden and accidental,\" those terms should be construed against the insurance company.\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   [# 45] at 10. Plaintiffs further assert that \"sudden and accidental\" means \"unexpected and unintended.\" Because the damage to their home was \"unexpected and unintended,\" they argue, the loss should be covered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Hecla Mining Company v. New Hampshire Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10382144\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/811/1083/\">\n    811 P.2d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo. 1991), for their contention that \"sudden and accidental\" means \"unexpected and unintended.\" Their reliance is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   [# 45] at 10. In\n   <em>\n    Hecla\n   </em>\n   , the Colorado Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the phrase \"sudden and accidental\" as used in a commercial liability insurance policy's pollution exclusion clause.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10382144\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/811/1083/\">\n    811 P.2d at 1088-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In order to avoid inconsistency between the policy's definition of \"occurrence\" and the use of the phrase \"sudden and accidental\" in the pollution exclusion, the Court construed the phrase to mean \"unexpected and unintended\" with regard to the nature of the pollution discharge. The Court's analysis was occasioned by its conclusion that the term \"sudden\" was used ambiguously in the context of the policy's exclusionary clause.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10382144\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/811/1083/\">\n    811 P.2d at 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Plaintiffs have pointed to no inherent inconsistency in the policy language at issue here. As explained below, the Court concludes that the term \"sudden\" is not ambiguous as used in the policy, nor is it inherently ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Preliminarily,\n   <em>\n    Hecla\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that the use of the phrase \"sudden and accidental direct physical loss to property\" in a homeowners' insurance policy means unexpected and unintended loss to the home. Rather,\n   <em>\n    Hecla\n   </em>\n   holds that a pollution exclusion clause in a commercial liability insurance policy which provides coverage for a \"sudden and accidental\" event is inconsistent with that policy's definition of an \"occurrence\" as an accident including \"continuous or repeated exposure to conditions.\" In light of this inconsistency, the Court held that use of \"sudden\" in the policy exclusion was ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For that reason, the Court rejected the \"temporal connotation\" of \"sudden,\" and instead construed the term to mean \"unintended and unexpected.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10382144\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/811/1083/\">\n    811 P.2d at 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The holding in\n   <em>\n    Hecla\n   </em>\n   is simply not applicable to the policy or circumstances at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Moreover, in the absence of any internal inconsistency which creates ambiguity, the word \"sudden\" in the Plaintiffs' policy must be construed in accordance with its ordinary meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins. Co. v. Huizar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11433673\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/52/816/#p821\">\n    52 P.3d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 821 (Colo. 2002) (\"[I]nsurance policies are contracts, which must be construed according to their plain meaning....\"). Under Colorado law, in construing an insurance policy, terms are given their plain meaning according to common usage.\n   <em>\n    Pompa v. Am. Fam. Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702390\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/1139/#p1143\">\n    520 F.3d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1143 (10th Cir. 2008). Plaintiffs' interpretation of \"sudden and accidental\" makes no reference to two of the most common usages of \"sudden,\" which relate solely to timing: that is, events which are \"marked by or manifesting abruptness or haste\" or \"made or brought about in a short time.\"\n   <em>\n    Sudden\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster.com (2018), https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sudden (last visited Sept. 12, 2018). Under Plaintiffs' reading of the policy language, any unexpected and unintended property loss would be covered, regardless of how long it took to develop. Simply stated, in the context of this policy, there is no legitimate reason to construe \"sudden\" as \"gradual or continuous,\" which is precisely the type of damage found by the engineers to Plaintiffs' EIFS stucco system. Indeed, the Colorado Supreme Court's recognition in\n   <em>\n    Hecla\n   </em>\n   of the inherent contradiction and ambiguity in an insurance policy which covers accidents caused by \"continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,\" but excludes damage caused by discharges of pollution unless they are \"sudden and accidental,\" supports this conclusion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10382144\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/811/1083/\">\n    811 P.2d at 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the policy language indicating that the insurance covers \"sudden and direct physical loss to property\" means loss which was brought about in a short time, not loss which occurred over time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tynan's Nissan, Inc. v.

Be that as it may, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the damage to the EIFS system was \"sudden and accidental,\" as required by the plain language of the policy.

Regardless of whether the damage occurred because of a design flaw in the EIFS system or a construction issue, there is no dispute that the home was built in 1994, water seeped into the EIFS system over a period of years, and the damage to the stucco at the residence was due to this long term water infiltration.\n   <em>\n    Ex.
