On the other hand, Huawei identifies several facts negating any possible inference that it never intended to abide by its FRAND obligations: it has repeatedly offered to submit this dispute to binding arbitration, it initially sought to bifurcate the issues in this case so that the FRAND-related issues could be addressed on an expedited basis before delving into the patent issues, and it is and has been willing to withdraw the Chinese injunction actions so long as Samsung agrees to a binding process to determine the FRAND terms of a cross-license between the parties.

Noninfringement of the '825 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The '825 patent provides a method for a user equipment to communicate with a base station (Node B) on a shared channel (SCH), which is a channel used by multiple UEs communicating with the same base station. '825 patent, Abstract;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:53-56 (Dkt. No. 140-1 at 47). The Node B must be able to differentiate UEs to ensure that data packets are sent to their intended recipient. The '825 patent discloses a method for UEs to select a temporary ID from a pool when initiating communications with a base station. Sometimes, two UEs may select the same short ID at the same time and a \"collision\" occurs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:14-39;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:47-49. The '825 patent addresses this potential problem by developing a monitoring technique in which a UE waits a \"predetermined delay duration\" prior to monitoring for a downlink signal, so that a first UE has time to receive its short ID before a second UE may intercept it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3:33-45;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:34-39;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:65-7:7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Asserted claims 1 (method) and 4 (apparatus) both disclose \"receiving system information indicating a group of identification (ID)s.\" '825 Patent at 11:43-44, 12:3-4.

The description of figure 3, \"a message flow diagram illustrating conventional operation for acquiring a short ID after a UE moves to a new cell,\" includes the following: \"The system information is common information to be provided up to a cell boundary through known cell-by-cell channels, and includes information to be detected by the UE\n   <strong>\n    305\n   </strong>\n   for initiating communications in the cell.\" '825 Patent at 2:54-56, 59-63;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:32-33, figure 4 description (noting that the UE \"acquires system information\" and \"[t]he system information includes the temporary ID pool\n   of the cell A.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:52-57, figure 8 description (\"[t]he controller\n   <strong>\n    835,\n   </strong>\n   for example, manages a temporary ID pool and T and P values acquired from system information of a current cell, selects a temporary ID from the temporary ID pool, and delivers the selected temporary ID to the control message generator\n   <strong>\n    805\n   </strong>\n   .\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:51-52, figure 9 description (noting that the UE \"acquires system information,\" and \"[t]he system information includes a temporary ID pool of the cell A, a delay duration T, and a valid period P.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Huawei underscores that Samsung's expert, Dr. Matthew Valenti, admitted that this description means that the T and P values are what is being transmitted.

And its expert, Dr. La Porta, opines that \"[n]othing within this source code, or elsewhere, suggest that the Huawei/HiSilicon accused devices receive system information 'including a group of identification(ID)s.' \" La Porta Rebuttal Report \u00b6\u00b6 121, 132 (Ex. 42; Dkt. No. 327-56[under seal] ). Dr. La Porta also contends that, even accepting Samsung's proposed construction, the claims would not read on the accused products because \"the system information only provides data for the UE to determine the size of PreambleGroupA and PreambleGroupB[,]\" but \"the base station does not provide\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   information to show\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     which\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   preamble group to use.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Samsung begins its counterattack by insisting that \"indicating\" must be given its plain and ordinary meaning, since it was not selected for claim construction, and the plain and ordinary meaning of the word can mean \"to point out or point to.\" Dkt. No. 328-41. It also emphasizes that all of the embodiments that Huawei highlights are \"exemplary embodiments\" and nowhere does the patentee use limiting language in reference to these embodiments. As evidence of infringement, it cites to Dr. Valenti's opinion that \"[t]he received system information determines the available groups of random access preambles (including whether preamble group B exist or not), the number of preambles in the available groups, and the size of each of those preamble groups.\" Valenti Report \u00b6\u00b6 372, 624 (Dkt. No. 357-46[under seal] ). According to Samsung, since the system information includes the number of preambles in a group, it necessarily includes the range of preamble indexes, i.e., an ID within a group of IDs, thereby accomplishing the claim limitation of \"receiving system information indicating a group of identification (ID)s.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '825 Patent at 11:43-44, 12:3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Even though I must look to the specification for guidance in interpreting the plain and ordinary meaning of claim terms, \"it is improper to read limitations from a preferred embodiment described in the specification-even if it is the only embodiment-into the claims absent a clear indication in the intrinsic record that the patentee intended the claims to be so limited.\"\n   <em>\n    Epos Techs.

Mot. at 2-4.

But \"whether a claim element or combination is well-understood, routine, and conventional ... falls under step two in the \u00a7 101 framework, in which we 'consider the elements of each claim both individually and as an ordered combination to determine whether the additional elements transform the nature of the claim into a patent eligible application.' \"\n   <em>\n    Aatrix Software, Inc. v.

Samsung's\n   <em>\n    real\n   </em>\n   issue centers around the \"allocated by the system\" limitation. Dr. Veeravalli opined that the value \"u\" is \"allocated by the system,\" which explains Samsung's attempt to assign \"u\" to \"a group number k.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 1 (\"Because the only values 'allocated' by the system cited by Dr. Veeravalli are the values used to compute the 'sequence-group number u,' the value 'u' must be the claimed 'group number k' that is obtained by the UE.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   What Samsung should have argued in its motion, but only developed in reply, is that Huawei has not offered evidence that \"a group number k\" is \"allocated by the system,\" and therefore has not demonstrated disputed facts that the claim limitations are met by the accused products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 2 (\"Huawei presents no evidence that 'u +1' is a value 'allocated by the system' that the UE obtains.\") (citing Veeravalli Report). Samsung insists that Huawei cannot present such evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Marisetti Report \u00b6 18 (\"The UE never 'obtains' the value 'u+1' at any point in time when generating reference signals; nor is the value 'u+1' ever 'allocated' by the system, as required by the Court's construction.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   As with the \"obtaining\" limitation, Huawei contends that \"allocated by the system\" does not prohibit receiving precursors to the group number k from the system (i.e., the value \"u\"), and subsequently calculating the group number k (\"u+1\") from the precursor. It cites to the dictionary definition of \"allocate\" (which the parties apparently agree on) to support its position. Dictionary Definition of \"allocate\" (Mack Decl.

I agree with Huawei that \"allocated\" should not be limited to \"receiving\" in the same way that \"obtaining\" is not limited to \"receiving.\"\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   discussion IV.E. In other words, Huawei can prove infringement by showing that the \"group number k\" is allocated by the system because \"u\" is sent by the system, a necessary prerequisite to \"allocating\" \"u+1.\" As Huawei put it during the hearing, Samsung concedes that \"u\" is \"allocated by the system,\" but insists that \"u+1\" is not allocated.

Huawei initially indicated that it would \"respond to this interrogatory at an appropriate time.\" Its final response asserted that it would \"disclose its experts' opinions in accordance with the expert discovery schedule in this matter,\" noted that the functionality of its products constituted a \"design-around,\" and identified as responsive the entirety of the \"deposition testimony of its technical and source code witnesses deposed in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

I agree with Samsung that the interrogatory was directed towards noninfringing alternatives, but I am not convinced that Huawei's explanation should be so easily brushed aside. The interrogatory sought technology that \"can\" be used as an alternative, and Samsung does not directly dispute Huawei's contention that once the standard was adopted, no acceptable alternative technology exists. It does, however, dispute any \"temporal limitation\" in the interrogatory, and it underscores the language asking \"when the alleged design-around was available for use\" as support that the request sought \"any and all design-arounds at any point in time.\" Reply at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   But Samsung cannot deny that its interrogatory used \"can,\" not \"could\" as it claims in its motion. Huawei insists that a request for \"present-day design-arounds to the asserted patents\" is \"irrelevant to the issue of whether there were any acceptable alternative technologies at the time of the adoption of the relevant 3GPP standard,\" which is the subject of its rebuttal reports. Given the plain language of the interrogatory, I agree with Huawei. Samsung can legitimately argue that Huawei should have known what it intended by its request, but that does not change the plain language of the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-387\">\n   Moreover, this case is different than those relied on by Samsung that place the burden of identifying noninfringing alternatives during the accounting period on the accused infringer. None of those cases dealt with a technology that was declared essential to a standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-388\">\n   Huawei also emphasizes that it consistently took the position that this subject was properly suited for expert, not fact, discovery, and therefore need not have been disclosed in interrogatories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ericsson Inc. v.

To the extent that Samsung disagreed with this contention, it could have moved to compel a further response. Huawei insists that its experts' reports were directly responsive to Samsung's experts' opinions concluding that there were no \"viable non-infringing alternative[s]\" and criticizing certain alternative technologies available at the time the standard was implemented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bambos '130 Opening Infr.

Noninfringement Theories\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   Samsung also takes issue with several of Huawei's noninfringement theories that it contends were not disclosed during discovery:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-391\">\n   For the '105 patent : (1) the Accused Instrumentalities do not use \"FT pre-coded symbols\" because Physical Uplink Shared Channel (\"PUSCH\") symbols purportedly contain control information in addition to data information (see Ex. J at 29-34); (2) the Accused Instrumentalities do not map PUSCH and Physical Uplink Control Channel (\"PUCCH\") symbols to two sets of subcarriers such that both sets of subcarriers are available for transformation during the same IFFT operation (id. at 38-46); and (3) the Accused Instrumentalities do not perform the same IFT operation on the PUSCH and PUCCH (id. at 47-50);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-392\">\n   For the '350 patent : (1) performing only the steps in method claim 1 does not result in the determination of \"downlink transmit power,\" which is based on a new claim construction theory that the preamble is limiting (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. L at 53-59); (2) the claimed \"determining a cell-specific ratio\" cannot be met by using a lookup table based on Huawei's proposed construction of \"determining\" as \"calculating\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-63); (3) the claimed \"receiving a cell-specific parameter\" is not met by receiving an index value for a lookup table based on Huawei's proposed construction of \"cell-specific parameter\" as \"a parameter representing an RS boosting value\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-65); and (4) the Accused Instrumentalities do not use a cell-specific ratio because \"[t]he same 'ratio' is not used by all user equipment in a cell\" and that different manufacturers purportedly use different ratios (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 69-72).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-393\">\n   For the '130 patent : data is not mapped to \"remaining\" symbols in the slot when a Sounding Reference Signal (\"SRS\") is sent (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. M at 40-41).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-394\">\n   For the '726 patent : Samsung has failed to point to evidence of a claims \"HARQ processor\" (see Ex. N at 76-81)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   Huawei responds to Samsung's attack by offering that noninfringement contention interrogatory responses are not required in this district, it nonetheless sought to meet and confer with Samsung regarding mutual supplementation of the parties' noninfringement interrogatories, it provided responses at the same level of detail as Samsung, and certain positions were unforeseeable until Samsung served its opening infringement reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   Given the uncertainty as to the requisite particularity of the responses and the lack of prejudice, I will not strike these theories on procedural grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   <strong>\n    4. For Huawei Asserted Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   Samsung's Interrogatory No. 35 asked Huawei to describe any \"design-around alternatives\" to Huawei's asserted patents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. O at 2. Three weeks after the close of discovery, Huawei responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-399\">\n   there were no alternative proposals that solved the problems solved by Huawei's inventions. Any alternatives either failed to solve the same problems, or failed to provide an efficient solution like Huawei's inventions. Due to their superiority as compared to available alternatives, Huawei's inventions were adopted into the LTE standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-400\">\n   Ex. P at 22. Huawei did not identify any specific design-around alternatives, but referred to its response to Interrogatory No. 20, which mentions alternatives for the '613 and '587 patents. Ex. Q at 18-19, 22-23, 25-26. Samsung argues that Huawei's opening expert reports identify several previously undisclosed purported noninfringing alternatives for each of Huawei's patents-in-suit. But that is not what the reports identify. To the contrary, they opine on why certain technologies could not serve as a feasible alternative to Huawei's patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. R \u00b6\u00b6 537-45 ( '239 patent); Ex. S at \u00b6\u00b6 481-500 ( '892 patent); Ex. T at \u00b6\u00b6 296-309 ( '587 patent); Ex. U at \u00b6\u00b6 279-84 ( '613 patent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   Huawei asserts that it could not have known that its responses were inadequate given the parties' agreement, and therefore had no duty to supplement. To the extent that Samsung contends that Huawei's responses were inadequate, it should have moved to compel supplemental responses rather than seeking to strike portions of the expert reports at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Huawei's Omission of Priority Dates for the '587 and '892 patents in its Opening Expert Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   Huawei's opening expert reports offering opinions on alleged infringement of the '587 and '892 patents failed to mention any priority date for either patent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. S at ii-iii; Ex. T at ii-v, but the rebuttal reports included specific priority dates,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. V \u00b6\u00b6 62-65; Ex. W \u00b6\u00b6 59-77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   Huawei responds that its infringement contentions on October 25, 2016 identified December 3, 2009, the date of the original Chinese application, as the priority date for the '587 patent, and identified April 30, 2007, the date of the original Chinese application, as the priority date for the '892 patent. Given this disclosure, which Samsung does not directly address, I fail to see any basis for concluding that Huawei \"needed to include\" this evidence in its opening reports, thereby justifying striking its rebuttal expert reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Huawei's Undisclosed DOE Theory for the '239 patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   Samsung contends that Huawei did not invoke a DOE theory in its infringement contentions served for the '239 patent, and it made no attempt to amend. But Huawei's opening expert report on infringement of the '239 patent includes the opinion that \"u+1\" is equivalent to the \"group number K\" from the asserted claims under the DOE. Ex. R at \u00b6\u00b6 254, 271, 282, 318, 338, 370. Samsung seeks to strike these opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-407\">\n   Huawei argues that the claims \"do not require receiving the 'group number k' directly from the network and can cover receiving precursors and calculating the group number.\" Opp'n at 4. From this premise, it insists that Samsung ( [redacted] ) literally infringes. According to Huawei, Samsung's interrogatory responses on noninfringement of the '239 patent stated that \"Huawei impermissibly redefines the group number 'k' to be 'u + 1' in the standard - but of course 'u + 1' is not the group number.\" Yang Decl., Ex. 3 at 243.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   But it did not disclose Samsung's current theory that \"obtaining\" cannot include calculating. This theory was first presented in Dr. Madisetti's rebuttal noninfringement report. Madisetti '239 NonInf. Report \u00b6\u00b6 64-68 (Yang Decl., Ex. 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-408\">\n   It further contends that Samsung has not been prejudiced as evidenced by its full response to the DOE theory in Madisetti's rebuttal report and opportunity to depose Dr. Veeravalli about any statements in his opening report. Samsung counters that Huawei could have sought leave to amend its infringement contentions to include its DOE theory if it was \"truly ... blindsided by Samsung's noninfringement argument[,]\" and could have brought a motion to strike portions of Madisetti's report if it thought the theory was not adequately disclosed. Reply at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-409\">\n   Both sides have failed here. Huawei should have sought leave to amend its infringement contentions when it realized that it would offer evidence under a DOE theory of infringement. On the other hand, its initial infringement contentions inform Samsung of the substance of its DOE argument-that it contends that the group number k equals \"u+1[.]\" I see no reason to apply an overly formalistic approach to the rules to strike these portions of Dr. Veeravalli's report, given that they are not really \"new infringement theories\" but simply have a \"new\" label.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verinata Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204100638\">\n    2014 WL 4100638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (\"Given the purpose behind [these] disclosure requirements, a party may not use an expert report to introduce new infringement theories....\"). In determining whether to strike portions of expert reports for failure to comply with the patent local rules, I assess whether striking will result in litigation that is more fair, or less.\n   <em>\n    Apple\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202499929\">\n    2012 WL 2499929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Samsung was aware of the underlying theory of infringement since Huawei's initial contentions (although not labeled as \"DOE\"), including the particular limitation that the group number k is equal to \"u+1\" and fully responded to the arguments in Dr. Madisetti's rebuttal report, so I will not strike these paragraphs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-410\">\n   This brings me to Samsung's failure, which is not truly at issue in this motion since Huawei has not separately moved to strike any portion of Dr. Madisetti's report. As Samsung points out, Huawei moved to exclude Dr. Madisetti's opinions on the \"obtaining ... a group number k\" limitation based on claim construction arguments, but it did not separately move to strike those opinions based on failure to comply with the local rules. This does not absolve Samsung of the same responsibility to abide by the patent local rules. It should have amended its interrogatory response to include its theory that it does not infringe because \"obtaining\" cannot include calculating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-411\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. MOTIONS TO SEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-412\">\n   In conjunction with the briefing on these motions, the parties have asked to seal an inordinate amount of information. This is a court of public record and the parties must have a compelling reason to justify concealing information from the public. This case is proceeding to trial and I expect much of the information the parties currently seek to seal will by necessity - given the information's centrality to the parties' arguments - be discussed during trial. I will not seal, or close the courtroom, when information central to the parties' arguments in this case is being discussed before the jury unless the parties demonstrate the most compelling of reasons and show through persons with direct knowledge why significant harm\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   occur if the information became public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-413\">\n   For current purposes, the parties must re-review each of the documents and pieces of information they believe should remain under seal under the compelling justifications standard. They must then submit one, joint chart identifying by specific docket and sub-docket number (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF Dkt. No. 384-2) and then by page/line\n   or paragraph number the specific, narrowly tailored information they seek to seal. For each piece of information to be sealed, the chart shall identify the specific portion of a declaration, by docket number and then page/line or paragraph number, where a person with knowledge has demonstrated compelling reasons for sealing that specific piece of information, including the harm that would be caused if the information were publicly disclosed.

No. and sub-number - docket numbers that can be wholly unsealed because no party currently believes the information should remain under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   This joint chart and any supplemental declarations in support, shall be filed within twenty (20) days of the date of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   When deciding what information the parties believe should remain under seal, they should adhere the following guidance:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   Percentages of royalties sought or secured in negotiations or resulting licensing agreements may remain under seal at this juncture, if those terms are not otherwise publicly known. This includes references to the identities of third-parties to those agreements, assuming the existence of the agreement itself is not otherwise publicly known.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   No other provisions of proposed or secured licensing agreements shall be sealed, unless a person with knowledge explains why specific provisions are so unique to that agreement that disclosure would cause significant harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   Descriptions of confidential functions of accused products, including references to the contents of source code are sealable, if those functions or portions of source code are not otherwise obvious, expected, or publicly known.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   Expert and percipient witness discussions of how the patents function or the alleged prior art are not sealable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   Information disclosed during open court, in particular during the hearing on these pending motions, shall not be sealed.
