The government, however, has not argued procedural default; it has argued the merits of the petitioner's ineffective assistance claims. And given that the petitioner asserts the reason he didn't raise these four issues on appeal was because his counsel ineffectively failed to raised them, a finding in his favor might constitute cause for the default. Accordingly, the following analysis does not analyze procedural default, or cause; the court directly analyzes the merits of the petitioner's Sixth Amendment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The petitioner alleges that his appellate counsel should have raised four arguments on appeal. The government correctly notes that it is difficult to pin down the exact nature of the four arguments, because of the voluminous and rambling nature of the petitioner's arguments. The government characterized the four arguments as best it could, and as far as the court can tell, those characterizations appear correct. Below, however, the court provides its own characterizations of the arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   a. Argument Number One: Collateral Estoppel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The heading of the petitioner's first argument, pared down, says that appellate counsel failed to raised issues of \"judicial bar under collateral estoppel\" that the dismissal of the 12-cr-253 case raised in the 13-cr-231 case. Dkt. No. 1 at 52. In the text under that heading, the petitioner mentions \"double jeopardy's offshoot of collateral estoppel,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675919\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/847/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675919\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/847/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and says that \"[a] collateral estoppel claim is grounds for an immediate appeal, applying if a defendant's claim that a prior jeopardy attaching proceeding-where an issue of ultimate fact was determined in the defendant's favor-was impermissibly adopted and reapplied in the instant proceeding, then Double Jeopardy Clause would foreclose the prosecution,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 54. But for the most part, he repeats that his appellate counsel should have raised a \"collateral estoppel\" claim. Despite the length of the petition, he does not lay out the law on collateral estoppel, and he doesn't say what action in 12-cr-253 estopped what action in 13-cr-231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In his brief, the petitioner cites numerous cases involving double jeopardy and collateral estoppel. Dkt. No. 2 at 4-11. On page 12, he gets to the heart of the matter; he argues that once 12-cr-253 \"[was] determined [in favor of Dobek] by a valid final judgement [ (the 12-CR-253 dismissal) ],\" it couldn't be litigated \"between the same parties in any future [ ] [prosecution] ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (brackets and parentheses in the original). It appears that the petitioner is saying that his appellate lawyer should have invoked the collateral estoppel doctrine to argue that Judge Stadtmueller's order dismissing 12-cr-253 constituted a final decision on the merits, and that the statute of limitations barred the government from re-charging him with the December 29, 2007 conduct. This argument, the petitioner believes, would have convinced the Seventh Circuit to invalidate his conviction in 13-cr-231. And because the lawyer who represented him on appeal also\n   represented him in both 12-cr-253 and 13-cr-231, the petitioner thinks that this issue should have been obvious to his lawyer. Dkt. No. 1 at 65-66. Finally, he argues that this \"collateral estoppel\" argument was stronger than any of the three claims his lawyer raised on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The doctrine of collateral estoppel holds that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   a judge's ruling on an issue of law or fact in one proceeding binds in a subsequent proceeding the party against whom the judge had ruled, provided that the ruling could have been (or was, but unsuccessfully) challenged on appeal, or if not that at least it was solid, reliable, and final rather than \"intended to be tentative.\"\n   <em>\n    Lummus Co. v.

In recounting the history of the case, he said, \"We begin by taking a look at the two charges embodied in the indictment, the first of which relates to conduct that occurred back in 2007, now soon to be six years ago.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513756\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/270/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513756\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/270/#p280\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Dkt. No. 27 at p. 5. He criticized the fact that although investigative authorities appeared to have been involved in the case since late spring 2010, they had not determined \"whether or not the subject matter of this prosecution were or were not licensable in the context of a criminal prosecution,\" but he said nothing about the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6. No one-not Judge Stadtmueller, not the prosecutor, not the defense attorney-mentioned the statute of limitations at this hearing. The only \"rulings\" the judge made at this October 15, 2012 hearing were his ruling denying the government's motion to adjourn the trial, and his\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   (made on his own initiative, without anyone asking him to) ruling dismissing the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Judge Stadtmueller gave the government approximately three hours and thirteen minutes (from the end of the hearing at 8:47 a.m. until noon) to file a brief explaining why the dismissal should be without prejudice. The government met that deadline; it filed a pleading entitled \"Motion Requesting that Any Possible Dismissal Be Without Prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Dkt. No. 26. This motion did not ask the court to rule on whether the statute of limitations would bar re-indictment of the December 29, 2007 conduct. It asked the court only to order that its earlier dismissal of the case be without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In making that request, the government analyzed the three factors the Speedy Trial Act requires judges to consider when deciding whether to dismiss a case with or without prejudice for a violation of that statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. The last of those three factors is \"the impact of re-prosecution on the administration of the Speedy Trial Act and on the administration of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In arguing that that factor weighed in favor of dismissal without prejudice, the government said, \"[b]y virtue of dismissing the indictment, the government will no longer be able to prosecute the defendant for the conduct alleged in Count One, as the statute of limitations has now expired.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. The government did not\n   <em>\n    ask\n   </em>\n   Judge Stadtmueller to decide whether the statute of limitations had expired; it\n   <em>\n    assumed\n   </em>\n   (wrongly) that the limitations period had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The defense also filed a motion; it asked the court to dismiss the case with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Dkt. No. 29. This motion did not ask the court to rule that the statute of limitations barred re-indictment on the December 29, 2007 conduct; it did not mention the statute of limitations at all. It asked only that the court dismiss the 2012 case with prejudice based on Speedy Trial Act considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Judge Stadtmueller issued his decision on October 21, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Dkt. No. 31. The words \"statute of limitations\" appear for the first time in this order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. After a three-page recitation of the history of the government's investigation, Judge Stadtmueller said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   All of this begs the question: if the U.S. Attorney's Office in this district was not adequately prepared to follow through with making discovery available at the time of the arraignment,\n   <em>\n    even after having over eight months to prepare\n   </em>\n   , then why did they even present the charge to the grand jury so much earlier? The answer, of course, lies in the fact that the statute of limitations would have otherwise expired on the conduct charged against Mr. Dobek in Count One of the underlying indictment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   That fact, in itself, also begs the question of why the U.S. Attorney did not bring the charges against Mr. Dobek in a more timely fashion so as to avoid any issues with the statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4 (emphasis in the original). Judge Stadtmueller went on with his critique of the government's investigation from there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Some fifteen pages later, Judge Stadtmueller considered the third factor of the Speedy Trial Act's \"with or without prejudice\" test-the impact of the dismissal on the administration of justice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Judge Stadtmueller acknowledged that even a dismissal without prejudice was not a \"toothless\" sanction, particularly \"here, where one of the charges against Mr. Dobek has essentially been with prejudice, because the U.S. Attorney will not have the ability to re-file it against him, as it now stands barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Stadtmueller observed, \"This is a very serious sanction, in and of itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The conclusion of the order-the part that actually \"ordered\" something-said, \"IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure together with the Court's supervisory powers, this case be and the same stands DISMISSED without prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In sum, Judge Stadtmueller made three rulings over the course of that third week of October 2013. He denied the government's motion to adjourn the trial. He\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   dismissed the case. And he granted the government's request that the dismissal be without prejudice (impliedly denying the defense request for a dismissal with prejudice). He did not rule that the statute of limitations had run on the December 29, 2007 conduct. Judge Stadtmueller's comment \"was not the resolution of a dispute[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Loera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869112\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/1025/#p1028\">\n    714 F.3d at 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   ii.\n   <strong>\n    There was no \"final\" ruling.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Even if one could construe Judge Stadtmueller's assumption that the statute of limitations had run on the December 29, 2007 conduct as a \"ruling,\" it was not \"final.\" In\n   <em>\n    Loera\n   </em>\n   , Judge Posner described a \"final\" order or ruling as one that \"could have been (or was, but unsuccessfully) challenged on appeal, or if not that at least it was solid, reliable, and final rather than 'intended to be tentative.' \"\n   <em>\n    Loera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869112\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/1025/#p1028\">\n    714 F.3d at 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ill. 1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Judge Stadtmueller ordered the dismissal of the indictment without prejudice in October 2013. Less than a year later, on September 8, 2014, the Seventh Circuit held that \"dismissal of the indictment without prejudice was not a final order\" in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200523\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/722/#p734\">\n    766 F.3d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734 (7th Cir. 2014),\n   <em>\n    rev'd en banc\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277252\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/712/\">\n    793 F.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2015). While the court later reversed that ruling in an\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   decision, it appears that at the time Judge Stadtmueller dismissed the petitioner's 2012 case, his order would not have been considered a final, appealable order under Seventh Circuit law. If the order dismissing the indictment without prejudice was not subject to appeal, then comments that the judge made in reaching that decision were not subject to appeal. The government had no way to appeal Judge Stadtmueller's assumption that the statute of limitations had run on the December 29, 2007 conduct-at least not in the 2012 case. And again, Judge Stadtmueller did not\n   <em>\n    rule\n   </em>\n   that the limitations period had expired.

He argued that Judge Stadtmueller had \"seized\" on the \"assurance\" by the government that \"consequences had been sustained in that one of the counts was dismissed per the statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277252\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/712/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He speculated that \"[t]his representation by the government may very well have convinced the Court to dismiss the indictment without prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277252\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/712/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The petitioner argued that Count Two of the 2013 indictment charged \"the same exact conduct\" that the government \"had assured the Court in 12CR253 was time barred and was dismissed with prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. He stated that, in telling Judge Stadtmueller that it wouldn't be able to re-indict the petitioner for the December 29, 2007 conduct, \"[i]n effect, the government was promising the Court it would not prosecute Dobek for the activities alleged in count two of the instant indictment and count one of the indictment in 12CR253.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. He claimed that the government had \"misled\" Judge Stadtmueller into believing that he was dismissing that conduct with prejudice, and that if the government hadn't misled Judge Stadtmueller, he \"may have issued a decision dismissing both count one and count two with prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In recommending that Judge Randa deny the motion to dismiss the indictment, Judge Callahan rightly dismissed this argument out of hand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 29 at 9. He stated, \"[t]o be sure,\" the government had not\n   <em>\n    promised\n   </em>\n   that it would not re-indict the petitioner for the December 29, 2007 conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He rightly concluded that the petitioner was speculating when he posited that Judge Stadtmueller might have dismissed both counts with prejudice if he had known that the statute of limitations had not run on that conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And he pointed out that the petitioner's argument ignored Judge Stadtmueller's reliance on the presumption that dismissals should be without prejudice, and his discussion of the seriousness of the crime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Callahan rightly characterized the government's single statement that it\n   would not be able to prosecute the petitioner on the December 2007 conduct as a \"mistake.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   When the court considers the transcript of the October 2013 hearing at which Judge Stadtmueller dismissed the case, and the entire twenty-page opinion deciding that the dismissal should be without prejudice, it is clear that he did not base his decision solely on his mistaken belief that the dismissal of the December 2007 conduct was, effectively, a dismissal with prejudice. Did his mistaken belief factor into his reasoning? It did. Was it necessary to his decision to dismiss the indictment? No. And again, the \"final judgment\" here was Judge Stadtmueller's order dismissing the case without prejudice, not an order finding that the statute of limitations had run on the December 2007 conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   iv.\n   <strong>\n    The parties did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, Judge Stadtmueller's October 21, 2013 statement about the statute of limitations having expired was not the result of a full and fair hearing on that question. Neither he nor either of the parties even mentioned\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203282\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which prescribes the limitations period.

Neither party asked Judge Stadtmueller to decide whether the limitations period had run. The judge did not ask the parties to brief the issue-he asked only for their positions on whether his dismissal should be with or without prejudice. Judge Stadtmueller gave the government only three hours and thirteen minutes to file its brief on that question, and he gave the defense some five hours to craft its response. In contrast, in 13-cr-231, the parties had a full and fair opportunity to address the statute of limitations issue directly, and Judge Callahan provided a thoughtful, reasoned analysis in response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In sum, the petitioner has not met his burden of demonstrating that collateral estoppel precluded the government from indicting him in 13-cr-231. Because collateral estoppel did not bar the indictment, it would have been frivolous for the petitioner's appellate counsel to raise the issue in the Seventh Circuit when appealing his conviction in that case. The petitioner fails to state a Sixth Amendment claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   b. Argument Number Two: Interpretation of the Limitations Statutes\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The heading of the second argument in the petition refers to the two statutes Judge Callahan interpreted in concluding that the statute of limitations did not bar the 2013 indictment. Case No. 16-cv-1255, Dkt. No. 1 at p. 64.

Count One of the 12-cr-253 indictment alleged that the petitioner knowingly and willfully exported F-16 canopy seals from the United States to Venezuela on December 29, 2007. Case No. 12-cr-253 at Dkt. No. 1. Count Two of the 13-cr-231 indictment contained a similar allegation: that the petitioner knowingly\n   and willfully attempted to export F-16 canopy seals from the United States to Venezuela on December 29, 2007. Case No. 13-cr-231 at Dkt. No. 1. The petitioner had notice from December 11, 2012 that he was being accused of having committed the December 29, 2007 offense. He had notice within the five-year time limitations period mandated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203282\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The petitioner, however, doesn't argue that the government changed, or broadened, the charge relating to the December 29, 2007 conduct. Instead, he argues that the government added a new count in the 13-cr-231 indictment that it had not charged in the 2012 indictment. Count One of the 2013 indictment charged the petitioner with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, \"namely, to willfully export F-16 canopy seals\" without a license, from July 2007 through January 2009. Case No. 13-cr-231 at Dkt. No. 1. The petitioner argues that the addition of this new count \"broadened\" or \"substantially amended\" the otherwise-time-barred charge, such that he was not placed on notice of the charge he'd have to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   There is no support for this theory in\n   <em>\n    Italiano\n   </em>\n   , or in Ross, or in \u00a7 3288. The fact that the government timely charged him with an additional count does not impact whether the petitioner had sufficient notice that he'd be called to account for the December 29, 2007 conduct. If the government had changed something about the December 29, 2007 charge-perhaps charged him with exporting some other articles on that date, or charged him with exporting the canopies to a different country on that date, or charged him with committing a different statutory offense on that date-the petitioner would have a basis for his relation-back argument. Under these circumstances, he does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   This argument also ignores the fact that the defendant was aware,\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Judge Stadtmueller dismissed the 2012 indictment, that the government planned to add the conspiracy charge. In his dismissal order, Judge Stadtmueller recounted how the government had submitted a jury instruction for conspiracy ahead of the planned trial date. Case No. 12-cr-231, Dkt. No. 31 at p. 5. Judge Stadtmueller explained that he thought this was a mistake, until he learned the next day in a phone conversation with the prosecutor that \"the Government planned to re-indict Mr. Dobek on Tuesday, October 15, 2013-the day of the final pretrial conference and less than a week before trial was scheduled to commence-to add a conspiracy charge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203282\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Judge Stadtmueller went on to say that the petitioner's counsel had informed him that counsel received word of the proposed plan to add the conspiracy charge \"only moments before the parties submitted their pretrial report to the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203282\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The docket shows that the parties submitted their joint pretrial report to the court on October 10, 2013,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203282\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at dkt. no. 21, meaning that the petitioner had notice regarding a possible conspiracy charge for five days before the court dismissed the 2012 case, and over a month before the grand jury returned the 2013 indictment.

Certificate of Appealability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Under Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases (which apply in cases filed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), the court must consider whether to issue a certificate of appealability. A court may issue a certificate of appealability only if the applicant makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). The standard for making a \"substantial showing\" is whether \"reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\"\n   <em>\n    Slack v.
