Moreover, in those instances where this court has considered extra-record documents, it is because the second exception has been satisfied, i.e., HHS relied on them in making its decision. For example, while the 2010 and 2015 Tier 1 FOAs are not contained in the administrative record, clearly HHS considered them in making its decision to alter course with the 2018 Tier 1 FOA.

The County's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The County's claims can be summarized in two broad categories: (1) the 2018 Tier 1 FOA fails to follow the mandate of the 2018 CAA because it limits funding to projects that replicate elements of the SMARTool and TAC, which are not \"programs that have been proven effective through rigorous evaluation\"; and (2) the 2018 Tier 1 FOA illegally allocates a portion of Tier 1 funding to Tier 2 and augments the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education Program (\"SRAEP\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The SMARTool and TAC-Not Programs Under the 2018 CAA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The SMARTool and TAC are not programs, much less ones that have been proven effective through rigorous evaluation. The analysis begins with the language of the 2018 CAA, specifically the mandate that \"75% shall be for replicating programs that have been proven effective through rigorous evaluation to reduce teenage pregnancy, behavioral risk factors underlying teenage pregnancy, or other associated risk factors.\" Where \" 'a word is not defined by statute, [courts] normally construe it in accord with its ordinary or natural meaning' \" and \"may refer to standard English language dictionaries\" to do so.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under either definition, the SMARTool and TAC are not programs. The SMARTool is defined as \"a research-based\n   <em>\n    tool\n   </em>\n   designed to help organizations assess, select, and implement effective programs.\" ECF # 33-24, at 6 (emphasis added). The TAC, which is an acronym for\n   <em>\n    Tool\n   </em>\n   to Access the Characteristics of Effective Sex and STD/HIV Education Programs, is \"an organized set of questions designed to help\n   practitioners assess whether ... programs have incorporated the common characteristics of effective programs.\" ECF # 33-23, at 1-2 (emphasis added). A non-exhaustive list of questions, elements, or characteristics designed to help organizations assess, select, and implement programs does not constitute a plan or system under which action may be taken toward a goal. Otherwise stated, the SMARTool and the TAC are self-described tools used to select effective programs; as such, they are not effective programs in and of themselves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Moreover, the 2018 Tier 1 FOA requires applicants to \"replicate each of the elements\" of the SMARTool or TAC. AR000043. An element is only a \"part\" or \"component\" of the whole.\n   <em>\n    See Element\n   </em>\n   , DICTIONARY.COM, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/element?s=t (last visited Aug. 28, 2018) (\"a component or constituent of a whole or one of the parts into which a whole may be resolved by analysis\"). Adopting defendants' approach would be directly at odds with the mandate of the 2018 CAA, which requires that whole programs-not merely elements-be replicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   HHS also ignores the qualifier that the programs must be \"proven effective by rigorous evaluation.\" Defendants have offered no evidence that any program has ever been developed using the SMARTool or the TAC, let alone that such a program has been evaluated or resulted in a study demonstrating evidence of effectiveness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the 2018 Tier 1 FOA allows \"[a]pplicants [to] choose\n   <em>\n    any curriculum\n   </em>\n   as long as it incorporates all of the evidence-based elements of either the\" SMARTool or TAC. ECF # 33-22, at 3 (emphasis added). As the County aptly notes, this means that \"all projects incorporating these elements,\n   <em>\n    however cobbled together\n   </em>\n   , will necessarily\" be eligible for funding. ECF # 58, at 16 (quotations and brackets omitted) (emphasis added). Moreover, as the County importantly observes, \"[n]othing in the new FOA prevents Defendants from funding programs that have already been proven\n   <em>\n    ineffective\n   </em>\n   , provided they echo the elements in the TAC or the SMARTool.\" ECF # 58, at 19 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The County contends that additional scoring criteria contained in the 2018 Tier 1 FOA is similarly problematic. The 2018 Tier 1 FOA states that points may be awarded for weaving the goal of optimal health into every component of the project, clearly communicating that teen sex is a risk behavior, providing skills to avoid risk, and providing cessation support. AR000090-91 (\"Project Expectations and Priorities\"). However, nothing in the record indicates that fulfilling these requirements has ever resulted in a program proven effective through rigorous evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In sum, \"an agency is not free simply to disregard statutory responsibilities....\"\n   <em>\n    Lincoln\n   </em>\n   , 508 U.S. at 193,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12066\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/182/#p191\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Impermissible Use of 75% Allocation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The County also contends that the 2018 Tier 1 FOA improperly transfers a portion of the 75% that is earmarked for replicating programs toward the 25% of funds dedicated to \"research and demonstration grants to develop, replicate, refine, and test additional models and innovative strategies for preventing teenage pregnancy,\" i.e., from Tier 1 grants to Tier 2 grants. Indeed, the 2018 Tier 1 FOA contains language indicating that the funds will not be used solely for replicating programs. For instance, the 2018 Tier 1 FOA states that \"[t]he purpose of this funding opportunity is to fund\n   <em>\n    the evaluation of replication strategies\n   </em>\n   that focus on protective factors.\" AR000048 (emphasis added). Clearly, evaluating replication strategies is distinguishable from replicating programs themselves. Elsewhere, the 2018 Tier 1 FOA requires applicants to provide \"a\n   <em>\n    proposal\n   </em>\n   for rigorous evaluation and testing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 19 (emphasis added). However, there would be no need to submit a proposal to rigorously evaluate and test programs if they have already been \"proven effective through rigorous evaluation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Moreover, as the County accurately observes, \"the stated purpose of the 2018 Tier 1 FOAs is identical to that of the 2018 Tier 2 FOA, save for the deletion of the word 'replication.' \" ECF # 29, at 21. Indeed, the stated purpose of the 2018 Tier 2 FOA is \"to fund the evaluation of strategies that focus on protective factors shown to prevent teen pregnancy, improve adolescent health and address youth sexual risk holistically,\" while the purpose of the 2018 Tier 1 FOA is \"to fund the evaluation of replication strategies that focus on protective factors shown to prevent teen pregnancy, improve adolescent health, and address youth sexual risk holistically.\" AR000048, 000139. Because the 2018 Tier 1 FOA is not limited to replicating programs proven effective through rigorous evaluation and instead directs funds towards Tier 2 research and evaluation efforts, it violates the 2018 CAA, the Purpose Statute, and the Appropriations Clause. The 2018 Tier 1 FOA further violates the 2018 CAA in that it allows for misappropriation in excess of this transfer limit. 2018 CAA, 132 Stat. at 736.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendants contend that the 2018 Tier 1 FOA contains language that is no different from \"similar requirements\" contained in the 2010 and 2015 FOAs. ECF # 42, at 23. For example, the 2010 Tier 1 FOA states that \"OAH plans for a mixture of evaluation strategies to address the question of whether replications of evidence-based programs are effective\" and that \"all grantees will be expected to monitor and report on program implementation and outcomes through performance measures.\" 2010 Tier 1 FOA, ECF # 33-3, at 11. Defendants misconstrue the nature of the 2010 Tier 1 FOA requirements, as they do not conflict with the appropriation's mandate to replicate programs proven effective through rigorous evaluation. The 2010 Tier 1 FOA merely informed applicants that their performance would be evaluated in terms of whether their replications of evidence-based programs were effective. Whether the replication of a program was effective is a different inquiry than whether a program has previously been proven effective through rigorous evaluation. Here, as discussed at length above, requiring applicants to choose from elements of a \"sexual risk reduction\" or a \"sexual risk avoidance\" approach, when no such program has ever existed or been implemented before, necessarily conflicts with the appropriation's mandate that Tier 1 funds \"shall be for replicating programs that\n   have been proven effective through rigorous evaluation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The County also argues, but this time to no avail, that the 2018 Tier 1 FOA repurposes the Tier 1 appropriation to expand the funding pool for SRA grants under the SRAEP. ECF # 29, at 21-22; ECF # 58, at 20. In addition to appropriating funds to Tier 1 and Tier 2 grants, the 2018 CAA contains a separate provision appropriating $25 million \"for making competitive grants which exclusively implement education in sexual risk avoidance (defined as voluntarily refraining from non-marital sexual activity).\" 2018 CAA, 132 Stat. at 733.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The County contends that because the 2018 Tier 1 FOA requires that projects \"clearly communicate risk,\" \"provid[e] skills to avoid sexual risk,\" and incorporate messages of \"optimal health\" and \"cessation support,\" the 2018 Tier 1 FOA unlawfully transfers funds from Tier 1 to SRA education programs. ECF # 58, at 20; AR000045-16. However, as the 2018 CAA's Tier 1 and SRA appropriations are not mutually exclusive, the 2018 Tier 1 FOA does not violate the Purpose statute as the County contends. The 2018 CAA requires Tier 1 funds be used to \"replicate programs proven effective through rigorous evaluation to reduce teenage pregnancy, behavioral risk factors underlying teenage pregnancy, or other associated risk factors.\" Other than that, it does not mandate specific subject matter. That this argument fails, however, does nothing to save the 2018 Tier 1 FOA as it is unlawful for the many other reasons discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Counts Two and Three\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Counts Two and Three also allege APA violations. In Count Two, the County contends that the 2018 Tier 1 FOA is arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion for three reasons: (1) defendants did not provide a reasoned explanation for the changes to the criteria in the 2018 Tier 1 FOA and for the FOA's departure from the statute and past agency practice; (2) the criteria in the 2018 Tier 1 FOA run counter to the evidence before the agency; and (3) defendants prejudged the 2018 TPP Program competition with an unalterably closed mind and designed the 2018 Tier 1 FOA as a pretext for ending the TPP Program based on preconceived ideological animus. ECF # 28, \u00b6\u00b6 107-110; ECF # 29, at 27. In Count Three, the County contends that the 2018 Tier 1 FOA is contrary to an HHS regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2087.3\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 87.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (l), which provides that \"[d]ecisions about awards of Federal financial assistance must be free from political interference or even the appearance of such interference and must be made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of the religious affiliation, or lack thereof, of a recipient organization.\" ECF # 28, \u00b6 113. The County argues that \"[s]ince at least February 2017, Defendants have engaged in impermissible political interference in multiple aspects of the administration of TPP Program grants, including but not limited to the cancellation of the 2015 TPP Program grants and the drafting and administration of the 2018 Tier 1 FOA.\" ECF # 28, \u00b6 114.

Defendants argue they have acted within the broad scope of the 2018 CAA to reassess the TPP Program and issue new funding criteria, ECF # 42, at 25, but that is clearly not the case for the reasons discussed above.
