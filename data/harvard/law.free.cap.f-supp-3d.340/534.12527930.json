The defendant employers have moved to compel arbitration under the terms of an employment contract. Some five years ago, Judge Schiller of this Court faced a similar case and wrote an eloquent opinion enforcing the contract, while expressing his misgivings about the result he was compelled to reach.\n   <em>\n    Porreca v. Rose Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206498392\">\n    2013 WL 6498392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. Dec. 11, 2013). Like Judge Schiller, I am also bound to order that this case proceed to arbitration. But since his decision was issued, there has been increasing scholarly research into the adequacy and fairness of arbitration as the primary mechanism for enforcing federal laws governing the workplace. Although consideration of that growing body of literature is ultimately the province of higher courts and Congress, I conclude this opinion with a review that underscores why there is legitimate cause for concern when a parallel system of dispute resolution supplants the courts as the primary means of enforcing the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

But Plaintiff's career path stalled after a male supervisor repeatedly harassed her, touching Plaintiff inappropriately and prying into her sexual orientation and marital status.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8-9.

JAMS' own rules and procedures governing employment arbitration provide several avenues for assessing and challenging potential conflicts and bias.

But Plaintiff contends that her ability to fairly present her claims is limited by JAMS rules that limit discovery to\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   one (1) deposition and an exchange of documents. Plaintiff fails to attribute proper significance to the phrase \"at least.\" Plaintiff gets \"at least\" one deposition but quite possibly more.

If it is true that Plaintiff needs to take multiple depositions to fairly present her claims, I see no reason why the discretionary authority vested in arbitrators per JAMS' rules insufficiently meets her need. Although it is true that JAMS rules do not provide for interrogatories, as Plaintiff laments, she has not shown or even alleged that she needs the interrogatory procedure to fairly present her claim. Rule 17(a) mandates an informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216237\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/20/#p30\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (outlining that the parties \"shall complete an exchange of all relevant, non-privileged documents, including, without limitation, copies of all documents in their possession or control on which they rely in support of their positions, names of individuals whom they may call as witnesses at the Arbitration Hearing and names of all experts who may be called to testify at the Arbitration Hearing....\").

I have looked carefully through the agreement and dispose of the other potentially problematic provisions as follows: (1) What appears to be a restriction on the arbitrator's ability to award attorney's fees is simply a provision articulating that the arbitrator may not award fees unless authorized by law: \"The Arbitrator will not have the authority to award attorneys' fees unless a statute or contract at issue in the dispute authorizes the award of attorneys' fees to the applicable prevailing party, in which case the Arbitrator shall have the authority to make an award of attorneys' fees to the full extent permitted by applicable law.\" Defs.' Mot. Dismiss Ex. B. (2) Requiring Plaintiff to otherwise pay her own attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses does not render the arbitration agreement unconscionable, as the same would be true in court but for statutory authorization. (3) The JAMS arbitral forum does not curb Plaintiff's rights to damages or other relief.

It cautioned that \"[t]he private arbitral system differs in critical ways from the public judicial forum and, when imposed as a condition of employment, it is structurally biased against applicants and employees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20N.C.%20L.%20Rev.%20679\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The EEOC also \"believes that ... [a]though binding arbitration does not, in and of itself, undermine the purposes of the laws enforced by the EEOC ... this is the result when it is imposed as a term or condition of employment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20N.C.%20L.%20Rev.%20679\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The EEOC concluded that such agreements harm both the individual civil rights claimant and the\n   public interest in eradicating discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20N.C.%20L.%20Rev.%20679\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In light of the growing body of empirical research and the EEOC's admonition, courts must continue to scrutinize the fairness of mandatory arbitration, especially in employment cases. To quote from Judge Schiller's eloquent analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   There is a reason that arbitration is the favored venue of many businesses for deciding employment disputes, and it is not to ensure that employees are afforded the best chance to have their claims adjudicated by a judge or jury picked from the community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Porreca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206498392\">\n    2013 WL 6498392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 11, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   It bears mention that similar concerns were raised by Chief Justice Warren Burger some twenty years earlier:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Plainly, it would not comport with the congressional objectives behind a statute seeking to enforce civil rights protected by Title VII to allow the very forces that had practiced discrimination to contract away the right to enforce civil rights in the courts. For federal courts to defer to arbitral decisions reached by the same combination of forces that had long perpetuated invidious discrimination would have made the foxes guardians of the chickens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Barrentine v.

Both JAMS and the American Arbitration Association, the other of the country's two largest arbitration firms, take seriously their responsibility to eliminate bias and conflicts. But just as the judiciary has come to recognize the challenges judges face in overcoming implicit bias on racial and ethnic grounds,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   we must consider the inherent problems presented by a for-profit system of dispute resolution that addresses important issues of federal law without the same transparency and error-correcting mechanisms as the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Around the time Judger Schiller published his opinion, a major media outlet was researching the growth of arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jessica Silver-Greenberg &amp; Michael Corkery,\n   <em>\n    In Arbitration, a 'Privatization of the Justice System\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    ' Beware the Fine Print\n   </em>\n   , N.Y. Times, Nov. 1, 2015. Research done by the press is not always conducted with the same rigor as academic research, but the ability of reporters to engage directly with participants in a system sometimes yields insights that fall outside the ken of academia. More than three dozen arbitrators, including those working for JAMS and AAA, told the\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   that \"they felt beholden to companies. Beneath every decision, the arbitrators said, was the threat of losing business.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189685\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/728/#p750\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   One arbitrator confessed that \"plaintiffs had an inherent disadvantage,\" saying, \" '[w]hy would an arbitrator cater to a person they will never see again?' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189685\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/728/#p750\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And\n   <em>\n    The Times\n   </em>\n   found that a JAMS arbitrator in an employment case had 29 cases involving the same company.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189685\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/728/#p750\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Even if individual arbitrators adhere to high standards, we ignore reality if we forget that private arbitration services are profit-making enterprises that advertise and compete for business. An arbitrator in\n   Boston explained that \"after a company complained that she had scheduled an extra hearing for a plaintiff, the arbitration firm she was working with canceled it behind her back.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189685\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/728/#p750\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At a minimum, an employer that regularly uses a single provider to resolve disputes will have superior insight into how individual arbitrators have ruled in earlier cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Like Judge Schiller, I am bound by the rulings of higher courts. \"[T]he plain language of [the Federal Arbitration Act] affords a district court no discretion to dismiss a case where one of the parties applies for a stay pending arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Lloyd v. Hovensa, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9245543\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/369/263/#p269\">\n    369 F.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269 (3d Cir. 2004). Only those courts, or Congress, can address the policy issues raised by motions such as this. But as research into the operation, outcomes, and effects of mandatory arbitration continues to accumulate, the assumptions that led the Supreme Court to embrace it will continue to be tested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I grant Defendants' motion to stay the proceedings in this Court pending the completion of arbitration and refer this dispute to arbitration per the terms of the agreement.
