SUF \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant, Pep Boys, is an automotive aftermarket retail and service provider. (Compl. \u00b6 5;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Am. SUF \u00b6 1; Resp. Am SUF \u00b6 1.) Defendant requires all of its employees to follow a Code of Conduct, which demands a high standard of respect and courtesy in customer interactions and expressly prohibits the use of intimidation and abusive language. (Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 2-4; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Defendant maintains and enforces an Equal Opportunity Policy, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, and maintains and enforces an anti-harassment policy that expressly forbids \"derogatory or offensive remarks and slurs.\" (Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6; Resp. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6.) Defendant maintains at least two incident reporting hotlines. (Am. SUF \u00b6 7; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 7.) Once an incident is reported, it is turned over to the local Human Resources manager to investigate and resolve. (Am. SUF \u00b6 8; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 8.) Defendant also encourages Area Directors and Store Managers to report all incidents of discrimination and harassment. (Am. SUF \u00b6 9; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 9.) Every two years, Defendant requires managers and associates to complete an e-learning course on workplace harassment and discrimination. (Am. SUF \u00b6 10; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 10.) Defendant requires its employees to complete other trainings, emphasizing customer care and service, including one for new employees, one conducted in-person by area managers, and trainings customized for individual employees' level of customer interaction. (Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 11-14; Resp. Am.

(Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 27; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19, 27; Ex. D, K. Pinckney Dep. 42:14-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After arriving at the North Charleston Pep Boys, Mr. Pinckney was serviced by Jason Morton, Service Manager of the store. (Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 20-22; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 20-22.) Mr. Pinckney told Mr. Morton that he needed a plug in the front right tire and Mr. Morton asked Mr. Pinckney for his contact information and the make and model of his car, which Mr. Pinckney provided. (Am. SUF \u00b6 23; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 23.) Mr. Morton also asked Mr. Pinckney to pull his car up to Service Bay One. (Am. SUF \u00b6 24; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 24.) After Mr. Pinckney pulled his car\n   <em>\n    into\n   </em>\n   , rather than\n   <em>\n    up to\n   </em>\n   , Bay One, Mr. Morton allegedly\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   said to Mr. Pinckney \"You people don't listen.\" (Am. SUF \u00b6 25; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 25.) Shortly thereafter, Mr. Pinckney gave his keys to Mr. Morton, who placed them in an envelope and indicated he would notify Mr. Pinckney when the car was ready. (Am. SUF \u00b6 26; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 26.) Mr. Pinckney then walked to his wife's place of work, approximately two minutes away. (Am. SUF \u00b6 27; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. and Mrs. Pinckney returned to Pep Boys that evening around 7:00 p.m., at which time Mr. Morton allegedly stated \"Oh, it's you again.\" (Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 28-29; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.) At that time, Mr. Morton directed the service technician,\n   Scott Wurscher, to examine the Pinckney's car tire. (Am. SUF \u00b6 30; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 30.) The Pinckneys observed their car on the lift in Service Bay One. (Am. SUF \u00b6 31; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Wurscher testified that he examined the tire and found it was punctured, such that it could not be inflated because air would rush out as fast as it could be pumped in. (Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 32,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   37.) He also testified he noticed both front tires were low on tread so he recommended replacing the two front tires. (Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) Mr. Morton told Mr. and Mrs. Pinckney they needed\n   <em>\n    four\n   </em>\n   new tires. (Am. SUF \u00b6 41; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 41.) Mrs. Pinckney replied they weren't there for new tires, to which Mr. Morton allegedly responded \"I don't need any f* * *ing attitude,\" and \"I'm not doing sh*t for you n* * *ers.\" (Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 42, 43; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 42, 43.) Mr. Morton allegedly further stated to Mr. Pinckney: \"You got your girl in here b*tching at me about tires,\" and then repeated \"I'm not doing sh*t for you n* * *ers.\" (Am. SUF \u00b6 44; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 44.) Mr. Morton then allegedly told Mr. Wurscher to \"drop [the car] and get [that] sh* * out of here.\" (Am. SUF \u00b6 43; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Wurscher testified that Mr. Morton told him to fill the tire with air, so he put a plug in the tire before doing so, since it would not otherwise hold air. (Am. SUF \u00b6 35-37.) Mr. Wurscher lowered the Pinckneys' car and drove it out of the service bay. (Am. SUF \u00b6 39; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 39). He testified his work took about two minutes. (Am. SUF \u00b6 40; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Inside, Mrs. Pinckney spoke to a woman and a man in the retail area and asked for the Pep Boys' complaint hotline phone number, so she could file a complaint against Mr. Morton. (Am. SUF \u00b6 45; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 45.) Thereafter, Mr. and Mrs. Pinckney got in their car and left Pep Boys. (Am. SUF \u00b6 46; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 46.) They were able to drive home safely. (Am. SUF \u00b6 46; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 46.) Plaintiffs never paid for any service from Pep Boys on June 9, 2016. (Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 58; Def.'s Resp. Pls.' Additional Disputed Material Facts \u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Approximately one week later, Mrs. Pinckney told her coworker that Pep Boys repaired the tire. (Am. SUF \u00b6 58; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 58.) On July 24, 2016, forty-five days later, the Pinckneys replaced the two front tires. (Am. SUF \u00b6 49; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 49.) Mr. Pinckney had to put air in the tire at least once during that forty-five-day time period, though he could not recall when. (Am. SUF \u00b6 48; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Hotline Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Later in the evening of June 9, 2016, after the Pinckneys left Pep Boys, Mrs. Pinckney called the hotline to report the Pickneys' encounter with Mr. Morton. (Am. SUF \u00b6 50; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 50.) The complaint was forwarded to Pep Boys' Area Director Shane Helton. (Am. SUF \u00b6 51; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 51.) Mr. Helton and Mrs. Pinckney exchanged voicemails until June 15, 2016 but were never able to personally\n   speak to one another. (Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 52-54; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 52-54.) After three days of inactivity, Pep Boys closed Mrs. Pinckney's complaint on June 18, 2016. (Am. SUF \u00b6 55; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 55.) Mr. and Mrs. Pinckney both testified Mr. Morton was the only person at Pep Boys who treated them differently because of their race. (Am. SUF \u00b6 56; Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 56.) At some point, Mr. Morton accessed Pep Boys' electronic complaint filing system and falsely accused the Pinckneys of threatening to kill him. (Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Therefore, in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-movant must establish that the disputes are both (1) material, meaning concerning facts that will affect the outcome of the issue under substantive law; and (2) genuine, meaning the evidence must be such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

(Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 3, ECF No. 33-1.) Second, Defendant argues Summary Judgment should be granted on Plaintiffs' 43 P.S. \u00a7 955 PHRA Claim because Plaintiffs withdrew that claim. (Def.'s Mot.

Am. SUF that Mr. Wurscher's statements are disputed but, in explaining further, they affirm that Defendant's recitation of Mr. Wurscher's testimony is accurate. (Resp. Am. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 32-36 and 38.) Because Plaintiffs' Motion for Sanctions (ECF No. 37), which included a request to strike the deposition testimony of Scott Wurscher, was denied (ECF No. 45), and because this Court finds the statements contained in paragraphs 32-36 and 38 of Defendant's Am. SUF are consistent with the transcript of Mr. Wurscher's deposition (Def.'s Ex. E), paragraphs 32-36 and 38 of Defendant's Am.
