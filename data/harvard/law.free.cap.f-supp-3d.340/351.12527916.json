PAULEY III, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Mansoor Hamoud Hadwan seeks leave to conduct discovery and supplement the administrative record in this mandamus action. (ECF No. 30) Hadwan challenges the United States Department of State's decision to revoke his U.S. passport and U.S. Consular Report of Birth Abroad (\"CRBA\"), and its denial of his application for a direct return passport permitting him to attend a revocation hearing. For the reasons that follow, Hadwan's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action arises from the State Department's revocation of Hadwan's U.S. passport and CRBA. In June 2013, Hadwan traveled to the United States Embassy in Sana'a, Yemen to apply for immigration benefits on behalf of his family. (Am. Pet., ECF No. 22 (\"Pet.\"), \u00b6 12.) At that time, Embassy officials confiscated his passport and CRBA. (Pet. \u00b6 13.) Despite his inability to speak or write English, Hadwan alleges that Embassy officials conditioned the return of his passport and CRBA on his completion of a number of forms. (Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.) Hadwan executed the forms on the belief that doing so would facilitate the return of his passport and CRBA. (Pet. \u00b6 17.) After doing so, Hadwan claims he was told that the documents would be sent to him. (Pet. \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   However, in March 2014, Embassy officials informed Hadwan that his passport and CRBA had been revoked. (Pet. \u00b6 23; Administrative Record, ECF No. 19 (\"Record\"), at US 0003.) According to Hadwan-and\n   unbeknownst to him at the time-the forms he executed included admissions that his biological father was not a U.S. citizen and that he had lied on his passport and CRBA applications. (Record at US 0003; Pet. \u00b6 17.) Hadwan claims these statements were coerced and that he did not understand what he was signing. (Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, 24.) Hadwan retained an attorney and challenged the revocation of his citizenship documents. (Pet. \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August 2014, the State Department convened a revocation hearing, but Hadwan failed to appear because he was denied a one-time passport to attend that hearing. (Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 26-29.) Hadwan's attorney appeared on his behalf, arguing that Hadwan did not sign the form voluntarily and questioning why anyone would go to the Embassy solely to admit to a fraud. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record at US 0094-114.) The Government countered that the statement was voluntary and noted that the document stated that it \"was read to me in Arabic and I understood the contents completely.\" (Record at US 0109-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2015, the State Department hearing officer found that Hadwan understood the documents he was asked to sign because his sworn statement said so. (Record at US 0133-34.) Accordingly, the State Department found that Hadwan admitted to supplying false information in his passport and CRBA applications and affirmed their revocation. (Record at US 0133-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Based on the revocation of these citizenship documents, Hadwan commenced this action under the Mandamus Act and the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hadwan seeks to supplement the administrative record with extra-record evidence-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , evidence outside of or in addition to the administrative record-concerning \"the implementation of the State Department's proxy denaturalization program and consulate decisions ... specific to [ ] Hadwan ....\" (Hadwan's Ltr. dated Dec. 22, 2017, ECF No. 30 (\"Mot.\"), at 6.) Hadwan contends that the administrative record is \"devoid of any record of how and why the Department of State decided that Mr. Hadwan was not who he purported to be.\" (Mot. at 3.) Moreover, Hadwan argues that the administrative record \"fails to establish the policies and procedures of the proxy denaturalization program,\" and omits the \"illegal and coercive interrogation of [ ] Hadwan [by] agency employees\" and the \"multiple interviews conducted pri[o]r to the coercion of [Hadwan's] statement.\" (Mot. at 3.) In sum, Hadwan seeks discovery regarding his claim that the State Department routinely strips passports from American citizens in Yemen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Government counters that Hadwan has not \"made a 'strong showing' or demonstrated a particularized need for the extra-record discovery ..., nor has he demonstrated the existence of any of the narrow and rare circumstances under which discovery may be appropriate against the government in an APA review case.\" (Gov't Ltr. dated Jan. 4, 2018, ECF No. 31 (\"Opp.\"), at 3.) The Government argues that in making his discovery request, Hadwan \"merely speculates as to the existence of other materials on which the agency relied in making the administrative determination but which are not included in the administrative record.\" (Opp. at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 14, 2018, Hadwan supplemented his letter motion. (Hadwan's Ltr. dated Feb. 14, 2018, ECF No. 33 (\"Supp. Mot.\").) Hadwan now argues that because his attorneys received documents from the administrative record of another U.S. citizen whose passport was revoked at the\n   Embassy in Sana'a under similar circumstances, those documents must also have been relied on by the State Department in Hadwan's case. (Supp. Mot. at 1.) Hadwan bases his argument on a records certification in\n   <em>\n    Ali v. Pompeo\n   </em>\n   , 16-cv-03691 (E.D.N.Y.), which purportedly reveals that certain documents not in Hadwan's Administrative Record are routinely relied on by the State Department in these types of proceedings. (Supp. Mot. at 1.) The Government counters that Hadwan has failed to demonstrate that the same documents were considered by State Department decision makers here. (Gov't Ltr. dated June 13, 2018, ECF No. 39 (\"Supp. Opp.\"), at 1.) The Government also points out that the records certification in\n   <em>\n    Ali\n   </em>\n   actually states that the documents \"were before\" the agency, not that they are \"considered and relied upon\" by the agency as a matter of course.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ali v.

His evidence of bad faith includes (1) his claim that his statement was coerced; (2) his claim that similar events, such as those described in\n   <em>\n    Ali,\n   </em>\n   happened to other American citizens in Yemen; (3) the State Department's failure to issue a \"limited validity\" passport to him; and (4) the lack of consular records regarding the incident at the Embassy in Sana'a.

It may be that the agency's reliance on an allegedly coerced confession renders its decision arbitrary and capricious or not based on substantial evidence....

Moreover, even if this were not a merits argument, Hadwan offers nothing more than bare assertions that the statement was coerced. And at the revocation hearing, Hadwan's attorney acknowledged that he had no information \"from [Hadwan] directly\" regarding \"what transpired\" the day he signed the sworn statement. (Record at US 0107.) The surrounding circumstances alone do not suggest impropriety. Hadwan visited the Embassy to apply for immigration documents for his family-it is reasonable that State Department officials would have questioned him as a result, especially given that, as Hadwan's attorney admitted at the revocation hearing,\n   \"there's a lot of fraud in Yemen.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Record at US 0101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On the remaining points, Hadwan again makes unsupported assertions. This Court will not \"ascribe ... nefarious motives to agency action as a general matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Landers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3860053\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/98/#p113\">\n    545 F.3d at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For instance, while Hadwan is correct that the State Department may issue a limited validity passport in certain circumstances, it is not required to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051.60\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 51.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court will not assume an agency acted in bad faith simply because it exercised its discretion. In addition, similar passport revocations do not themselves demonstrate bad faith, especially given the rampant fraud and dangerous conditions in Yemen. (Record at US 0101.) Revocations are likely to happen where the State Department is \"investigating, as they very often do.\" (Record at US 0101 (quoting Hadwan's counsel).) Ultimately, like in\n   <em>\n    Ali\n   </em>\n   , Hadwan \"has provided nothing other than conclusory\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   from his lawyer to support his allegations of bad faith conduct.
