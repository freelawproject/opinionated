The Commissioner denied plaintiff's applications\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for Disability Insurance Benefits (DIB) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) after a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Having considered the ALJ's decision, the administrative record (AR), and all memoranda of record, this matter is REMANDED for an award of benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff was born on XXXX, 1969.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He completed high school, attending special\n   education classes and requiring an additional year to graduate. (AR 38-39, 42-24.) Plaintiff was last gainfully employed, in December 1997, as a baker helper. (AR 39-40, 228, 1430.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff protectively filed a DIB application on May 18, 2009 and an SSI application on June 5, 2009, alleging disability beginning June 1, 1997. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 204, 1418.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He remained insured for DIB through December 31, 2002 and was therefore required to establish disability on or prior to that \"date last insured\" (DLI) in order to receive DIB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.131\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404.321. Plaintiff's applications were denied at the initial level and on reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 21, 2011, ALJ Gordon Griggs held a hearing, taking testimony from plaintiff, his brother, and a vocational expert (VE). (AR 31-79.) Plaintiff passed away on April 3, 2011 (AR 183) and his brother was deemed an appropriate substituted party (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 1418). In a June 14, 2011 decision, the ALJ found plaintiff not disabled prior to June 5, 2009, but disabled as of that date and through his death. (AR 15-24.) He found plaintiff not under a disability or entitled to DIB at any time through the DLI. While plaintiff established his entitlement to SSI, there was no one eligible to receive those benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Appeals Council denied plaintiff's request for review on March 8, 2012 ( AR 1 - 5 ) and plaintiff filed a civil action in this Court. On November 14, 2012, the parties stipulated to a remand for further proceedings. (AR 1216-17.) The Appeals Council vacated the decision and remanded, directing the ALJ to re-evaluate the medical and lay opinions regarding onset of disability and to obtain the assistance of a medical expert in determining that date. (AR 1228-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 8, 2013, ALJ Gary Elliott held a hearing, taking testimony from claimant's brother, a VE, and psychological expert Dr. Arthur Lewy. (AR 1143-81.) In a decision dated December 3, 2013, the ALJ again found plaintiff not disabled prior to June 5, 2009, but disabled as of that date, and not disabled at any time through the DLI. (AR 1113-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Appeals Council denied plaintiff's request for review (AR 1104-07) and plaintiff again filed a civil action. By Order dated October 26, 2015, the Court remanded for further proceedings to address whether plaintiff met the requirements of listing 12.05C in the Listing of Impairments in Appendix 1 to Subpart P of the regulations. (AR 1570-77.) On February 8, 2016, the Appeals Council vacated the decision and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the Court's Order. (AR 1581.) It affirmed the ALJ's finding of disability beginning June 5, 2009 and directed the ALJ to issue a new decision on the issue of disability prior to that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ALJ Gene Duncan held a hearing on October 24, 2016, taking testimony from claimant's brother, a VE, and medical expert Dr. James Todd. (AR 1457-1535.) On February 15, 2017, the ALJ issued a decision finding plaintiff was not under a disability, and therefore not entitled to DIB, from the June 1, 1997 application date through June 5, 2009. (AR 1418-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff submitted exceptions to the ALJ's decision and, on December 29, 2017, the Appeals Council found no reason to assume jurisdiction. (AR 1408-13.) Plaintiff appealed the final ALJ decision to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction to review the ALJ's decision pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Commissioner follows a five-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a claimant is disabled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416.920 (2000). At step one, it must be determined whether the claimant is gainfully employed. The ALJ found plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful activity after the June 1, 1997 alleged onset date. At step two, it must be determined whether a claimant suffers from a severe impairment. The ALJ found plaintiff's obesity and learning disorder severe. Step three asks whether a claimant's impairments meet or equal a listed impairment. The ALJ found plaintiff's impairments did not meet or equal the criteria of a listed impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   If a claimant's impairments do not meet or equal a listing, the Commissioner must assess residual functional capacity (RFC) and determine at step four whether the claimant has demonstrated an inability to perform past relevant work. The ALJ found plaintiff able to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels, with simple, repetitive tasks, basic vocabulary instructions, and hands-on training for work setting changes. With that assessment, the ALJ found plaintiff able to perform his past work as a baker helper prior to June 5, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   If a claimant demonstrates an inability to perform past relevant work, or has no past relevant work, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to demonstrate at step five that the claimant retains the capacity to make an adjustment to work that exists in significant levels in the national economy. With the assistance of the VE, the ALJ also found plaintiff capable of performing other jobs, such as work as an agricultural sorter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court's review of the ALJ's decision is limited to whether the decision is in accordance with the law and the findings supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Penny v.

He also avers error at steps two, four, and five, in the assessment of lay witness evidence, and in the hypotheticals offered to the VE. He requests remand for a finding of disability as of June 1, 1997 and an award of benefits.

Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.05C (2011);\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694020\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/1172/#p1175\">\n    738 F.3d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1175-76 (9th Cir. 2013). The parties agreed the ALJ erred in overlooking plaintiff's verbal IQ score of 65. (AR 1576.) The Commissioner argued the error was harmless because plaintiff's verbal learning disorder could not be considered a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional limitation. The Court rejected this argument, noting a learning disorder is not necessarily coextensive with a listing-qualifying IQ score. However, the ALJ had not made findings as to whether the verbal learning disorder imposed any additional limitations or whether plaintiff satisfied the first prong of the listing. (AR 1576-77.) The Court directed the ALJ to address listing 12.05C and to explicitly discuss plaintiff's testimony on remand. (AR 1577.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Effective January 17, 2017, the Social Security Administration (SSA) removed paragraph C from listing 12.05. Revised Medical Criteria for Evaluating Mental Disorders,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066138\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. 66138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sept. 26, 2016). The portion of the revised listing now pertinent to the Court's inquiry, 12.05B, requires satisfaction of three requirements: (1) significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning evidenced by either a full scale IQ score of 70 or below or a full scale IQ score of 71-75 accompanied by a verbal or performance IQ score of 70 or below; (2) significant deficits in adaptive functioning currently manifested by extreme limitation of one, or marked limitation of two, areas of mental functioning (including (a) understand, remember, and apply information; (b) interact with others; (c) concentrate, persist, or maintain pace; and (d) adapt or manage oneself); and (3) evidence about current intellectual and adaptive functioning and the history of the disorder demonstrates or supports the conclusion it began prior to age 22. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, Subpt. P, app. 1 \u00a7 12.05B (2017).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.00H(1) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the time of the October 2016 hearing, the revised listing was not in effect. Although appearing to acknowledge the revision to come (AR 1463 (\"The problem with 12.05 is it seems to be obsolete.\") ), the ALJ proceeded to take testimony regarding listing 12.05C (AR 1465). Medical expert Dr. Todd agreed with the 2011 assessment of consultative psychological examiner Dr. Loren McCollom that plaintiff's mental status was severe and plaintiff had a learning disability his entire life. (AR 1430; AR 1462-73.) However, the ALJ ultimately found Dr. Todd, a cardiologist, not qualified to testify regarding the listing. (AR 1429-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In his February 2017 decision, a month after the revision took effect, the ALJ addressed plaintiff's claim solely in relation to revised listing 12.05B. The ALJ found plaintiff did not satisfy 12.05B because he did not have significant deficits in adaptive functioning, manifested by extreme limitation of one, or marked limitation of two, areas of mental functioning. (AR 1424.) He found only mild limitation in interacting with others and moderate limitation in understanding, remembering, or applying information, concentrating, persisting, or maintaining pace, and adapting or managing oneself. (AR 1423.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The ALJ also found plaintiff failed to satisfy the remaining requirements of 12.05B. The record showed, in March 2011, a full scale IQ score of 71 and a verbal IQ score of 65. (AR 1424 (citing AR 1085).) However, in August 2009, when plaintiff was forty years old, consultative psychiatric examiner Dr. Aaron Hunt found, objectively, plaintiff \"did not appear to be suffering from or have any ongoing intellectual dysfunction, suggestive of borderline intellectual functioning or mental retardation.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing AR 851).) The record did not show a diagnosis of an intellectual disorder prior to March 2011 and there was no medical evidence showing plaintiff had that disorder prior to age 22. No State agency psychological consultant concluded plaintiff equaled a mental listing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The ALJ gave great weight to the opinion of Dr. Hunt, who found plaintiff able to perform simple/repetitive and detailed/complex tasks, no objective evidence to support an inability to receive instructions from supervisors, interact with coworkers and the public, and no evidence he could not maintain regular attendance, participate in a normal workday, or deal with regular stressors in the workplace. (AR 1429 (citing AR 847-52).) The ALJ gave some weight to the opinion of prior testifying expert Dr. Lewy that plaintiff was only mildly limited in functioning, but found the record to support moderate limitations in understanding, remembering, and applying information, and in concentration, persistence, and pace. He gave little weight to the opinion of Dr. Todd because it fell outside the cardiologist's area of expertise and was inconsistent with the opinions of Drs. Hunt and Lewy. (AR 1429-30, 1473.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff avers error in the ALJ's failure to address whether he met listing 12.05C, as ordered to do by this Court. He asserts a number of related errors, including the failure to address the diagnoses and limitations opined by Dr. McCollom, or to properly address evidence supporting the conclusion his intellectual disorder dated back to his childhood, including the report from Dr. McCollom, hearing and lay witness testimony, and other evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Commissioner contends the ALJ had no choice but to apply the revised listing. In giving notice of the revised mental disorder listings, the SSA indicated: \"When the final rules become effective, we will apply them to new applications filed on or after the effective date of the rules, and\n   to claims that are pending on or after the effective date.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066138\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. 66138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The agency expected federal courts reviewing final agency decisions would use the rules in effect at the time of those decisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at n.1. If a court remanded a case for further proceedings after the effective date, the agency would apply the revised rules to the entire period at issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Commissioner denies any other error, contending the ALJ's findings show plaintiff's impairments do not meet the previous or current version of listing 12.05. The Commissioner argues Dr. McCollom's opinion, offered two years after the established onset date of disability and nine years after the DLI, was neither significant, nor probative and did not support a finding of disability, and that the ALJ reasonably rejected the testimony of Dr. Todd and favored the evidence from Drs. Hunt and Lewy. She denies any error, or harmless error, in regard to the lay witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This case is unusual in several respects. Claimant passed away more than seven years ago. He can be found entitled to disability benefits only upon showing he met the necessary criteria almost sixteen years ago. The proper criteria to apply to that determination is in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   There is no dispute the revised listing 12.05 was in effect at the time of the final ALJ decision. Plaintiff posits it would be fundamentally unfair to apply the revision, noting the prior listing applied from the time of application through the 2016 hearing, and that the ALJ's decision issued only twenty-nine days after the revision effective date. The Commissioner maintains the intervening change in the regulations made it impossible for the ALJ to strictly comply with the Court's order and that application of the revised listing was consistent with the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Neither party addresses the issue of retroactivity. Courts in this district have, on more than one occasion, construed Ninth Circuit law as requiring an ALJ to apply the listings in effect at the time of a claimant's application.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beaty v.

The ALJ found inconsistency with the medical evidence, but, other than IQ scores, did not take the evidence from Dr. McCollom into consideration. (AR 1427-28.) The ALJ found plaintiff's lack of mental health treatment, with no history of psychiatric hospitalization, mental health counseling, or psychotropic medications, suggested the alleged persistence and intensity of related symptoms were not as serious as alleged. (AR 1428.) As argued by plaintiff, this appears to reflect the ALJ's misunderstanding of the nature of plaintiff's impairment and the symptom testimony. While Dr. McCollom did identify various mental health diagnoses (AR 1087), both claimant and his brother attested to symptoms and limitations associated with intellectual functioning, not mental health issues amenable to treatment through psychiatric counseling or medications.

The IQ scores likewise satisfy the 12.05B(1) requirement of significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning evidenced by a full scale IQ score of 71-75 accompanied by a verbal IQ score of 70 or below. \u00a7 12.05B(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The record also contains evidence supporting the conclusion plaintiff satisfies 12.05B(2) with significant deficits in adaptive functioning currently manifested by extreme limitation of one, or marked limitation of two, areas of mental functioning. In March 2011, Dr. McCollom found plaintiff moderately/markedly limited in social interaction given his anxiety, extremely low verbal intelligence, and difficulty relating to others, and opined plaintiff did not appear appropriate for public employment. (AR 1089.) He found plaintiff's ability to understand, remember, and follow instructions moderately/markedly impaired due to extremely low verbal functioning and working memory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff lacked the ability to manage his funds due to his cognitive limitations and illiteracy, with extremely low range scores on tests of arithmetic, working memory, and processing speed. (AR 1091.) Dr. McCollom also, in a separate form dated April 8, 2011, assessed marked and extreme limitations\n   in relation to understanding, remembering, and carrying out instructions, with test results indicating plaintiff functioned \"between the mentally retarded &amp; borderline level of intelligence[,]\" and verbal abilities falling in the extremely low range for both spoken and received language abilities. (AR 1094-95.) He assessed marked limitations in plaintiff's ability to interact appropriately with supervisors, co-workers, and the public, pointing to a lack of social skills, compounded by mood disturbance, especially anxiety bordering on paranoid thought processes, and extremely low verbal abilities. (AR 1096-97.) Dr. Todd, while opining outside his area of expertise, testified plaintiff's mental status was very severe, with difficulty managing his medications, severe cognitive problems, and social withdrawal, found satisfaction of listing 12.05 with the IQ scores and limitations in social functioning and concentration, and described the report from Dr. McCollom as compelling. (AR 1462-75.) Considering the evidence as a whole and the unique circumstances of this case, the Court finds substantial evidence support for plaintiff's satisfaction of 12.05B(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, the Court finds substantial evidence support for the conclusion plaintiff's intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits manifested before age 22, as required for satisfaction of both 12.05C and 12.05B(3). Plaintiff's IQ results and medical records provide support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.00H(4)(a), (e). While noting plaintiff overall performed within the borderline range on testing, Dr. McCollom observed \"his score barely meets the criteria for the Borderline designation, as a loss of two points would place him within the Mentally Retarded range of intellectual functioning.\" (AR 1087.) He included mental retardation as a \"rule-out\" diagnosis due to \"confidence intervals[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. McCollom also found plaintiff was not likely to develop substantial gains in cognitive abilities and that his history of academic difficulties suggested continued intellectual and learning limitations.

Claimant testified he could not read or use a computer, did not have a bank account, and that his brother paid his bills. (AR 44-45, 49, 52, 56-58.) His brother and sister-in-law indicated claimant had no problem with personal care, but needed reminders for hygiene and paperwork and help with daily activities, including assistance with medications and household chores, that he could count change but not otherwise handle money, could not read or write, and had a hard time following spoken instructions and poor social skills.

At hearing, claimant's brother testified he had provided assistance throughout claimant's life by, for example, taking care of medications, paying bills, filling out forms, helping to secure and keep jobs, providing reminders regarding hygiene and reminders and assistance with laundry and other cleaning, and otherwise generally managing claimant's life. (AR 1490-91, 1497-1502.) Claimant never obtained a driver's license and never lived entirely independently. (AR 1492-96, 1500.)
