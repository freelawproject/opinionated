The body camera videos show that the plaintiff exited his car with his hands up as ordered by the detectives. Detective Mayorga's body camera video shows that Detective Baskins approached the plaintiff and attempted to slam the plaintiff into the hood of his car. Video also shows Detective Baskins punching the plaintiff in the face repeatedly before Detective Baskins turned off his body camera. Sometime later Detective Baskins body camera video reveals that the camera was placed on the hood of the plaintiff's car. The verbal exchange between Detective Baskins and the plaintiff is also recorded on the video and includes Detective Baskins responding, \"What the f**k are you going to do about it?,\" after the plaintiff asked for his badge number and questioned being punched in the face. The detectives arrested and charged the plaintiff with multiple offenses which were nolle prossed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Miami-Dade County (hereinafter \"the County\") seeks to dismiss the following eight counts of the Amended Complaint: Count I (state law false arrest and imprisonment), Count III (negligent hiring or retention under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), Count IV (negligent failure to train and supervise under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), Count VI (excessive force under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), Count VIII (state law battery), Count IX (state law intentional infliction of emotional distress), Count X (state law civil conspiracy), and Count XI (state law gross negligence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The County moves to dismiss the Section 1983 claims (Counts III, IV and VI) on the grounds that the allegations are conclusory and fail to satisfy the requirements to allege municipal liability under\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

The County further contends that the plaintiff failed to identify a responsible County policymaker and plead sufficient facts supporting a ratification theory of liability; and that the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to establish that a custom or policy was the moving force behind the plaintiff's alleged constitutional\n   violation. The County moves to dismiss the remaining state law claims as barred by Section 768.28(9)(a) of the Florida Statutes and/or sovereign immunity because the alleged actions were malicious, in bad faith, or with wanton and willful disregard of the plaintiff's rights. Additionally, the state law false arrest claim includes the state law battery claim, which cannot exist as a separate claim. Finally, the County argues that the Amended Complaint is a shotgun pleading that incorporates each prior allegation into the subsequent counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Officers seek dismissal of the plaintiff's claims for excessive force cognizable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count VII); intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count IX); and civil conspiracy (Count X). The Officers argue that the well-pled factual allegations of the Amended Complaint fail to state claims upon which relief may be granted for intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count IX) and civil conspiracy (Count X). Additionally, the Section 1983 excessive force claim (Count VII) is subsumed in the Section 1983 false arrest claim (Count I) and cannot exist as an independent cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiff filed responses to the County's and the Officers' respective motions to dismiss, and the defendants filed their respective replies.
