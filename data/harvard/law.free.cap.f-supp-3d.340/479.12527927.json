As a result, upon FDA approval of Egalet's own pain management drug, Egalet was not permitted to market its drug as effective at reducing intranasal opioid abuse, and when this news was announced, shares of the stock dropped significantly within a matter of days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Presently before the Court are Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, and Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike one of the exhibits that Defendants attached to their Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For reasons discussed below, Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike is DENIED and Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint is GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case began on January 27, 2017, with the filing of a Class Action Complaint (ECF 1) by Plaintiff George Mineff against Robert S. Radie (\"Radie\"), Stanley J. Musial (\"Musial\"), Jeffrey M. Dayno (\"Dayno,\" and together with the aforementioned individuals, \"Individual Defendants\"), and Egalet (together with Individual Defendants, \"Defendants\"). On February 10, 2017, Plaintiff Steve Klein filed a Class Action Complaint against Defendants in a separately captioned case (17-cv-617, ECF 1), which was designated as related and assigned to the undersigned. On March 28, 2017, two sets of movants filed motions for consolidation of the related cases, appointment of lead plaintiffs, and approval of their respective selections of legal counsel. (ECF 10-11) However, the first of the two motions was withdrawn on April 11, 2017. (ECF 15) Also on April 11, 2017, Defendants filed a response to the remaining motion, expressing their agreement that the related actions should be consolidated. (ECF 16)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 1, 2017, this Court granted the motion of Johseph Spizzirri, Abdul Rahiman, and Kyle Kobold (collectively, \"Egalet Investor Group\"), thereby consolidating the two related cases under the above caption, appointing Egalet Investor Group as Lead Plaintiff, and approving their selection of counsel. (ECF 17) On May 15, 2017, pursuant to a joint stipulation of the parties, this Court granted leave to Lead Plaintiff to file an amended complaint. (ECF 18) Lead Plaintiff filed its Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on July 3, 2017. (ECF 19, \"CAC\") The Amended Complaint contains two counts: (1) \"Violations of Section 10(b) [ 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) ] and Rule 10b-5 [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5 ] Promulgated Thereunder Against All Defendants,\" and (2) \"Violations of Section 20(a) [ 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a) ] Against the Individual Defendants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Presently before the Court are three motions. The first two motions are (1) Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, which was filed on September 1, 2017; and (2) Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike Exhibit 1 to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, to Treat Defendants' Motion to Dismiss as a Motion for Summary Judgment, which was filed on October 31, 2017. (ECF 24, \"MTD\"; ECF 26, \"MTS\") The parties submitted Responses and Replies to each motion. (ECF 25, \"MTD Response\"; ECF 28, \"MTS Response\"; ECF 29, \"MTD Reply\"; ECF 31, \"MTS Reply\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 20, 2018, the Court held oral argument on both motions. (ECF 39) During oral argument, Plaintiffs represented to the Court that they would like to avail themselves of the opportunity to file a second amended complaint. Thereafter, on March 6, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the third motion now before the Court, a Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint (ECF 43), to which they attached a proposed third complaint. Defendants filed a Response (ECF 44) on March 20, 2018, and Plaintiffs filed a Reply on March 27, 2018. (ECF 45) Plaintiff also filed a Motion for Leave to File a Surreply (47), which this Court granted on April 4, 2018. (ECF 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 12, 2018, this Court held oral argument on all open motions, specifically addressing with the parties those portions of the proposed Second Amended Complaint which do not appear in the First Amended Complaint. Because Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is addressed to the First Amended Complaint, it is the principal subject of this opinion. The proposed Second Amended Complaint, which almost entirely mirrors the First Amended Complaint,\n   is discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   in the context of whether amendment would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant Egalet is a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on developing and commercializing abuse-resistant formulations of opioids and other pain care drugs. (CAC \u00b6 33) Egalet's proprietary Guardian Technology employs a novel application of \"injection molding\" to manufacture \"tablets that are hard and difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"At the beginning of the Class Period,\" Egalet was developing two late-stage lead product candidates: ARYMO ER\u2122 and Egalet-002. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35) Both use Guardian Technology to impede abuse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Egalet also acquired two FDA-approved pain care products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint centers on ARYMO ER\u2122 (\"ARYMO\"). Egalet developed ARYMO as an extended release morphine tablet intended to utilize Guardian Technology to deter abuse of the product by increasing resistance to physical methods of manipulation (e.g., cutting, crushing, grinding), chemical manipulation, and extraction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The 505(b)(2) Pathway to Drug Approval\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 1984, Congress passed the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Pub. L. No. 98-417,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Stat.%201585\">\n    98 Stat. 1585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47) The Hatch-Waxman Amendments require that a drug manufacturer seeking to market a new drug must first obtain approval from the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48) A manufacturer can obtain FDA approval via any of three different application pathways, one of which is known as a Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (\"NDA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   An applicant for a 505(b)(2) NDA can receive approval for marketing a new drug even where one or more investigations relied upon for approval \"were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51) Thus, a 505(b)(2) NDA applicant can rely on previously published reports of studies and the FDA's own findings with respect to drugs that the FDA has previously approved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When an applicant relies on clinical studies that were previously submitted to the FDA in support of a different drug, the drug for which the borrowed studies were conducted is referred to as the \"Reference Listed Drug\" (\"RLD\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52) A 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may proffer studies conducted on the\n   RLD to satisfy the applicant's burden of proving a new drug's safety and effectiveness. This generally occurs when the new drug differs only slightly from the RLD, such as a drug product innovation or change in drug strength. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Marketing Exclusivity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Hatch-Waxman Amendments create certain incentives to encourage innovation of new drug products. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55) One of those incentives is \"marketing exclusivity,\" which the FDA can grant to new drugs that it approves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54-55) Marketing exclusivity, as its name suggests, provides exclusive marketing rights over a drug. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55) It can prevent the issuance of requested labeling language sought by another applicant or prevent the submission or effective approval of other NDAs (such as 505(b)(2) NDAs). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, when the FDA grants marketing exclusivity to a drug, it confers substantial benefits on the drug. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For a drug to receive exclusivity, it must meet all statutory requirements and receive approval by the FDA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57) There are four categories of exclusivity, one of which is referred to as \"Other Exclusivity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) One type of \"Other Exclusivity\" is \"new drug product exclusivity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.108\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58) New drug product exclusivity is granted when a 505(b)(2) NDA: (1) contains an active moiety (a sub-division of a molecule) that has previously received FDA approval; (2) includes new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that were \"essential to the approval of the application\"; and (3) is approved by the FDA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58) If these three conditions are met, the FDA will not approve another 505(b)(2) NDA with the same \"conditions of approval\" for a period of three years from the date of the application's approval.

CDER and Abuse-Deterrent Opioids\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In April 2015, CDER published a guide to assist manufacturers wishing to develop opioid drug products with abuse-deterrent properties (the \"AD Opioid Guidance\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71) Among other things, the AD Opioid Guidance provides information to drug manufacturers about the FDA's \"Physician Labeling Rule.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75) Section 9.2 of the Physician Labeling Rule requires that labeling for abuse-deterrent drug products \"state the types of abuse that can occur with the drug and the adverse reactions pertinent to them, and must identity particularly susceptible patient populations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The AD Opioid Guidance supplies additional detail about Section 9.2, stating that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   labeling language regarding abuse deterrence should describe the product's specific abuse deterrent properties as well as the specific routes of abuse that the product has been developed to deter. For example, a formulation that limits an abuser's ability to crush a tablet and to extract the opioid can be described as limiting manipulation for the purpose of snorting or injection if the data support such a statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    E. ARYMO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   ARYMO, previously discussed in general terms, is an Egalet product for the management of severe, long-term pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80) It is an abuse-deterrent extended release (\"ER\") oral morphine formulation to which Egalet applied its proprietary Guardian Technology \"for the expected purpose of it becoming an FDA-approved ER morphine drug product with abuse-deterrent labeling for the intranasal, intravenous, and oral routes of abuse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Egalet submitted ARYMO as a 505(b)(2) NDA and selected MS Contin (extended-release morphine tablets) as ARYMO's RLD, thus seeking to establish that its 15mg, 30mg, and 60mg doses were bioequivalent to MS Contin as the same strengths. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81) As earlier discussed, an applicant submitting a 505(b)(2) NDA can rely on clinical studies previously submitted to the FDA in support of another drug (the RLD). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82) In this case, Egalet submitted its ARYMO application using clinical studies performed on MS Contin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82) It also conducted its own clinical studies in support of ARYMO's approval, including\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   and human abuse liability studies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   ARYMO's abuse-deterrent properties differentiated it from the \"vast majority of the ER morphine products prescribed in the U.S.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89) In fact, ARYMO's prospects for abuse-deterrent labeling for a trifecta of abuse routes-nasal, intravenous, and oral-was \"particularly valuable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90) No product had received FDA-approved abuse-deterrent labeling for all three routes of abuse.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 233-34) For example, a Cantor Fitzgerald analyst stated that \"our enthusiasm following the approval to ARYMO [ ] this afternoon was tempered as the label, which we expected to include abuse-deterrent [ ] claims in oral, intranasal, and IV routes of abuse, only included IV.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 233)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   However, some of the statements appear in Egalet's financial statements. For example, Plaintiffs highlight that Egalet's Form 10-K filed on March 13, 2017 disclosed new risks that Egalet had not previously mentioned, such as that \"the FDA may not approve the labeling claims, including claims regarding abuse deterrence, that we believe are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our products and product candidates.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 237) Another risk that had previously not been included in Egalet's financial statements was that, \"if the FDA approves a competitor's 505(b)(2) application for a drug candidate before our application for a similar drug candidate, and grants the competitor a period of exclusivity, the FDA may take the position that it cannot approve our FDA ... or that our label cannot reflect certain claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 239)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss includes various attachments as exhibits. In response, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Strike Exhibit 1 (to the Motion to Dismiss), or in the alternative, to treat Defendants' Motion to Dismiss as a motion for summary judgment. Exhibit 1 to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is a memorandum, dated November 16, 2016 and signed November 29, 2016, written by the FDA's CDER Exclusivity Board regarding the \"Scope of 3-Year Exclusivity for MorphaBond.\" (MTD, Ex. 1, the \"CDER Memo\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Parties' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In the Motion to Dismiss, Defendants assert that the Court can consider the CDER Memo \"because it is explicitly relied upon in the [Amended Complaint] and integral to Plaintiffs' claims.\" (MTD, at 1, n.1) Defendants indicate that paragraph 114 of the Amended Complaint quotes from the CDER Memo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that this Court should strike Exhibit 1, and all factual assertions made by Defendants in reliance on it, because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   (1) \"the Complaint does not rely upon or even reference the CDER Memo a single time\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   (2) \"the CDER Memo is not integral to Plaintiffs' claims which are based on Defendants' public misrepresentations regarding their efforts to secure FDA approval of a broad label for ARYMO [ ] covering intranasal abuse deterrence while failing to disclose a risk to the approvability of that label.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   (MTS, at 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Plaintiffs specifically refute Defendants contention that the CDER Memo is quoted in Paragraph 114 of the Amended Complaint, and aver that \"the CDER Memo is not quoted, cited, or referenced anywhere else in the Amended Complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Instead, Plaintiffs assert, Paragraph 114 \"refers to the exclusivity code given to MorphaBond in the Orange Book.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs state, because Defendants rely on the CDER Memo for the truth of the information contained within it, the Court should disregard Defendants' factual assertions based on the CDER Memo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In their Response, Defendants contend that Paragraph 114 of the Amended Complaint \"contains the exact language found in the conclusion of the Memo, in quotation marks, without any attribution to another source.\" (MTS Response, at 1) Thus, they say it is \"relied upon\" by Plaintiffs in making their claims and should be considered by the Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Defendants also contend that the CDER Memo is \"integral to\" the Amended Complaint and may be considered by the Court even if it were not cited in the Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants characterize Plaintiffs' description of the case as \"being about what Defendants supposedly knew about the risk that the FDA would not approve the labeling Egalet had requested for ARYMO [ ] because of MorphaBond's exclusivity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because the CDER Memo-published in November of 2016 (after the Class Period had ended)-appears to demonstrate that the scope of MorphaBond's exclusivity was undecided prior to that point, Defendants assert that the CDER Memo specifically addresses what Defendants could have known (and/or could not have known) during the Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Defendants contend, the CDER Memo \"sets forth the FDA's reasoning underlying its decision about the scope of exclusivity to which MorphaBond was entitled,\" thus demonstrating the \"nature of the risk\" that Defendants allegedly should have disclosed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Lastly, Defendants assert that the Court \"may judicially notice [the CDER Memo] as a public record.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Even if the CDER Memo were not integral to the Amended Complaint (which Defendants do not concede), they contend that the Court could take \"judicial notice of the date of the Memo's publication,\" and this fact alone would be sufficient to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In their Reply, Plaintiffs assert that the language of Paragraph 114 of the Amended Complaint was not drawn from the CDER Memo, but rather from MorphaBond's exclusivity code, as expressed in the FDA's Orange Book (which also includes the exact language quoted in Paragraph 114). (MTS Reply, at 2) Thus, they contend, the CDER Memo was not \"explicitly relied upon\" in the Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Plaintiffs also dispute Defendants characterization of the CDER Memo as \"integral to\" their claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 2) Plaintiffs highlight that they do not claim any statement in the CDER Memo was fraudulent, do not rely upon it to show any element of their claims, and do not mention or cite it for any proposition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs contend that even if the Court were to take judicial notice of the CDER Memo, the Court should strike any assertions contained in Defendants' Motion to Dismiss that rely on the CDER Memo for the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., to \"demonstrate that Defendants could not have known the scope of Morpha[B]ond's exclusivity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 7-8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In general, a district court considering a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ.

MorphaBond's marketing exclusivity began, according to Plaintiffs, \"at the time the FDA approved MorphaBond's 505(b)(2) NDA,\" on October 2, 2015.

Instead, it was not until November 29, 2016 that the FDA published the CDER Memo detailing the scope of MorphaBond's exclusivity (with such exclusivity made retroactive to October 2, 2015). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CDER Memo) In other words, if not for the CDER Memo, the FDA would not have decided that MorphaBond has marketing exclusivity for intranasal abuse-deterrent labeling for drugs of this kind.

The warnings contained in Egalet's SEC filings, presentations, and investor calls specifically address the risk that the FDA would fail to approve labeling for certain abuse-deterrence claims. For example, as excerpted above, Egalet repeatedly disclosed that \"there can be no assurance that our product candidates in development will receive FDA-approved labeling that describes the abuse-deterrent features of such products.\" (MTD Ex. 18, at 50; Ex. 19, at 41) As Plaintiffs allege in the Amended Complaint, at the beginning of the Class Period, Egalet had only two late-stage lead product candidates in development. (CAC \u00b6 35) Yet, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants' risk disclosures were insufficiently tailored because they did not specifically say it was ARYMO that might not receive intranasal abuse-deterrent labeling, and that it was MorphaBond's exclusivity that might prevent such labeling. However, Egalet was not required, as a matter of law, to precisely mention all abuse-deterrent labeling that might or might not be included, nor the specific reasons for the FDA's decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    OFI Asset Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   , 834 F.3d at 502 (finding statements supplied \"sufficient context to constitute cautionary language,\" even though its \"warnings could have been more direct\"). Adopting Plaintiffs' asserted rationale would restrict the protection afforded by the Safe Harbor to confines unrecognized by any precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   It is sufficient that, for example, Defendants warned they \"may not be allowed to include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization\" of its products in development. (Ex. 19, at 40) This statement-and others, such as, \"the commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon our ability to obtain FDA approved labeling describing their abuse-deterrent features or benefits\" (MTD Ex. 18, at 50)-gives notice to investors that Egalet might not be able to successfully commercialize its products if precluded (by the FDA) to use labeling that describes all abuse-deterrent features. Given that this is the precise risk Plaintiffs assert was responsible for their loss, this Court finds the cautionary language sufficient for purposes of the Safe Harbor Provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238849\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/242/#p254\">\n    564 F.3d at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding cautionary language sufficient where the company \"included in a list of [ ] 'risks and uncertainties' the very 'price and product competition' Shareholders assert was responsible for Avaya's missing its projections\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   All of the Challenged Forward-Looking Statements are protected by the Safe Harbor Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Misrepresentation or Omission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   The first pleading requirement of a Section 10(b) claim, subject to a \"heightened pleading requirement[ ] above the normal Rule 12(b)(6) standard,\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

In other words, Plaintiffs' theory is that Defendants' statements were misleading because they failed to disclose MorphaBond's regulatory status. Instead, Egalet continued discussing its process for seeking FDA approval of ARYMO, including for its ability to deter intranasal abuse, without mentioning that MorphaBond would preclude Egalet from making intranasal abuse deterrence claims on ARYMO's label.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   This theory fails, in part because Defendants did not make false or misleading statements or omissions about ARYMO's prospects for approval.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following examples, drawn from the Amended Complaint, are representative:\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Egalet stated that ARYMO's NDA \"submission [to the FDA] includes a comprehensive battery of abuse-deterrent studies (Category 1, 2 and 3) which were conducted to support abuse-deterrent label claims for intravenous injection, snorting and oral abuse.\" (CAC \u00b6 171) The fact that the studies were conducted to support label claims is not false. It is also not misleading, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. The CDER Memo makes clear that the scope of MorphaBond's exclusivity was not decided by the FDA until November, 2016, after the Class Period had ended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CDER Memo, at 13. Thus, during the Class Period, Egalet's description of its studies as being \"conducted to support abuse-deterrent label claims for ... snorting,\" would not mislead a reasonable investor into thinking that intranasal abuse-deterrent labeling was a guarantee. (CAC \u00b6 171) This is especially the case because Egalet repeatedly disclosed that \"there can be no assurance that our product candidates in development will receive FDA-approved labeling that describes\n   the abuse-deterrent features of such products,\" (MTD Ex. 18, at 50; Ex. 19, at 41) and \"we may not be allowed to include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for [ ] successful commercialization.\" (Ex. 19, at 40)\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Egalet also represented in several of its Form 8-K's that it was \"potential\" for ARYMO to receive an intranasal abuse-deterrent label from the FDA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 130, 147, 157, 166, 202) Again, Plaintiffs allege these statements were false and misleading because Egalet omitted to disclose the fact that MorphaBond had been approved by the FDA. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , CAC \u00b6 148) More specifically, Plaintiffs allege they were false and misleading because MorphaBond appeared to meet the regulatory requirements for a scope of labeling exclusivity that extended to abuse-deterrent intranasal abuse (and thus \"would\" receive such exclusivity). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109, 221) However, one cannot plausibly contend that a company using the word \"potential\" to describe an event (in this case, approval for intranasal abuse-deterrent labeling) misleads its investors because it appears in retrospect that the event was \"unlikely.\"\n   <em>\n    In re NAHC\n   </em>\n   , 306 F.3d at 1330 (\"To be actionable, a statement or omission must have been misleading at the time it was made; liability cannot be imposed on the basis of subsequent events.\"). Again, the Court finds it implausible in light of Egalet's risk disclosures that Egalet's use of the term \"potential\" could mislead reasonable investors into thinking that there were no obstacles to AMYRO receiving approval for intranasal labeling (such as MorphaBond's scope of exclusivity extending into this labeling area),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   One case relied on heavily by Plaintiffs to support the \"misleading or false statement or omission\" element of their Section 10(b) claim is\n   <em>\n    In re Enzymotec Secs.

Dec. 14, 2015). In\n   <em>\n    Enzymotec\n   </em>\n   , the defendant company had directly made statements in press releases that it was aware of \"recent changes in Chinese regulations,\" but also stated that \"[t]he Company does not expect this change in Chinese regulations to impact its 2014 revenues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14. The court concluded that the company had failed to disclose material information about the specific risk posed by a change in Chinese regulations, despite the fact that the regulations were public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   This Court declines to borrow from the logic of\n   <em>\n    Enzymotec\n   </em>\n   , and in any event, finds it distinguishable in one very important regard. In that case, the court was unpersuaded by the defendant's contention that the effect of the Chinese regulations on\n   Enzymotec's revenues was uncertain. Thus, the latent uncertainty in that case did not excuse the company's failure to inform its investors in greater detail about the Chinese regulations that were already promulgated but yet to be implemented. In contrast, in this case, the regulatory conclusion of the FDA (a third-party) was the uncertainty. By way of illustration, for example, if the FDA had already decided the scope of MorphaBond's exclusivity over intranasal labeling and Egalet were speculating about the effect of the FDA's determination, Egalet would be expected to provide accurate, or at least not misleading, information about the effect of the FDA's determination. Instead, in this case, a third-party, the FDA, had not yet determined the scope of MorphaBond's exclusivity. Therefore, when Egalet stated that it was \"potential\" for its drug to receive intranasal labeling from the FDA, it did not mislead reasonable investors; falsity is determined at the time a statement is made, not on the basis of subsequent events.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kovtun v.

Indeed, Plaintiffs' own Amended Complaint acknowledges that all the information required to determine whether MorphaBond would obtain exclusivity was public in nature, stating \"[i]n view of ... publicly available information, Egalet, with knowledge\n   of FDA law and practice[,] would comprehend that MorphaBond would obtain a three-year exclusivity ... This inference would have been obvious....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 275) Given that the legal requirements for labeling exclusivity are publicly-available in federal statutes and regulations, and Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants possessed any insider or confidential knowledge beyond what was \"publicly available,\" any \"inference [that] would have been obvious\" to Defendants could similarly have been obvious to an informed investor using public information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   This relates to a similar issue. The Amended Complaint takes for granted that the scope of MorphaBond's exclusivity would extend into intranasal abuse deterrent labeling. However, the CDER Memo demonstrates that the FDA had not yet approved a scope of exclusivity for MorphaBond during the Class Period. (CDER Memo, at 13) Thus, Defendants could not have known during the Class Period that MorphaBond's labeling exclusivity would preclude intranasal abuse deterrent labeling for ARYMO.\n   <em>\n    In re NAHC\n   </em>\n   , 306 F.3d at 1330 (\"[L]iability cannot be imposed on the basis of subsequent events.\");\n   <em>\n    Gallagher v.

In fact, it was far from certain that the FDA would grant MorphaBond such a scope of exclusivity, as the CDER Memo demonstrates that the FDA \"considered but declined to adopt both broader and narrower potential approaches to the scope of exclusivity.\" (CDER Memo, at 13) The FDA also noted that it considered a scope of exclusivity \"limited to the specific formulation in MorphaBond, or the specific technology MorphaBond uses to deter intranasal abuse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 14) Because the FDA made its determination after the Class Period, the inference that Defendants did not act with scienter is \"at least as compelling\" as an inference that they did.\n   <em>\n    Tellabs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p322\">\n    551 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p322\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that ARYMO's NDA did not seek exclusivity-protected intranasal labeling, which they allege amounts to an admission that ARYMO could not receive such labeling at all. (CAC \u00b6 296) They also allege that Defendants' slideshow presentations show awareness of MorphaBond's approval for intranasal labeling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 302) Both of these allegations are fully consistent with Defendants' knowledge that MorphaBond had FDA approval. However, Defendants do not refute that they were aware of MorphaBond's approval, and MorphaBond's approval is not at the heart of the issue in this securities fraud lawsuit. Instead, it is the scope of MorphaBond's exclusivity that is at issue, and, as detailed in the CDER Memo, the scope of such exclusivity was not determined until after the Class Period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Westinghouse Sec.

Thomas, it is unclear what is added to the\n   scienter allegations by his opinion, which was based solely on \"the substance and documents referenced above in paragraphs 249-279.\" (CAC \u00b6 283) The documents in those paragraphs are all publicly available information, and in fact, are mostly federal statutes and regulations. Professor Thomas's opinion is that \"Egalet would have known MorphaBond three-year exclusivity attached at the time MorphaBond was approved by the FDA.\" Again, this is not disputed by Defendants, because it is not at the heart of the issue in this litigation. Instead, the central issue is whether the\n   <em>\n    scope\n   </em>\n   of such exclusivity would extend into intranasal abuse-deterrent labeling. To the extent that Professor Thomas formed an opinion about the scope of MorphaBond's exclusivity, the fact that such an opinion is based solely on public information substantially undermines his conclusion (for the same reasons expressed above).\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiffs' confidential witness does little to add to Plaintiffs' scienter allegations. The paragraphs pertaining to CW1 in the Amended Complaint lack multiple requirements of particularized pleading, including the \"who, what, when, where and how\" of the events at issue.\n   <em>\n    GSC Partners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9243900\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/228/#p243\">\n    368 F.3d at 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CW1 reports that \"Egalet executives\" (without specifying\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   , or even whether it was one of the Individual Defendants), said ARYMO was \"encountering difficulties getting approved by the FDA with its proposed labeling\" (without specifying\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   particular difficulty, or even whether it related to intranasal as opposed to other abuse pathways), that the information was relayed during \"calls held in October and November 2016,\" (without specifying\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   , during which call, or whether it happened more than once). (CAC \u00b6 334)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the departure of COO Melloy in May, 2016, do not relate in any way to their allegations about ARYMO. Nonetheless, the Amended Complaint concludes that Melloy's \"peculiar\" departure \"support[s] a cogent and compelling inference of scienter\" because \"some investors ... held Melloy in very high esteem.\" (CAC \u00b6 377) If there is a connection between Melloy's departure and Defendants' alleged scienter (or ARYMO's intranasal labeling), it cannot be inferred from anything in the Amended Complaint and it remains unexplained in Plaintiffs' brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   With respect to Plaintiffs' \"core operations\" assertion, it is entirely reasonable to suggest that achieving FDA approval for ARYMO was one of Egalet's core operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   Thus, the \"nature of the relevant fact is of such prominence that it would be 'absurd' to suggest that management was without knowledge of the matter.\"\n   <em>\n    S.

This proposed complaint mirrors the First Amended Complaint in most material respects. It does not contain any additional allegations that change the\n   Court's analysis, and in fact, contains nearly no new information at all (aside from conclusory statements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   However, the Second Amended Complaint emphasizes a scienter argument that Plaintiffs previously made, albeit less strongly, alleging that Egalet's decision in its NDA not to seek exclusivity for ARYMO's intranasal abuse deterrence labeling claims amounted to a tacit admission that Defendants knew they could not receive intranasal abuse deterrent labeling at all. However, this theory is not new, as it was previously included in the second complaint and discussed at the first oral argument, held on February 20, 2018 (prior to the filing of the proposed third complaint):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-290\">\n   The Court: Okay. All right. Number eight. How does Egalet's decision not to seek exclusivity for ARYMO amount to an admission, as alleged by plaintiff, that ARYMO could not receive such labeling at all? Are there other plausible reasons that Egalet might not seek exclusivity when filing an NDA for its product?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-291\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-292\">\n   Plaintiffs' Counsel: [T]he fact that they ... didn't actually ask for exclusivity suggests that they knew at the time of the NDA that in fact their drug did not qualify for exclusivity. And if it didn't qualify for exclusivity, then MorphaBond must-it would only not qualify for exclusivity if MorphaBond did qualify for exclusivity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   (ECF 39, at 19:15-20:8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   Here, it is important to note that Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants made false or misleading statements or omissions regarding the prospects for ARYMO's intranasal labeling\n   <em>\n    exclusivity\n   </em>\n   , but rather the prospects for ARYMO's\n   <em>\n    approval.\n   </em>\n   While it is correct that Defendants did not seek exclusivity along with ARYMO's approval, this can reasonably be traced to explanations other than fraud. Most notably, it suggests that Egalet was aware of Inspirion's application for MorphaBond, which by virtue of containing the same active moiety (i.e., portion of a molecule), would, irrespective of its scope of its exclusivity, preclude ARYMO from receiving exclusivity (but not necessarily FDA approval). In any event, Plaintiffs' renewed emphasis on this argument in the Second Amended Complaint does not materially change any part of the Court's above analysis related to scienter or otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that amendment would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   After extensive briefing and two oral arguments, Plaintiffs still fail to adequately plead particularized scienter, as required under the PSLRA, related to any omission or false statement supported by any reported precedent, controlling or otherwise. Plaintiffs' allegations do not show Defendants omitted or concealed anything internal to Egalet-or possible action or inaction by the FDA-and Defendants cannot be held responsible for action or inaction taken by the FDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike is DENIED and Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED WITH PREJUDICE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-302\">\n    All facts are drawn from the Consolidated Amended Complaint (ECF 19, \"CAC\"), and, for purposes of this motion, the Court accepts as true the facts contained therein.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ashcroft v.
