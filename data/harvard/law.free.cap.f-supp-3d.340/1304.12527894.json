D.E. 1-3 \u00b6 1; D.E. 38 \u00b6 1; D.E. 1-2, p. 19-21. In the Article, BuzzFeed\n   described the Dossier as a compilation of memoranda assembled \"for political opponents of Trump by a person who is understood to be a former British Intelligence agent.\" D.E. 1-2 p. 20. The last of the seventeen memoranda (\"Report 166\" or \"the Report\"), dated December 13, 2016, contains statements about Plaintiffs. As published by BuzzFeed, the pertinent portion of the Report appeared as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [redacted] reported that over the period March-September 2016 a company called XBT/Webzilla and its affiliates had been using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data, and conduct \"altering operations\" against the Democratic Party leadership.

In Prague, COHEN\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   agreed [sic] contingency plans for various scenarios to protect the operation, but in particular what was to be done in the event that Hillary CLINTON won the presidency. It was important in this event that all cash payments owed were made quickly and discreetly and that cyber and other operators were stood down/able to go effectively to ground to cover their traces. (We reported earlier that the involvement of political operatives Paul MANAFORT and Carter PAGE in the secret TRUMP-Kremlin liaison had been exposed in the media in the run-up to Prague and that damage limitation of these also was discussed by COHEN with the Kremlin representatives).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   D.E. 1-3 \u00b6 26, D.E. 1-2 p. 19-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Article included the following disclaimers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The dossier, which is a collection of memos written over a period of months, includes specific, unverified, and potentially unverifiable allegations ....

D.E. 1-3 \u00b6 27. Plaintiffs also allege that, although BuzzFeed tasked its reporters with investigating the allegations, Defendants never contacted Plaintiffs to determine whether the allegations that they hacked the Democratic Party had merit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28; D.E. 38 \u00b6 28.

D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 7. Fusion retained Orbis Business Intelligence Limited (\"Orbis\") to investigate business ties between\n   Trump and Russian interests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Orbis was founded by Christopher Steele, who worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 1987 until 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; D.E. 214-19, 31:11-20.

D.E. 214-19, 31:11-20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During the course of his research, Steele received information that Russia was interfering in the 2016 presidential election to support Trump and that Russia held compromising information about the candidate. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 8. Steele took the information he found credible and wrote a total of seventeen reports, which became the Dossier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. In deciding what he found credible, Steele weighed the possibility that his sources might try to provide false information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Government Officials Receive Portions of The Dossier\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to two congressionally drafted memoranda (the \"Nunes Memo\" and \"Schiff Memo\"), Steele had been a \"longtime FBI source\" who had credibly reported on Russia and other matters for several years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10; 214-30 (Nunes Memo); 214-31 (Schiff Memo). Steele shared his research with an FBI agent until late October 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   D.E. 214-2 \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; Nunes Memo, p. 5; Schiff Memo, p. 3. Steele also shared his research with Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr. Nunes Memo, pp. 4-6; Schiff Memo, p 7. However, before receiving Steele's reports, the FBI had opened a counterintelligence investigation into potential links between Russia and the Trump campaign. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 13; Nunes Memo, pp. 4-6; Schiff Memo, pp. 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The FBI terminated its relationship with Steele in October 2016 after Steele spoke with journalists. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 17. Nevertheless, after Steele's termination, an independent unit within the FBI conducted a \"source validation\" assessment of the credibility of Steele's reports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19; Nunes Memo, p. 5. Additionally, the Department of Justice used Steele's reports, as well as other source material, in its applications to obtain and renew a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\") warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, a Trump advisor that the FBI believed had been targeted for recruitment by Russian intelligence. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 46; Nunes Memo, p. 4; D.E. 214-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In November 2016, Senator John McCain and his chief of staff, Christopher Brose, attended the Halifax International Security Forum. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 20. There, they met David Kramer, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State responsible for Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. They also met Sir Andrew Wood, the former British Ambassador to Russia and an informal advisor to Orbis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Wood told the three others that he was aware of information collected by Steele suggesting that Russia both colluded with the Trump campaign and had compromising information about the candidate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. McCain asked Kramer to go to London to meet with Steele, which he did on November 28.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Kramer read the sixteen extant reports (again, Report 166 had not yet been written) in London and later obtained copies of them from Glenn Simpson in Washington, D.C.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 30, Kramer met with McCain and Brose in Washington, D.C., where they reviewed Steele's reports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Kramer advised McCain to share the reports with the FBI and the CIA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Some days after that meeting, at McCain's behest, Kramer met with Victoria Nuland, the Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia Affairs, and Celeste Wallender, the Senior Director for Russian Affairs at the National Security Council (\"NSC\"), to see if the Dossier \"was being taken seriously.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30; D.E. 214-16, 113:1-117:11. The two officials were aware of the existence of the Dossier and of Steele, whom they believed to be credible, but Kramer did not share the Dossier with them. D.E. 214-16, 115:1-117:24. After those meetings, on December 9, McCain met with James Comey, the FBI Director, and gave him the first sixteen reports.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Steele Drafts and Shares Report 166\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On December 13, Steele wrote the last of the seventeen reports, Report 166, which names Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As with the sixteen prior reports, Steele compiled Report 166 using information he found credible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Steele gave Report 166 to Kramer, an unnamed senior British security official, Ms. Wallender at the NSC, Representative Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), and House Speaker Paul Ryan's Chief of Staff, John Burks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-39. The record does not reveal what, if anything, these people did with the Report. At some point prior to BuzzFeed's publication of the full Dossier, the FBI also possessed Report 166.

Former CIA Director John Brennan testified before the Committee that the Dossier was not used as a basis for the ICA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 110 n.47. However, in late December 2016, NSA Director Michael\n   Rogers clarified that a two-page summary of the Dossier was added as an appendix to the ICA and that consideration of the appendix was part of the overall ICA review and approval process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In early January, at some point prior to BuzzFeed's publication of the Dossier, Brennan, Rogers, and former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, briefed President Obama about allegations in the Dossier. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 44; D.E. 214-11 \u00b6 6; HPSCI Report, p. 107. Around the same time, intelligence community officials, including James Comey, briefed President-elect Trump about allegations in the Dossier. HPSCI Report, p. 107; Nunes Memo, p. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n    <em>\n     BuzzFeed Obtains and Publishes the Dossier\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On December 29, 2016, BuzzFeed reporter Ken Bensinger met with David Kramer at the McCain Institute. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 48. Kramer reviewed with Bensinger what he knew about the Dossier and explained that he took the allegations seriously.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bensinger found Kramer to be a serious and credible Russia expert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Kramer showed Bensinger the Dossier and told him that \"some of the information was unverified.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.

Schoofs decided that BuzzFeed should investigate some of the allegations in the Dossier and tasked reporters with doing that.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53. BuzzFeed did not, however, investigate any of the allegations concerning Plaintiffs. D.E. 234-5, p. 124. Neither did BuzzFeed attempt to contact Plaintiffs. D.E. 287-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On January 10, 2017, CNN reported the existence of the Dossier, the preparation and presentation of the two-page synopsis, the presidential briefings, and that the FBI was investigating the credibility of the allegations contained in the Dossier. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 55. The CNN article did not mention Plaintiffs. D.E. 214-5, pp. 10-12. After seeing the CNN article, Bensinger and Ben Smith decided to publish the Dossier with their own article on the BuzzFeed website. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 56. Smith knew that some of the allegations in the Dossier were unproven and that readers could reasonably doubt their veracity. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 59. Consistent with his concerns, BuzzFeed stated that the Dossier \"includes specific, unverified, and potentially unverifiable allegations ....\" D.E. 1-2, pp. 19-21. BuzzFeed also included a hyperlink to the CNN article and explained that CNN reported \"that the two-page synopsis of the report was given to President Obama and Trump.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   About three hours after publishing its article, BuzzFeed revised it by adding statements from the President-elect, Kellyanne Conway, and Michael Cohen denying the Dossier's claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. BuzzFeed also redacted information pertaining to one source named in the Dossier, but Smith refused to redact other sources because he thought the Dossier was of grave national importance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. In early February, 2017, BuzzFeed redacted Plaintiffs' names from the Dossier as it appeared on BuzzFeed's website. D.E. 287-1, pp. 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants removed this case from the Circuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida, on February 28, 2017. D.E. 1. On June 29, 2018, Defendants answered Plaintiffs' one count complaint for defamation. D.E. 38. In their answer, Defendants asserted affirmative defenses including the fair report privilege and the neutral report privilege.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants also asserted as an affirmative defense,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' status as public figures who, therefore, could not prove that the Defendants acted with actual malice when they published the Dossier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   During discovery and at the Court's invitation, Plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to Defendants' two privilege defenses: the neutral report privilege and the fair report privilege. D.E. 115. In deciding that motion, the Court ruled that New York law, rather than Florida law, governed these affirmative defenses. The Court further ruled that New York law does not recognize the neutral report privilege, and so granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to that affirmative defense. D.E. 171, pp. 19-21. As to the fair report privilege, the Court denied the motion because it could not \"conclude as a matter of law that the Article [was] other than a fair and true report of an official proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 18. In deciding that motion, the Court took as true the allegations in the Complaint and drew all reasonable inferences in Defendants' favor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   pp. 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Discovery closed on June 15, 2017, although certain discovery requests to and disputes with non-parties remained pending through the end of July. Thereafter, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. D.E. 208, 225, 214/226. Both parties moved for summary judgment on Defendants' affirmative defense that Plaintiffs were public figures at the time of the alleged defamation. Defendants also moved for summary judgment on their defense of the fair report privilege and on the elements of Plaintiffs' claim, arguing that the allegedly libelous statements were not defamatory and that Plaintiffs could not prove the requisite degree of fault necessary to sustain their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Summary judgment is authorized only when the moving party meets its burden of demonstrating that \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

They are correct about the record, to a point. Intelligence community officials including Directors Brennan, Rogers, Clapper, and Comey briefed the President and President-elect about allegations in the Dossier. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 44; HPSCI Report, p. 107; Nunes Memo, p. 5. The FBI conducted a \"source validation\" assessment of the Dossier. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 19; Nunes Memo, p. 5. And the DOJ used the Dossier with other information to obtain and renew a FISA warrant directed at Carter Page. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 46; Nunes Memo, p. 4; D.E. 214-33. But missing from the record is whether the particular allegations about Plaintiffs were specifically the subject of these official actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendants cannot claim the privilege for that very reason. They emphasize that the Dossier is not a single document but, rather, a collection of seventeen reports. And although the FBI admitted that it had a copy of Report 166 prior to BuzzFeed's publication of the full Dossier, the record does not reveal what, if any, official action was taken with respect to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 214-11 \u00b6 6. Similarly, although the FBI admitted that President Obama was briefed about the Dossier, the record does not reveal whether information from Report 166 was part of that briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=399%20N.E.2d%201185\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants cannot claim the privilege as a matter of law because they cannot show conclusively that the allegedly defamatory statements themselves were subject to official action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As discovery has fleshed out the facts, the issue of whether there was official action with respect to the specific allegations about Plaintiffs has taken on more importance than previously. Distilled to its essence, Defendants' motion turns on the\n   following question: may Defendants claim the privilege's protection when the record reveals that certain parts of the Dossier were subject to official action but does not reveal whether the specific allegations about Plaintiffs were subject to official action? For the reasons discussed below, the answer is: yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court begins again with the text Section 74. The second paragraph of that statute exempts from the privilege \"anything said or done at the time and place of such a proceeding which was not a part thereof.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Civ.%20Rights%20Law%20%C2%A7%2074\">\n    N.Y. Civ. Rights Law \u00a7 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on this provision, Plaintiffs take the position that Defendants must show that the particular statements about them were subject to official proceedings. But Defendants respond that New York law does not require that level of granularity; they have satisfied their burden by showing that the Dossier was subject to official action. Alternatively, they argue that they have satisfied their burden because they have shown that parts of Report 166 were subject to official action (namely, those portions concerning Carter Page, and those concerning Russian connections with the Trump campaign) and that is sufficient to protect their publication of the whole Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   How close the connection between the challenged Report and the official proceeding must be \"has not been clearly defined.\"\n   <em>\n    Fine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215986\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/11/209/\">\n    11 F.Supp.3d at 216-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the Report discusses allegations of cooperation between Trump's \"team\" and Russian operatives. D.E. 1-2 pp. 19-21. And, as described in the Nunes and Schiff Memos, the FBI was investigating those connections. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6 13; Nunes Memo, pp. 4-6; Schiff Memo, pp. 2-3. Second, Report 166 references earlier reports in the Dossier about Carter Page's alleged relationship with Russian intelligence. D.E. 1-2 p. 19 (\"We reported earlier that the involvement of political operatives Paul MANAFORT and Carter PAGE in the secret TRUMP-Kremlin liaison had been exposed by the media in the run-up to Prague and that damage limitation of these was also discussed by COHEN with the Kremlin representatives.\"). The FBI was investigating whether Carter Page was recruited by Russian intelligence, the\n   DOJ obtained a FISA warrant to surveil him, and, in January 2017, the DOJ sought renewal of that warrant based, in part, on information contained in the Dossier. D.E. 214-2 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 46; Nunes Memo, p. 4; D.E. 214-33. Those portions of Report 166, therefore, are plainly covered by the privilege. And in accordance with Section 74's broad construction and the degree of liberality which a media report is afforded, so too, by extension, is the remainder of the Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215986\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/11/209/\">\n    11 F.Supp.3d at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs have cited to a number of cases in support of their argument that line-by-line scrutiny of Report 166 is required, but those cases are factually distinct and unpersuasive.

To go line-by-line to determine if official action existed with respect to each statement in Report 166 would not impose on BuzzFeed a duty to faithfully recount official proceedings, but instead, would impose on BuzzFeed a duty to investigate extensively the allegations of the Dossier and to determine whether the government was investigating each separate allegation.

Plaintiffs' argument here overlaps substantially with their argument that Defendants cannot show that there was an official proceeding. They argue that because Defendants cannot show that the particular statements about Plaintiffs were subject to official action, Defendants' decision to publish the Dossier leads the average reader to mistakenly believe that the allegations about Plaintiffs were taken more seriously by government officials than they actually were.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. pp. 3-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the Article falsely elevates the importance of the allegations by collectively referring to the Dossier as \"the documents\" without distinguishing between all of the individual reports. They point out that the Article says that former Senator Harry Reid had seen \"the documents\" before sending a letter to the FBI, but Reid did not see Report 166 when he sent that letter because it had not been written yet. D.E. 235-5, p. 143. Additionally, they point out that the hyperlinked CNN article reported that Senator McCain provided James Comey with a \"full\" copy of the Dossier, but the record shows that at the time McCain passed the Dossier to Comey, Report 166 had not been written. Accordingly, they argue that the Article conveys the false impression that government officials took the allegations about Plaintiffs more seriously than they really did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   This argument is unavailing for at least two reasons. First, as the Court ruled in the order on the motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Article does not editorialize; it simply reproduces the Dossier. D.E. 171, p. 14. Second, Plaintiffs' cases in support of their false-by-implication argument are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Karedes v.

At the meeting, the board released an audit of the town's golf course, which found that the plaintiff-manager had directed the town to pay invoices billed to another entity. At the town meeting, the auditor clarified that the bills in question likely were, in fact, the town's bills, but that the vendors had erroneously printed the name of the other entity on them. Nevertheless, the article reported that the plaintiff had caused the town to pay more than $170,000, which should have been paid by the other entity. On these facts, the Court refused to afford the defendants the protection of the fair report privilege. The Court explained, \"[s]ection 74 does not afford protection if the specific statements at issue, considered in their context, suggest more serious conduct than that actually suggested in the official proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3861892\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/876/211/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Karedes\n   </em>\n   and the others like it that Plaintiffs cite are not analogous to the present case. This case does not involve a summary and misstatement of an official proceeding that attributes to Plaintiffs misconduct beyond that alleged in the Dossier. Here, BuzzFeed published the Dossier without editorializing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 171, p. 14. The Article did not, therefore, make any misstatements about the allegations against Plaintiffs.

D.E. 171, pp. 16-18. Analysis of the sufficiency of the hyperlink did not require facts beyond those already in the record, and so the Court's ruling on that issue was final.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aguirre v.

There, the Supreme Court of Nevada held that a hyperlink to source material about an official proceeding rendered a report privileged provided the hyperlink was conspicuous.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=402%20P.3d%20665\">\n    402 P.3d at 669-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finding that\n   <em>\n    Adelson\n   </em>\n   aligned with modern journalistic principles, the Court adopted its reasoning. D.E. 171, p. 17. The Court went on to find that the hyperlink in the Article was conspicuous because \"[i]t appears in the body of the Article, within the words 'CNN reported,' which are written in blue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=402%20P.3d%20665\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In their opposition, Plaintiffs essentially move for reconsideration of that ruling on the grounds that the hyperlink in\n   <em>\n    Adelson\n   </em>\n   was materially different than the hyperlink here and that the hyperlink here was not, in fact, conspicuous. Plaintiffs' first argument is that because the CNN article did not reveal any official action as to the specific allegations in the Dossier concerning Plaintiffs, it was materially different from the hyperlinked article in\n   <em>\n    Adelson\n   </em>\n   . This is the same argument Plaintiffs raised with respect to each preceding element of the privilege, and the Court rejects it for the same reason. BuzzFeed is not required to show that there was official action with respect to each specific allegation concerning Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiffs' second argument is that BuzzFeed was required to underline the hyperlink; it was not sufficient to merely put it in blue. Plaintiffs cite no cases standing for the proposition that a hyperlink must conform to such strict formatting requirements to be conspicuous. Cases (outside the defamation context)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   have recognized that hyperlinks are typically blue and underlined, but they uniformly take a totality-of-the-circumstances approach when determining whether a hyperlink is conspicuous.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plazza v.

The hyperlink here is the same size as the text around it, it appears in the body of the text rather than hidden somewhere at the bottom or side, and it is the only blue text in the paragraph in which it appears.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 234-5, p. 143. Additionally, it is apparent from the face of Article that BuzzFeed used blue text to link to sources. The words that BuzzFeed chose to print in blue naturally suggest an outside link:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \u2022 \"CNN Reported ....\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \u2022 \"Now BuzzFeed News is publishing the full document ....\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \u2022 \"Michael Cohen, told\n   <em>\n    Mic\n   </em>\n   ....\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \u2022 \"Kellyanne Conway[ ] also denied the claims during an appearance on\n   <em>\n    Late Night with Seth Meyers\n   </em>\n   ....\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \u2022 \"David Corn referred to the documents in a late October column\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265860\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/454/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Lastly, at the end of the Article, BuzzFeed wrote: \"To send us information confidentially, go here.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265860\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/454/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The blue \"here\" is obviously a hyperlink and so underscores that the other blue words are also.

Additionally, because the privilege is absolute, the Court does not address Defendant's other arguments,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Plaintiffs cannot prove (1) that Defendants made a defamatory statement or (2) acted with the requisite degree of fault.
