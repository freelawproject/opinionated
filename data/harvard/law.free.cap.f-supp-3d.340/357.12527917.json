D. Mem. at 17. Nonetheless, based on the inordinate amount of preparation time billed by Eisenman to appear at a four minute hearing (2.5 hours),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Roth Decl. \u00b6 8, we reduce his preparation time to 1.0\n   hour, and allow a total of 4.0 hours for his time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We thus are left with a claim of 92.4 hours by DeCrescenzo, which is the lion's share of the fee claim for the administrative hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We have considered each side's arguments regarding these hours along with the contemporaneous time records. We have also examined the transcripts of the hearings (to the extent any portions have been put in the record) and documents in the record that were presented by plaintiff and DOE. Having done so, we are not persuaded that the full amount of time sought by plaintiff would be appropriately awarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Paramount in our consideration is that notwithstanding the holding of six hearings, only two of them involved witness testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Roth Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-10; Exhibits A through F (copies of the hearing transcripts filed as Docket ## 33-1 to 33-6); D. Mem. at 3, 9. Two of the hearings largely involved submitting written exhibits and scheduling issues and lasted less than an hour each. D. Mem. at 2-3; Roth Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. The remaining two hearings lasted five minutes or less. D. Mem. at 3; Roth Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The hearing on September 29, 2016, for example, lasted five minutes and was conducted by telephone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of hearing held on September 29, 2016 (filed as Docket # 33-3). The transcript shows that the telephonic appearance was arranged by email prior to the hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64. The time records reflect that this email was sent either on September 22 or September 26.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Table of Services Rendered, at *2. Yet 5.5 hours were billed between the September 26 email and the September 29 hearing for conversations with the client, \"[p]relitigation work,\" and time identified as \"prepar[ing] for [the September 29] hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is excessive for a five minute hearing. We cite this only as an example. In all, there were more than 20 hours that appear to be attributable to preparation for the hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Of equal concern, the time records identify some tasks simply as \"pre-litigation work\" and variants of \"prepar[ing]\" for the hearing - which occurs in a number of entries, see entries of 9/29/16, 9/27/16, 8/22/16, 8/19/16 in Table of Services Rendered, at *1-2, totaling more than 10 hours. Such descriptions hamper this Court's review because they do not indicate what specific tasks were accomplished - for example, a conversation with a witness to prepare for hearing testimony, a conversation with an adversary, the drafting of an identified letter or brief, reading or summarizing medical records, or the drafting of a direct examination outline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In some instances, it may be that the statement referring to \"prepar[ing]\" for a hearing was intended to cover more specific entries that are listed in the same description. But at least one time entry (9/27/16 for 3.5 hours) refers to hearing preparation with no other descriptions of tasks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   And even where a description of \"prep[aration]\" for a hearing is followed by\n   more specific descriptions, the task descriptions are aggregated together into a single block of time so that it is impossible to tell what amount of time is allocated to each task. Time entries of this type are commonly referred to as \"block billing\" - that is, the aggregation of a number of tasks in a single time entry. Because block billing interferes with the ability of a court to evaluate the reasonableness of attorney hours, its use often results in a reduction of fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Erickson Prods., Inc. v.

Thus, plaintiff may obtain additional fees only for the period of November 15, 2017, through April 3, 2018, which is the time period during which the fee application case was initially filed and before the initial pretrial conference was held in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(D)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based on the records provided to this Court, the hours claimed in the period are 1.9 hours of DeCrescenzo, 20.1 hours of Ben Brown, and 0.5 hours of paralegal Charlene Lolis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Table of Services Rendered, at *1-2 (DeCrescenzo), *3-5 (Brown), and *5-6 (Lolis).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants point to the fact that Gina DeCrescenzo, P.C. has filed similar fee applications in the past and thus the time to draft the complaint in this matter was excessive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.

We agree that there are numerous similarities in fee application complaints filed by Gina DeCrescenzo, P.C., in other cases and in this case.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Complaint filed in\n   <em>\n    B.B.\n   </em>\n   , 17 Civ. 4255, filed June 6, 2017 (Docket # 1),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Complaint filed in\n   <em>\n    P.R.\n   </em>\n   , 17 Civ. 4887, filed June 28, 2017 (Docket # 1)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Complaint filed in\n   <em>\n    O.R.\n   </em>\n   , filed December 21, 2017 (Docket # 1). In light of the similarities, it should not have taken a large number of hours to draft the complaint. At the same time, we commend DeCrescenzo for putting a junior attorney on the fee application, and thus we fully understand why it\n   might have taken him some time to review the administrative record in this case to get a firm grasp of the justification for fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In the end, given the relatively small amount of hours expended during the limited time period for which fees may be sought, and given the fact that we are awarding no more than approximately 18% of the main fee award, we find this a case in which it is fair to do \"rough justice,\"\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450131,5932835\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/826/\">\n    563 U.S. at 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450131,5932835\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/826/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and simply award the total amount claimed through April 3, 2018.

DeCrescenzo Decl. \u00b6 28; Brown Decl. \u00b6 3. The record is not so clear that anyone with personal knowledge has attested that Duffin's and Eisenman's time records are actually based on contemporaneous time entries. DeCrescenzo states only that their records are \"consistent with the work\" that she observed them performing,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    DeCrescenzo Decl. \u00b6 29, and that the \"time\" of Duffin and Eisenman \"was contemporaneously kept as part of [DeCrescenzo]'s firm's regular business practices,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 30. The DOE has made no objection to the contemporaneous aspect of these records, however; accordingly, we do not address the issue further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    An additional 2.5 hours was billed on September 29 apparently after the hearing for \"[p]re-litigation work; review evidence binder, create notes and outline.\" Table of Services Rendered, at *1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    We would normally not fault the 7/22/16 entry that reads \"[p]repare opening statement ... for Monday,\" as it is a specific explanation of the litigation task performed.
