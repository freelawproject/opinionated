Thus, Rongstad \"made rounds each day to check on the progress of the remediation by vendors, often visiting buildings under repair multiple times in the same day.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. As an insurance adjuster for VeriClaim, Rongstad reported to Scott Chambers, who was the lead adjuster in charge of the Escambia County loss and who, in turn, reported directly to the insurance carriers. Pls.' 56.1 Statement \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After being retained as the insurance adjuster, VeriClaim, upon obtaining authorization, engaged Madsen Kneppers &amp; Associates (\"MKA\") to \"clerk the works\" for the Escambia County loss.

Rongstad elaborated that the challenges faced included \"[h]ow to restore 19 buildings and the services they provide. Inmate housing, juvenile detention housing[,] [w]hat to do with these people, where to put them ... how many counties over are we going to use? This was a huge challenge.

Generally, there were about twenty total attendees at the daily meeting. Rongstad Dep. at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Notwithstanding the overarching purpose of the daily meeting, Jennifer Hoyal (StopLoss/SouthernCAT), who attended the daily meeting during the first week of the flood response, Hoyal Dep. at 38, stated that in her view the meeting\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   was like walking into a buzz saw every time we went in ... where it felt like we were being gunned for ... Usually those meetings are productive. There's a productive element to the meeting ... [but] [t]he meetings just didn't play out that way. It was more we walk in and there was a lot of accusations thrown about what we were or weren't getting done and then we would say, no, that is complete ... It was a very abrasive ... very confrontational [ ] and we really didn't understand why. We had never worked with [Rongstad] before [and] we didn't know why he was so confrontational with us and really seemed to be trying to get us thrown off the project is what it seemed like [to me].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. In addition, Nathan Brooks (StopLoss/SouthernCAT), when asked how he would \"describe Mr. Rongstad's demeanor when he interacted with you and John Lewis at [the daily] meetings\" stated that Rongstad appeared \"[p]ut out, disgusted,\n   aggravated\" and that he was not able to \"think of one time that [Rongstad] said something reasonable or nice or kind.\" Brooks Dep. at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   However, Michael Cox (MKA), when asked to describe the interactions between Rongstad and John Lewis during the daily meeting, stated that the exchanges between the two \"were civil\" but that \"this was an extremely tense situation [and] [t]here was a lot of pressure to perform for everyone involved, and so it was a very intense situation in my opinion.\" Cox Dep. at 25. In addition, Cox stated that he did not \"recall any arguing or ... foulness or anything like that [but that he] just recall[ed] there was a bit of tension in the air because everyone was under a lot of pressure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Likewise, Cox noted that \"Tom Rongstad expressed a lot of frustration during this process with not only StopLoss but contractors, with the County [and] with brokers [because] [t]here was a lot of stress going on.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to Nathan Brooks (StopLoss/SouthernCAT) and John Lewis (StopLoss), during the daily meeting, Rongstad accused StopLoss of: (1) not having enough employees; (2) having too many employees; (3) not having enough equipment and (4) not having completed certain tasks. Pls.' 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 24-27. However, Lewis was given a chance to respond to these allegations. Lewis Dep. at 76 (stating that \"I told [Rongstad] I didn't know where his information was being gathered from, but I had more than sufficient manpower and more than sufficient equipment to do every loss that they had simultaneously ... [s]o I rebutted [Rongstad's allegations] straight away.\"). In addition to these accusations, during one daily meeting Rongstad \"displayed on his computer a picture of 50-60 StopLoss employees standing/sitting [idle], apparently doing nothing [and] Lewis had to explain to Rongstad and the other [meeting] attendees, including Escambia County, that StopLoss personnel take breaks and lunch at the same time, and the employees in the picture were on break.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although Rongstad, who was employed by VeriClaim, had \"no authority to remove StopLoss from the project,\" meeting attendees who were affiliated with StopLoss concluded that Rongstad's remarks and behavior were levied in order \"to get the County to fire StopLoss and bring in a different company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hoyal Dep. at 44 (stating that she remembered Rongstad stating during a meeting that \"I've got people who can get this done, they're not getting it done, kind of in [ ] general. I don't remember specifically the words he used, but that was generally what he said....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addressing what Rongstad perceived to be StopLoss' inadequate level of equipment, he stated that \"[a]bsolutely. They did not\" and added that he \"had several\" other companies who possessed the necessary equipment including \"BELFOR, Complete DKI [and] SERVPRO.\" Rongstad Dep. at 37. Rongstad clarified that \"they all had generators, and they were willing to drop them off [with] me at any time to help StopLoss do their job, as they were hired to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, both Brooks and Lewis interpreted Rongstad's remarks as \"offer[ing] up his own solution, another company.\" Brooks Dep. at 31;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Lewis Dep. at 130 (stating that Rongstad recommended \"a competitor, a much larger competitor, in an open meeting with all the participants we described earlier.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 129 (stating that he perceived Rongstad's accusations and comments as being made in order to \"try[ ] to get [StopLoss] thrown off the job\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Rongstad's Inspections of the Sheriff's Warehouse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   During the eighth or ninth day of the drying process, Rongstad visited the Sheriff's Warehouse. Defs.' 56.1 Statement\n   \u00b6 39.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Sheriff's Warehouse consisted of a concrete floor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. By this point in the drying process, Rongstad had \"viewed the building as largely done\" such that he was curious at the \"magnitude of people inside and outside the building.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Upon entering the building, Rongstad observed that \"the floor appeared to be wet.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. After making this observation, Rongstad \"asked a StopLoss employee ... why the concrete was still wet so long into the remediation and was told that 'water must be wicking up from the ground through the concrete.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. As Rongstad had not previously heard of this type of issue, he \"decided to visit [the building] more frequently to learn about it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The following morning, Rongstad returned to conduct a further inspection of the Sheriff's Warehouse as well as the Evidence Room.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Upon entering the Sheriff's Warehouse, Rongstad \"witnessed one [StopLoss] worker dumping water from a five-gallon bucket onto the floor, two other workers using squeegees to move the water, and a magnitude of people in the room.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rongstad Dep. at 50-54; Lewis Dep., Exhibit (\"Ex.\") 6 (sign-in sheet for May 10, 2014 reflecting 28 workers assigned to the Sheriff's Warehouse and Evidence Room building). After making this discovery, Rongstad \"concluded that the concrete was getting wet again because people were pouring water on it\" as opposed to \"water wicking up through concrete as had been represented to him\" the previous day. Defs.' 56.1 Statement \u00b6 50. According to Rongstad, the bucket's contents \"appeared to be clear water, with no soap bubbles or smell.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. However, despite having a camera on hand in order to document his observations, Rongstad did not take a photo of what he observed because he \"didn't want to document what [he] saw\" because he \"was shocked\" and it \"[w]as too horrible to document [ ] with a camera.\" Rongstad Dep. at 50. In addition, he did not ask any of the StopLoss employees what they doing because he \"became extremely disappointed\" and simply \"turned around and left.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53. At some point after leaving the Sheriff's Warehouse, Rongstad initiated what he perceived to be an investigation by \"[r]eporting to MKA, asking if [ ] anybody had seen [the incident] ... expressing what [he] saw to MKA, and then delegating [to] them [the task of] finish[ing] the investigation in order to stop [the incident] from happening over and over again.\" Rongstad Dep. at 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    E.
