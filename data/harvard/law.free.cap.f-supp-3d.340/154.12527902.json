(\"Defendant\" or \"Spirit\") asserting state law claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and fraud. Plaintiffs allege Defendant, an air carrier, misled Plaintiffs into believing they were purchasing a low airfare at a specific price, and thereafter breached the agreement by requiring Plaintiffs to pay additional fees for carry-on baggage. Defendant now moves to dismiss\n   the action under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on the grounds that Plaintiffs' claims are preempted by federal law and fail to allege a viable cause of action. The Court held oral argument on this motion on October 31, 2018, and the Court reserved its decision. For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion to dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are twenty-two individuals who purchased airfare to travel to various locations within the United States on Spirit Airlines between 2012 and 2016. Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 13-32, ECF No. 60. Plaintiffs purchased their airline tickets exclusively through third-party online travel agents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 13-32. Plaintiffs allege, at the time of purchase, they were not aware that Spirit charges additional fees for carry-on bags, which Plaintiffs allege they believed were included in the rate for their air travel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-32, 39-40, 42. Plaintiffs first learned of the unexpected carry-on fees after they arrived at the airport and were forced to pay exorbitant fees that were equal to a significant portion of the ticket price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 13-32, 41. Plaintiffs allege the carry-on fees were \"unanticipated\" and \"unforeseen,\" and Plaintiffs were \"unaware\" of them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. They allege they were not aware of the additional fees because third-party agents \"withhold the information regarding the surprise carry-on payments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Moreover, Plaintiffs allege Spirit \"does not make its fee structure clear ... at the time of purchase\" and withholds \"certain material facts regarding the total pricing of a flight.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs assert state law claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-57. Plaintiffs seek to bring these claims on behalf of \"all persons who contracted with Spirit Airlines to travel on Spirit Airlines flights during the period extending from August 31, 2011 through and to the filing of this Complaint and who were required to pay additional fees for carry-on items and bags over and above the contracted amount.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant now moves to dismiss the action under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing Plaintiffs' claims are preempted by federal law and fail to allege a viable cause of action.

SAC \u00b6\u00b6 39-40. However, Plaintiffs do not base their claim on any agreement made by Spirit. Indeed, by Plaintiffs' own admission, Spirit did not agree to free carry-on baggage. Plaintiffs readily acknowledge there was only an agreement as to \"the price term, destination and dates of travel, and no other terms were either disclosed or made part of the contract.\" Opp'n at 14-15. Plaintiffs purport to input their own subjective \"understanding\" of airline fee structures and their \"expectation that a carry on bag was included in the contracted price\" to assume Spirit \"voluntarily\" undertook this obligation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, 14-15. While Plaintiffs' subjective belief may be relevant in assessing and\n   imposing obligations under state law, the ADA does not permit a claim based on state law obligations. Rather, the ADA only allows claims based on Spirit's agreement with Plaintiffs, not what Plaintiffs believed should have been included in the agreement. Moreover, Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim relies on their allegation that the carry-on fees were \"unanticipated\" and \"unforeseen\" and they were \"unaware\" of them-not that a term of the agreement stating there would be no carry-on fees was breached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim does not seek to enforce the terms of the agreement between the parties, but instead depends on an \"enlargement or enhancement\" of the scope of that agreement and is therefore preempted by the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
