The first concerns the legal enforceability of the debts that student borrowers owe the Department. The States have not shown that their laws apply when the Department certifies those debts as enforceable for the purposes of complying with its obligations under federal law. The second concerns defenses against enforcement that students may raise. The Department's borrower defense adjudication does implicate state law.
