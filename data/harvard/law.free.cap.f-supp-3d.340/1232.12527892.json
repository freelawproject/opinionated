As Sheriff, Dorning's duties include (1) managing and operating the Madison County Jail (\"Jail\") and (2) providing services that tend to inmates' needs, including housing, food, and medical care. A November 2000 consent decree binds Dorning to provide constitutionally adequate medical care to the Jail's inmates, and Dorning utilizes funding from the County to comply with the consent decree's requirements. (Doc. 95-11 at 3-23). The County retains a statutory duty to fund the operation of the Jail through the Sheriff's budget, which includes funding at a necessary level to provide constitutionally adequate medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2002, Dr. Norman Johnson (\"Johnson\") founded Advanced Correctional Health Care, Inc. (\"ACH\"). ACH provides healthcare in seventeen (17) states at approximately three-hundred (300) correctional facilities, serving as the largest privately-owned provider of correctional healthcare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 29, 2005, Dorning and the County (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to administer a comprehensive, healthcare services system at the Jail. (Doc. 95-9 at 27). The RFP indicated that the selected provider would serve as the sole supplier of healthcare services, and the coordinator of the healthcare delivery system, at the Jail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28). The RFP required that the selected provider carry \"acceptable professional liability insurance providing coverage for claims including professional liability, negligence, and claims asserted pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ... and name Madison County, the Sheriff, and their agents and employees as additional insureds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34). The RFP also required that the selected provider \"indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Sheriff, Madison County and any and all of their agents and employees from any claims arising from the delivery of healthcare services to inmates at the [Jail].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    ACH and Plaintiffs Enter into a Health Services Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ACH, along with several other companies, responded to the RFP. Although the County rejected ACH's first proposal, the County subsequently engaged ACH to negotiate a contract for the provision of healthcare at the Jail. The discussions between ACH and the County culminated in a Health Services Agreement in July 2006 (\"Agreement\"). (Doc. 94-2 at 8 through Doc. 94-3 at 12). The parties subsequently renewed the Agreement on May 1, 2009 (Doc. 95-11 at 33-49); May 1, 2012 (Doc. 95-11 at 51 through Doc. 95-12 at 18); and February 1, 2014. (Doc. 95-13 at 2-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   All versions of the Agreement state that ACH would serve as the \"sole supplier of healthcare services (including pharmacy) and coordinator of the healthcare delivery system\" at the Jail. (Doc. 94-2 at 8; Doc. 95-11 at 33, Doc. 95-11 at 51; Doc. 95-13 at 2). The Agreement required ACH to \"develop, manage and staff a comprehensive healthcare services system,\" yet Dorning retained responsibility for the Jail's operations. (Doc. 94-2 at 8-9; Doc. 95-11 at 33-34;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Doc. 95-11 at 51-52; Doc. 95-13 at 2-3). Additionally, the Agreement stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   6. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS: The Sheriff requires and ACH represents and warrants that it will meet certain minimum requirements. At a minimum, ACH will strictly comply with the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ......\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   B.

Madison County and the Sheriff shall be additional named insureds on the aforesaid policies of insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Doc. 94-2 at 9; Doc. 95-11 at 34; Doc. 95-11 at 52; Doc. 95-13 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Agreement accorded that \"[a]s between insurance coverage provided by other sources to the above named entities and individuals and ACH's insurance coverage, ACH's insurance coverage shall be primary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Agreement also required ACH to furnish the Madison County Administrator with a copy of ACH's insurance policy obtained in compliance with the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Furthermore, it provided that \"all claims, litigation costs, attorney fees and any judgment or settlement money will be paid by ACH\" should \"ACH's insurance provider withdraw coverage or become insolvent.\" (Doc. 94-2 at 10; Doc. 95-11 at 35; Doc. 95-12 at 1; Doc. 95-13 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Agreement also contained bilateral indemnification provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   D. INDEMNIFICATION:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ACH agrees to indemnify and save harmless Madison County, and the Sheriff, and their respective supervisors, agents, officers, employees, and officials from and against any and all liability, loss, damages, interest, judgments and liens growing out of any and all costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees and disbursements) arising out of or incurred in connections with any and all claims, demands, suits, actions or proceedings, which may be brought against Madison County, the Sheriff, respective supervisors, agents, officers, employees, and officials by reason of, or as the result of (1) acts or omissions of ACH, its agents, servants, or employees related in any way to or while in the performance of this Agreement; (2) any allegations of an act or omission, conduct or misconduct, of ACH, its agents, servants or employees not included in the paragraph above and for which the County, the Sheriff, or their agents, servants, or employees are alleged to be liable; and (3) any allegation of employment discrimination by an ACH employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Madison County and the Sheriff agree to indemnify and save harmless ACH from and against any and all liability, loss, damages, interest, judgments and liens growing out of any and all costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees and disbursements) arising out of or incurred in connection with any and all claims, demands, suits, actions or proceedings, which may be brought against ACH by reason of, or as the result of (1) acts or omissions of Madison County, the Sheriff, or their respective supervisors, agents, officers, employees, and officials related in any way to or while in the performance of this Agreement; (2) any allegations of an act or omission, conduct or misconduct, of Madison County, the Sheriff,\n   or their respective supervisors, agents, officers, employees, and officials not included in paragraph above and for which ACH is alleged to be liable; and (3) any allegation of employment discrimination by Madison County, the Sheriff, or their respective supervisors, agents, officers, employees, and officials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Jeffrey Rich (\"Rich\"), the County's attorney, drafted the aforementioned insurance and indemnification provisions in the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties understood that ACH agreed to defend and indemnify claims related to ACH's provision of healthcare services. (Doc. 95-1 at 112, ll. 19-22). On June 27, 2006, ACH acquired a Certificate of Liability Insurance that designated the Jail as the Certificate Holder and included Madison County as \"additional insured under the General Liability if required by contract in writing.\" (Doc. 95-13 at 24). An updated Certificate in September 2006 stated that \"Madison County Jail, AL and the Madison County Sheriff's Office, AL are included as additional insured under the General Liability and Professional Liability coverage if required by contract in writing. Coverage applies to operations in correctional facilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). However, Rich objected that these two entities were not legal entities and requested a name change. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A November 2006 Certificate added the Jail and the Sheriff of Madison County as \"additional insured\" under the General Liability, Professional Liability, and Civil Rights Liability coverage \"if required by contract in writing.\" (Doc. 95-13 at 26). Furthermore, the Certificate limited the coverage to ACH operations in correctional facilities only. This language consistently remained in the yearly-renewed Certificates through July 2014. (Doc. 95-1 at 104-07; Doc. 95-10 at 32, 34; Doc. 95-13 at 26, 28, 29, 30, 31; Doc. 96-6 at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The County retained insurance through Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company, an affiliate of OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd. (\"OneBeacon\"), to cover claims against the County, Dorning, and other County officials that stem from alleged acts or omissions by the County, Dorning, and other County officials. OneBeacon's policy contains a Law Enforcement Liability Endorsement, which enacts a \"Transfer of Rights of Recovery Against Others to Us\" clause providing as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   If any insured has rights to recover all or part of any payment we have made under this Coverage Part, those rights are transferred to us. The insured must do nothing after loss to impair them. At our request, the insured will bring \"suit\" or transfer those rights to us and help us enforce them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Doc. 93-8 at 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Johnson sent several letters to Dorning updating him on the progress ACH employees undertook in the Jail to comply with the Agreement. (Doc. 95-10 at 8-14). Between 2006 and 2014, Plaintiffs expressed no concerns regarding the medical care ACH provided. (Doc. 95-1 at 33). On January 5, 2011, Rich sent a letter to Jefferson County Sheriff Mike Hale, recommending ACH's services \"without reservation.\" (Doc. 95-14 at 2-3). Rich praised ACH's ability to \"improve the healthcare of the offenders housed in [the] facility, while controlling the medical costs and providing risk management.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    ACH Procures Insurance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In June 2006, Rich, the County Attorney, requested assurance from ACH that it would acquire insurance in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Specifically,\n   Rich requested that the insurance include Madison County, the Madison County Sheriff, and their employees as additional insureds. ACH endeavored with its insurance broker, Rob Bielenberg of Callender &amp; Co. in Peoria, Illinois, to procure insurance through Essex Insurance Company (\"Evanston\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Evanston has no employees, and Markel Services, Inc., (\"Markel\") serves as Evanston's claims manager. (Doc. 96-4 at 6-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Beginning in July 2006, ACH procured and maintained general liability, professional liability, and medical malpractice insurance at its own expense. ACH's insurance covered professional and medical liability, negligence, and claims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1983. Furthermore, as the Agreement required, ACH maintained policy limits of one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and three million dollars ($3,000,000) aggregate. Although ACH eventually procured insurance, Bielenberg informed Johnson of the difficulties in acquiring insurance that complied with the Agreement. (Doc. 95-10 at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On May 31, 2013, ACH submitted an Application for Locum Tenens and Contract Staffing Organizations Professional and General Liability to Evanston. (Doc. 94-9 at 1). As part of its application, ACH included a copy of its standard template contract. (Doc. 94-11 at 15 - Doc. 94-13 at 1). ACH's standard template contract does not contain the required insurance coverage terms found in the Agreement's Section 6(B). As a result of the application, Evanston issued ACH a claims-made insurance policy for \"Locum Tenens and Contract Staffing Professional Liability Insurance\" (\"Policy\") for the policy period of August 1, 2013, to August 1, 2014. (Doc. 94-4 at 19). Evanston then renewed the Policy with a policy period of August 1, 2014, to August 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Policy provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   INSURING AGREEMENT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A.\n   <strong>\n    Professional Liability and Claims Made Clause:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The Company shall pay on behalf of the Insured all sums in excess of the Deductible amount stated in the Declarations, which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as Damages as a result of Claims first made against the Insured during the Policy Period or during the Extended Reporting Period, if exercised, and reported to the Company pursuant to Section Claims A., Claim Reporting Provision:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   1. under Coverage A.

Upon review of the blood sample, the Sheriff's Department incorrectly told Moore that he tested positive for a sexually transmitted disease. Despite his insistence that the test could not be accurate, the defendants ordered Moore to visit the Madison County Health Department and receive treatment for his STD. Moore's wife also commenced treatment at the Madison County Health Department and took medication for two weeks, causing adverse side effects for her.

(Doc. 95-14 at 18). Hammonds arrived at the Jail in January 2014, after which he began suffering itches on his body. Hammonds alleges that he proceeded through the proper procedures and filed a sick call to see a medical staff member, and medical personnel placed him on the waiting list to see Dr. Williams. Hammonds alleges he waited for over three weeks, and the itching progressively worsened. After he visited Dr. Williams, he avers Dr. Williams indicated the absence of any ailments.

Hammonds avers that he remained in the medical unit from March\n   through August 2014 without receiving any treatment, and it was during his transition to federal custody in August 2014 that he finally received treatment for scabies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Hammonds filed an amended complaint on September 2, 2015, alleging identical facts to his original complaint and a state law claim of medical malpractice against all defendants.

The facts in each case reveal a mixture of claims against ACH, Dorning, the County, and numerous individuals employed by and/or affiliated with ACH and the County. The following five cases raise the same procedural question: whether ACH and Evanston owed a duty to defend and indemnify the County and Dorning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) The\n    <em>\n     Listau\n    </em>\n    Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   On July 8, 2014, Robert Elliott, as the personal representative of the estate of Nikki Listau (\"Listau\"), commenced a civil action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (No. 5:14-cv-01309-CLS). The claims below stem from the most recent version of the complaint, filed on October 31, 2014. (Doc. 97-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The complaint alleges the defendants-including Madison County, Dorning, and ACH-acted deliberately indifferent to Listau's medical needs in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, the complaint alleges that upon Listau's arrival at the Jail, she exhibited symptoms from alcohol withdrawal, and thus, officials placed her in a medical observation cell. The complaint alleges that, from prior jail admissions, both ACH and Jail personnel knew that Listau struggled with alcoholism and suffered from a history of advanced delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures during withdrawal. Shortly after Listau arrived at the Jail, a nurse affiliated with ACH examined Listau and identified her as suffering from severe DTs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The complaint alleges correctional officers at the Jail checked on Listau every fifteen minutes, yet ACH employees failed to sufficiently monitor Listau's vital signs. The day after Listau's arrival, personnel found Listau unresponsive in her cell, and Listau died the day after at Huntsville Hospital. The autopsy report indicated that Listau died from severe blunt force injuries, including a broken left femur and multiple rib fractures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Count I of the complaint alleges a claim of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against all defendants. Count I alleges that certain individual defendants, including Dorning and specific ACH employees, act as supervisory officials for the jail and failed to fulfill their responsibility for development and implementation of policies and procedures for medical care. Furthermore, Count I states Madison County intentionally refused to adequately fund medical care with deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of inmates such as Listau. Finally, Count I alleges Dorning remains liable for the acts of ACH and its policymakers, and the defendants' conduct caused Listau to suffer physical and emotional injuries that led to her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Count II of the complaint alleges state law claims of negligence and wantonness against individual ACH defendants and unknown ACH employees. Specifically, Count II alleges ACH employees involved with Listau's care owed a duty to satisfy the standard of care applicable to inmates\n   and/or to ensure those under their supervision were adequately trained regarding the proper care of such inmates, and that these employees negligently and/or wantonly violated this standard of care. Furthermore, Count II states that because ACH personnel acted within the scope of their employment, defendant ACH remains liable for their negligence and/or wantonness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   On July 9, 2014, Rich sent a letter to Johnson stating demands for indemnification pursuant to the Agreement. Furthermore, the letter requested ACH provide notice to its insurer for it to consider Dorning and Madison County as \"additional insureds\" under the Policy. Madison County, Dorning, and ACH retained separate counsel to defend the\n   <em>\n    Listau\n   </em>\n   action, and the parties ultimately reached a settlement. Evanston and OneBeacon separately contributed to the settlement of the individual claims against their respective insureds. Rich states that OneBeacon decided to settle based on the allegations in the\n   <em>\n    Listau\n   </em>\n   complaint and the risk and exposure to the insurer and its insureds.

Specifically, the complaint alleges Woods arrived at the Jail in late June 2013, and Woods's mental functioning underwent a severe change between late July and early August 2013. This decline in Woods's mental functioning led personnel to move him to a medical observation cell. The complaint states that over a two-week period, Woods's condition deteriorated-he began hallucinating, remained in a confused state, and became unable to communicate with correctional and medical personnel. Correctional personnel tased Woods at least three times over this period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Over this period, Woods did not eat or drink, and records indicated that correctional personnel cut off Woods's water supply a week before his death. The complaint alleges that both County and ACH personnel knew of Woods's deteriorating condition and did nothing to alleviate it. During this period, Woods's right foot became gangrenous, and the complaint alleges that correctional personnel remained aware of Woods's condition but did nothing to help him. The complaint also argues that in the week leading up to Woods's death, no ACH personnel took Woods's temperature, checked his blood pressure, checked his blood sugar, or otherwise attempted to assess Woods's condition. On August 19, 2013, someone found Woods completely non-responsive, and he died two days later at Huntsville Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Count I of the complaint alleges a claim of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against all defendants.

Specifically, the complaint alleges Jefferson arrived at the Jail in mid-October 2013, and Jefferson began complaining of rectal and abdominal pain on October 19, 2013. The complaint asserts Jefferson requested on numerous occasions to see a doctor and filed at least one medical grievance, and she finally saw an ACH doctor on October 29, 2013. However, the complaint alleges the doctor misrepresented Jefferson's condition in his\n   notes by omitting her symptoms of severe and worsening abdominal pain, lack of appetite, rectal pain, and vomiting. The doctor did not perform a rectal exam, but he prescribed laxatives for Jefferson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The complaint states Jefferson's condition worsened over the following days, and she exhibited sweating and labored breathing. On the morning of October 31, 2013, Jefferson allegedly saw an ACH nurse and reported her condition, but the nurse sent her back to her cell. That evening, despite ACH personnel knowing of her early morning complaint, Jefferson passed out in her cell while complaining of extreme abdominal pain. An hour later, ACH personnel called an ambulance as Jefferson was nonresponsive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The complaint states Jefferson died that day as a result of complications related to a bowel obstruction, yet an autopsy reveals that Jefferson died of cardiomyopathy. The autopsy also diagnosed Jefferson with hypertensive cardiovascular disease and blunt force injuries in the right upper extremity and lower extremities.

The claims below stem from the most recent version of the complaint, filed June 8, 2017. (Doc. 99-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The complaint alleges the defendants-including Madison County, Dorning, and ACH-acted deliberately indifferent to Foster's medical needs in violation of her Fourteenth Amendment rights as a pretrial detainee. Specifically, the complaint alleges Foster arrived at the Jail on April 4, 2014. Documentation from ACH personnel indicated the \"Methadone Clinic\" in Huntsville, Alabama, was treating Foster, and Foster expressed she was experiencing methadone withdrawal symptoms. The complaint asserts none of the defendants verified this information, despite the fact ACH personnel documented the information from their interview with Foster. The complaint further states that within a week of Foster's arrival at the Jail, she displayed visible signs of weakness and methadone withdrawal that worsened daily. Foster avers that although the defendants knew she suffered from withdrawal, they did nothing to help her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The complaint avers ACH personnel took actions that worsened Foster's condition and inaccurately reported blood pressure numbers that Foster exhibited. On April 21, 2014, Foster's cellmate called for medical assistance because Foster was shaking and sweating, and ACH personnel placed Foster under medical observation. The complaint alleges correctional personnel harassed and ridiculed Foster while she endured numerous strokes and seizures, and individual correctional officers left her sprawled on a floor during a commissary visit. The complaint further alleges a medical nurse continuously picked up and dropped Foster while yelling at her. At some point thereafter, ACH and correctional personnel physically placed Foster in a shower because she urinated on herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   On April 22, 2014, another inmate requested emergency assistance for Foster because she was \"twitching\" in her bunk. Correctional personnel assisted Foster into a wheelchair and took her to triage with ACH personnel. ACH personnel placed Foster under medical observation, yet her condition worsened. The following day, after both correctional and ACH personnel observed Foster's worsening symptoms, they sent her to Huntsville Hospital for treatment due to signs of a stroke. The complaint alleges Foster arrived at the hospital with high blood pressure readings and marks indicating she had been beaten. Foster remained in the hospital for three weeks, and hospital personnel diagnosed her with Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES).

The claims below stem from the most recent version of the complaint, filed January 30, 2017. (Doc. 99-14). (\"Davis Complaint\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The nature of the Davis Complaint alleges the defendants-including Madison County, Dorning, and ACH-acted deliberately indifferent to Davis's medical needs in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights as a pretrial detainee. Specifically, the complaint alleges Davis arrived at the Jail on July 17, 2014. The Davis Complaint alleges that over the succeeding days, Davis began experiencing withdrawal symptoms, yet neither ACH nor County personnel identified him as a person likely to experience withdrawal. On July 21, 2014, ACH personnel examined Davis after his symptoms worsened and identified him as experiencing severe delirium tremens (DTs). That evening, ACH\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   personnel placed Davis in a medical observation cell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Davis Complaint states that over the succeeding two days, Davis's condition deteriorated, and numerous ACH and County personnel observed him during this time period. By July 23, 2014, Davis was mainly unresponsive and could not walk. Only July 24, 2014, Jail management personnel contacted court personnel to inquire about releasing Davis to avoid incurring the costs of sending him to the hospital. Upon release, Davis's family transported him to Madison Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Count I of the complaint alleges a claim of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against all defendants except Dorning. Count I alleges that certain individual defendants, including Dorning and specific ACH employees, act as supervisory officials for the jail and failed to fulfill their responsibility for development and implementation of policies and procedures for medical care at the Jail. Count I further argues these individuals' action and inaction established unconstitutional customs and policies regarding the provision of medical care at the Jail. Count I alleges ACH, as an entity, remains liable because its customs and policies caused the violation of Davis's rights. Count I states Madison County intentionally refused to adequately fund medical care with deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of inmates such as Davis. Finally, Count I alleges Dorning remains liable for the acts of ACH and its policymakers, as he delegated his final policymaking authority to ACH, and the defendants' conduct caused Woods to suffer physical and emotional injuries that led to his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Count II of the complaint alleges state law claims of negligence and wantonness against individual ACH defendants and unknown ACH employees. Specifically, Count II alleges ACH employees involved with Davis's care owed a duty to satisfy the standard of care applicable to inmates and/or to ensure those under their supervision were adequately trained regarding the proper care of such inmates, and that these employees negligently and/or wantonly violated this standard of care. Furthermore, Count II states that because ACH personnel acted within the scope of their employment, defendant ACH, as an entity, remains liable for their negligence and/or wantonness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   On July 20, 2016, Rich sent a letter to Johnson that served as a notice of demand for indemnification pursuant to the Agreement. Furthermore, the letter requested ACH provide notice to its insurer. Madison County, Dorning, and ACH retained separate counsel to defend the\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   Complaint. On July 31, 2018, the court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Final Judgment dismissing with prejudice all claims against all defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Memorandum Opinion &amp; Final Judgment,\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

(Doc. 95-2 at 139-140). After ACH first notified Evanston of the\n   <em>\n    Listau\n   </em>\n   case, Evanston reached out to its claims service manager, Markel. Markel retained the law firm Hand Arendall to review coverage, and Hand Arendall subsequently sent a letter to Rich and Dorning on October 27, 2014. The letter states that the\n   <em>\n    Listau\n   </em>\n   Complaint alleged claims against the County and Dorning that arose from their own actions, yet Evanston would \"nonetheless defend Madison County and Sheriff Dorning in this matter at this time subject to a full and complete reservation of any and all rights.\" (Doc. 96-5 at 12). Evanston appointed an attorney to defend the County and Dorning in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   On January 15, 2015, Hand Arendall sent another letter to Rich and Dorning in response to the filings of the Woods and Jefferson Complaints. Although the letter rendered statements similar to the October 2014 letter, it also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   The [Evanston] Policy provides coverage for Sheriff Dorning and Madison County as Additional Insureds\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   with respect to liability Sheriff Dorning and Madison County may have resulting from the negligence of ACH and its employees in providing medical care or treatment to the inmates and/or staffing/hiring decisions. The [Evanston] Policy does not provide any coverage to Sheriff Dorning or Madison County for damages relating to their independent actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   As is apparent, the One Beacon Policy provides coverage to Sheriff Dorning and Madison County for their wrongful acts. The [Evanston] Policy provides no coverage for Sheriff Dorning and Madison County for their wrongful acts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   (Doc. 96-5 at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The letter stated that the\n   <em>\n    Listau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   Complaints \"also make independent allegations against Madison County and Sheriff Dorning based on its or his own conduct that are not covered by the [Evanston] Policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22). Thus, because OneBeacon's policy covered direct actions by Dorning and the County, and the Evanston Policy only covered Dorning's and County's liability on the basis of ACH's conduct, Evanston proposed that Dorning and the County consent to OneBeacon and Evanston each paying half of the defense costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). This offer never culminated into a formal proposal, and the County rejected the offer. Presumably, OneBeacon paid all of Plaintiffs' defense costs in the Underlying Actions. OneBeacon also funded the County and Dorning's share of settlement in the\n   <em>\n    Listau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In early 2015, ACH and Plaintiffs encountered several obstacles while discussing the possible renewal of the Healthcare Agreement. On March 18, 2015, ACH's in-house counsel, Jessica Young, sent a letter to Rich upon reviewing the primary insurance and additional named insured questions with Evanston. In the letter, Young stated ACH had named the County as an additional insured on ACH's insurance policies since 2006. Young states that although ACH never intended to be deemed responsible for the negligent acts and omissions of County employees, ACH now understood that the Agreement read otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Nevertheless, Young informed Rich the County would not receive any coverage\n   beyond recompense for their own conduct based upon \"the industry standard ... and how [ACH] operate[s] at every other jail nationwide.\" (Doc. 99-24 at 22). Young also stated ACH would indemnify the County if it is drawn into a lawsuit through ACH's negligence. Young also informed Rich that ACH remained unable to sign the Agreement as currently written due to these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   On April 22, 2015, Rich sent a letter to Johnson and Young reminding them of Rich's prior March 2015 letter listing several demands. These demands included: (1) acknowledge its obligation to pay all claims, litigation costs, attorney fees, and any judgment or settlement money for which the County or Dorning is or may become liable for or obligated to pay in the\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Listau\n   </em>\n   actions; (2) immediately obtain primary insurance covering the County and Dorning as named insureds for all claims that may arise out of the course and scope of the Agreement; and (3) acknowledge its indemnity obligations under the Agreement as it relates to the\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Listau\n   </em>\n   actions. (Doc. 103-1 at 2). Rich's letter states that ACH neither cured its breach of the Agreement nor complied with the County's and Dorning's demands. Therefore, Rich states in the letter that \"ACH is hereby notified that as of Monday, June 22, 2015, ACH's services at the [Jail] will end.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). The Agreement between the County, Dorning, and ACH ultimately expired in June 2015. (Sheriff Depo., 95:1-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   On September 7, 2016, Plaintiffs' counsel contacted ACH's counsel via letter and notified him of the upcoming mediation of the\n   <em>\n    Listau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   actions. (Doc. 103-4 at 2-3). The letter also served as another demand for indemnification for Plaintiffs. ACH never responded to the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   After the filing of the Davis Complaint in July 2016, Markel retained a different law firm-Swift, Currie, McGee &amp; Hiers LLP (\"Swift Currie\")-to review coverage on behalf of Evanston. On October 24, 2016, Swift Currie sent a letter to Rich and Dorning communicating Evanston's agreement to defend the Davis action under a reservation of rights. (Doc. 99-25). The letter stated independent allegations existed against both the County and Dorning based on their own conduct, and Evanston's Policy likely would not cover some of these allegations. The letter further explained the County and Dorning would remain responsible for acquiring insurance to protect its or his interests in all non-covered claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   On March 13, 2017, Judge Abdul Kallon issued a Memorandum Opinion in the\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   case that dismissed several claims and assessed the remaining survivable claims. (Memorandum Opinion &amp; Final Judgment,\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Madison County Alabama et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:16-cv-1166--AKK (N.D. Ala. July. 21, 2018), ECF No. 102). The surviving claims included the claim of deliberate indifference based on inadequate funding against Madison County. On June 29, 2017, Swift Currie sent a letter to the attorney representing Madison County, David Hodge. This letter served as Evanston's intent to withdraw its defense of the County, and repeated the offer to reimburse OneBeacon for half of the defense expenses incurred on the County's behalf up through March 13, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   After the filing of the\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   Complaint in March 2016, Markel retained Swift Currie again to review coverage on behalf of Evanston. On February 23, 2017, Swift Currie sent a letter to Rich and Dorning containing similar reservation-of-rights language in Evanston's agreement to provide a defense to the County and Dorning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   On October 2, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a civil action against Evanston and ACH in the\n   Circuit Court of Madison County, Alabama. On November 6, 2015, Evanston and ACH filed a Notice of Removal. (Doc. 1). The most recent version of Plaintiffs' complaint alleges claims of breach of contract and bad faith against Evanston and claims of breach of contract, indemnification, fraud, suppression, and promissory estoppel against ACH.

As determined regarding Plaintiffs' breach-of-contract claims, although the Agreement requires ACH to provide coverage to the Plaintiffs, the Additional Insured\n   <em>\n    endorsement\n   </em>\n   limits coverage\n   to \"\n   <em>\n    liability in rendering Professional Services caused by the negligence of the Named Insured\n   </em>\n   [ACH] ....\" (Doc. 94-4 at 28) (emphasis added). As discussed previously, this provision clearly limits coverage to ACH's negligent conduct. Furthermore, the Additional Insured endorsement provides that \"[c]overage provided to any Additional Insured ... shall apply solely with respect to any Claim or Claim Expenses arising from Professional Services rendered by the Named Insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This provision does not afford any coverage for Plaintiffs' own conduct; rather, it limits Plaintiffs' coverage to conduct perpetrated by ACH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Plaintiffs insist that this limitation conflicts with the Civil Rights endorsement, which provides coverage for allegations of civil rights violations pursuant to \u00a7 1983 that stem from the provision of medical services. Although Plaintiffs correctly describe the scope of the Civil Rights endorsement, its scope does not overlap with the limitations placed on Plaintiffs through the Additional Insured endorsement. Under the Additional Insured endorsement, Evanston insures Plaintiffs only for liability that stems from\n   <em>\n    negligence\n   </em>\n   in ACH's performance of \"Professional Services.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also offer no additional evidence to show that Evanston relied on any potentially ambiguous provision to limit Plaintiffs' insurance coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   To bolster their bad-faith claim against Evanston, Plaintiffs argue Evanston failed to properly investigate their claims. Specifically, Plaintiffs fault Jagady Blue, Evanston's claims manager, for determining coverage by reviewing the allegations in the Underlying Actions' complaints. (Doc. 96-4 at 117-120). \"An insurance company's duty to defend its insured is determined by the language of the insurance policy and by the allegations in the complaint giving rise to the action against the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    American States Insurance Co. v.

(Doc. 95-3 at 10-27 (Letter re:\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   Case); Doc. 95-14 at 6-15 (Letter re:\n   <em>\n    Listau\n   </em>\n   Case); Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   95-14 at 42 through Doc. 95-15 at 5 (Letter re:\n   <em>\n    Listau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Woods\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   Cases); Doc. 99-25 (Letter re:\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   case) ). These letters reviewed the Policy language, the claims alleged in each of the Underlying Actions, and the analysis that determined which claims the Policy covered. For each of the cases, Evanston granted at minimum a defense under reservation of rights for the potentially covered claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Furthermore, Evanston attempted to reach a cost-sharing agreement for several of the Underlying Actions. Blue and Barbara McConnell of OneBeacon exchanged several emails with Rich in late December 2014, indicating that Evanston's designation of the policy as \"excess\" was unintentional and proposing a 50/50 split on indemnity and defense costs under Evanston's Reservation of Rights. (Doc. 95-8 at 4-7). Although a proposal never fully culminated, Evanston's attempts counter Plaintiffs' claim of bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Finally, Evanston based its decisions on lawful and adequate reasons. Evanston utilized the Policy's clear language, compared it to the allegations in the complaints of each Underlying Action, and integrated both documents in its analysis. Evanston's investigation established a legitimate reason to not defend and indemnify Plaintiffs in certain Underlying Actions, thereby defeating Plaintiffs' bad faith claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Evanston's actions do not qualify as the intentional or reckless actions necessary to prove an \"extraordinary\" bad-faith claim. The court finds that Plaintiffs fail to satisfy its burden in countering Evanston's evidence that it properly investigated the requests for defense and indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    III. GENUINE ISSUES OF MATERIAL FACT EXIST AS TO PLAINTIFFS' BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM AGAINST ACH\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   ACH moves for summary judgment against Plaintiffs' breach-of-contract claim regarding the parties' Agreement for ACH to procure insurance coverage for Plaintiffs. Although Plaintiffs list several other alleged breaches of the Agreement, most of them, save the indemnity claim, coalesce under the allegation ACH failed to procure particular insurance coverage. The alleged failures - to secure Plaintiffs as Additional Named Insureds; to ensure primary insurance coverage for Plaintiffs; to insure all claims arising out of the course and scope of the Agreement; to furnish Plaintiffs a copy of the policy; to recompense deductible amounts paid on other policies for claims related to the Agreement; and to pay all costs if ACH's insurance company were to deny or withdraw coverage - all converge under Plaintiffs' failure-to-procure, breach-of-contract claim. As the following analysis portrays, genuine issues of material fact regarding some aspects of Plaintiffs' claim precludes summary judgment in ACH's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   To recover on a breach-of-contract claim, \"a party must establish: (1) the existence of a valid contract binding the parties; (2) the plaintiff's performance under the contract; (3) the defendant's nonperformance; and (4) damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Capmark Bank v.

The Agreement states ACH \"shall procure ... insurance providing coverage for claims ... asserted pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ... that may arise out of the course and scope\" of the parties' contract. (Doc. 94-5 at 22; Doc. 94-7 at 4). Immediately thereafter, the Agreement provides that Plaintiffs \"shall be additional named insureds on the aforesaid policies of insurance.\" (Doc. 94-5 at 22; Doc. 94-7 at 4). The Agreement continues that \"ACH's insurance coverage shall be primary,\" and ACH agreed \"to pay on demand any deductible amount ... required by ... any insurance policy of Madison County ... on any claim made against Madison County, or the Sheriff ... as a result of any service from or related\" to the contract. (Doc. 94-5 at 22; Doc. 94-7 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   As an initial matter, there should be no dispute ACH did not perform its obligation to procure insurance coverage for the Plaintiffs against \u00a7 1983 claims, given the summary judgment ruling on Evanston's motion that its policies did not provide such coverage for Plaintiffs. That finding constitutes a matter of law that governs the interpretation of the Healthcare Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Nevertheless, the Agreement obligated \u00a7 1983 coverage for \"claims that may arise out of the course and scope\" of the contract, and the provision of payment of deductibles emanating from other policies likewise required that pertinent claims result from \"any service from or related\" to the contract. The plain and ordinary meaning of these terms requires \u00a7 1983 coverage against claims that incite the purpose of the Agreement - ACH's provision of medical care for Plaintiffs' detainees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   44 C.J.S. Insurance \u00a7 420 (\"In order to be entitled to an award of damages for a failure to procure insurance, however, plaintiff must establish a causal relation between the defendant's breach and the damages. Thus, a party may not recover damages unless the insurance, if it had been procured, would have covered the loss....\") (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The parties dispute whether the Underlying Actions - in particular the claims against Plaintiffs - involve circumstances arising from ACH's provision of medical care. Upon reviewing the Underlying Actions, there exist genuine issues of material fact whether they assert \u00a7 1983 claims against Plaintiffs based upon ACH's provision of medical care to detainees, or whether they involve such claims against Plaintiffs for conduct unrelated to ACH's provision of medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   As discussed extensively in the Background, the first counts of the Underlying Actions consistently aver claims of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against all defendants. They allege certain individual defendants, including Dorning and specific ACH employees, act as supervisory officials for the jail and failed to fulfill their responsibility for development and implementation of policies and procedures for medical care at the jail. Furthermore, the counts state Madison County intentionally refused to adequately fund medical care with deliberate indifference to the serious\n   medical needs of inmates. Finally, the counts allege Dorning remains liable for the acts of ACH and its policymakers, and the parties' conduct caused the plaintiffs in the Underlying Actions to suffer physical and emotional injuries. Clearly, a reasonable factfinder may determine these counts in the Underlying Actions averred \u00a7 1983 liability for Plaintiffs for the conduct of ACH's employees, and thus, genuine issues of material fact remain as to this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   In addition, there exists a genuine issue of material fact whether ACH performed its obligation under the Agreement to procure coverage with Plaintiffs as \"additional named insureds\" on the policies. This issue most appropriately influences any putative measure of damages if the trial factfinder deems ACH liable. Evanston's Additional Insured Endorsement lists Plaintiffs as Additional Insureds, yet, as reviewed, the pertinent policy does not cover \u00a7 1983 claims. Notwithstanding this finding, ACH essentially maintains it still escapes damages if it proves the Underlying Actions against Plaintiffs did not arise under the course or scope of, or in relation to, ACH's provision of medical care. ACH couches its interpretation on the terms \"additional named insured,\" contending that the terms only require coverage for claims regarding the provision of medical care. Therefore, if the Underlying Actions only involve claims against the Plaintiffs for their own conduct, the failure to secure insurance for such claims caused no harm because the parties only contracted for Plaintiffs' \"additional insured\" status in relation to ACH's provision of medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Plaintiffs contend otherwise, construing the terms \"additional named insured\" to require ACH to provide insurance coverage for Plaintiffs against all claims, regardless of such claims' relation to ACH's provision of medical care. Under such an interpretation, even if the Underlying Actions only involve claims against the Plaintiffs for their own conduct, the Agreement still obligated ACH to secure primary insurance coverage for such claims on Plaintiffs' behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   In this guise, the genuine issue of fact manifests. The Agreement is ambiguous because its \"four corners\" do not provide a basis for construing the meaning of \"additional named insureds,\" and the factfinder must resort to facts external to the terms of the Agreement to discern the parties' intended meaning. Indeed, the parties provide sparse guidance as to the distinction between \"additional insureds\" and \"additional named insureds.\" Although there exist some cases referencing the terms \"additional named insureds,\" they provide no basis for deciphering the phrase.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McInnis Corp. v.

The debate continues because of semantic inconsistencies. Some risk managers add to the confusion by insisting that their companies be identified as named insureds on an indemnitor's liability policy. These companies are thus branded as additional named insureds by some scholars, instead of being described as additional insureds. Furthermore, even commentators and scholars cannot agree on the definitions of \"additional named insured\" and \"additional\n   insured,\" for some commentators define an additional insured as \"a party protected under a liability policy without being named therein,\" and an \"additional named insured\" as a party designated as an insured after the policy is issued. It is no small wonder that confusion abounds and that policyholders, indemnitees, and insurers routinely argue over their respective rights and obligations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Douglas R.

One school of thought holds that additional named insured status has no widely accepted definition, and therefore is open to subjective interpretation. Parties who negotiate whether to enter into an additional insured agreement or additional named insured agreement are either bargaining for unintended coverage or simply wasting their time since there currently exists no meaningful difference between additional insured and additional named insured status. Proponents of this view seem to accept that until additional named insured status can be more clearly and universally defined, all added parties to liability policies should be treated as additional insureds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   Another school of thought, forwarded most clearly by Mark Pomerantz in\n   <em>\n    Recognizing the Unique Status of Additional Named Insured\n   </em>\n   , holds that courts have wrongly treated additional named insured status and additional insured status as if they were identical. As a result of this confusion, courts have usually reached decisions contrary to the contracting parties' intent. He contends that by choosing to specifically designate a party as an additional named insured, parties to the contract intend that the added party be treated more like the named insured, rather than just a third party donee beneficiary (as is the treatment afforded additional insureds). * * * As demonstrated by the foregoing, different scholars have asserted their own views on this issue and even forwarded their own definitions of additional named insured status. Hence the debate over whether any meaningful difference exists between the two statuses remains unresolved. For the purpose of this article, additional insured and additional named insured will be afforded treatment similar to that provided by most courts: they will be treated as identical.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Samir B.

In chapter 4, the authors explain why they believe it is more prudent to be named as an additional insured, rather than an additional named insured. The primary reason in support of their position is that exclusions only apply to the named insured. The authors also note that there is no formal definition of \"additional named insured\" that has been accepted by the insurance industry; nor is there a standard endorsement for an additional named insured. Additionally, the authors express concern that if a party is named\n   as an additional named insured, there could be some obligation to share in the cost of the premium or contribute to the deductible. The authors conclude that being named as an additional insured on a standard industry endorsement provides a relatively known scope of protection that is preferable to requesting to be named as an additional named insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Terry J.

Law., Fall 2010, at 5, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   As revealed, caselaw and the commentators abound in disarray as to any meaningful distinction between the terms. However, such confusion does not detract from the previous assessment of this issue. Even if a definitive legal meaning of the phrases eludes the interpreter's grasp, the parties argue that they effected diverging intentions in the Agreement, regardless of the nomenclature: either the Agreement required ACH to cover Plaintiffs for all claims, or the Agreement limited ACH's obligation to only cover Plaintiffs for claims emanating from the provision of medical care. There exists a genuine issue of fact on that issue reserved for the factfinder at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   To be sure, ACH argues that the \"unavailability\" of additional named insured coverage precludes enforcement of a failure-to-procure claim in this action. As an initial matter, ACH pens its argument on the testimony of one of its witnesses, which, of course, represents testimony the court must disregard at the summary-judgment stage.\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p150\">\n    530 U.S. at 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p150\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he court should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that 'evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached, at least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.' \")\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p150\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). Furthermore, one queries the basis for such an assertion given the findings by the afore-cited commentators and scholars that a definitive delineation of additional named insured status does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   In any event, an even more concrete legal doctrine suppresses ACH's argument: litigants may not resort to a defense of unavailability in the contract breach realm. In support of its argument, ACH relies upon cases finding that the unavailability of certain types of insurance coverage defeats a plaintiff's failure-to-procure claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hawk v.

As to the first factor, ACH has not submitted any facts indicating Plaintiffs knew that Evanston's insurance policies limited their coverage to claims arising solely from ACH's negligence; indeed, the Certificates of Insurance ostensibly stated otherwise. Furthermore, Plaintiffs contend they did not know that Evanston's policy only provided against liability arising out of ACH's provision of medical services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 93-6 at 20 (the Additional Insured endorsement \"provide[s] coverage ... only as respects liability in rendering Professional Services\n   <em>\n    caused by the negligence of the Named Insured\n   </em>\n   ....) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs hotly contest whether they contracted for coverage of their own conduct, so apparently they did not know Evanston's policy failed to even accord such coverage. Therefore, ACH cannot obtain summary judgment on its equitable estoppel defense because genuine issues of material fact remain for resolution by the factfinder at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   The same result manifests for the waiver defense. \"Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right.... Intentional relinquishment must be shown in an unequivocal manner.

Given the cache the parties place on a supposed distinction between the phrases \"additional insureds\" and \"additional named insureds\" - which serve as proxies for the parties' dispute whether they contracted for primary insurance coverage of Plaintiffs' own conduct bereft of any reference to ACH's provision of medical care - the factfinder may conclude Plaintiffs waived their right to the substance of \"additional named insured\" coverage by accepting the certificates and not further inquiring about the discrepancy. That the certificates did not alter or modify their referenced insurance policies does not obviate this finding; the factfinder may still find that Plaintiffs should have inspected the underlying policies to ascertain the desired status, at which case it would have discovered its designation as an \"additional insured\" (among other critical discoveries).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   In addition, that ACH failed to provide Plaintiffs copies of the insurance policies does not preclude a genuine issue of fact on the waiver defense. Plaintiffs cannot defeat one waiver defense against a particular right by asserting another right they arguably waived by their course of conduct. In such circumstances, ACH's failure to provide copies of the policies would not preclude its waiver argument as a matter of law, yet genuine issues of material fact remain as to its application in this action. Therefore, ACH cannot obtain summary judgment on the waiver defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Indeed, the clause unambiguously provides otherwise: ACH indemnifies Plaintiffs solely against ACH's acts, omissions, conduct, or misconduct \"related in any way to or while in the performance\" of the Agreement, or against other actions allegedly perpetrated by ACH. Therefore, the indemnity clause covers Plaintiffs for ACH's actions in providing medical care to detainees or for other conduct at the facility.

They allege certain individual defendants, including Dorning and specific ACH employees, act as supervisory officials for the jail and failed to fulfill their responsibility for development and implementation of policies and procedures for medical care at the jail. Furthermore, the counts state Madison County intentionally refused to adequately fund medical care with deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of inmates. Finally, the counts allege Dorning remains liable for the acts of ACH and its policymakers, and the parties' conduct caused the plaintiffs in the Underlying Actions to suffer physical and emotional injuries. Clearly, a reasonable factfinder may determine these counts in the Underlying Actions averred \u00a7 1983 liability for Plaintiffs for the conduct of ACH's employees, and thus, genuine issues of material fact remain as to this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Finally, this issue proceeds to trial notwithstanding the absence of any fault determination judicially dispensed in the Underlying Actions.

Rob Bielenberg of Callender &amp; Co. served as a liaison to ACH to obtain the proper insurance coverage, yet ACH did not send Bielenberg a\n   copy of the Agreement until all parties had signed it. (Doc. 96-1 at 20, ll. 9-12). On August 29, 2006, Bielenberg wrote to Johnson and explained his difficulties in finding an insurance carrier willing to adopt the wording set out in the Agreement-specifically, providing insurance for \"Madison County, its officers, agents and employees, and the Sheriff and all agents and employees of the Sheriff.\" (Doc. 94-2 at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   Rich, Johnson, and Dorning exchanged correspondence several times in late 2006, constantly referring to the importance of acquiring the insurance as described in the Agreement and the difficulties in obtaining said insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 95-10 at 12-14 (September 12, 2006, letter from Johnson to Dorning, communicating Rich's frustrations with the wording on the Certificate of Liability Insurance not matching the language set out in the Agreement); Doc. 95-10 at 17-18 (September 14, 2006, letter from Johnson to Rich, summarizing Johnson's efforts to acquire Eighth Amendment insurance that included the wording from the Agreement); Doc. 95-7 at 12 (October 16, 2006, letter from Rich to Johnson, emphasizing that \"insurance coverage is a matter of significant concern to [the County and Dorning]\" and requesting an update on the status of ACH's insurance coverage); Doc. 95-10 at 25-27 (October 23, 2006, letter from Johnson to Rich, updating Rich on communications with Bielenberg regarding the ongoing insurance search).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Bielenberg testified that he always received a copy of the policy that Evanston issued for ACH, and Bielenberg would then send the policies to Neil Leuthold, ACH's president. (Doc. 96-1 at 68, ll. 9-16). Rich testified that he never received any of the insurance policies issued to ACH. (Doc. 95-2 at 28, ll. 17-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   At first blush, the numerous documents evincing the negotiations underlying the initial 2006 Agreement, and following the initial execution of the 2006 Agreement, depict the parties engaging in attempts to comply with said Agreement by acquiring the requisite insurance. During that period, the parties all remained aware of the importance that Plaintiffs placed on receiving adequate coverage in liability insurance. Therefore, the 2006 Agreement does not indicate any misrepresentations or intents to deceive or not perform a promise at the time the parties' executed the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   However, evidence of misrepresentation, and an intent to deceive and not perform, exists as to the 2012 and 2014 Agreements pertinent to the claims at bar. Notwithstanding ACH's efforts in 2006 to secure insurance coverage reflecting the Agreement's promises, it ultimately failed to do so. Indeed, ACH maintains that insurers do not offer \"Additional Named Insured\" coverage. Furthermore, it provided a template to Evanston that did not accord with Plaintiffs' promised coverage, and it possess the policies and Additional Insured endorsements unambiguously covering Plaintiffs solely for excess coverage on negligent conduct perpetrated by ACH's agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   Despite knowledge of these facts six years after 2006, ACH still executed contracts stating that it would provide Plaintiffs' primary coverage for \u00a7 1983 claims. Furthermore, ACH delivered certificates of insurance essentially stating that the insurance policies covered Plaintiffs for civil rights liability, with no indication whether such [false] coverage was primary or excess. A reasonable juror may determine that ACH's execution of the 2012 and 2014 Agreements - despite the afore-mentioned facts indicating it could not provide the coverage sought by Plaintiffs - constitutes misrepresentations, an intent to deceive, and an intent not to perform its obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   To combat Plaintiffs' fraud claim, ACH argues that it could not have misled Plaintiffs because ACH repeatedly provided Plaintiffs with Certificates of Liability Insurance that identified the insurance coverage. However, the Certificates list information that conflicts with Evanston's Policy: specifically, ACH's insurance remained \"primary\" for Plaintiffs when it was excess in the Policy, and the Certificates failed to inform that Evanston narrowed Plaintiffs' coverage to acts of negligence committed by ACH, thus excluding \u00a7 1983 constitutional torts. Plaintiffs provided evidence demonstrating ACH retained copies of both the Certificates and the Policy, so it should have discerned the discrepancies between the Certificates and the actual policies. Therefore, the trier of fact could reasonably determine that ACH's act of delivering the Certificates actually constituted a misrepresentation itself as to the coverage afforded by the underlying policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Genuine Issues of Fact Exist Whether Plaintiffs Unreasonably Relied on ACH's Alleged Misrepresentations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   The same conclusion manifests on the issue whether Plaintiffs reasonably relied upon ACH's alleged misrepresentations.

Plaintiffs actually contracted with ACH in the Agreement to obtain copies of the insurance policies. For all of the controlling Agreements - 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2014 - ACH maintained the contractual obligation to provide copies of the insurance policies. A reasonable factfinder may conclude that its failure to provide copies when it sustained the contractual obligation to do so constitutes\n   a denial of access to the documents, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the later documents when it contracted to procure insurance that it ostensibly could not - and of course, did not - obtain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   If ACH would not have breached its contractual duty to provide the insurance policies, Plaintiffs may have discovered the features of the policies contrasting with the Agreement. Sure, Plaintiffs may have retained the duty to investigate the nature of the policies upon examining the Certificates, yet ACH retained the duty to provide copies of the policies to facilitate such examination. In effect, determining reasonable reliance as a matter of law against Plaintiffs on these facts would occasion an unjust benefit for ACH, as it would profit from the wrongful breach of its contractual duty to provide information that could have unveiled the alleged misrepresentations. In turn, such a ruling may incentivize entities to deny access to documents subject to a contractual disclosure duty as a means of concealing detrimental information. Courts should be loath to facilitate such a development, and thus, seek to deter it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   In these circumstances, the reasonableness of Plaintiffs' reliance upon ACH's alleged misrepresentations constitutes a close, difficult question, which establishes its domain for the factfinder at trial, not a legal decision at summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

If the judge finds that the circumstances as alleged would be enough to create a legal duty, then he should instruct the jury as to what that duty would be if these circumstances did exist. The jury then decides whether those circumstances indeed existed. Should the plaintiff fail to prove her facts to the jury's satisfaction, then the jury can determine that the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to justify holding the defendant to the legal duty as charged by the judge.

Both of these factors play prominent roles in the determination at bar, leading to the conclusion ACH sustained the duty to fully disclose the underlying policies' coverage. First and foremost, the Agreement required ACH to deliver to Plaintiffs copies of the Policy; that is, the Agreement contained a contractual request for information. The desired information, of course, contravenes ACH's representations that it secured desired insurance coverage. (Doc. 94-2 at 9). Furthermore, ACH provided Plaintiffs certificates of insurance; that is, it undertook to speak on a valuable subject, i.e., the substance of the coverage sought by Plaintiffs. ACH's undertaking clearly failed to fully disclose the limitations in Evanston's policies. Although ACH contends that nothing prevented Plaintiffs from contacting ACH or Evanston to obtain information about the Policy, nonetheless ACH regularly received copies of the Policy from Evanston and was obligated to deliver them to Plaintiffs.

(Doc. 104 at 38. 54, 57-60, 70). Plaintiffs tendered a letter dated January 17, 2018-over two years after the commencement of this action-from Aaron Stone, the Vice President of Claims at OneBeacon.

Plaintiffs refer to OneBeacon's subrogation interest as a basis for several arguments in its Response, including their claim for damages. (Doc. 104 at 54, 57-60, 70). Furthermore, while several witnesses extensively reviewed the 2014 policy in depositions, so far as the parties indicate Rich remains the only witness to refer to OneBeacon's subrogation interest, and he mentioned it only once in his deposition.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 95-2 at 137, ll. 20-21 (\"[OneBeacon has] a subrogation interest, legally, I believe, that exists.\") Plaintiffs \"may not amend [their] complaint through argument in a brief opposing summary judgment\", especially when proposing a new theory of recovery.\n    <em>\n     Gilmour v.

In\n    <em>\n     Stone\n    </em>\n    , the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that plaintiff waived its failure-to-procure claim because defendant sent a certificate of insurance revealing plaintiff's non-coverage.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476719\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/796/1076/#p1090\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476719\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/796/1076/#p1090\">\n     at 1089\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Rather, the facts of\n    <em>\n     Stone\n    </em>\n    merely reveal that the plaintiff's course of conduct - accepting the certificates of insurance indicating non-coverage and sending a letter acknowledging the same - evinces an intention to waive a right. Therefore, ACH may not rely upon\n    <em>\n     Stone\n    </em>\n    as establishing a legal rule regarding certificates of insurance. Indeed, the certificates of insurance at issue in this case clearly state that they do not alter the terms of Evanston's insurance policies, and, as established previously, Alabama insurance regulations preclude such modifications by insurance certificates.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-354\">\n    The parties dispute the applicability of the equitable exception from\n    <em>\n     Stone Bldg.

Although the\n    <em>\n     Couse\n    </em>\n    decision found that a contract required a subcontractor to indemnify a contractor for the contractor's own negligence, it ruled so because the indemnity clause provided that the subcontractor shall indemnify contractor for all claims \"arising out of or connected with the performance\" of their contract.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 318. The court determined \"the language of the indemnity agreement in question to be clear and unequivocal that the subcontractor was to indemnify the contractor against claims from a third party when such claims arose out of or were connected with the performance of the subcontract even though the contractor himself may have been guilty as a matter of law of negligence to the third party.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 319.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-357\">\n    Here, the Agreement obligates ACH to indemnify Plaintiffs against claims \"related in any way to or while in the performance\" of the contract, which mirrors the indemnity terms in\n    <em>\n     Couse\n    </em>\n    regarding indemnity against claims arising out of \"the performance\" of the contract therein. However, the Agreement here contains additional, limiting language expressly stating that ACH shall indemnify Plaintiffs solely against ACH's own acts, omission, conduct, or misconduct \"related in any way to or while in the performance\" of the contract. Therefore, the Agreement does not reach as broadly as the contract as in\n    <em>\n     Couse\n    </em>\n    , and thus,\n    <em>\n     Couse\n    </em>\n    provides no aid for Plaintiffs' entreaty.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-358\">\n    ACH contends from the outset that Plaintiffs \"improperly attempt to convert their breach of contract claim into a fraud claim.\" (Doc. 90 at 53).

(Doc. 90 at 47-49). For example, ACH asserts it maintained a successful contractual relationship with the County and Dorning for nearly a decade, renewing the Agreement on a yearly basis. Moreover, ACH points to Plaintiffs' consistent, positive evaluations of ACH's healthcare services at the Jail, and their routine meetings with ACH leadership about the quality of services, as facts disproving any potential misrepresentations. However, these facts bear no relevance on the issue whether ACH ultimately misrepresented Plaintiffs in its discussions surrounding its acquisition of insurance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
