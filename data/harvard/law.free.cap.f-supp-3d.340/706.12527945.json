Ltd., and its owner, Adnan Oygur, asserting claims for trademark and design patent infringement, because Australian Leather sells boots called \"ugg boots.\" Defendants filed counterclaims and affirmative defenses, asserting, among other things, that Deckers's trademarks containing the word UGG should be canceled or that Deckers should be barred from enforcing them. Defendants say that ugg is a generic term for a kind of sheepskin boot, one popularized by Australian surfers in the 1970s, and therefore, Deckers cannot stop them from calling their boots uggs in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on some of defendants' counterclaims and affirmative defenses.

The UGG Brand\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Brian Smith, who was born in Australia and moved to the United States in 1978, founded the sheepskin-boot company known today as UGG. [189] \u00b6\u00b6 5, 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Smith owned a pair of sheepskin boots while still living in Australia, and he and others referred to them generally as ugg\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   boots. [173] \u00b6 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once he moved to the United States, specifically in December 1979, Smith began purchasing boots from an Australian company, Country Leather, and reselling them in the United States under the name Country Leather America. [189] \u00b6 5; [141] \u00b6 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Smith bought six pairs of sample boots, followed by an additional\n   500 pairs, which had a sewed-on label that read, \"Country Leather\" and a hang tag with the phrase, \"Ugg Boots keep you Warm &amp; Happy.\" [214] \u00b6 69. Smith knew that another individual had trademarked the term \"Ugh Boots\" for sheepskin boots in Australia in the early 1970s. [189] \u00b6 12. In early 1980, Smith applied to register UGG as a trademark in the United States, listing December 28, 1979, as the first-use date. [214] \u00b6 70; [189] \u00b6 6. The Trademark Office rejected the application because the mark did not \"serve to identify and distinguish applicant's goods,\" and Smith did not reapply.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1720006\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/266/#p271\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In April 1980, Smith-on behalf of UGG Imports-agreed to be the sole agent and distributor for Country Leather's sheepskin products in the U.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [141-3] at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   A few years later, Smith made a third order for about 2,200 pairs of boots.

In the first year of business, both Smith and Jensen attempted to sell UGG footwear to surf and ski shops, as well as shoe stores.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1720006\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/266/#p271\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Smith visited 50 surf shops that year, and some shop owners referred to the boots as ugg boots without prompting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. In a speech, Smith described his first two attempts at selling to surf-shop owners as follows: \"And the first store I walked into, I was super nervous and really timid, and I open up the bag, and-and the guy goes, 'Ah, UGG boots, man. They're fantastic.... I got a pair. Buddy brought them back for me.' And next store I went to was, 'Oh UGG boots. Yeah my buddies have all got those. They swear by them.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Smith and Jensen had similar reactions from other shops as well. [214] \u00b6 63. The parties disagree about the extent to which shop owners were familiar with the term ugg and whether they used it in a generic sense. Viewing the facts in light most favorable to Australian Leather, some shop owners were familiar with the term and used it generically, to refer to the style of the boots, and not in reference to Smith's company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In an interview, Smith said that surfers \"all knew of UGG in some way before I even started, and that's really why I did it. They already had a recognition in the surf market.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. Though some shop owners and surfers were familiar with the term, customers generally were not. [189] \u00b6 12. In addition to targeting surf and ski shops, Smith and Jensen sold their products at flea markets, swap meets, farmers markets, and from Smith's van.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Smith also attended ski shows in Las Vegas, where other companies selling sheepskin boots used the word ugg in their company name.

[189] \u00b6 13. Deckers acquired UGG Holdings (the successor to UGG Imports) and its UGG trademark in 1995.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. After Deckers acquired the UGG brand, it repositioned it as a luxury brand and sold its products in well-known department stores and through other third-party retailers, along with its own UGG concept stores and online.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Deckers spent tens of millions of dollars in advertising campaigns in fashion magazines during the early 2000s, and media outlets, movies, and TV shows featured UGG products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-26.

Arnold used the boots as packing material in his shipments of surfboards. [189] \u00b6 51. He sold mostly to surf shops and did not sell to mainstream footwear shops.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Roger Bosley, an Australian who was in the sheepskin business from 1973-84, traveled to the U.S. in 1979 in hopes of selling boots, but found Americans were not interested. [189] \u00b6 53; [173] \u00b6 15; [136-21] at 16:23-19:23. A year later, Bosley opened four retail shops in Los Angeles, which he operated for a little under two years, where he sold sheepskin boots under a cardboard sign that read \"UGG BOOTS.\" [189] \u00b6\u00b6 54-55; [173] \u00b6 50.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bosley stated that ugg had always been a generic term in Australia.

[189] \u00b6 57. He first attempted selling his boots wholesale to stores in the U.S. in 1980 but was unsuccessful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 1983, he sold \"probably\" 800 pairs at the 1983 America's Cup and then sold 40-50 leftover pairs in California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Dorizzi believed that ugg was a generic term and that all manufacturers used it to describe sheepskin boots. [173] \u00b6 13; [136-19] at 40:2-7. Robert Hayter also tried to sell sheepskin boots at the 1983 America's Cup, but was unable to sell many pairs and was disappointed in the response in America. [189] \u00b6 62. According to Hayter, the term ugg boot \"didn't mean much to [American customers] at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oygur-Australian Leather's owner-purchased a pair of sheepskin boots as\n   an eleven-year-old boy in Australia in 1971, and said that back then, everyone called them ugg boots. [173] \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   American surf-shop owners started selling sheepskin boots in their shops in the late 1960s. Terry McKendree, who owned two surf shops in Jacksonville, Florida in the late 1960s and early 1970s, imported sheepskin boots from Australia to sell in his own shops. [189] \u00b6 65. McKendree also arranged sales for other U.S. shops. [173] \u00b6 49; [136-22] at 34:7-12. He first learned about sheepskin boots during a 1969 trip to Australia, where surfers wore them to warm their feet after surfing in cold water. [173] \u00b6 16; [214] \u00b6 53. At that time, people in Australia used the term ugg to describe the type of boots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The boots McKendree sold were marked \"Made in Australia\" and sold out of a bin in his stores labeled \"UGG boots.\" [189] \u00b6 66. At the time he sold the boots, McKendree considered ugg to be generic. [214] \u00b6 58. McKendree placed an ad in\n   <em>\n    Surfing\n   </em>\n   magazine in the February 1970 issue, advertising \"Australian Sandals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; [189] \u00b6 67. The ad displayed six pieces of footwear, one of which was a sheepskin boot labeled \"UGG BOOT.\" [189] \u00b6 67. Aside from the ad in\n   <em>\n    Surfing\n   </em>\n   magazine, two other pre-1979 U.S. advertisements used the term \"UGG\" or \"Ugg\" followed by \"boot\": one in a Santa Cruz newspaper (December 1972),\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and one in\n   <em>\n    Surfer\n   </em>\n   magazine (November and December 1979).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Another surf-shop owner, Glen Kennedy, first became familiar with sheepskin boots on a trip to Australia in 1973-though he did not know if anyone referred to them as ugg boots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.

After 1986, Kennedy bought sheepskin boots from Smith, and sold them under the UGG brand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.

As a result, the exhibits are not properly authenticated, and I do not consider them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 901. In any event, as discussed below, even assuming Australian Leather established that ugg was generic in Australia, in part by offering these phone books, ads, and dictionaries, it has not linked that finding in any way to consumer perceptions in the U.S. and so considering this evidence would not change the result here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    4. Generic Status\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Australian Leather has not shown that ugg is, or ever has been, generic among footwear customers in the U.S-the relevant public. Australian Leather argues that the word ugg was generic among American surfers in the 1970s, but there is no reason to construe the relevant public so narrowly. Sheepskin boots are not a specialized technology that appeals only to some limited consumer base.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nartron Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11388233\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/305/397/#p406\">\n    305 F.3d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 406 (6th Cir. 2002). Though many early customers were surfers, anyone can purchase and wear boots (as evidenced by the shift in UGG's consumer-base over time). To show that ugg is generic, Australian Leather relies on the statements from a handful of American surfers and surf-shop owners; testimony from Australian manufacturers who sold boots in the U.S. (including statements from Smith); and a few advertisements. It points to no additional evidence, surveys or otherwise, of consumer perceptions. Crediting this evidence and drawing inferences in Australian Leather's favor demonstrates that some individuals used ugg generically in the past. But this is not enough to justify the conclusion that American footwear purchasers generally view ugg as a generic term. Based on Deckers's survey evidence and expert testimony-which revealed no generic uses of ugg in any dictionaries or databases and showed that 98% of consumers interviewed thought ugg was a brand-no reasonable factfinder could conclude that ugg is or ever was a generic word for sheepskin boots in the U.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Looking to the Australian experience does not alter this outcome. Although evidence of how Australians used the word ugg could be relevant to consumer perceptions in the U.S., generic usage in Australia is not enough on its own to infer generic meaning in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    G. Heileman Brewing\n   </em>\n   , 873 F.2d at 1000 n. 15. The foreign-equivalents doctrine does not dictate a different analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Duncan F. Duncan, Inc. v. Royal Tops Mfg.

First, the doctrine is not a perfect fit for English to English, and is generally used to analyze non-English terms used in the American marketplace. 2 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a7 12:41 (5th ed.) (\"Under the doctrine of foreign equivalents, a word commonly used in\n   <em>\n    another language\n   </em>\n   as the generic name of a product cannot be imported into the United States and be transformed into a valid trademark. Generic names in languages\n   <em>\n    other than English\n   </em>\n   have often been held to be generic for the American trade.\") (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, as applied here, the doctrine is simply an expression of the prohibition on allowing a trademark to monopolize a generic term. Australian Leather has evidence that ugg is generic in Australia, but there is no evidence that Americans familiar with Australian usage (or Australian visitors to the United States) would be misled into thinking that there is only one brand of ugg-style sheepskin boots available in this country. Australian Leather needed to come forward with some evidence that would allow a jury to conclude that the term ugg has a generic meaning to buyers in the United States; its Australian and surf-shop evidence does not suffice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Australian Leather, through expert testimony from an intellectual property professor at Monash University in Australia, also attempts to introduce evidence regarding the legal status of ugg in Australia. Australian Leather retained the professor to report on whether the word ugg (or minor variations of that term) is generic in Australia for sheepskin footwear. Deckers argues that the report is inadmissible because the legal status of ugg in Australia is irrelevant and that the professor's testimony is inadmissible under Rule 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert.\n   </em>\n   Deckers also notes that whether the term was generic in Australia in the past is outside of the scope of the report; the professor focused his analysis on the current legal status of the term. \"In determining foreign law, the court may consider any relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1. But the legal status of the term in Australia is irrelevant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the legal expert is not qualified to testify about consumer perceptions. As a result, I do not consider the report in deciding these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Even assuming the term is generic in Australia, no reasonable jury could conclude that it is generic in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Australian Leather's theory is inconsistent with the law. Even assuming that with full disclosure, the examining attorney would have attached a disclaimer to UGG in the ram logo, it does not follow that the word ugg\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   generic. And because it is not generic to the relevant consumers in the U.S., Deckers may rightfully own its subsequent trademarks. Australian Leather cannot attribute any harm it has suffered from Deckers's ownership rights to the '992 trademark as opposed to any other.

Australian Leather also asserts that the information explaining the dangers of counterfeit goods misleads consumers by improperly linking Australian Leather to those dangers. But Deckers never mentions Australian Leather by name, and there is no reason that a consumer would conclude that those statements were about Australian Leather. Further, for the reasons discussed, it is not false or misleading for Deckers to say that the word ugg is not generic in the U.S. Because the statements Australian Leather points to were not false, and because they do not mention Australian Leather, Australian Leather cannot prevail on its fraud claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Unclean Hands\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Australian Leather asserts that Deckers should be barred by the doctrine\n   of unclean hands from enforcing its trademarks based on its predecessor's abuse of the \u00ae symbol. Deckers owns eleven U.S. trademark registrations that contain the UGG mark. [189] \u00b6 94. In May 1996, UGG (at that point UGG Holdings) received a U.S. Trademark Registration for the text word UGG for footwear and other goods. [173] \u00b6 31. Though it did not own a trademark in the word UGG before 1996,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    \u00b6 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; [136-1] \u00b6\u00b6 123-26, Smith and his companies used the \u00ae symbol next to the word UGG in various advertisements and documents.

[204] \u00b6 26. To Smith's knowledge, none of his companies received a complaint about improper use of the \u00ae symbol.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    \u00b6 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on this testimony, Deckers disputes that the alleged misconduct was willful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Australian Leather uses the \u00ae symbol next to its name as well, and it has never applied for a trademark registration. [204] \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. Deckers argues that Australian Leather's own misuse precludes it from relying on the unclean-hands doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leo Feist, Inc. v. Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1404871\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/138/972/#p975\">\n    138 F.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 975 (7th Cir. 1943) (discussing the doctrine of unclean hands and noting that \"if the defendant has been guilty of conduct more unconscionable and unworthy than that of the plaintiff, the rule may be relaxed\"). Because there are genuine disputes of material facts as to the requisite intent and the degree of culpability of both parties, summary judgment is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Australian Leather estimates, relying on Oygur's calculations, that if Deckers did not own or enforce its trademarks, Australian Leather would have sold 75,000 pairs of boots (60,000 short boots and 15,000 long boots) annually to wholesalers in the United States from 2008-16. [189] \u00b6 111; [154-11] at 78. He also estimates the wholesale prices for which Australian Leather could have sold those boots to American retailers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1404871\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/138/972/#p975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Oygur bases these estimates on his own experiences; he did not do any test sales, studies, or surveys to determine the American demand for the product. [189] \u00b6 113. While the accuracy and precision of Oygur's calculations may be questioned, they are based on his personal knowledge of the industry and not so speculative as to entitle Deckers to summary judgment on the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Deckers's motion for partial summary judgment is granted with respect to Australian Leather's claims based on fraud, generic status, and the foreign equivalents doctrine. The motion as to Australian Leather's damages calculation is denied. Australian Leather's motion is denied. Deckers's motion for summary judgment, [137], is granted in part, denied in part. Australian Leather's motion, [130], is denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Because, as relevant here, Australian Leather and Oygur's affirmative defenses are the same, I refer to them collectively as Australian Leather.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Both parties raise objections throughout that relate to the relevance of evidence presented. Many of these objections stem from the parties' central disagreement about how to define the relevant class of purchasers, which matters when considering consumer perceptions to determine whether the term was generic. For reasons discussed below, I conclude that the relevant consumer perceptions are those of American footwear consumers generally. For that reason, evidence from non-surfer consumers is relevant. And though the test centers on American perceptions, the Australian experience is not irrelevant to that determination.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     G. Heileman Brewing Co. v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536744\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/873/985/\">\n     873 F.2d 985\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1000 n. 15 (7th Cir. 1989). Because many early players in the American sheepskin boot business had ties to Australia, this information provides helpful context. As to the relevant time period, a trademark is subject to cancellation at any time if it becomes generic. As a result, post-1979-the date Deckers asserts it first used the UGG trademark-evidence is relevant as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Bracketed numbers refer to entries on the district court docket.
