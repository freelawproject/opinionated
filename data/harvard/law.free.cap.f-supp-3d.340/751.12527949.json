(Filing No. 17.) Nelis alleges that he was discriminated against on the basis of sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\"), and was terminated in retaliation for reporting sex discrimination.

On or about June 2016, Hilton Garden Inn Indianapolis Airport (\"Hilton\") hired Nelis. (Filing No. 1 at 3.) Nelis is a male, but he does not follow traditional gender norms. Immediately\n   upon beginning employment with Hilton, Nelis's co-workers began making disparaging comments such as \"sissy\", \"queen\", \"fag\", and \"tranny\". The housekeeping manager subjected Nelis to similar comments as well.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046996\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/507/614/#p618\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The housekeeping manager would tell Mr. Nelis 'not to be a girl, but to be a man' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Nelis reported the comments and slurs to management, but the harassing behavior continued. Nelis was terminated following an incident in which he reported finding a bed bug in one of the rooms to his housekeeping manager. Maintenance was sent to the room, in which the maintenance manager met with the lead housekeeper. The maintenance manager advised Nelis that he was being terminated for \"creative differences\".\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Nelis alleges that the maintenance manager and lead housekeepers engaged in frequent and regular discrimination against him on the basis of sex, including using slurs and derogatory terms. On September 9, 2016, Nelis filed charges of sex and gender discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"the EEOC Charge\"), alleging discrimination on the basis of being a transgender and because he does not conform to gender norms. On September 6, 2017, Nelis filed a Complaint with this Court.

(Filing No. 18 at 4.) Nelis responds that he listed Hilton with the address of his employer (located at the Indianapolis Airport) on the EEOC Charge, and that attached to his Complaint is a Notice of Rights indicating the same address. (Filing No. 26 at 4.) Moreover, upon drafting the Complaint, Nelis searched the Indiana Secretary of State website and found no registration by the name of \"Hilton Garden Inn Indianapolis Airport\", and there are numerous entities doing business with the name/word Hilton in their title. As a result, Nelis sued all possible entities that may be the parent company of his employer, Hilton Garden Inn Indianapolis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The Seventh Circuit has also held that multiple entities may be considered an employee's 'employer' for the purposes of Title VII liability where an affiliated corporation 'directed the discriminatory act, practice, or policy of which the employee is complaining.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Tritsis v.

(Filing No. 18 at 5.) Citing\n   <em>\n    Tritsis\n   </em>\n   , Schahet additionally explains that the \"Complaint does not contain sufficient fact allegations demonstrating Schahet Hotels, Inc., exerted control over Nelis and qualified as his employer.\" Nelis distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Tritsis\n   </em>\n   on its facts by noting that the\n   <em>\n    Tritsis\n   </em>\n   court dismissed an alleged defendant employer because an exhibit attached to the Complaint belied the plaintiff's joint employer theory. (Filing No. 26 at 5.) The Court agrees. Nelis persuasively suggests that on reply Schahet should answer the proper line of inquiry which would be \"whether or not Schahet Hotels, Inc. has a hotel located at 8910 Hatfield Dr., Indianapolis[,] IN 46241 with the name Hilton contained in its title.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3577795\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/1074/#p1088\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In reply, Schahet does not answer whether or not it owns a hotel located at the indicated address, rather noting that this is not discovery where Schahet has to answer those questions while proposing discovery-related solutions that Nelis could have taken to confirm the proper defendant. (Filing No. 28 at 5.) The Court is not persuaded. At this stage, the Court accepts as true that Schahet Hotels, Inc. is d/b/a Hilton Garden Inn Indianapolis Airport until Schahet offers evidentiary support to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Turning to the merits of Schahet's Motion to Dismiss, Schahet contends that under\n   <em>\n    Ulane v.

Nelis responds that he is not a transsexual, and that the Complaint does not allege that he is a transsexual. (Filing No. 26 at 2.) In\n   <em>\n    Ulane\n   </em>\n   , a pilot was terminated after sex reassignment surgery. The Seventh Circuit held that the plaintiff was not discriminated against on the basis of being a female, rather she was discriminated on the basis of being a transsexual in which it held was not protected under Title VII.\n   <em>\n    Ulane,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"613435\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/742/1081/#p1084\">\n    742 F.2d at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court's holding rested on the determination that \"sexual identity\" is not a protected class.\n   <em>\n    Ulane\n   </em>\n   was decided in 1984. Nelis relies on\n   <em>\n    Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana\n   </em>\n   , in asserting that \"gender stereotyping falls within Title VII's prohibitions against sex discrimination even if the discrimination is by an individual of the same sex.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277022\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/339/#p340\">\n    853 F.3d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340-41 (7th Cir. 2017). At the outset of\n   <em>\n    Hively\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit's most recent case relevant to this issue, the court noted, \"[i]n this case, we have been asked to take a fresh look at our position in light of developments at the Supreme Court extending over two decades.\".

The case was heard\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   and the court noted that the panel described the line between a gender non-conformity claim and one based on sexual orientation as non-existent.

Turning back to the facts of this case, as noted previously, Nelis is not a transsexual. Thus, Nelis persuasively contends, that\n    <em>\n     Ulane\n    </em>\n    , a case only addressing whether or not Title VII protects transsexuals, transgenders, or homosexuals is not at issue here. (Filing No. 26 at 3.) Nelis alleges that he was discriminated against by a fellow male co-worker for not meeting stereotypical expectations of what a man should behave like. (Filing No. 26 at 2.) The Complaint alleges that Nelis was called \"sissy\" and \"queen\" among other slurs. (Filing No. 1.) Nelis argues that these comments indicated that his co-workers perceived him to be more feminine than masculine in that he failed to behave in line with a masculine male gender norm. In response, Schahet contends that the allegations in Nelis's Complaint demonstrate a claim for gender identity, rather than discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation. The Court disagrees. While gender identity could be an issue gleaned from the Complaint, the Seventh Circuit noted in\n    <em>\n     Hively\n    </em>\n    , that discrimination on the basis of failure to adhere to stereotypical gender norms is prohibited under Title VII,\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    sex discrimination, language which Nelis has alleged in his Complaint. The Complaint squarely alleges a gender non-conformity claim, which the Seventh Circuit and Supreme Court cases have recognized. Moreover, Schahet misconstrues the facts of\n    <em>\n     Hively\n    </em>\n    . (Filing No. 28 at 3-4.) (\"The\n    <em>\n     Hively\n    </em>\n    plaintiff made no allegation that she did not follow traditional gender norms or that she was discriminated against because of her gender identity. She alleged only that she was denied full-time employment because of her sexual orientation.\")\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    As noted previously,\n    <em>\n     Hively\n    </em>\n    relied on a line of gender non-conformity Supreme Court cases, in alleging that she was discriminated against because she was not a heterosexual female--a female gender norm. Schahet is correct in that the\n    <em>\n     Hively\n    </em>\n    court did not have the issue of gender identity before it; however, the Complaint does not allege a gender identity claim. (Filing No. 28 at 4.) And even if it could be construed to contain a gender identity claim, the Seventh Circuit explicitly recognized that gender non-conformity was protected under Title VII's sex prohibition. In\n    <em>\n     Hively\n    </em>\n    , sexual orientation was the specific behavior at issue for gender non-conformity. However, the\n    <em>\n     Hively\n    </em>\n    court examined gender conformity with regards to masculine and feminine stereotypes associated with being a male and female respectively, which is the behavior at issue in this case. At this stage of litigation, and finding that the case law does not foreclose Nelis's claim based on sex discrimination, the Court determines that Nelis's Complaint is sufficient to state a plausible claim for relief. Accordingly, Schahet's Motion to Dismiss is\n    <strong>\n     denied\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.\n     <em>\n      CONCLUSION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, Schahet's Motion to Dismiss is\n    <strong>\n     DENIED\n    </strong>\n    (Filing No. 17).\n    <strong>\n     SO ORDERED\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-36\">\n     \"It is quite possible that these interpretations may also have surprised some who served in the 88th Congress.
