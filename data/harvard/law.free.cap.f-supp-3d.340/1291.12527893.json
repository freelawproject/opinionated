Upon due consideration of the pleadings, and with the benefit of oral argument, Plaintiff's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Alpha is a home healthcare service provider with about twenty employees. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 5). Alpha provides skilled nursing care, restorative therapy, and other medical services to approximately thirty-five patients in their homes, at assisted living facilities, and in retirement communities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 12, p. 1). Alpha currently employs approximately twenty people as either W-2 employees or independent contractors. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 14). Alpha is one of few agencies that provide specialized therapy services, including dementia management, lymphedema therapy, and vestibular rehabilitation. (Doc. 12-1, \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. Jennifer Tauro, owner and manager of Alpha, provided an affidavit in which she attests that approximately 90% of Alpha's revenue is received through Medicare reimbursement. (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). Alpha bills Medicare approximately $45,00.00 per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). On December 27, 2016, a government-contracted auditor initially estimated that Alpha had been overpaid $1,418,504.47. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8). Alpha pursued its available administrative remedies, discussed in detail below, and on April 30, 2018 received a partially favorable decision which reduced the overpayment by half. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10). Alpha made a timely demand for a hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") to further contest the overpayment calculation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 117-19). By statute, a hearing must be held promptly before an ALJ, but the current backlog of pending cases has created a waiting period of between three and five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 12-1, \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To continue operating the business and providing services to patients, Ms. Tauro stopped drawing a salary and is using her personal resources to cover expenses. (Doc. 12-1, \u00b6 15). Alpha has already been forced to reduce medical staff, from thirty full-time to four full-time equivalent employees and has reduced its patient list from 130 to 22 patients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). Alpha has been compelled to lay off its remaining full-time marketers, further impacting the viability of its business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Alpha now seeks entry of a preliminary injunction to stay recoupment by the Defendants of $707,981.33 plus interest accruing at 9.625% per annum (currently exceeding $100,000). (Doc. 12, p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Administrative Appeals Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under the Medicare program enacted in 1965 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, the Medicare program reimburses Medicare providers for covered claims.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Medicare claims for home healthcare services must be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (\"DHS\"), which processes them through Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") and its Medicare Administrative Contractors (\"MACs\"). (Doc. 1, \u00b6 8). \"MACs are government contractors that process and make payments on valid claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395kk-1(a)(3).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Alpha submits reimbursement claims to the MAC appointed to the Orlando, Florida, geographic area-Palmetto GBA, LLC (\"Palmetto\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Paid Medicare claims are subject to \"post-payment review\" by Zone Program Integrity Contractors (\"ZPICs\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10). ZPICs generally use statistical sampling to calculate an estimated amount of overpayment. A healthcare agency can appeal post-payment claim denials via a four-level administrative appeals process before seeking review in front of a U.S. District Judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff. The four-step process proceeds as follows: first, a MAC reviews the denied claim for redetermination and must issue its decision within sixty days of the review request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1394ff(a)(3). Second, the health care agency can appeal the MAC's redetermination to a Qualified Independent Contractor (\"QIC\") within 180 days of the redetermination decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1395ff(c). The QIC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   must issue its decision within sixty days of the reconsideration request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the first two review steps, the third avenue is to appeal the QIC reconsideration decision within sixty days of its receipt by requesting a hearing before an ALJ.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1395ff(d)(1)(A). The statute requires the ALJ to hold the hearing and render a decision within ninety days of the healthcare provider's hearing request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If an ALJ does not hold the hearing and render a decision in a timely manner, the healthcare provider may escalate its appeal to a fourth level of review before the Medical Appeals Council, but the provider is limited to the evidentiary record established in the prior levels of review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1395ff(d)(3)(A). The Appeals Council must render a decision or remand the case within ninety days of a timely review request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1395ff(d)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   If these time periods are complied with, the appeals will proceed through the administrative process in about one year. After the Council has issued its decision, the healthcare provider may seek review in federal court. During the first two levels of review, healthcare providers can avoid recoupment of alleged overpayments by pursuing an appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1395ddd(f)(2). The provider cannot, however, avoid recoupment during the third or fourth level of the review process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, CMS can recoup the alleged overpayments prior to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review before the ALJ.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Alpha's Appeals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As previously discussed, on December 27, 2016, SafeGuard Services, LLC (\"SGS\")-the ZPIC assigned to Alpha's geographic area-sent Alpha a letter stating that Defendants overpaid Alpha approximately $1,418,503.47 in Medicare claims. (Doc. 1, pp. 8, 12-13). This overpayment amount was calculated based on SGS's review of a sample of sixty-nine claims paid to Alpha by Medicare. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The overpayment findings from the sample were then extrapolated to determine the total Medicare overpayment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On December 29, 2016, Palmetto requested that Alpha repay $1,418,503. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 18-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Alpha immediately appealed to the MAC, which issued a redetermination decision on April 5, 2017, partially upholding the claim denials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). Next, Alpha requested review by a Qualified Independent Contractor, C2C Innovative Solutions, Inc. (\"C2C\"), which ultimately rendered a partially favorable decision on August 14, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Subsequently, Alpha requested that C2C reopen its reconsideration decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). C2C agreed to reopen its reconsideration decision on October 27, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 78-79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 30, 2018, Alpha received a \"partially favorable\" reconsideration decision, resulting in a reduced overpayment amount of $707,981.33. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 112, 114). As of July 27, 2018, $101,767.25 of interest had accrued, thus Alpha owes a total of $809,748.58. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Before filing this suit, Alpha took two responsive actions: (1) Alpha requested a hearing before an ALJ (\"ALJ Hearing\") to demonstrate it was not overpaid; and (2) Alpha applied for a five-year repayment plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, pp. 117-19). The repayment-plan application was approved shortly before oral argument on November 13, 2018; however, Alpha cannot afford the payments sought by CMS over the next sixty months while it awaits a hearing before an ALJ and potentially an appeal from that decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   12-1, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
