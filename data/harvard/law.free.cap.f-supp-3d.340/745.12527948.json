(\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 28\n   </em>\n   .) In this action, FIC seeks a declaratory judgment that it has and had no duty to defend or indemnify Defendant Stephanie Swinney (\"Swinney\") for any judgment or settlement entered in an underlying lawsuit entitled\n   <em>\n    Russell Jacobs v. Stephanie Swinney and Pure Beverage\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Company\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 55D03-1612-CT001903, currently pending in Morgan County, Indiana Superior Court (the \"Morgan County Lawsuit\"). The basis of this contention is that Swinney was not a permissive driver of the insureds' company vehicle when it struck Defendant Russell Jacobs (\"Jacobs\"), and, as such, Swinney does not qualify as an insured under an insurance policy issued by FCI. For reasons explained below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    grants\n   </strong>\n   FIC's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are not necessarily objectively true, but as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, the facts are presented in the light most favorable to Jacobs as the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zerante v.

Pursuant to Local Rule 56-1(f)(1), the facts that Jacobs asserts are true, to the extent admissible evidence supports them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Morgan County Lawsuit surrounds a collision between Jacobs and Swinney while Swinney was driving a vehicle owned by Pure Beverage Company (\"Pure Beverage\"). (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 1-1 at 2\n   </em>\n   .) Jacobs filed the Morgan County Lawsuit against Swinney and Pure Beverage on December 5, 2016, seeking damages for extensive injuries sustained during the collision. FIC is Pure Beverage's insurer and Jacobs contends, pursuant to the FIC policy, it has a duty to defend Pure Beverage (or its interest) in the Morgan County Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the time of the accident, Swinney was living with her fianc\u00e9, Danny Scott (\"Scott\"), who was an employee of Pure Beverage. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 29-3 at 3\n   </em>\n   .) Swinney was never employed by Pure Beverage. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 29-2 at 1\n   </em>\n   .) Though Scott does not recall signing Pure Beverage's written vehicle policy, he knew certain policies existed. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 29-1 at 5\n   </em>\n   .) The Commercial Auto Policy issued to Pure Beverage states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A.

When shown the policy terms during his deposition, Scott testified that the terms appeared to be what he remembered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. On the day of the accident, Swinney took the Pure Beverage vehicle without the knowledge or permission of Scott, nor did she have permission from Pure Beverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 29-3 at 3\n   </em>\n   .) Prior to the date of the accident, Swinney had never driven the Pure Beverage vehicle, and had never spoken to anyone at Pure Beverage regarding permission to use the vehicle.

(\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 1\n   </em>\n   .) In its Complaint, FIC alleges that for Swinney to qualify as an insured under the FIC policy, Swinney must have been using the Pure Beverage vehicle with \"[Pure Beverage Company's] permission.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The Summons and Complaint were served on Swinney on April 11, 2017, by a process server, and on April 19, 2017, by US Mail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Service was properly effectuated. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 17-1\n   </em>\n   .)

FIC filed a Motion for Clerk's Entry of Default against Swinney and on July 12, 2017, the Clerk of this Court granted FIC's Motion, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a) (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 16\n   </em>\n   ). On\n   August 18, 2017, FIC filed its Motion for Default Judgment against Swinney. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 17\n   </em>\n   .) The Court granted that Motion on December 27, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 27\n   </em>\n   .) On default, the Court declared that FIC has no duty under the FIC Policy to defend Swinney in the Underlying Action, or to indemnify Swinney for any judgment or settlement entered against her in the Underlying Action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.

The central issue in this case is whether or not Swinney had permission to use the Pure Beverage vehicle. FIC contends that under the clear and unambiguous terms of the FIC policy, Swinney would only be entitled to coverage if she was a \"permissive user\" of the Pure Beverage vehicle at the time of the accident. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 29 at 7\n   </em>\n   .) Jacobs contends there is disputed issue of material fact regarding whether Scot's personal use of the company vehicle was\n   <em>\n    initially restricted\n   </em>\n   by Pure Beverage's instructions or established policy. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 36 at 1).\n   </em>\n   He responds that permission may be implied, and that there is a factual dispute regarding whether Pure Beverage restricted the use of the vehicle to employees only,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   Scott.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Many courts have referred to policy provisions similar to the one at issue, covering permissive use, as an \"omnibus\" clause.\n   <em>\n    Manor v.

Additionally, there was no implied permission, because the daughter's initial permission was terminated when she loaned the car out for unauthorized use against her parents' express restrictions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10884712,10884961\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/637/811/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"When the owner of a vehicle places express restrictions on its use by others, the focus is not on whether the operator deviated from the contemplated use; the determinative question is whether the operator's use of the vehicle was restricted in the first instance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10884712,10884961\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/637/811/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10884712,10884961\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/637/811/\">\n    at 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Arnold,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"444449\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/260/161/#p165\">\n    260 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   165 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   FIC contends that Scott's use of the Pure Beverage vehicle was expressly restricted by the Salesmen Vehicle Policies, which provided that only Pure Beverage employees may drive the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 29 at 9\n   </em>\n   .) As discussed earlier, Jacobs contends that there is a material factual dispute as to when or whether Pure Beverage restricted Scott's use prior to the accident. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 36 at 3\n   </em>\n   .) Scott admitted knowledge that vehicle policies\n   existed, but could not recall whether he had ever been told that a non-employee was not allowed to drive the company vehicle. In support of implied permissive use here, Jacobs cites to\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. White,\n   </em>\n   a case where the Indiana Court of Appeals held that the owner of a vehicle had not expressly restricted a permissive user from allowing a third person to drive.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1482279\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ind-app/168/118/\">\n    168 Ind.App. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=341%20N.E.2d%20782\">\n    341 N.E.2d 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 785 (1976). The only restriction placed on the vehicle's use in that case was for the permittee to return the vehicle in time for the owner to go to church that evening. Thus, the Indiana Court of Appeals held that there was coverage for the ensuing accident caused by a third driver, whom the owner had not expressly loaned the vehicle to.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=341%20N.E.2d%20782\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The facts here are distinguished. The Court agrees with FIC. The Pure Beverage Salesmen Vehicle Policy expressly restricted use of the Pure Beverage vehicle to employees use only. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 1-2\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at 2\n   </em>\n   .) In addition to not remembering the exact language of the vehicle policy, Scott provided an affidavit that he did not sign the Salesmen Vehicle Policy prior to Swinney's accident. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 37-2 at 1\n   </em>\n   .) The affidavit, provided after Scott's deposition testimony, is the subject of a Motion to Strike contained in FIC's reply brief. FCI notes that Scott's affidavit contradicts portions of his deposition testimony. FIC also notes that the evidentiary matters raised in its Motion to Strike, particularly with regards to an \"alleged forgery\" are not relevant to the ultimate outcome. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 38 at 6\n   </em>\n   .)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Viewing the facts in a light favorable to Jacobs, and accepting that Scott did not sign the Pure Beverage Salesmen Vehicle Policy, summary judgment in favor of FIC is still warranted for two reasons. First, despite Scott not recalling whether the particular use at issue was permitted, he did concede that he was aware that vehicle policies existed. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 37-1 at 16\n   </em>\n   .) Second, and dispositive, Scott conceded that he never gave Swinney permission to use the vehicle and had no knowledge that she had taken it on the date in question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Moreover, there was no implied use based on a course of conduct, as Swinney conceded that this was the first time that she had used the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 29-3 at 5-6\n   </em>\n   .) Thus, neither Pure Beverage, nor Scott, acquiesced in Swinney's use of the Pure Beverage vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , express restrictions regarding who was permitted to drive the Pure Beverage vehicle governed Scott's use of the vehicle. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Gonterman\n   </em>\n   , Scott was not permitted to allow third parties to drive the Pure Beverage vehicle, and even if he were allowed to permit others to drive the company vehicle, Scott never gave Swinney permission to use the vehicle. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Manor\n   </em>\n   , permission in this case terminated, whether through implied or express permission, because the scope of permission excluded Swinney's use thereby, also terminating Scott's use. Because Swinney does not qualify as a \"permissive user\", she is not covered under the Commercial Auto Policy. Thus, summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   in favor of FIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, FIC's Motion for Summary Judgment (\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 28\n   </em>\n   ) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .
