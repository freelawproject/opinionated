(Dkt. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 30-34). Presently before the Court is Defendant's motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 4). For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are taken from the Complaint. As required on a motion to dismiss, the Court treats Plaintiff's factual allegations as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff began working for Defendant as an administrative assistant in 2015. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 14). She applied for and was denied the position of senior administrative assistant and was not given the chance to apply for the position of human resources manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15). She alleges that she was qualified for both of these positions, and that Caucasian individuals who did not previously work for the company as well as employees with less experience than her were selected for these positions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16). Plaintiff also claims that she was denied salary increases given to similarly situated Caucasian employees, that she is paid less than Caucasian employees in her position who have less experience than her, and that she was asked to perform hundreds of hours of additional work outside of her job description for which she received no extra pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 21-22, 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she filed a charge of discrimination against Defendant with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on July 27, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). On February 2, 2018, Plaintiff requested the matter be withdrawn from the EEOC so it could be pursued in federal court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9; Dkt. 9-1 at 2). EEOC issued a notice of right to sue to Plaintiff dated February 22, 2018. (Dkt. 9-1 at 6-7). Plaintiff commenced this action on May 22, 2018. (Dkt. 1). Defendant filed the instant\n   motion to dismiss on July 24, 2018 (Dkt. 4), and on September 7, 2018, Plaintiff filed a response to the motion (Dkt. 9). Defendant replied in support of the motion to dismiss on September 14, 2018 (Dkt. 10), and Plaintiff was granted permission to file a sur-reply by the Court (Dkt. 13), which she filed on October 11, 2018 (Dkt. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's state law claim and claim regarding a hostile work environment should be dismissed, and that all claims are barred by sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 4-4 at 6-9).

(Dkt. 4-4 at 6-8). Plaintiff states she brings a claim for discrimination on the basis of race (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 30-34), and she concedes that her Complaint contains no separate cause of action for a hostile work environment (Dkt. 14 at 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the Court finds the Complaint, while inartfully drafted, does not intend to assert a claim that Defendant created a hostile work environment and therefore that aspect of Defendant's motion is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     State Law Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant also argues that Plaintiff has asserted state law claims that should be dismissed. (Dkt. 4-4 at 9). Again, Plaintiff concedes that she does not assert any state law claims. (Dkt. 14 at 2). While the Complaint, in the request for relief, does ask for \"[a] judgment that the Defendant violated the Plaintiff's rights under New York State Human Rights Law\" (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 B), Plaintiff's request for relief is just that-a request, and one that Plaintiff admits should not be granted. Accordingly, with no state law claims asserted in the Complaint, Defendant's motion to dismiss any state law claims is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Sovereign Immunity\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant asserts that it is entitled to sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, and that Plaintiff's Title VII claim should be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). (Dkt. 4-4 at 8-9). Defendant's argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Title VII was enacted pursuant to Congress's authority under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Fitzpatrick v.
