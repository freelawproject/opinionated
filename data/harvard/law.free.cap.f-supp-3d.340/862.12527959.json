According to Blue, the government intends to offer evidence under Rule 413 of the Federal Rules of Evidence that AM also made sexual assault allegations against Blue. Blue filed a motion seeking the following: 1) counseling records for CB from Capital Area Counseling as well as all records from the South Dakota Department of Social Services (DSS) concerning CB; 2) all DSS records concerning WWK, along with WWK's records from St. Joseph's Indian School, Crow Creek Middle School, Chamberlain Academy, Our Home, the New Beginnings Center in Aberdeen, and the Abbot House in Mitchell; and 3) certain records concerning AM from Child Protection Services in Brule County and Child's Voice in Sioux Falls, along with all records from DSS concerning AM. Docs. 36, 37.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Blue asked this Court to issue a subpoena duces tecum under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17(c) ordering that these records be produced to defense counsel or, in the alternative, to this Court\n   for in camera review. Concluding that CB and WWK were entitled to notice under Rule 17(c)(3) but that AM was not, this Court directed the government to inform CB and WWK that Blue was seeking confidential information about them and to determine whether they wished to assert the psychotherapist-patient privilege. Doc. 38. The government has informed this Court that CB and AM are asserting the psychotherapist-patient privilege. Doc. 39. Although the government has been unable to reach WWK, it wishes to assert the privilege on her behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 39. The government argues that the psychotherapist-patient privilege bars disclosure of the records Blue seeks and that Blue has failed to satisfy the requirements of Rule 17(c). This Court addresses these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

As to the first issue, a party invoking the psychotherapist-patient privilege must show that her communications were made (1) confidentially; (2) to a licensed psychotherapist; and (3) during the course of diagnosis or treatment.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335296\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/778/#p787\">\n    827 F.3d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 787 (8th Cir. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ghane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3741749\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/771/#p783\">\n    673 F.3d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783 (8th Cir. 2012). Analyzing whether the records Blue seeks meet\n   this test is difficult because this Court does not have the records and the parties have provided limited information about them. Nevertheless, this Court has enough information to make some preliminary observations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To begin with, there is no evidence that the DSS records Blue requests for CB, WWK, and AM fall within the psychotherapist-patient privilege. DSS records for minor children usually consist of notes or reports by case workers concerning the child's background and current situation. Although DSS. records might record that a child is seeing a counselor or therapist and might even contain some information concerning the treatment, the DSS caseworker is not the person providing the mental health treatment. Absent any information that the DSS caseworkers here are licensed psychotherapists who were treating the alleged victims, the alleged victims' DSS records are not protected by the psychotherapist-patient privilege. Next, nothing indicates that WWK's records from the Crow Creek Middle School in 2012 contain confidential communications WWK made to a licensed psychotherapist during the course of treatment or diagnosis. The information Blue seeks from the Crow Creek Middle School concerns a report that WWK had sexual contact with an older boy, which is of dubious relevance at best, but not likely protected by the privilege here if the report was made to a teacher or school administrator. Finally, AM's records from Child Protection Services and Child's Voice in Sioux Falls do not appear to fall within the psychotherapist-patient privilege. Records from Child Protective Services would be similar to records from DSS; they would contain the child's biographical information and any allegations and investigations of abuse rather than confidential communications the child made during the course of treatment. The records Blue seeks from Child's Voice concern an exam AM had there in April 2016. Although Child's Voice may provide treatment or a diagnosis in some instances, Child's Voice typically conducts forensic evaluations and interviews of children believed to have been sexually abused as a part of investigating and documenting evidence. The government and AM have not presented any evidence that AM's exam at Child's Voice involved confidential communications AM made to a licensed psychotherapist during the course of treatment or diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By contrast, CB's records from Capital Area Counseling and WWK's treatment records from St. Joseph's Indian School (where she saw a psychiatrist), Chamberlain Academy, Our Home, the New Beginnings Center, and Abbot House could fall within the psychotherapist-patient privilege. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v. Ritchie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131144\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/39/\">\n    480 U.S. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131144\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/39/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131144\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/39/\">\n    94 L.Ed.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), Blue argues that his request for the records trumps the privilege because the records are \"material and necessary to assure him his Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-exam his accusers.\" Doc. 40 at 2.

Although evidence suggesting that the alleged victims are falsely accusing Blue would be acutely relevant, the government argues that Blue is merely speculating that the records might contain such information. To be sure, the \"specificity and relevance elements\" of the\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   standard \"require more than the title of a document and conjecture as to its contents.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Hang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"807\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/1275/#p1283\">\n    75 F.3d at 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This Court has recognized, however, that defendants sometimes struggle to be specific in establishing the relevance and admissibility of DSS or mental health records without truly knowing what the records contain or what the government's evidence will be at trial. In the past, this Court has ordered the production of records for in camera review so that the Court can determine whether the defendant is entitled to the records. The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   did not hold that defendants must establish relevance beyond all doubt. Rather, the Court, after recognizing that the special prosecutor could not \"fully\" describe the contents of the tapes when it filed the subpoena, held that the prosecutor had shown \"a sufficient likelihood that each of the tapes contains conversations relevant to the offenses charged in the indictment.\"\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p698\">\n    418 U.S. at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p698\">\n    94 S.Ct. 3090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p698\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (concluding that the overall context of the tapes \"permit[ed] a rational inference that at least part of the conversations relate to the offenses charged in the indictment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Blue has shown a sufficient likelihood of relevance to justify an in camera review at least on the requested records concerning WWK. Some of WWK's records contain allegations that people including but not limited to Blue sexually abused her. Most of the records Blue seeks for WWK relate to the time during which Blue allegedly sexually assaulted her or the two years thereafter. Blue has made a weaker showing of a likelihood of relevance as to the requested Child's Voice and Child Protection Services records concerning AM, just narrowly providing enough information to support a rational inference that such records contain relevant evidence. For example, AM apparently alleged during a July 22, 2016 forensic interview that Blue sexually abused her. Although Blue\n   has the July 22, 2016 interview report, he is seeking an interview of AM that Child's Voice conducted on April 13, 2016. The Child's Voice interview could contain allegations against Blue or show that AM failed to accuse Blue despite having the opportunity to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Blue however has not made a showing of relevance regarding DSS records on AM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Blue has made no showing of relevance as to the records concerning CB, but simply wants those in case she perchance disclosed being sexually abused by someone else or recanted. If the standard of relevance were set so low where a defendant could simply aver a possibility of another perpetrator or recantation, then a criminal defendant facing sexual assault charges could in every case seek in camera review of all sorts of records\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the alleged victim. No case authority or rule of criminal procedure, however, entitles a defendant facing a sex charge with such a broad right of discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Specificity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Blue has shown enough relevance to warrant an in camera review of some material, but some of his requests are not sufficiently specific. Some of Blue's requests seek all the records an organization has for the alleged victims, without any limits on the time frame or the type of documents sought. Such broad requests smack of a fishing expedition, which Rule 17(c) does not allow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9441390\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/287/985/#p991\">\n    287 F.3d 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 991 (10th Cir. 2002) (\"Courts have held that requests for an entire file are evidence of an impermissible fishing expedition.\"). As set forth in the Conclusion below, this Court will narrow certain requests of Blue so that they meet the specificity requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Admissibility\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The government argues that the records are inadmissible because they are hearsay and protected by the psychotherapist-patient privilege. If Blue is right about the content of certain records, such records could potentially be admissible as impeachment evidence. After all, CB, WWK, and AM will almost certainly testify at trial. When they do, certain of their statements contained in the records could become admissible as prior inconsistent statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 613(b). Unfortunately for Blue, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Nixon\n   </em>\n   stated that \"[g]enerally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to require its production in advance of trial.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p698\">\n    418 U.S. at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/#p698\">\n    94 S.Ct. 3090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The rationale for this rule is that \"the admissibility prong of Rule 17(c) cannot be fully assessed until the corresponding witness testifies.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. LaRouche Campaign\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304419\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/841/1176/#p1180\">\n    841 F.2d 1176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1180 (1st Cir. 1988). However, \"where a defendant has identified evidence that would be admissible for impeachment but not otherwise, several courts have ordered the items produced for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection so that the court may review the material and disclose it, if ever, when it becomes ripe for impeachment.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3918750\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/239/591/#p601\">\n    239 F.R.D. 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601 (N.D. Cal. 2006) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaRouche Campaign\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304419\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/841/1176/#p1180\">\n    841 F.2d at 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that it was proper to disclose impeachment evidence before trial because the \"putative key witness, whose general testimony is already known, is scheduled to testify\");\n   <em>\n    United States v. King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"200164\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/194/569/#p574\">\n    194 F.R.D. 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574-75 (E.D. Va. 2000) (ordering\n   pretrial production of evidence where it was clear that the evidence would be useful for impeachment and it was \"known with certainty\" that the witness would testify). Pretrial in camera review is the appropriate course here, where the three alleged victims will be testifying, the content of their testimony is generally known, the records might reasonably contain impeachment evidence, and such review will aid in trial preparation and avoid unnecessary delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In camera review is also the best approach to resolving the psychotherapist-patient privilege issue under these circumstances. As noted above, this Court has limited information about the records. Although the party asserting the privilege has the burden of proving its applicability, the only information the government has offered is a statement in its brief that Blue \"seeks records regarding treatment.\" Doc. 39 at 2. Some of the records sought by Blue appear to be privileged while others do not. Under these circumstances, in camera review will allow this Court to determine with certainty which records fall within the privilege. In camera review is also the safest approach given the uncertainty about whether Blue has any constitutional right to the records and whether this right is paramount to the psychotherapist-patient privilege. If the records do not contain the evidence Blue seeks, this Court need not disclose the records to Blue and the records will remain confidential from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court recognizes, of course, that any review of the records may seem invasive to the alleged victims. At least one district court has held that ordering the production of mental health records for in camera review is itself a violation of the psychotherapist-patient privilege.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Doyle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1575259\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/1/1187/#p1191\">\n    1 F.Supp.2d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1191 (D. Or. 1998). However, other courts have ordered that mental health records sought in a subpoena be produced for in camera review despite a claim that the records are subject to the psychotherapist-patient privilege.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Chee\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:14-CR-00033-KJD-CWH,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203397683\">\n    2016 WL 3397683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (D. Nev. June 14, 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Alperin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11144477\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/128/1251/#p1254\">\n    128 F.Supp.2d 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1254-55 (N.D. Cal. 2001). This Court will order that certain records be produced for an in camera review so that the Court can rule on Blue's motion and the privilege asserted by the alleged victims. These records will not be disclosed to anyone else until a further ruling by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   However, additional records that a boy with the initials J.B. had sexual contact with WWK at Crow Creek Middle School will not be admissible at trial and need not be subpoenaed. Blue already has information about the incident to use if WWK or the government suggests that WWK would not have knowledge of sexual activity lest she was so assaulted by Blue. Rules 403 and 412 otherwise render evidence about J.B.'s sexual contact with WWK inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
