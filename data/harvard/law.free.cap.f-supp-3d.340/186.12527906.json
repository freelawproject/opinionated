In February 2008, Mauze was promoted to Manager of Sports Production Services (SPS), a role she held until her termination in February 2013. CBS 56.1 \u00b6 1. With her promotion, Mauze received a raise to an annual salary of $70,000, CBS 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, and reported to Arthur Harris (\"Harris\"), an African-American man and Vice President of Broadcast Operations, CBS 56.1 \u00b6 4; Jones Decl., ECF No. 43 (\"Jones Decl.\"), Ex. 1, Mauze Dep.

Harris responded that the changes planned for the department did not include Sports Production Services. CBS 56.1 \u00b6 18; Jones Decl., Ex. 5, Sept. 27, 2012 Email from Harris to Mauze. A few months later, in September 2012, Mauze called Hazel-Ann Mayers (\"Mayers\"), CBS's Assistant General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, and complained about her lack of opportunity for a promotion. CBS 56.1 \u00b6 20; Mauze Add'l 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. Mauze alleges that she also made claims of \"adverse actions and hostile work environment against Mr. Harris and for discrimination in promotional opportunities and pay disparity against [Ken] Aagaard.\" Mauze Opp'n at 2; Mauze Add'l 56.1 \u00b6 34. CBS asserts that Mauze did not claim discrimination at this time. CBS 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 23-25. Mayers then asked Kevin Oldis (\"Oldis\"), VP of Human Resources, to look into Mauze's complaint. CBS 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. Mauze told Oldis that Harris was denying her opportunities and was difficult to work with. CBS 56.1 \u00b6 25. Harris was subsequently transferred out of Mauze's department. CBS 56.1 \u00b6 28. As a result, in January 2013, Mauze began reporting to Scott Davis (\"Davis\"), a white man, who replaced Harris as Vice President of Broadcast Operations. CBS 56.1 \u00b6 29, Davis originally applied for the open position of Director of Broadcast Operations. Mauze Add'l 56.1 \u00b6 62; Jones Decl., Ex. 5, Davis Dep. (\"Davis Dep\") at 27:14-23. Davis had five direct reports: Doug Jackson (\"Jackson\"), Director of Broadcast Operations; George Dimotheris (\"Dimotheris\"), Director of Broadcast Operations; Kevin Burroughs (\"Burroughs\"), Manager of Broadcast Operations; Mauze, Manager of Sports Production Services; and Shoshana Salmon (\"Salmon\"), Coordinator of Broadcast Operations.

CBS 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 34a-38a. Mauze disputes that this relationship between the divisions existed. Mauze Counter 56.1 \u00b6 34 (\"CBS Sports and CBS Sports Network [ ] were separate\n   divisions of CBS, with different budgets and separate sales and \"traffic teams\" \"). However, Mauze alleges that, after several discussions with him, Aagaard told her that she would be \"taken care of in the reorganization\". Mauze Add'l 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 48-49, 67-69. In addition, Patty Power (\"Power\"), a white woman, was promoted to Senior Vice-President of Operations, and became Davis's direct supervisor. CBS 56.1 \u00b6 39a. Later that summer, Davis fired Jackson, and Burroughs took over Jackson's responsibilities. CBS 56.1 \u00b6 37b. Because he was capable of filling the role and was already \"operating at that capacity,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Davis formally promoted Burroughs to Director in August 2013.

CBS 56.1 \u00b6 46. Mauze also complained to Mayers, alleging that she \"believe[d] that [she] ha[d] been discriminat[ed] against because of [her] sex and ... blacklisted by Ken Aagaard and denied any and all opportunity for advancement in [her] department.\" CBS 56.1 \u00b6 49; Salins Decl., Ex K., Mauze email to Mayers 8/30/2013. She also complained that she had \"made numerous verbal and written attempts to receive a formal review\" and \"submitted proposals for [her] advancement as recently as March to Ken Aagaard via email.\" Salins Decl, Ex. K. Mauze was upset because Burroughs and Dimotheris were hired into Manager positions after her, but surpassed her in title and pay. Mauze Add'l 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 95, 98. Mauze subsequently told Oldis that she wanted clarification about her job description and whether there was additional opportunity for her at CBS. CBS 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 50-51. According to Oldis, Mauze \"wanted the director's title ... [but] wasn't looking for a wider role. She wanted the title for what she did\" already.

(\"Mauze Dep.\") at 141:24-144:21. She also asserts that \"building CBSSN's commercial formats was [not] within the reasonable scope of her employment\" and that, to justify her lack of upgrade/promotion and salary increase, Davis used the \"as assigned\" provision in her job description to require her to perform duties he had previously removed. Mauze Counter 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 59-60; Salins Decl., Ex N. She alleges that CBS's version of her job description removed duties that were \"added since her hire,\" and that she had inherited certain duties from the former Director of Sales soon after she became the Manager, SPS. Mauze Add'l 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 126-27. Davis questioned Mauze's assertion that she \"collaborat[ed] with executives to understand business objectives,\" because it suggested that she had \"an executive level job and a strategic role,\" and he did not believe this was one of Mauze's responsibilities. Salins Decl, Ex. C, Davis Dep. at 85:8-20. After reviewing her job description, Davis and Power concluded that Mauze's title and salary did not warrant adjustment; this message was communicated to Mauze by Davis and Human Resources Manager Michelle Ahmad on November 25, 2013. CBS 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 58, 61a-64a. Mauze accepted the new job description.

She also sang \"this is not my job\" in the workplace. CBS 56.1 \u00b6 66a; Mauze Dep. at 55:3-6. In addition, though she was invited to meetings with VPs and high-level executives, she chose not to attend, CBS 56.1 \u00b6 108a, because she viewed her attendance as \"unnecessary,\" Mauze Counter 56.1 \u00b6 108a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   One Sunday in early September 2013, Mauze arrived at CBS's Studio 43 and found no chair at her work station. CBS 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 62b-64b. According to Burroughs, this oversight was \"completely unintentional.\" CBS 56.1 \u00b6 66b. Upon realizing that her chair was missing, Mauze walked out of the studio. CBS 56.1 \u00b6 64b. When Mauze returned, she complained to Davis, who asked her to find a chair. CBS 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 67b-68b. When Mauze refused, Burroughs retrieved one from a nearby room.

CBS contends that the alternative seat had all of the equipment Mauze needed to do her job, CBS 56.1 \u00b6 78, however, Mauze left the studio and told Aagaard and Power that there was \"no position\" for her and no \"tools to perform her job,\" CBS 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 77, 79; Mauze Add'l 56.1 \u00b6 160, and that she was insulted to be put in the corner,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mauze Add'l 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 155, 160.
