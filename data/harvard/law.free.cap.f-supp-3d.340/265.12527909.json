The defendant claims that his interests in Delos Living qualify for a partial exemption under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The government's application is granted, and the defendant's claim of exemption is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In September of 1998, the defendant was charged with securities fraud and money laundering in connection with purchases and sales of Dollar Time Group, Inc., and Aquanatural Company. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1.) The defendant and his co-defendant, Daniel Mark Porush, both of whom had ownership interests in Dollar Time and Aquanatural, opened a Swiss bank account and smuggled cash into the account to finance illicit securities transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6, 8-10.) As part of their scheme, they caused millions of shares of Dollar Time and Aquanatural stock to be issued at below-market prices to their own offshore entities, which they falsely claimed were owned by foreign individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) They encouraged customers to purchase stock to generate inflated market demand, and sold their stock back into the U.S. marketplace, reaping substantial profits, which they used to buy additional stock in the companies, and then sold shares to their firm to transfer profits from their offshore entities to their firm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On May 25,1999, the defendant pleaded guilty to multiple counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering, and manipulative and deceptive devices. (ECF No. 37.) The Honorable John Gleeson sentenced him to 42 months in prison, and ordered him to pay restitution in the amount of $110,362,993.87.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 134.) To date, the defendant has paid only a fraction of that amount-$12,843,845.19. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 197, 242.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At issue here is the extent to which the defendant's interest in an entity called Delos Living is protected from garnishment by the Consumer Credit Protection Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November of 2014, Delos Living entered into an agreement not with the defendant as an individual, but with a company that he set up called JB Global Holdings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Delos Living awarded the defendant's company Class D Membership Units.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agreement was designed to \"enhanc[e] [Delos Living]'s ability to attract, retain, and motivate\" the defendant, who was \"expected to make important contributions\"; the Class D Membership Units were \"intended to be treated as 'profits interests' for federal income tax purposes,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"thereby better aligning the interests of [the defendant] with those of [Delos Living]'s members.\" (ECF No. 214-2 at 7, 10-11.) The agreement awarded JB Global Holdings 1.153 Class D Membership Units for \"bona fide services\" that the defendant would provide. (ECF No. 214-2 at 2, 9.) The units were to vest in equal amounts-0.28825 units-over a three-year period at the beginning of each year starting January 1, 2016, and \"are non-voting ... profit interests, intended to serve as incentive equity for certain service providers to\" Delos Living. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2; ECF No. 209 at 2.) The defendant could participate in capital distributions of Delos Living only after the fair market value of the company exceeded $300,000,000. (ECF No. 214-2 at 2, 7.) At the time of the defendant's objection to the government's writ of garnishment, 0.86475 of JB Global Holdings' Class D Membership Units had vested, and 0.28825 unvested units were scheduled to vest on January 1, 2019. (ECF No. 212 at 2.) The fair market value of the company, at least as of the time of oral argument, did not exceed $300,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both sides filed memoranda, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 215, 220, 223, 230), and I heard oral argument on May 16, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (May 16, 2018 Minute Entry.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The government seeks a writ of garnishment of the defendant's Delos Living membership interests. The defendant responds that the units are \"earnings\" under the CCPA that qualify for the 25% garnishment cap. I conclude that those membership interests do not qualify as \"earnings\" under the CCPA, and are therefore subject to full garnishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act, \"[a] court may issue a writ of garnishment against property (including nonexempt disposable earnings) in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest and which is in the possession, custody, or control of a person other than the debtor, in order to satisfy the judgment against the debtor.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203205\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Nevertheless, a review of the statute's purpose and the relevant case law leads me to conclude that these interests are not what Congress had in mind when it enacted the CCPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kokoszka v.

Nothing about the defendant's arrangement with Delos Living is consistent with that goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The award agreement does not permit the defendant to participate in capital distributions unless and until Delos Living's fair market value exceeds a $300,000,000 hurdle. In other words, the defendant receives no cash from the membership interests until Delos Living's fair market value\n   is greater than $300,000,000, which, as far as I am aware, has not occurred. The defendant does not claim, nor could he in light of his financial records and the conditions governing the membership units, that he uses the membership units to support himself and his family at all, let alone on a periodic basis. According to the record, the defendant has relied on another of his companies-again owned solely by him and his fianc\u00e9e-to pay for millions of dollars of personal expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 223-2 \u00b6 9 (\"Belfort and Ms. Koppe had the company pay for their personal expenses in 2013, 2014 and 2015, net of any reimbursements or reversals, in the amounts of $1,422,632.42, $2,792,004.21 and $3,722,580.89, respectively.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court has not found and the defendant does not cite any case in which a court applied the CCPA's garnishment cap to a similar type of property interest. Courts have, however, concluded that the CCPA exemption does not apply to interests that more closely resemble earnings than the property at issue here. These interests include tax refunds, rollover IRA funds, accounts receivable for work performed, and severance pay received in a lump sum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kokoszka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1519533\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/642/#p651\">\n    417 U.S. at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1519533\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/642/#p651\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (tax refunds are not \"earnings\" under the CCPA);\n   <em>\n    United States v.
