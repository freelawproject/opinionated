INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this products liability action, Plaintiff Kim Chandler (\"Plaintiff\") alleges that she was injured after using an at-home hair relaxer product manufactured and sold by Defendants L'Oreal USA, Inc. and Soft Sheen-Carson, Inc., (\"Defendants\"). (Docket No. 1-1). Plaintiff asserts claims for strict liability, negligence, breach of implied warranty, fraud and violations of the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (\"UTPCPL\") against Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Presently before the Court is a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants which is opposed by Plaintiff. (Docket Nos. 36; 40). The motion has been fully briefed and neither party requested oral argument, making it ripe for disposition. (Docket Nos. 36-41; 44-45). After careful consideration of the parties' arguments, and for the following reasons, Defendants' motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   II. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    A. Relevant Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is a 62-year old resident of Uniontown, Pennsylvania. (Docket No. 1-1 at 13). She has shoulder length hair which she described as \"coarse\" and 40 years of experience applying at-home hair relaxer products to straighten her hair. (Docket Nos. 38 at \u00b6 3; 41 at \u00b6 3; Docket No. 38-2 at 16-17). For the past decade, Plaintiff has relaxed her hair with Defendants' Dark and Lovely \u00ae relaxer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She estimated that she applies this type of product to the areas of regrowth in her hair every four weeks. (Docket No. 38-2 at 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 11, 2017, Plaintiff went to her local CVS pharmacy in order to purchase Dark and Lovely \u00ae relaxer but the store was out of this product. (Docket Nos. 38 at \u00b6 4; 41 at \u00b6 4). Rather than travel to a different store, she purchased Defendants' Regular Optimum Salon Haircare \u00ae Defy Breakage Salon No-Lye Relaxer (the \"Defy Breakage relaxer\"), explaining that she did so because her hair \"needed done.\" (Docket Nos. 38 at \u00b6 1; 41 at \u00b6 1). Plaintiff testified that she had not previously used the Defy Breakage relaxer. (Docket Nos. 38 at \u00b6 2; 41 at \u00b6 2). She conceded that when she purchased the Defy Breakage relaxer, she did not look at the exterior packaging other than to determine the strength of the product, which was listed on the box as \"regular.\" (Docket No. 38-2 at 38). Plaintiff admitted that she did not read any of the warnings on the exterior of the box or the list of ingredients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, she stated that she read the instructions contained within the box before using the Defy Breakage relaxer. (Docket Nos. 38 at \u00b6 15; 41 at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The front of the exterior packaging of the Defy Breakage relaxer contains a photograph of a female model with straight hair. (Docket No. 38-3). The product is advertised as a \"No-Lye Relaxer,\" \"with whipped oil moisturizer,\" and \"90% Less Breakage,\" for \"Stronger, Smoother,\n   Hair,\" on both the front and top of the package. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). These areas also include \"IMPORTANT - READ &amp; FOLLOW THE SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS,\" in smaller print. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The bottom of the packaging lists the product's chemical ingredients and describes the contents of the box. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The rear of the exterior packaging also provides that the Defy Breakage relaxer offers \"Exclusive Salon Haircare at Home,\" and \"90% LESS BREAKAGE,\" \"[w]ith patented Strengthening Ceramide, and Coconut Oil, Defy Breakage Relaxer Kit helps replenish moisture for smooth, healthy-looking hair. Supreme conditioning infused at every step, before, during and after relaxing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This portion also lists the seven items contained within the box, numbering them one through seven. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The side of the exterior packaging contains the following warnings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   IMPORTANT - READ BEFORE PURCHASING\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   - This product may not be suitable for all hair types; a strand test must be performed prior to application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   - Use the strength of relaxer suited to your hair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   - Do not use on bleached hair, highlighted hair, hair treated with henna or metallic salts, or hair processed with a thio/perm product such as thioglycolate, thiolactate, cysteine, cysteamine, sulfite.

(Docket No. 38-4). Under the \"SAFETY WARNINGS\" section, the instructions reiterate that \"[t]his product may not be suitable for all hair types; a strand test must be performed prior to application\" and contain two separate lists, the relevant portions of which follow:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   When you should NOT relax your hair:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 Not suitable for use in children\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 If you have a sensitive, irritated or damaged scalp\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 If hair has been bleached or highlighted, processed with a thio (perm) product.... or treated with henna or metallic salts.

Failure to follow directions and warnings, or other misuse of the product can cause serious injury to eyes or skin and can damage hair or result in permanent hair loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 Use the strength of Optimum Care relaxer suited to your hair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 If hair has been relaxed previously, apply product to new growth only. Application of product to previously relaxed hair can cause hair breakage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   FOLLOW ALL DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A separate section titled \"PREPARATION OF THE HAIR,\" provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Following the application directions, test the mixture on one hair strand before relaxing all the hair. In case of hair breakage or scalp irritation after the test, do not use this product or any other relaxer. Because timing and precision application is imperative to avoid hair loss, hair breakage and/or scalp injury, it is recommended that you do not apply the relaxer yourself. Ask another person to assist you. Always do a strand test before relaxing, even if you have relaxed before. The Strand Test determines how long to straighten the hair. Prior to application, it is recommended that you apply petroleum jelly on hairline, nape of neck and ear area only.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Once the relaxer is applied to the strand, the instructions direct users to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   check texture and straightness of your hair frequently while waiting. If they are satisfactory before recommended processing time is up, end the test. Record time in Time Chart above and use as your processing time. Otherwise, use the time recommended in Time Chart. Never exceed the maximum processing time indicated in the Timing Chart.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The instructions also provide that \"[i]n case of hair breakage or scalp irritation after the test, do not use this product or any other relaxer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Under the \"APPLICATION\" section, there is a Timing Chart which has three columns for hair type, recommended strength, and processing time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). For \"normal\" hair, the recommended strength is the \"Regular\" relaxer and the processing time is 15-18 minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). For \"coarse\" hair, the recommended strength is the \"Super\" relaxer (a different product) and the processing time is 18-20 minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, the instructions list a step-by-step process for using the relaxer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Relevant here, the second step \"Apply the Relaxer Mixture\" instructs users to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Set a clock or a timer. Apply relaxer mixture to dry hair per the directions below without touching scalp. If the hair has already been relaxed, apply to new growth only. Follow the processing times. The application time should be counted in the total processing time. NEVER LEAVE THE RELAXER\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   MIXTURE ON HAIR LONGER THAN THE MAXIMUM PROCESSING TIME INDICATED IN THE STRAND TEST. NEVER EXCEED THE MAXIMUM PROCESSING TIME INDICATED IN THE TIME CHART.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff did not apply the Defy Breakage relaxer to her hair immediately after purchasing the product. Two days later, on March 13, 2017, Plaintiff used a heated curling iron on her hair in preparation of the application. (Docket No. 38-2 at 37). She applied the relaxer the next day, March 14, 2017. (Docket No. 38-5). Plaintiff did not ask anyone to assist her and applied the relaxer herself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff admitted that she did not perform a strand test prior to applying the relaxer. (Docket No. 38-2 at 42). She testified that she had never performed a strand test when applying a relaxer product to her hair in the past. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff stated that she left the relaxer in her hair for 20 minutes and that the time included her preparation time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43). She explained that her hair was \"coarse\" and used the time provided in the instructions for that hair type. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). When Plaintiff rinsed off the relaxer, some of her hair fell out and went down the drain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48). Plaintiff kept the box for the Defy Breakage relaxer but did not retain any of its contents. (Docket No. 38-5 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Two weeks after sustaining this injury, on March 28, 2017, Plaintiff sought treatment from Dr. Dayna Hrovath of Mountain State Dermatology and was diagnosed with traumatic alopecia of the scalp and prescribed medications to treat her condition. (Docket No. 1-1). In a letter prepared on that date, Dr. Hrovath states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Kim Chandler [...] presented to our office today with hair loss to her superior scalp. She states that a week ago she was using \"Optimum Care Hair Relaxer\" according to directions and when she rinsed, her hair fell out. She denies burning or rash.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Upon examination there was a large area on her superior scalp of widespread hair loss. No erythema, burns or rash present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Diagnosis is traumatic alopecia to scalp. We are treating her to encourage hair regrowth, but this is not guaranteed to help.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   (Docket No. 1-1 at 13). Since this initial visit, Plaintiff has experienced some regrowth of her hair, although it has not returned to its original state prior to using Defendants' product. (Docket No. 38-2 at 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiff filed this case on August 4, 2017 in the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County and Defendants removed the action to this Court on August 30, 2017. (Docket No. 1). Defendants filed their Answer on September 6, 2017. (Docket No. 5). The parties' efforts at resolving the matter through Court-ordered mediation were unsuccessful and the case continued through discovery, which ended on March 9, 2018. (Docket Nos. 15; 34). In the interim, the Court denied motions filed by Plaintiff to remand the matter to Fayette County and to compel discovery, the latter of which was resolved after the parties completed a meet and confer at the Court's direction. (Docket Nos. 22; 32; 34). The Court likewise denied Defendants' partial motion for summary judgment as it was filed prematurely while discovery was ongoing and prior to the Court establishing a briefing schedule. (Docket No. 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   After discovery concluded and the Court entered a briefing schedule, Defendants submitted the pending motion for summary judgment, supporting brief, concise statement of material facts and appendix\n   on April 9, 2018. (Docket Nos. 36-38). Plaintiff responded on May 4, 2018 by filing her response, concise statement of material facts and opposing brief. (Docket Nos. 39-41). Plaintiff did not present any additional evidence in opposition to the motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants replied on June 4, 2018. (Docket No. 44). Plaintiff then filed her sur-reply on June 7, 2018. (Docket No. 42). Neither party requested that the Court hold oral argument. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 35). Accordingly, as the motion is now fully briefed, it is ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   III. LEGAL STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Summary Judgment is appropriate when the moving party establishes \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff counters that she has met her burden to show genuine disputes of material fact as to each of her causes of action such that she should be allowed to present her case to a jury at trial. (Docket Nos. 40; 45). After careful consideration of the parties' positions and the evidence of record, the Court finds that there are no genuine disputes of material fact and that Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on each of Plaintiff's causes of action. The Court initially explains its rationale for granting summary judgment as to Plaintiff's strict liability, negligent failure to warn, and breach of implied warranty claims and then discusses the insufficiency of the evidence as to her fraud and UTPCPL claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    A.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 38-3; 38-4). Further, the purposes of the test are to ensure that the product reacts properly to the user's hair and to determine how long the product should be left in the hair after an application.

The directions further warn that \"you should NOT relax your hair\" \"if the strand test results in hair breakage or scalp irritation\" and reiterate that \"this product may not be suitable for all hair types: a strand test must be performed prior to application\" as one of the important things \"you should know before relaxing your hair.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A separate section titled \"Preparation of the Hair\" provides additional admonitions as to the need for users to conduct a strand test and directions as to how to do so:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Following the application directions, test the mixture on one hair strand before relaxing all the hair. In case of hair breakage or scalp irritation after the test, do not use this product or any other relaxer. Because timing and precision application is imperative to avoid hair loss, hair breakage and/or scalp injury, it is recommended that you do not apply the relaxer yourself. Ask another person to assist you. Always do a strand test before relaxing, even if you have relaxed before. The Strand Test determines how long to straighten the hair. Prior to application, it is recommended that you apply petroleum jelly on hairline, nape of neck and ear area only.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [...] check texture and straightness of your hair frequently while waiting.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 39-41; 45). She also did not testify that she misunderstood any of them. (Docket No. 38-2). Instead, she explained that she did not conduct a strand test because she had never done so when applying different hair relaxer products to her hair in the past. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42). She described that she left the product in her hair for 20 minutes because she has \"coarse\" hair and the table on the instruction sheet indicated that Defendants' \"super\" relaxer should be applied for a maximum of 18-20 minutes to that hair type. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-3). In addition, despite claiming the provided warnings were insufficient, Plaintiff has not presented any evidence of an alternative warning which would have protected her from the harm she sustained.
