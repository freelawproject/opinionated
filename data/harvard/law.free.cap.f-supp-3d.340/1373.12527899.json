This litigation currently consists of 48 actions pending in five districts, as listed on Schedule A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   All responding defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   oppose centralization based on arguments that the 47\n   infringement suits, which are brought against Amazon cloud computing customers, should be stayed pending the outcome of Amazon's Northern District of California declaratory judgment action. Most responding defendants alternatively prefer centralization in the Northern District of California. Northern District of California defendant Heroku, Inc. suggests that the Panel defer its decision on centralization until Amazon's declaratory judgment action is resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On the basis of the papers filed and hearing session held, we find that these 48 actions involve common questions of fact, and that centralization in the Northern District of California will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of the litigation. The actions contain similar allegations regarding the infringement, validity and enforceability of five now-expired PersonalWeb patents\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that, broadly, concern cloud computing concepts that ensure that internet browsers do not use outdated and no longer authorized content when rendering the defendants' business webpages for viewing. Defendants in 47 actions are a variety of disparate companies that do business on the internet. Amazon later filed suit against the patentholders, seeking an injunction against further litigation against its customers-most of which reportedly use Amazon's S3 service (S3 stands for Simple Storage Service)-and declarations that PersonalWeb's claims against its customers are barred and that, if not barred, Amazon's technology does not infringe the asserted patents. As the litigation stands now, the actions are pending in five different districts. Centralization will create significant judicial efficiencies by allowing a single judge to preside over all pretrial proceedings, including\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   requests to stay the customer suits, claim construction hearings (if necessary) and determination of the preclusive effect of a prior action between Amazon and PersonalWeb in\n   <em>\n    PersonalWeb Techs. LLC v. Amazon.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:11-cv-00658 (E.D. Tex.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Amazon and the customer defendants argue that it is preferable for the customer suits to be stayed pending resolution of Amazon's declaratory judgment action, pursuant to the customer suit exception to the first-to-file rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other circumstances, stays pursuant to the customer suit exception may be an appropriate alternative to centralization, but we are not persuaded that centralization should be denied on that basis here. In the cases before us, no judge with a pending action has granted a stay pursuant to the customer suit exception, and we express no opinion on the appropriateness of such stays here. Recent developments such as PersonalWeb's amendments to several customer action complaints, combined with some customers' alleged use of Amazon cloud services other than S3, add further doubt as to whether Amazon and its customers' motions to stay can be promptly resolved and, thus, stand as an adequate alternative to centralization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Northern District of California is the most appropriate transferee district for pretrial proceedings in this litigation. The majority of the cases are pending in\n   this district, and numerous defendants are based there. We are confident that Judge Beth Labson Freeman, who already presides over the Amazon declaratory judgment action, will steer this litigation on a prudent course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the actions listed on Schedule A and pending outside the Northern District of California are transferred to the Northern District of California and, with the consent of that court, assigned to the Honorable Beth Labson Freeman for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    SCHEDULE A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MDL No. 2834 -\n   <strong>\n    IN RE: PERSONALWEB TECHNOLOGIES, LLC, AND LEVEL 3 COMMUNICATIONS, LLC, PATENT LITIGATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Northern District of California\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   PERSONALWEB TECHNOLOGIES, LLC, ET AL. v.
