INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this insurance coverage dispute, Plaintiffs, The Charter Oak Fire Insurance Company and St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (\"the Insurer\"), argue that an \"aircraft exclusion\" contained in the two policies issued to Defendants, Interface Performance Materials,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   , (\"Interface\") relieves them of their duty to provide coverage to Defendants in a separate lawsuit involving a tragic plane crash and an allegedly defective aircraft part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The underlying lawsuit stems from a plane crash that occurred on August 18, 2013, in Kansas City, Missouri which resulted in the death of Mr. and Mrs. Lallo. (Complaint, \u00b6 18-20.) Interface is a party to the underlying litigation because an aircraft part known as a \"gasket\" was discovered in the rubble of the crash with the word \"Interface\" stamped on it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Facts, \u00b6 32.) The underlying complaint specifically alleges that Interface \"designed, manufactured, tested, inspected, trained, advertised, marketed, warranted, distributed, licensed, sold, supplied, overhauled and/or rebuilt gaskets and gasket materials used to interface between the magneto and engine accessory case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 26.) When Interface requested coverage for the underlying lawsuit from the Insurer, the Insurer denied coverage and based that denial on an aircraft exclusion contained in the\n   insurance agreements. (Docket No. 34, Exh. 10 and 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Interface and the Insurer have two insurance agreements and both are in dispute here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 32-40.). The first agreement is a typical comprehensive commercial insurance policy, and the second is an umbrella policy that provides excess coverage for occurrences surpassing the commercial policy's retained limit. The pertinent parts of the commercial policy read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. Insuring Agreement\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   a.

We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \"suit\" seeking damages for \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any \"occurrence\" and settle any claim or \"suit\" that may result....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   21. \"Your Product\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a.

B.) In its motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Insurer argues that this aircraft exclusion unambiguously relieves it of its duty to provide coverage to Interface because Interface's alleged liability in the underlying lawsuit is based solely on its involvement with an aircraft part. (Docket Nos. 33, 39.) In its motion for partial summary judgment, Interface argues that the underlying lawsuit contains coverage-triggering allegations, and the lawsuit is meritless, requiring the Insurer to provide coverage. Alternatively, Interface argues that the Insurer has failed to meet its burden of proving that the aircraft exclusion applies. (Docket Nos. 34, 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Interface moves for partial summary judgment under FRCP 56. Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Fed R. Civ. Proc. 56(a). \"A motion for summary judgment will not be defeated by the 'mere existence' of some disputed facts, but will be denied when there is a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

This gasket is an aircraft part.

B.) This subsection unambiguously precludes coverage for any product that Interface manufactures, sells, handles, distributes or disposes of that is \"manufactured for, used in connection with, or incorporated into aircraft, aircraft parts, aircraft equipment or aircraft accessories....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Unlike subsection (2) of the exclusion in\n   <em>\n    Southwire\n   </em>\n   which the court found did not preclude coverage for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of\n   an aircraft's component parts,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *15-16, here, the exclusion plainly prohibits coverage for any product used in connection with\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   aircraft parts. Likewise, unlike subsection (3) in\n   <em>\n    Southwire\n   </em>\n   which the court held did not preclude coverage because the subsection referred to Southwire's \"particular\" product rather than all of Southwire's products,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *17, here, the exclusion is broad and precludes coverage for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Interface's products that are \"manufactured for, used in connection with, or incorporated into ... aircraft parts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Therefore, I find that any of Interface's products that are involved with an aircraft or aircraft part are excluded from coverage, and the allegations in the underlying complaint allege just that--that Interface was involved with the production of a defective aircraft part. Accordingly, when examining the four corners of the underlying complaint and the insurance policy, I find that the Aircraft Products and Grounding exclusion unambiguously relieves the Insurer from its duty to provide coverage to Interface for the underlying lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Interface attempts to circumvent the aircraft exclusion by relying on two cases,\n   <em>\n    General Plasma, Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    IDS Property Cas. Ins. Co. v. Schonewolf.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    General Plasma\n   </em>\n   , the court analyzed a very similar insurance exclusion to the one at issue here, however, the underlying allegations to which the court applied the exclusion addressed the insured's alleged negligent\n   <em>\n    servicing\n   </em>\n   of an aircraft engine.\n   <em>\n    General Plasma, Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%2072811\">\n    2000 WL 72811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 11, 2000 Conn. Super. Ct.), abrogated on other grounds by\n   <em>\n    ACMAT Corp. v. Greater New York Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3951570\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/576/\">\n    282 Conn. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=923%20A.2d%20697\">\n    923 A.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). Thus, because the underlying complaint here alleges Interface was involved with the\n   <em>\n    production\n   </em>\n   of an aircraft part, not the servicing of an aircraft, the application of the aircraft exclusion in\n   <em>\n    General Plasma\n   </em>\n   is unpersuasive to the instant analysis, and Interface's reliance on it is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Schonewolf\n   </em>\n   , an insurance coverage dispute arose over whether \"an alcohol-fueled violent encounter\" was covered under a policy.\n   <em>\n    IDS Property Cas. Ins. Co. v. Schonewolf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365054\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/111/618/#p621\">\n    111 F.Supp.3d 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621 (E.D. Pa. 2015). The underlying lawsuit alleged that the plaintiff was \"continuously and violently beaten and kicked about his head and body by ... [two defendants].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365054\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/111/618/#p621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). The insurance companies for each defendant sought to be relieved from providing coverage under \"substantively identical\" insurance agreements which provided coverage for unintentional accidents but excluded coverage for intentional actions that caused bodily injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365054\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/111/618/#p621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365054\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/111/618/#p621\">\n    at 622, 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff in the underlying complaint \"carefully couched his complaint in language that avoids labeling [defendants'] actions as intentional\" and \"the complaint [was] admittedly vague,\" thus, the court was \"unable to rule out the possibility that the conduct may not have been intentional given [the] intoxication,\" and therefore held that the insurance companies had a duty to defend unless it was later shown that defendants' actions were intentional.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365054\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/111/618/#p621\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365054\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/111/618/#p621\">\n    at 624-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Interface relies on\n   <em>\n    Schonewolf\n   </em>\n   to argue that coverage-triggering allegations exist in the underlying complaint. Contrary to Interface's argument, there are simply no allegations against Interface, other than those regarding Interface's involvement with the defective aircraft part, that could possibly trigger coverage. Therefore, the aircraft exclusion must apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Interface makes two additional arguments in support of its position that the Insurer has a duty to provide coverage. First, Interface argues that the underlying\n   allegations against it are meritless and false; thus, the Insurer must provide coverage. Second, Interface argues that the underlying complaint alleges wrongdoing of other defendants, in addition to wrongdoing on the part of Interface, which makes the complaint false and contradictory towards Interface and thereby triggers the Insurer's duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Whether the allegations contained in the underlying complaint are meritless or false has no bearing on the aircraft exclusion. Likewise, if other defendants are actually at fault and Interface is not, that fact also has no bearing on the applicability of the aircraft exclusion. As already stated, Interface is involved in the underlying lawsuit because of their alleged involvement with the aircraft part in question. There are simply no other allegations against Interface that could potentially trigger the Insurer's duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A recent Third Circuit decision addressed arguments analogous to Interface's arguments here,\n   <em>\n    Lenick Constr., Inc. v. Selective Way Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20Fed.%20Appx.%2092\">\n    737 Fed. Appx. 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2018). In\n   <em>\n    Lenick\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's holding that the insurer was precluded from providing coverage to their insured in a lawsuit alleging that the insured, amongst others, conducted faulty carpentry workmanship resulting in housing units suffering leaks and drywall issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20Fed.%20Appx.%2092\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20Fed.%20Appx.%2092\">\n    at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In district court, the insured argued that since the underlying complaint alleged that other defendants had also performed faulty workmanship, meaning that the insured could possibly be found not at fault, the Insurer had to provide coverage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20Fed.%20Appx.%2092\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 95 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lenick Constr. Co. v. Selective Way Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201161571\">\n    2016 WL 1161571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 23, 2016) ). The Third Circuit agreed with the district court's rejection of this argument because \"[the insured's]\n   <em>\n    own faulty workmanship\n   </em>\n   is the only legal theory under which [the insured], as opposed to other contractors or subcontractors, could be found liable\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201161571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). In other words, it did not matter whether other defendants may be found liable because the only way the insured could be found liable is from their own faulty workmanship, which the insurance policy excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   After liberally construing the factual allegations of the underlying complaint and taking them as true, the underlying complaint does not have any actual or potential coverage-triggering facts or allegations. No matter whether Interface is truly liable for the defective part or not, the aircraft exclusion applies and the Insurer has no duty to defend Interface in the underlying litigation. Accordingly, I find that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the applicability of the aircraft exclusion in this matter, and judgment will be granted in favor of Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For all of the aforementioned reasons, the Insurer is relieved from its duty to provide coverage to Interface for the underlying complaint. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted, and Defendants' motion for partial summary judgment is denied. An appropriate Order dismissing the case follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    It was later discovered that Interface sold raw materials to its customer \"Corley Gasket,\" who sold a gasket to \"Superior Air Parts,\" who then sold a gasket to \"Quality Aircraft Accessories,\" who ultimately provided the gasket for the aircraft in question.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Additional allegations are brought against Interface. However, all allegations are similar in that they allege that Interface was in the chain of production, manufacturing or distribution for the aircraft's gasket.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 21-31.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
