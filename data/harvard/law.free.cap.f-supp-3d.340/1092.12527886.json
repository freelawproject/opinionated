First, Plaintiff's motion seeks a declaratory judgment that it owns the copyright in the code to four computer programs. Second, Defendants' motion asks the Court to find that\n   Plaintiff, based on its conduct, granted an implied, unlimited, nonexclusive license to retain, use, and modify the software programs, which is a complete defense to Plaintiff's second cause of action for copyright infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment. The Court DENIES Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following are the undisputed and material facts taken from the parties' statements of undisputed facts and accompanying exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff and Defendants' Relationship\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff is a computer software and development company. (ECF No. 118-1, Pl.'s Sep. Statement of Undisputed Mat. Facts (\"Pl.'s SUMF\"), Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 2.) Plaintiff creates, develops, and maintains a variety of computer software, software applications, data management applications, and practice management applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   provide healthcare services directly to patients and through a network of providers who have been trained in Defendants' \"soft-tissue manipulation techniques.\" (ECF No. 121-1, Defs.' Sep. Statement of Undisputed Mat. Facts (\"Defs.' SUMF\"), Defs.' SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties' businesses overlapped as Plaintiff provided software development and other IT services to Defendants from 2002 to 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 5.) Defendants terminated the business relationship with Plaintiff in 2013-which is also when the parties' conflicting copyright ownership claims over the programs began. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 25.) The disputes revolve around four programs referred to by the parties as follows: the (1) Admin Program; (2) EPN Program; (3) EHR Service Application; and (4) PMS Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 6.) There are no written agreements between Plaintiff and Defendants regarding any of the programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although Defendants refer to the programs \"collectively,\" the factual assertions surrounding the Admin and EPN Programs are very different than those surrounding the EHR and PMS Programs. As such, the Court will discuss the Admin and EPN Programs together and the EHR and PMS Programs together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Programs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Admin Program and EPN Program\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the Admin Program and EPN Program were developed at Defendants' request to assist in managing its data. (ECF No. 121-1, Defs.' SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11.) Plaintiff provided both programs on a monthly basis for which it charged in arrears. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13.) Plaintiff adds that it only invoiced Active Release Techniques, LLC for use of the Admin Program whereas it only invoiced ART Corporate Solutions, Inc. for use of the EPN Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, AF\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties also do not dispute that the Admin Program and EPN Program\n   were hosted on servers owned by Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 20.) It is uncontested that, throughout the parties' business relationship, Defendants' employees and providers could access and use both programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 19.) But Plaintiff asserts that Defendants did not have access to the source code\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the Admin Program or EPN Program; did not have the ability to modify the programs; and the programs were never installed on a computer or server owned or controlled by Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, AF \u00b6 19.) Similarly, Plaintiff contends that only its employees had access to its servers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, AF \u00b6 20.) Plaintiff claims that it, and it alone, made the conscious decision to limit Defendants' electronic access to the programs and Defendants' physical access to its servers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants reply that Plaintiff provided the source code for the Admin Program and EPN Program in 2008 and again in 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, Reply to AF \u00b6 19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Defendants assert that the Plaintiff provided them the source code and placed no restrictions on their access to, or use of, the source code. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With regard to hosting the programs on Plaintiff's servers, Defendants state that it was a decision the parties mutually agreed upon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, Reply to AF \u00b6 20.) Then, Defendants note that Plaintiff helped transition the source code to a new vendor and did not \"put any limits on that[,]\" in 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although it is unclear from the parties' filings, it appears that the preceding factual contentions are limited to the state of affairs before May of 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In May 2013, Defendants terminated the business relationship with Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 25.) According to Defendants, it was at that time Plaintiff voluntarily turned over the source code and related files for the Admin Program and EPN Program for a second time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 26.) Defendants cite testimony from one of Plaintiff's principals to further claim that the source code was turned over without any restrictions on Defendants' access to, or use of, it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, Reply to AF \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to Plaintiff, Defendants requested the source code to the Admin Program and EPN Program to run the programs on Defendants' servers so that Plaintiff would not have access to Defendants' data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, AF \u00b6 26.) Plaintiff admits that it provided Defendants the source code to the Admin Program and EPN Program. (ECF No. 113-3, Resps. to RFA Nos. 9 ant 11 at 25-26.) But Plaintiff contends that after being \"harassed\" by third-party vendors, it \"finally acquiesced to [Defendants' demands] with the promise from [Plaintiff] that [Plaintiff],\n   within a few months, cease using the Admin Program and the EPN Program.\" (ECF No. 121-1, Defs.' SUMF, AF \u00b6 26.) And Plaintiff states that it did not give permission to modify or create derivative works with respect to the Admin Program and EPN Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Despite Defendants' promise, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants continue to use the programs to this day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, Defendants state that they paid Plaintiff approximately $2 million between 2002 and 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, \u00b6 23.) Plaintiff responds that Defendants only paid $1,747,531.09 over that time period, of which \"less than 30%\" was for use of the Admin Program and EPN Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, AF \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    2. The EHR Service Application and PMS Program\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   According to Plaintiff, it created and developed the EHR Service Application, without any input or assistance from Defendants, to be marketed to the healthcare industry for record management-it was not developed for or at the request of Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, AF \u00b6 6.) Plaintiff maintains that the PMS Program is merely a version of its EHR Service Application that has been branded for use by the Defendants' providers, not by Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff insists that the branded version was created for Defendants pursuant to the following verbal agreement: (a) an initial payment of $60,000 from Defendants; and (b) Plaintiff would give ART Business Solutions, LLC 50% of any sales proceeds from the branded version. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Defs.' SUMF, AF \u00b6 33.) Defendants, relying on allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint, contend that Plaintiff agreed to create and develop the PMS Program at Defendants' behest. (ECF No. 121-1, Defs.' SUMF, \u00b6 6 and Reply to AF \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After the PMS Program had been developed, the parties agree that Plaintiff did\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   voluntarily provide the source code and related files to Defendants. (ECF No. 121-1, Defs.' SUMF, \u00b6 28.) Plaintiff only provided the source code after being ordered to do so by a preliminary injunction that Defendants obtained in state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The parties further agree that the state court vacated its preliminary injunction after Plaintiff (as the defendant in the state court action) prevailed at trial on all thirty-two (32) causes of action asserted against it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Next, Defendants direct the Court's attention to a copyright notice contained in the PMS Program's source code and several invoices from Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18.) With regard to invoices sent by Plaintiff, Defendants point to the following statement at the bottom of the documents: \"All source code and Images created by [Plaintiff] and used by the client become the client's property when Invoice is paid in full.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, \u00b6 18.) Plaintiff counters that the copyright notice contained in the source code was intended to cover Defendants' logo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, AF \u00b6 17.) Plaintiff asserts that the invoices were not related to the programs at issue and that, in any event, various invoices were never paid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF, AF \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. This Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff's Complaint alleges two causes of action related to the programs. First, Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that it owns the copyright in the Admin Program, EPN Program, EHR Service Application, and PMS Program. (ECF No. 60, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 74, 103-114.) Second, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants are liable for copyright infringement as to each of the programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 115-126.) Plaintiff moves the Court for partial summary judgment and a declaration that it owns the copyright in the Admin Program, EPN Program,\n   EHR Service Application, and PMS Program. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 110.) Defendants concede Plaintiff's motion to the extent of the claims of copyright ownership. (ECF No. 116 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants seek summary judgment that Plaintiff granted an implied license to use the programs. (ECF No. 113.) An implied license serves as a complete defense to Plaintiff's copyright infringement claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, Defendants request a declaration from the Court that Plaintiff has granted an unlimited, nonexclusive license to retain, use, and modify each of the programs for its own purposes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Plaintiff responds that material issues of fact preclude summary judgment on the implied license issue. (ECF No. 117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 110.) Although Defendants initially sought copyright ownership rights in the Programs, it now confesses Plaintiff's claim of copyright ownership.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff says, \"not so fast.\" First, Defendants did not specifically pay for hosting the programs on Plaintiff's servers-plus, the hosting decision was made by Plaintiff so it could control Defendants' electronic access to the programs.

Moreover, the source code was turned over with Defendants' promise that it would only be used for \"a few months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court finds that Plaintiff created the software for Defendants and delivered the two programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, the objective facts are that Plaintiff gave access to use the programs and even transferred the source code for the Admin and EPN Program.\n   <em>\n    Gagnon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841060\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/748/#p756\">\n    542 F.3d at 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (\"Even if [software developer] and his employees maintained the software and had primary control over the code, they programmed on-site at [client's site and on client's] computers to which key\n   <strong>\n    [client] personnel had access\n   </strong>\n   -conduct that does not demonstrate an intent to retain sole control.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holtzbrinck Pub.

Defendants argue that the creation and delivery of the source code for the Admin Program and EPN Program, without any express restrictions or limitations of use, manifested an objective intent to grant Defendants an implied license to use the programs. (ECF No. 113 at 12.) Plaintiff sets forth three contentions to\n   support its argument that there are material factual issues regarding intent, and the scope of any license, that preclude summary judgment on Defendants' implied license defense. (ECF No. 117 at 10-13.) First, Defendants did not pay for perpetual use and access to the Admin Program and EPN Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) Second, Plaintiff retained the source code on its servers so it could limit Defendants' use of the programs in the event Defendants failed to pay the monthly access fee.

The Court finds these factors helpful in guiding the intent analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Here, in 2013, it is undisputed that the parties' business relationship was strained. Defendants demanded the Admin Program and EPN Program so that Plaintiff did not have access to its data. Then, Defendants ultimately terminated the business relationship. Against this backdrop, Plaintiff gave Defendants the\n   <em>\n    source code\n   </em>\n   to the Admin Program and EPN Program. The fact that Plaintiff voluntarily transferred the source code directly undermines its arguments that it sought to restrict or control access to the two programs. By voluntarily transferring the source code, Plaintiff relinquished its ability to control access to, use of, or modification of the programs. Plaintiff obviously knew this because, as discussed below, it refused to provide the source code to the EHR Service Application and PMS Program until a court ordered it to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Although Plaintiff argues that Defendants did not pay for perpetual use and access to the programs, Plaintiff admits that it has been paid \"less than 30%\" of $1,747,531.09 for Defendants' use of the Admin Program and EPN Program. Plaintiff fails to specify how much less than 30% was paid. But, if 25% was paid for use of the Admin Program and EPN Program, that amounts to $436,882, which is a substantial\n   sum. Moreover, there is no writing to suggest that the programs could only be used with Plaintiff's future involvement or express permission. Like the special effects creator in\n   <em>\n    Effects\n   </em>\n   and the software developer in\n   <em>\n    Gagnon\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff \"was well paid for [its] services. Under the circumstances, it defies logic that [Defendants] would have paid [Plaintiff] for [its] programming services if [Defendants] could not have used the programs without further payment pursuant to a separate licensing arrangement that was never mentioned[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Gagnon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841060\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/748/#p756\">\n    542 F.3d at 756-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   But the Court must stop short of granting summary judgment in favor of \"the Defendants.\" Because Defendants frequently refer to themselves collectively, the foregoing contains an assumption that the analysis applies equally to each defendant. In other words, the nature of the evidentiary presentation asks the Court to conclude each corporate entity requested each program, received delivery of that program, and that Plaintiff's conduct was directed at, and the same, with respect to each of the three separate legal entities. However, summary judgment must not be premised on assumptions-in this instance, the moving party must present competent evidence to establish a complete defense to the claims of copyright infringement. This Defendants, individually, have failed to do. Apart from identifying the specific legal entity that requested the Admin Program and EPN Program, all that has been presented is general evidence that the programs were \"provided to Defendants\" (ECF No. 121, Defs.' SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13), and that \"Defendants paid\" $2 million to Plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 23). Based on this record, the Court cannot decipher on summary judgment, and as a matter of law, to which (perhaps none, one, or more) of the three named defendants Plaintiff has granted the implied license. The named defendants are separate legal entities, despite Defendants' argument that they are commonly owned by the same individual. (ECF No. 121 at 8.) Accordingly, summary judgment must be denied on the present record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. The EHR Service Application and PMS Program\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiff developed the PMS Program at its request. (ECF No. 113 at 10.) Plaintiff responds that the PMS Program was not created at Defendants' request. (ECF No. 117 at 5-6.) According to Plaintiff, it developed the EHR Service Application entirely on its own and without any input or assistance from Defendants-with internal development costs of approximately $1.6 million, which was never invoiced to any customer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 118-1, Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 26-41.) Further, Plaintiff maintains that the PMS Program is merely a \"skinned\" or \"branded\" version of the EHR Service Application. (ECF No. 117 at 5.) Neither party disputes that branding or skinning a software product only costs a fraction of the total cost to develop the software. (ECF No. 118-1, Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The real issue is whether the branded PMS Program is sufficiently distinct from the EHR Service Application for it to be considered a separate program developed at Plaintiff's request. Defendants argue that they only seek a license to use the PMS Program, thus any discussion of the EHR Service Application is irrelevant. (ECF No. 121 at 2-3.) But Defendants' argument does not address the core dispute-Plaintiff essentially claims that the PMS Program\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   the EHR Service Application. And there is a material factual dispute as to this issue. Plaintiff presents evidence that it created the EHR application on its own initiative, at its own expense of $1.6 million, and then offered a\n   branded version to Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gagnon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841060\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/748/#p756\">\n    542 F.3d at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Gagnon did not create the programs on his own initiative and market them to AMS; rather, he created them in response to AMS's requests.\"). Therefore, a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether Defendants requested the PMS Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Delivery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Black's Law Dictionary defines delivery as \"[t]he formal act of voluntarily transferring something[.] Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). In this case, the parties agree that Plaintiff did not voluntarily provide Defendants with the source code or related files. (ECF No. 121-1, Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 28.) Plaintiff only provided the source code and related files after a state court entered a preliminary injunction, which is not a voluntary transfer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, this factor weighs against finding an implied license for Plaintiff to use the PMS Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Intent as Manifested by Plaintiff's Conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Apart from reiterating the points discussed above, the parties provide little additional argument as to the intent manifested by Plaintiff's conduct as it relates to the PMS Program. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 113 at 12; ECF No. 117 at 10; ECF No. 121 at 6-7.) Defendants raise three additional points in their reply brief: (1) in the PMS source code, Plaintiff included a copyright notice in favor of Defendants; (2) several invoices state that source code becomes the client's property upon payment of the invoice; and (3) Plaintiff refused to provide the source code and registered its copyright in the programs only after the parties ended their relationship. (ECF No. 121 at 6-7.) The Court is not persuaded by Defendants' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   First, Plaintiff stated in deposition testimony that the copyright notice was intended to cover Defendants' logo, not the source code. (ECF No. 121-1, Resp. to Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 17.) Plaintiff also points to the fact that the copyright notice was not included in the EHR Service Application, which the Court interprets to mean that Plaintiff was not giving away its EHR source code, but only trying to protect the \"branded\" portions that had been added to the source code for Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, the Court has reviewed the invoices that Defendants rely on. None of the invoices refer to the EHR Service Application or the PMS Program. (ECF No. 121-1, Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 18.) Nonetheless, Plaintiff claims that the invoices were never paid. (ECF No. 121-1, Resp. to Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, the after-the-fact registration of the copyright notice does not negate Plaintiff's objective conduct: it refused to provide Defendants the source code to the PMS Program and only provided the code after being ordered to do so by a court. The Court also notes the substantially different amounts paid for the Admin and EPN Program ($436,882) as opposed to the PMS Program ($60,000 plus 50% of any sales proceeds). When considering the evidence that Plaintiff developed the EHR Service Application on its own initiative, paid for its own development costs, refused to provide Defendants the source code, and received a fraction of the overall development cost from Defendants, it cannot be said, on summary judgment, that Plaintiff intended to grant Defendants a nonexclusive license to use the EHR Service Application or PMS Program. Therefore, Defendants' motion is denied as to the EHR Service Application and PMS Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Declaratory Judgment Request\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendants ask the Court to enter summary judgment on their counterclaim for\n   declaratory judgment that Defendants have \"an unlimited, nonexclusive license to retain, use, and modify the programs.\" (ECF No. 113 at 1-2; 12.) The quoted language in the preceding sentence represents the full extent of Defendants' legal analysis and authority. Since Defendants have not provided a fully developed analysis or legal authority to establish that it meets the elements of its counterclaim for declaratory judgment, the Court will not undertake this task for them.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Good v.

Accordingly, summary judgment is denied as to Defendants' request for declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (1) GRANTS Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment (ECF No. 110);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (2) DECLARES that Plaintiff Xtomic, LLC is the author of, and owns the copyright rights in, the Admin Program, EPN Program, EHR Service Application, and PMS Program;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   (3) DENIES Defendants' motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 113); and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (4) DENIES Defendants' request for entry of declaratory judgment on its counterclaim (ECF No. 113).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The three named defendants appear to provide different services and serve different functions related to the healthcare and business operations of Active Release Techniques.

Generally, when software is distributed, only the compiled object code is distributed and the programmer retains the source code. Regardless of whether the computer program is in object code or source code form, it is copyrightable and protectable.\n    <em>\n     Asset Mktg. Sys., Inc. v.

For example, Plaintiff provides \"Additional Relevant Fact No. 5\" in response to Defendants' Undisputed Material Fact No. 19. For consistency, clarity, and ease of reference, the Court cites to the number of the Defendants' Undisputed Material Fact in the far left column and uses that same number when referring to Plaintiff's additional facts (in the middle column) or Defendants' Reply to those additional facts (in the far right column).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    More specifically, the Admin Program was developed at the request of Active Release Techniques, LLC (ECF No. 113-3 at 17) whereas the EPN Program was developed at the request of ART Corporate Solutions, Inc.

Both declarations provide the following: \"All of the statements in the second column of Xtomic's Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Opposition to ART's Second Amended Motion for Summary Judgment are true.\" The Court rejects this aberrant practice of suffusing truth over all statements of fact contained in a pleading filed with this Court. More importantly, Plaintiff fails to identify who made this statement, to whom the statement was made, or when the statement was made. Thus, neither the content nor the substance of such a declaration is \"evidence\" that would be admissible at trial.\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.

Finally, Plaintiff cites to its interrogatory responses as support for this contention. (ECF No. 113-3 at 26-27.) But the interrogatory response states something very different; it states that \"\n    <em>\n     ART\n    </em>\n    further indicated that it only intended to use the Admin Program [and EPN Program] for a short period of time[.]\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) This also fails to support Plaintiff's factual dispute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
