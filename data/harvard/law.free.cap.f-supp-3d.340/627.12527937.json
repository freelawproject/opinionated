Van Tatenhove, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Federal judges often find themselves at the intersection of state law and federal law and faced with the dilemma of which direction to turn. Occasionally, an area of state law can circumvent the Founding Fathers' dictate that federal law reign supreme, but only in rare situations. After several hearings and many hundreds of pages of briefing, the Court finds that this situation does not arise here. Kentucky's prohibition of arbitration between insolvent insurance companies and third-party contractors does not trump the mandate of the Federal Arbitration Act that valid arbitration agreements must be upheld. For the following reasons, the Liquidator's motions to dismiss are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and the Plaintiffs' motions to compel arbitration are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Kentucky Health Cooperative (KYHC) sought approval from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to offer health plans to Kentucky citizens in 2011 and 2012. [R. 4-1 at 2.] During this time, KYHC contracted with Beam Partners, LLC, whereby Beam Partners would provide management and support services to KYHC. [R. 4-2.] Terry S. Shilling is the sole member of Beam Partners. [R. 1 at \u00b6 2.] Through this Management and Development Agreement (MDA), Beam Partners agreed to train and orient members of the KYHC board of directors, apply for and obtain licensure for KYHC through the Kentucky Department of Insurance, apply for KYHC's tax-exempt status, provide consulting services to KYHC regarding internal systems and processes, identify and screen candidates for KYHC's support services, and provide interim management assistance until KYHC installed permanent officers. [R. 4-1 at 3.] The MDA included a section where parties agreed to arbitrate claims and disputes arising under or relating to the MDA. [R. 4-2 at 10-11.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Similarly, KYHC contracted with Milliman, Inc., for Milliman to perform actuary and consulting services to KYHC [\n   <em>\n    Milliman, Inc., v. Roof\n   </em>\n   , 3:18-cv-00012-GFVT, R. 1-2], and CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc., agreed to perform administrative services for KYHC [\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00037-GFVT, R. 9-2]. Significantly, each of these agreements also contained arbitration clauses. [\n   <em>\n    Milliman, Inc., v. Roof\n   </em>\n   , 3:18-cv-00012-GFVT, R. 1-2 at \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    Milliman, Inc., v.

[R. 4-3 at 3.] Pursuant to KRS \u00a7 304.33-010,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , Franklin Circuit Court placed KYHC into liquidation on January 15, 2016, and appointed H. Brian Maynard, Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Insurance, as the Liquidator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Jeff Gaither and David Hurt were appointed as Special Deputy Liquidators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to the Liquidation Order,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Liquidator and the Special Deputy Liquidators are hereby authorized to deal with the property, business, and affairs of KYHC and KYHC's estate, and in any necessary forum, to sue or defend for KYHC, or for the benefit of KYHC's policyholders, creditors, or shareholders in the courts and tribunal, agencies or arbitration panels of this states and other states, or in any applicable federal court in the Liquidator's name as Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Insurance, in his capacity as Liquidator, or a Special deputy in his capacity as Special Deputy Liquidator, or in the name of KYHC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Since that time, Nancy G. Atkins has replaced H. Brian Maynard as Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Insurance, and thus also as the Liquidator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRS \u00a7 304.33-200. Donald Roof was also appointed as a Deputy Litigator for KYHC on August 14, 2017. [\n   <em>\n    Milliman, Inc., v. Roof\n   </em>\n   , 3:18-cv-00012-GFVT, R. 1 at 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 13, 2016, the Liquidator sued CGI in Franklin Circuit Court for breach of contract and tort claims. [\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00037-GFVT, R. 71-1 at 2.] The Liquidator refused to honor the arbitration clause, so CGI removed that claim to this Court and filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Those actions were consolidated. [\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00037-GFVT, R. 8.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   That fall, the Liquidator sued Beam Partners and Terry Shilling, along with Janie Miller,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Joseph E. Smith,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Officers and Board of Directors of KYHC, and CGI for similar breach of contract and tort claims. [R. 4-4.] The Liquidator again refused to arbitrate, and CGI removed that action to this Court on December 1, 2016. [\n   <em>\n    Jeff Gaither, Deputy Liquidator of Kentucky Health Cooperative, Inc. v. Beam Partners, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00094-GFVT, R. 1.] Beam Partners and Terry Shilling (collectively, \"Beam Partners\") then filed this present action, a Petition to Compel Arbitration, on January 6, 2017. [R. 1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Meanwhile, in\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI\n   </em>\n   , the Liquidator sought remand back to Franklin Circuit Court. KYHC is a Kentucky non-profit corporation with a principal place of business in Kentucky, while CGI is a business incorporated in Delaware with a principal place of business in Virginia. [\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00037-GFVT, R. 1 at 1.] The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, under a traditional analysis of diversity jurisdiction, this Court has requisite authority and subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). However, the Liquidator sought remand on the basis of reverse preemption. [\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00037-GFVT, R. 49 at 3-4.] On January 3, 2017, this Court determined that its federal diversity jurisdiction was not reverse preempted by application of\n   the Kentucky Insurers Rehabilitation and Liquidation Law (IRLL) through the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Liquidator's Motion to Remand was denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Similarly, the Liquidator sought remand in the contract and tort action,\n   <em>\n    Gaither v. Beam.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gaither\n   </em>\n   , however, there was not complete diversity, as both plaintiffs and several defendants were residents of Kentucky. [\n   <em>\n    Jeff Gaither, Deputy Liquidator of Kentucky Health Cooperative, Inc. v. Beam Partners, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00094-GFVT, R. 44 at 6.] On March 31, 2017, this Court declined to sever the claims against the nondiverse parties and remanded for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After these developments, this Court denied CGI's Motion to Compel Arbitration without prejudice and directed the parties to re-brief the issue based on the significantly altered procedural posture. [\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00037-GFVT, R. 63.] Instead, CGI appealed the Court's Order to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. [\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00037-GFVT, R. 67.] Pending a decision in that case, the Court stayed this action. [R. 14.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Early in 2018, the Sixth Circuit vacated this Court's Order denying CGI's Motion to Compel Arbitration and remanded for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n    724 F. App'x 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2018). The Court of Appeals reviewed only this Court's denial of the Motion to Compel Arbitration and did not review any decision involving abstention.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n    at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Circuit Court determined that denial of the Motion to Compel Arbitration was premature insofar as it was based on reverse preemption under Kentucky's IRLL.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n    at 390-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the case had been removed from state court and this Court had denied remand, the purposes served by the exclusive jurisdiction provision of the IRLL did not apply, and state interests could not trump federal interests in the disposition of the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, while removing the issue of IRLL reverse preemption from\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit did not resolve all issues, nor did the Sixth Circuit resolve the issue of reverse preemption in either this case or\n   <em>\n    Milliman v. Roof\n   </em>\n   . The Liquidator has filed a Supplemental Motion to Dismiss [R. 19] to revisit this issue, and the parties appeared before this Court for oral argument [R. 30].\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the initial Motion to Compel Arbitration, Beam Partners argued that the parties entered into a valid agreement to arbitrate and that this dispute fell within the scope of that agreement, therefore, the Federal Arbitration Act mandates arbitration. [R. 4-1 at 5.] The Liquidator disagreed, stating that the agreement was invalid under Kentucky law, and thus the Court could not compel arbitration. [R. 9-1 at 1-2.] Specifically, the Liquidator argued that Kentucky law reverse preempted federal diversity jurisdiction in this case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the alternative, the Liquidator requested this Court abstain from exercising jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20F.%20App%27x%20383\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Following the Sixth Circuit decision in\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI\n   </em>\n   , the Liquidator supplemented the original motion to dismiss, arguing that the prior exclusive jurisdiction doctrine precludes this Court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction and that Beam Partners' petition for arbitration was not ripe for review. [R. 19 at 5.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Liquidator first claims that the McCarran-Ferguson Act reverse preempts this Court's diversity jurisdiction. [R. 9-1 at 9-10.] Because the IRLL vests exclusive jurisdiction in the Franklin Circuit Court for matters relating to an insurance company's liquidation, the Liquidator argues that this Court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction. The Court has already rejected this argument in\n   <em>\n    H. Nancy G. Atkins, Liquidator of Kentucky Health Cooperative, Inc. v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00037-GFVT, and the teaching of the Sixth Circuit agrees: \"the district court's jurisdictional ruling, rejecting the Liquidator's argument that Kentucky's IRLL reverse-preempted the federal diversity jurisdiction statute, is consonant with Sixth Circuit law and the majority view among the circuits.\"\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 724 Fed. App'x 383, 388 (6th Cir. 2018). Nevertheless, the Court reiterates that ruling here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Parties agree that the \"fundamental tenets of diversity jurisdiction\" are present. As required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), there is complete diversity amongst the parties. Beam Partners, LLC is a business incorporated in Georgia, and its only member, Terry S. Shilling, is also a citizen of Georgia. [R. 1 at 1.] Brian Maynard is the court-appointed liquidator of KYHC, which is a non-profit corporation that has its principal place of business in Kentucky.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Therefore, under a traditional analysis of diversity jurisdiction, this Court has the requisite authority and subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nonetheless, the question presented is whether federal law has opened the door for state law to reverse preempt the diversity jurisdiction statute. The Liquidator seeks to expand the existing McCarran-Ferguson reverse preemption framework to prevent Beam Partners from seeking relief in federal court. [R. 9-1 at 11.] However, the Constitution prevents this Court from ruling so expansively.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Metro. Life Ins. Co. v.

Further, no language in the agreement and no evidence provided by the parties display an intent to exclude breach of contract claims from the arbitration requirement.

The purpose of this subtitle is the protection of the interests of insureds, creditors, and the public generally, with minimum interference with the normal prerogative of proprietors, through:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (a) Early detection of any potentially dangerous condition in an insurer, and prompt application of appropriate corrective measures, neither unduly harsh nor subject to the kind of publicity that would needlessly damage or destroy the insurer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (b) Improved methods for rehabilitating insurers, by enlisting the advice and management expertise of the insurance industry;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (c) Enhanced efficiency and economy of liquidation, through the consolidation of matters relating to the liquidation under the supervision of a single court so as to avoid divergent rulings by a multiplicity of judicial tribunals and through clarification and specification of the law, to minimize legal uncertainty and litigation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (d) Equitable apportionment of unavoidable loss;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (e) Lessening the problems of interstate rehabilitation and liquidation by facilitating cooperation between states in the liquidation process, and by extension of the scope of personal jurisdiction over debtors of the insurer outside this state;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (f) Regulation of the insurance business by the impact of the law relating to delinquency procedures and substantive rules on the entire insurance business; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (g) Provision for a comprehensive scheme for the supervision, rehabilitation, and liquidation of insurance companies and those subject to this subtitle as part of the regulation of the business of insurance, insurance industry, and insurers in this states.

The IRLL grants exclusive jurisdiction to Franklin Circuit Court \"to entertain, hear, or determine all matters in any way relating to any delinquency proceeding under this subtitle, including but not limited to all disputes involving purported assets of the insurer.\" KRS \u00a7 304.33-040(3)(a).

The Liquidator argues, therefore, that the breach of contract claim, which is subject to the arbitration agreement in the MDA, must be submitted to the Franklin Circuit Court as part of the ongoing delinquency proceedings, and this Court should not compel arbitration.

[R. 19 at 15.] While the subject of arbitration does not foreclose abstention under\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   , the parallel cases of\n   <em>\n    Preferred Care of Delaware\n   </em>\n   both turned on the same legal question: whether, under the alternative dispute resolution agreement, VanArsdale had to arbitrate his claims against Preferred Care.\n   <em>\n    Preferred Care\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12392978\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/676/388/#p393\">\n    676 F.

This finding, however, does not end the analysis. When actions are parallel, the Court must then balance eight separate factors to determine whether abstention would be appropriate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (1) whether the state court has assumed jurisdiction over any res or property; (2) whether the federal forum is less convenient to the parties; (3) avoidance of piecemeal litigation; ...

(6) the adequacy of the state court action to protect the federal plaintiff's rights ... (7) the relative progress of the state and federal proceedings ... and (8) the presence or absence of concurrent jurisdiction ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    Romine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11669459\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/337/#p339\">\n    160 F.3d at 340-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These factors are not a checklist, but rather considerations for the Court when using its discretion to abstain in a matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   First, this action does not involve res or property. The res involved in the liquidation proceedings in Franklin Circuit Court are not at issue in this case. Additionally, the federal forum is located less than a quarter of a mile from the state forum, providing no more or less convenience to the parties. Furthermore, the state court action would not adequately protect Beam Partners' rights, given that Kentucky precedent is dictated by\n   <em>\n    Ernst &amp; Young\n   </em>\n   , which allows for reverse preemption of the FAA and denial of Beam Partners' petition for arbitration. Thus, the first, second, and sixth factors squarely oppose abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Factors three, four, and seven relate to the parallel proceeding in state court. Here, there is no danger of piecemeal litigation. While similar, the contracts involved in\n   <em>\n    Gaither v. Beam\n   </em>\n   are all different, and all include different provisions and protections. Resolving the contract dispute between the Liquidator and Beam Partners does not impact the resolution of other disputes and brings no danger of disparate judgments. Again, arbitration in this matter does not affect the liquidation proceedings and the policy holders. Thus, because there is no danger of piecemeal\n   litigation, the third factor does not encourage abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   While Franklin Circuit Court first obtained jurisdiction, the primary focus of the litigation in the parallel proceeding has concerned the liability of Janie Miller and Joseph Smith, neither of which are a party to this matter in federal court. [R. 22 at 11.] This Court has spent the last two years hearing oral arguments and conducting briefing on this specific arbitration issue, while the parties indicate that the Franklin Circuit Court has not yet considered it. [R. 19 at 19-20; R. 22 at 11-12.] So, while factor four favors abstention, the time spent debating this issue in federal court far exceeds the time devoted to this issue in state court, and factor seven strongly weighs against abstention. Factors five and eight relate to the jurisdiction and choices of law in both forums. Both forums have concurrent jurisdiction, and both courts could rule on the enforceability of arbitration. The issues relating to contract law and the IRLL are matters of Kentucky law, while the questions involving the McCarran-Ferguson Act and the FAA are matters of federal law. The Franklin Circuit Court could certainly rule on this issue, but so can this Court. Such factors do not clearly support abstention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Without the \"clearest of justifications\" that abstention is proper, the Court has a duty to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by Congress.\n   <em>\n    RSM Richter, Inc. v.

Such a \"complex state regulatory system\" is not the issue at hand. This Court is well equipped to handle questions concerning the application of federal law, preemption, and reverse preemption. Further, as noted above, abstention merely denies Beam Partners' petition for arbitration without adequate review on the merits. Thus, the Court declines to abstain from this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    D\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Additionally, the Liquidator adds two arguments challenging this\n   Court's ability to hear this action. First, the Liquidator claims the prior exclusive jurisdiction doctrine bars jurisdiction here. [R. 19 at 6.] The doctrine of prior exclusive jurisdiction states, \"If two suits are in rem or quasi in rem, so that the court must have possession or some control over the property in order to grant the relief sought, the jurisdiction of one court must yield to that of the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Cartwright v. Garner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070092\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/752/#p761\">\n    751 F.3d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761 (6th Cir. 2014.) This Court must assess \"whether the doctrine of prior exclusive jurisdiction applies at the time of filing, and not any time thereafter.\"\n   <em>\n    Chevalier v. Estate of Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346283\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/789/#p803\">\n    803 F.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 803 (6th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    In rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction involves or determines \"the status of a thing, and therefore the rights of persons generally with respect to that thing.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). Conversely,\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction involves or determines \"the personal rights and obligations of the parties\" and is \"brought against a person rather than a property.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). \"A normal action brought by one person against another for breach of contract is a common example of an action\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   .\" R.H. Graveson, Conflict of Laws, 98 (7th ed. 1974).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   If the Liquidator is successful in its tort claims against Beam Partners, the Liquidator will likely be able to collect monetary damages from Beam Partners, thus increasing the amount of assets that can be distributed among its creditors. [R. 26 at 1-3.] However, the Liquidator has not provided sufficient case law to convince the Court that this results in an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action governed by the prior exclusive jurisdiction doctrine. The cases cited by the Liquidator involve creditors suing the insolvent company, whereas in the tort action here, the insolvent company is the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gillis v. Keystone Mut. Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1182480\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/172/826/\">\n    172 F.2d 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1949) ;\n   <em>\n    Blackhawk Heating &amp; Plumbing Co.

By the Liquidator's logic, all suits brought by an insolvent company would need to be heard by the court of liquidation simply because those suits could increase assets available for distribution during liquidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court is not convinced. This is a petition to compel arbitration for a tort claim involving a breach of contract. A favorable result in this matter does not affect the distribution of the liquidated assets held in Franklin Circuit Court. Nor does the Court need to have jurisdiction over the assets to resolve this matter. Thus, the Court finds that the doctrine of prior exclusive jurisdiction does not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Liquidator also claims that Beam Partners has not complied with Kentucky's requirements for pursuing arbitration, and this Court cannot grant or deny relief without Beam Partners fully complying with Kentucky's arbitration requirements. [R. 19.] Under the IRLL, no party may institute an action against the liquidator without approval of the court. KRS \u00a7 304.33-270(1). However, the Federal Arbitration Act does not require parties to comply with state requirements\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   seeking a petition from federal court for arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Requiring Beam Partners to comply with the IRLL before petitioning this Court assumes that the IRLL reverse preempts the Federal Arbitration Act. As explained below, it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    E\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Finally, having determined that the Liquidator's claims are subject to arbitration, this matter must be stayed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the Court will stay the pending state court proceedings against Beam Partners. Pursuant to the Anti-Injunction Act, \"[a] court of the United\n   States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202283\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).
