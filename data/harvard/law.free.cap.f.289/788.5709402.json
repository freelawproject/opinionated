The patentee came into a very crowded art, yet one with which he had gained familiarity by receiving earlier patents, Nos. 821,488, 894,633, and 1,028,718. His prior inventions assist in assigning the patent at bar to its proper place in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">The numerous jar or bottle closures, fastening after more or less rotation and in evidence here, fall into three classes, as pointed out by appellant: First, the screw cap typified by the well-known Mason cover (726,321), and exhibiting correlative threads (continuous or multiple) on cap and jar; second, the lug cap, exhibiting lugs or projections on inner side of cap flange, passing between and/or underneath separated ribs on jar; third, caps having lugs adapted to function with jars threaded substantially as in the first class.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">It is asserted and admitted that plaintiff\u2019s device belongs to the second class; the defense is that the alleged infringing article belongs to the first. The third may be disregarded in this litigation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>admitted patentability of plaintiff\u2019s device does not rest (as seems t\u00f3 be thought) on the knurling or corrugation of the upper portion of cap flange, nor on the \u201cstrengthened\u201d lower edge thereof, nor on the junction of these old attributes;' it rests solely on the peculiarity of the lug shape, which as seen on the cylindrical flange of the cap has the section of a spherical triangle and is in its depression from the exterior flange surface, deep at the base and shallow at the apex.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">The well known and quite- obvious advantages of the first class of closures are simplicity and security. The cap merely \u201cscrews ,on,\u201d with as many revolutions as the length of flange, height of jar top, and pitch of thread permit; but, once fast, these caps are often difficult .of removal. The advantages of the second class are that the cap can be seated by slipping it on the jar top, the lugs being directed clear of the separate jar top ribs, and then the cap is set or fastened by a partial revolution thereof. Such caps require almost no \u201cscrewing up.\u201d The disadvantages are that short lugs or small projections give little bearing surface, and the caps lack security and perhaps strength.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">' Plaintiff\u2019s cap, with triangular lugs deep at the base and shallow at the apex can with some nicety be seated without rotation, by accurately placing the shallow apices of the lugs over the lowest parts of the jar top ribs; and complete engagement is then produced by less than a quarter turn (we refer, of course, to the exhibits in evidence), ' But most users will merely turn and press the cap until it \u201ccatches.\u201d This means that plaintiff has a true lug, but so large and so peculiarly shaped that, when furnished with appropriate jar ribs, it seems to screw up with much less than one revolution of the cap, and when\"\u2018driven, \u201chome\u201d has a bearing surface quite sufficient for security. This is plainly patentable invention. \u25a0 \u25a0 ' \u25a0 !</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The cap alleged to infringe can be tnade to respond in technical term,s to the description of a cap of the first class. It has multiple cap threads, extending substantially from top to bottom of inner flange surface, and corresponding multiple ribs on the jar; further; it is quite true, that any continuous thread cut or pressed in an article like a cap will exhibit a .shallowing at its plane of intersection\u2014i. e., the lower edge of flange. It -is also true that defendant\u2019s cap does \u201cscrew on\u201d; ,i. e., it requires the familiar wrist motion of the Mason jar. But we are convinced that this resemblance is deceptive in result; whether intentionally deceptive we need not ascertain. The flange thread is peculiar, in that it is so additionally depressed in its middle that the entire \u201cthread\u201d looks' like and is two triangular lugs with-.bases joining. Put in another way, it is true that defendant\u2019s \u201cthread\u201d may by bisection produce two of plaintiff\u2019s lugs whereof the lower one does all the useful work.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">This means that, when defendant\u2019s cap is affixed, it screws on truly enough, to all appearance; but it never does anything more than drive home so. much of its \u201cthread\u201d as perfectly represents one of plaintiff\u2019s lugs. The upper half of . defendant\u2019s thread might just as well be abolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">We thus agree with the lower court,, and affirm .the decree, appealed from, with costs, ' .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
