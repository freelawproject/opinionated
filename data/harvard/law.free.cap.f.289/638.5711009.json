Rudolph, Commissioner of the District of Columbia, - App. D. C. -, 287 Fed. 989 decided March 5, 1923, in which similar action by the trial court was sustained upon the ground that a plain and adequate remedy at law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>existed. In that case it was sought to restrain the commissioners from enforcing a police regulation prohibiting drivers of public vehicles for hire from stopping or loitering upon a street except at hack stands or taking on or discharging passengers. There no prosecution had been commenced, while the declared purpose of this proceeding is to stay the hand of the official until the prosecution is terminated. This difference, under the facts disclosed, is immaterial, since no ground for equitable relief is made to appear. Davis &amp; Farnum Mfg. Co. v. Los Angeles, 189 U. S. 207, 218, 23 Sup. Ct. 498, 47 L. Ed. 778; Dobbins v. Los Angeles, 195 U. S. 223, 241, 25 Sup. Ct. 18, 49 L. Ed. 169. Moreover, the statement is made by the district attorney in his brief that the prosecution to which appellant alludes in his bill \u201cterminated on June 14, 1922, by appellant agreeing to forfeit $5, which he did.\u201d Appellant\u2019s remedy was through the prosecution of a writ of error to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">,The decree is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
