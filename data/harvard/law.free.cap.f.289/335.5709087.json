Rodgers.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The case was tried before the court and a jury, and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff. In the course of the trial, the plaintiff offered in evidence the plaintiff\u2019s original verified complaint and defendant\u2019s original verified answer, for the purpose of showing the defendant\u2019s admissions in her original verified answer, and particularly her admission that she was the owner of the automobile in question; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Fred Davis was in possession of the automobile as her servant at the time of the accident, and was driving and operating the same under her direction and control in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Defendant objected to the admission of \u2022 these pleadings on the ground that the admissions referred to were judicial admissions, which were never admissible in evidence as such. The objection was overruled, and the pleadings admitted in evidence. Whether the court was in, error in this ruling is the only question submitted to us on this writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">It is stated by the plaintiff in error that he has discovered no decision in the courts of Nevada upon this question. But he claims that the rule has been established by the Supreme Court of California upon this subject, and he contends that, as Nevada has adopted the practice act of California, it must be presumed to have been adopted as interpreted by the highest court of the state. He accordingly cites the case of Mecham v. McKay, 37 Cal. 154, 165, as declaring a rule applicable here. In this case the Supreme Court held, with respect to the pleadings in the case, that the original/ answer having been superseded by an amended answer, the original answer was not admissible in evidence as an admission by the defendant to overthrow the amended pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">This is undoubtedly correct as a rule of practice in determining the questions at issue as developed and fixed by the pleadings. But has such a rule any bearing as qualifying the long and well established law of evidence, providing for the admission of such evidence as evidence (Jones on. Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 272, 274)? It is true the court does not make the distinction very clear in that case, for it holds that the trial court was in error in admitting in evidenc\u00e9, against the objection of the defendants, the original answers filed by them in the action, and which had been superseded by the amended answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">But for what purpose were the original pleadings offered in evidence? It would seem for the purpose of showing what the issues were under the pleadings, and not as evidence upon such issues, for the court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">\u201cWhilst it is true that pleadings in a cause containing admissions of facts dispense with the necessity of proving the facts admitted, the rule applies only to the subsisting pleadings on which the cause is tried, and not to defunct pleadings, for which other and amended pleadings have been substituted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The court says further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">\u201cThe pleading on which a party goes to trial is the one on which he places his defense or cause of action, and he is bound by its admissions. But in many cases it would operate as a gross injustice to hold him to be bound by the admissions of a former pleading, made, perhaps, under a mistake of the facts, and which has become functus officio by the substitution of an amended pleading.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">But whatever may have been the scope of the rule as applied in that case, in the case of Johnson v. Powers, 65 Cal. 179, 180, 3 Pac. 625, 626, the Supreme Court refers to the rule as stated in Mecham v. McKay, supra, with respect to the question of pleading, and makes the distinction with respect to evidence. The court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u201cBut in the case now before us the plaintiff was -called as a witness on his own behalf, and on cross-examination his attention was called to portions of the original complaint claimed to be inconsistent with his statements as a witness. There is no suggestion that he was not given full opportunity to explain the inconsistencies. The portions of the original complaint were not offered as evidence of any fact, other than the fact that the plaintiff made the statements contained in them, and such statements, so far as they were contradictory of or inconsistent with his statements as a witness, were as much admissible, for the purpose of impeaching him, as if they were contained in a letter written by him to a third person, or in an affidavit filed in a distinct proceeding. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2052.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In the Estate of O\u2019Connor, 118 Cal. 69, 71, 50 Pac. 4, 5, the same court stated that the rule with respect to evidence is that a\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">\u201cpleading being superseded by another furnished no valid ground for rejecting the admissions therein contained when offered for impeachment purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Referring to the answer in that case, the court Said':</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">\u201cThe statements of fact therein made by the party stood exactly as though found in any other written document made by him, and were entitled to be used against him for impeachment purposes, if they were such as to serve that purpose,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u2014citing the case of Johnson v. Powers, 65 Cal. 179, 3 Pac. 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">In Schuh v. R. H. Herron Co., 177 Cal. 13, 17, 169 Pac. 682, 683, the Supreme Court held that the rule declared in Mecham v. McKay, supra, was not universal; that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">\u201cthere is an exception in eases where the person who files and verifies the pleading is himself a witness on the trial. In such a case he may, on cross-examination, be questioned concerning the portions of his original pleadings which are inconsistent with the pleading upon which the trial is had, for the purpose of showing statements inconsistent with his testimony on the stand\u201d\u2014 citing Johnson v. Powers, 65 Cal. 180, 3 Pac. 625; Estate of O\u2019Connor, 118 Cal. 71, 50 Pac. 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">\u201cIt was proper, therefore,\u201d the court said, \u201cfor the jury to have before it the varying statements of the plaintiff on the subject of the exact manner in which he received his injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">In Williams v. Seiglitz, 186 Cal. 767, 773, 200 Pac. 635, 637, this question was again before the Supreme Court on an objection that an original answer had been improperly admitted as a part of the cross-examination of the defendant. The court, referring to Mecham v. McKay, supra, and other cases, says: *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-13\">\u201cThese authorities lay down the rule that in this state an abandoned pleading may not be used as evidence against the pleader. However, it has been held that such a pleading may be admitted for purposes of impeachment of the pleader\u2019s testimony by showing prior inconsistent statements,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">\u2014citing the cases which we have referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">In the present case, the defendant was a witness in her own behalf at the trial in a deposition taken and read to the jury. In this deposition she gave testimony in support of the allegations contained in her amended answer, stating that the automobile belonged to her mother. On cross-examination, she was asked if the matters she had testified to were known to her when she verified her original answer in the case. She said they were. She was then asked why she admitted, under oath, that Ered Davis was her servant, in her employ, and operated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>automobile in question under her direction and control, in the course of his employment.. Her answer was that she did not understand that she was admitting anything except the ownership of the ranch (the ownership of which was also a subject of inquiry on the trial of the case). She testified' further, that later, through discussion with her attorney, the error was discovered; he not fully understanding the situation at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">She was asked, further, whether she had communicated all the matters contained in her answer to her attorneys at the time her first answer was filed. She answered, \u201cNo.\u201d She said she answered at the time the questions her attorney asked, but he did not ask her if Davis was her servant, in her employ, and operating the automobile under her direction and control, in the course of his employment. Her attention, she testified, was not called to this particular feature when she read the answer. She says she naturally signed the paper which the attorney presented to her, .which she thought covered the ownership of the ranch, as he knew of the deeds to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The defendant\u2019s original verified answer, was not offered as evidence of any fact, other than the fact that she had made the statements therein contained under oath. The defendant testified in her own behalf. Her attention was called to that part of her original answer inconsistent with her statement as a witness. She was given a full opportunity to explain such inconsistencies, and she made such an explanation as she thought advisable. The answer was properly admitted as tending to show that she was the owner of the automobile, and that Davis, the driver, was in her employ. The question at issue then became a question for the j-ury.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In addition to the cases cited from the Supreme Court of California, sustaining the ruling of the trial court in this case, the weight of authority in other states is to the effect that \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">\u201cA party, plaintiff or defendant, who verifies a pleading, should be presumed to have known its contents, and it should be received in evidence, subject to such explanation as the party may see fit to offer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">See H. C. Behrens Lumber Co. v. Lager, 26 S. D. 160, 128 N. W. 698, Ann.
