The unit of' compensation is the lineal foot charge for any \u25a0 single duct containing wire. When the charge for a conduit is di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>rected t\u00f3 be obtained by multiplying the number of ducts in such conduit by the precedingly named fee for a single duct, it is clear that only ducts containing wire or other appliances customarily used or usable for the dispatch of telegraph messages can be counted and measured, because the unit of compensation applies to no duct unless it contains wire or other usable appliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
