Appellant was plainly advised, in our view of the pleading, that cancellation was sought because appellant had deceived the naturalization court with respect to his belief in organized government and his adherence to the principles of the Constitution of the United States. Sections 7 and 27 of the Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. c. 3592 (Comp. St. \u00a7\u00a7 4363, 4382).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\">Subsequent acts and declarations of appellant were properly admitted as tending to disclose his state of mind when he signed his petition for naturalization. On the whole, we regard the evidence as adequate to sustain the finding of the trial court. Compare Luria v. United States, 231 U. S. 9, 34 Sup. Ct. 10, 58 L. Ed. 101; United States v. Aakervik (D.
