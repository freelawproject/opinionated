The government assessed and collected such tax, basing its right so to do on the provision of the Revenue Act of 1918, quoted in the. margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff, having paid the tax under protest, brought suit against the collector to recover the same back; but the court held it had been properly assessed, and entered judgment for the defendant. Thereupon the plaintiff sued out this writ, and the question involved is whether the equipment trust certificates here concerned fall within the purview of the statute as being \u201ccertificates of indebtedness * * * issued by any corporation with interest coupons * * * known .generally as corporate securities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">Turning to that question, we note that the certificate issued by the plaintiff, a copy of which is printed in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> does not evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>or certify to, any indebtedness owing by the plaintiff to the bearer, nor is it the coupon contract usually accompanying corporate securities, to pay periodic interest indebtedness. On the contrary, it is simply a certificate of the right of its holder to participate in a rental payable under a certain lease which lease restricts the right of the certificate holder to payment solely\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-4\">\u201cfrom and out of the deferred rentals when paid as provided for in a lease of 500 steel ears made by Fidelity Trust Company, trustee, to Interstate Railroad Company, bearing date the 2d day of February, 1920, which rentals are payable to the trustee for the benefit of the holders of this and other certificates amounting at par to $900,000, to which lease and the agreement hereinbefore mentioned reference is made for a statement of the rights of the holders of such certificates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">These certificates are issued under what is known as the Philadelphia plan, which was devised many years ago to provide for such a legal bailment of railroad equipment as would allow railroads to hold possession and use property owned by third parties. The legal method of financing such transactions was subscription to a fund (in this case, $900,000) which was handled by a trustee company and used to buy railroad equipment (in this case, 500 steel cars), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>were then leased to a railroad (in this case, the Interstate Railroad Company) at an annual rental, the cars meanwhile being marked \u201cFidelity Trust Company, Trustee, owner and lessor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">It will thus be seen that, when the transaction is viewed as a whole, as must be the case, and the certificate in question measured from \u2022that standpoint, no indebtedness is involved or obligation incurred by the trustee to the holder, but it is simply a certificate of the holder\u2019s right to proportionate participation in a rental when paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">Car trust certificates, such as here involved, have been so long and so largely used in the financial world, and are so vital a factor in the financing and equipment of railroads, that it would seem that Congress, had it intended taxing them, would have so covered them by specific designation, or by proper generic description, as to leave no question of its-intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">In our judgment, the law and facts are with the plaintiff, and the judgment of the. District Court is therefore reversed, and the . cause remanded to said court for further procedure in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1030-8\"> \u201c1.
