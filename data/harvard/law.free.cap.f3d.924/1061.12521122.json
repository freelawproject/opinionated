He was convicted of a crime involving cocaine in 2006. He admitted to being removable, but asserted that he was eligible for cancellation of removal based on continuous residency in the United States for more than seven years. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed the Immigration Judge's (IJ) pretermission of his application for cancellation of removal holding that Alanniz's continuous residency did not commence with the 1997 parole, but with his 2000 adjustment to LPR status. We agree and affirm the pretermission of his application for cancellation of removal. However, at the parties' mutual request, we remand Alanniz's asylum application for the fact-finding necessary to determine the viability of Alanniz's proposed social group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Alanniz, a native and citizen of Mexico, was born on March 19, 1982. He claims that his parents brought him into the United States without inspection in 1986. He adjusted his status to LPR in August 2000. At the time of his removal hearing, he was unmarried and had four United States citizen children (born in 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2009). His parents and siblings are either citizens or LPRs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A parole document dated October 10, 1997, paroled Alanniz \"into the country for adjustment of status purposes, ... until October 9, 1998.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although this document was not placed in the certified record of this petition for review, Alanniz's primary contention before us is that the document constitutes an \"admission\" into the United States for the purpose of beginning the seven years of continuous residence necessary to qualify for discretionary cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2002, Alanniz was convicted of possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, in violation of California law and sentenced to three years probation. Then in 2006, Alanniz was convicted of violating a California criminal statute by being under the influence of cocaine and sentenced to 140 days in jail. Removal proceedings were initiated against Alanniz in 2012 based on his 2002 conviction. At the conclusion of a June 12, 2012 hearing before an IJ, the IJ issued an oral decision sustaining the charge of removability and ordering Alanniz removed to Mexico. Alanniz appealed to the BIA which dismissed his appeal, and he then filed a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While his petition was pending before the Ninth Circuit, Alanniz filed a motion to reopen with the BIA asserting that, in October 2012, a California Superior Court had amended the 2002 criminal complaint against Alanniz so that it no longer identified the controlled substance. The BIA granted reopening, vacated its previous order,\n   and remanded the case to the IJ for further proceedings. We then dismissed Alanniz's petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the reopened proceedings, DHS amended the Notice to Appear substituting Alanniz's 2006 drug conviction for the 2002 conviction. In a January 22, 2014 order, the IJ denied Alanniz's requests for relief. Alanniz admitted that he was removable but sought cancellation of removal, asylum, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The IJ granted DHS's motion to pretermit Alanniz's application for cancellation of removal. The IJ was not persuaded by Alanniz's argument that his 2002 conviction no longer disqualified him from cancellation of removal, but found that it was \"undisputed\" that Alanniz had been convicted of a controlled substance related offense in 2006, and that the substance had been cocaine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, to be eligible for cancellation, Alanniz had to show \"that he was 'admitted' and resid[ed] in the U.S. since at least 1999.\" However, the IJ found that his initial entry was without inspection, and his \"first 'admission' was when he adjusted his status to a lawful permanent resident on August 3, 2000.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The IJ proceeded to deny Alanniz's request for asylum noting that, even accepting that he provided credible testimony, Alanniz's concern that \"he will be targeted for harm by the drug cartels and other criminals in the country\" was a generalized fear of harm by criminals and not harm on account of a protected ground. The IJ also denied relief under the CAT noting that there was \"no claim or evidence that the respondent was harmed, much less tortured in the past.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Alanniz's appeal to the BIA was dismissed on August 11, 2015. The BIA agreed with the IJ that Alanniz was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because his 2006 conviction came before he had achieved seven years of continuous presence in the United States. The BIA stated: \"A grant of parole pursuant to section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Act 'shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The BIA also denied Alanniz's application for asylum noting that he had \"defined his particular social group based upon his assertion that members of the group are subject to kidnappings and extortion upon arrival in Mexico.\" It held that it is \"well established\" that asylum cannot be based\n   on \"fear of harm resulting from general conditions of violence and civil unrest affecting the home country's populace as a whole.\" Finally, the BIA noted that Alanniz had not challenged the IJ's determination that he was not eligible for protection under the CAT. Alanniz filed a timely petition with this court on September 9, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We review only the BIA's decision except to the extent the decision adopts or relies on the IJ's reasoning, in which case we review both the IJ's and the BIA's decisions.\n   <em>\n    Agyeman v.

The argument is not persuasive for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, Respondent makes a sound argument that Alanniz has forfeited any objection concerning the status of the administrative record because he did not object to the absence of the 1997 parole document from the record either before the IJ or the BIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (providing that a court may review a final order of removal \"only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\"). In the agency proceedings, Alanniz was allowed to argue on the existing record that his 1997 parole constituted an admission, and he never objected to the fact that the document was not in the record. Alanniz should not now be allowed to challenge the sufficiency of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, Alanniz overstates Respondent's responsibility for producing information. We have held that \"[i]n the removal context, the government bears the burden of establishing deportability,\" but that the \"REAL ID Act places the burden of demonstrating eligibility for cancellation of removal squarely on the noncitizen.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Young v.

Alanniz does not contest the evidence in the record that at his 2012 hearing his attorney reviewed the parole document and demurred to Respondent's statement that it was a Form I-131 application to allow travel. Moreover, Alanniz offers no suggestion as to how the particular language in the 1997 document would have any impact on his case. Indeed, under our controlling precedent of\n   <em>\n    Medina-Nunez\n   </em>\n   , it does not matter what type of parole issued in 1997, because whatever its nature it does not constitute an admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In sum, even if Alanniz has not forfeited his right to challenge the absence of the 1997 parole document from the record, he is not entitled to relief because (a) it was his responsibility to request the document, which he failed to do, and (b) the absence of the document was not prejudicial to Alanniz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Alanniz asserts that the BIA erred in holding that he did not challenge the IJ's determination that he was not eligible for protection under the CAT.

The BIA redefined the group as \"long term residents of the U.S. who have been deported to Mexico and will be subject to kidnappings and extortion upon arrival in Mexico.\" Alanniz objects that this amounted to improper fact-finding, which the BIA is not entitled to do, and contends that this issue should be remanded so that the IJ can address the social group proposed by Alanniz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Respondent concedes that the IJ mischaracterized Alanniz's proposed social group as \"returning Mexicans from the United States,\" when Alanniz had defined his proposed group as \"long term residents of the U.S. who have been deported to Mexico and will be subject to kidnappings and extortion upon arrival in Mexico.\" Respondent asserts that whether a proposed social group constitutes a particular social group is a question of law, but the cognizability of a putative social group also contains factual issues, citing\n   <em>\n    Pirir-Boc v.

Respondent requests a remand of Alanniz's request for asylum \"so that the agency may conduct a case-specific analysis of the documentary evidence Mr. Alanniz submitted to the immigration judge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Because the proposed group as understood by the IJ is somewhat different from the group proffered by Alanniz, we accede to the parties' request and remand this issue to the agency. Alanniz is entitled to have the IJ first consider the facts that define his proposed group, and neither the BIA nor the Ninth Circuit is authorized to undertake the initial factfinding necessary to determine the viability of the group.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    INS v.

The BIA properly determined that Alanniz is not eligible for cancellation of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To the extent that Alanniz's failure to object before the IJ or the BIA to the absence of the 1997 parole document from the record does not constitute a forfeiture of his right to raise the issue, his objection is not meritorious. Requesting the production of the document was part of his burden to demonstrate eligibility for cancellation of removal. Moreover, Alanniz has failed to show any prejudice from the absence of the parole document because the 1997 parole did not constitute an \"admission\" regardless of the nature of the parole. We also hold that the BIA properly determined that Alanniz's brief to the BIA did not challenge the IJ's denial of relief under the CAT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abebe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684927\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/1203/#p1208\">\n    554 F.3d at 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, we accede to the parties' request to remand Alanniz's asylum claim to the agency to allow an IJ to undertake the initial fact-finding necessary to determine the viability of Alanniz's proposed group, as defined by Alanniz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Alanniz's challenge to the pretermission of his application for cancellation of removal is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and his asylum application is\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   for further fact-finding.
