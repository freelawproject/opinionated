Water and Sewer Authority (\"D.C. Water\") for nearly thirty years when his position was eliminated as part of a reorganization. D.C. Water offered Haynes a new position, but he was unable to obtain the license that position required and lost his job. Haynes alleges that he was treated differently than other employees affected by the reorganization due to his race, age, and learning disability, and that D.C. Water refused to accommodate his disability when it set deadlines for him to obtain the new license. He brings claims under various federal and D.C. civil rights statutes. The district court granted D.C. Water summary judgment, Haynes appealed, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   D.C. Water is an independent agency of the D.C. government that provides water and sewage service to the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Haynes v. DC Water is Life\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272809\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/271/142/#p145\">\n    271 F. Supp. 3d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145 (D.D.C. 2017). Haynes started working at D.C. Water's predecessor organization in 1988. He was an \"Electrical Equipment Repairer,\" grade \"11/CDL.\" D.C. Water had long required Repairers in that position to hold a Class B Commercial Driver's License (CDL) and an apprentice electrician license, both of which Haynes possessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2014, D.C. Water consolidated several departments. Many positions were to remain the same after the reorganization, but some, including Haynes's, were to be eliminated or replaced. D.C. Water also discovered during this reorganization that D.C. law requires individuals holding apprentice electrician licenses-such as Haynes-to be directly supervised by master electricians. Problematically, D.C. Water did not employ enough master electricians to supervise all the Electrical Equipment Repairers holding apprentice electrician licenses, and, by mid-2014, determined that it would not be feasible to hire enough master electricians to do so. D.C. Water thus concluded that the Electrical Equipment Repairer position would be replaced by an \"Industrial Journeyman Electrician\" position, and that individuals employed in the new position would be required to hold a more advanced journeyman electrician license that permitted additional unsupervised work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After negotiations with the union representing affected employees, D.C. Water set a March 31, 2015 deadline for current Repairers to obtain their new licenses. Repairers who obtained the proper licenses on or before that date were to be retained as Industrial Journeyman Electricians, and those that did not would be fired. Beginning on September 2, 2014, Haynes and other Repairers attended training sessions offered by D.C. Water. Haynes alleges that around this time he told D.C. Water's Human Resources Department that he was dyslexic and needed more time to prepare for the exam, particularly because the training was a \"refresher\" course \"not meant for first-time test takers.\"\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272809\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/271/142/#p145\">\n    271 F. Supp. 3d at 148-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Am. Compl. \u00b6 8). Indeed, a journeyman electrician\n   license generally requires years of training and supervised work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272809\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/271/142/#p145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Haynes, who is over fifty and black, alleges that younger, white electricians employed by D.C. Water received accommodations, including being given more time to obtain their licenses, not being subjected to the heightened license requirement, or being allowed to return to school for additional training. In contrast, D.C. Water refused to offer Haynes additional time or any other accommodation. Haynes completed the training offered by D.C. Water on December 9, 2014, but still felt unprepared for the license examination. Shortly thereafter, he began attempting to get medical documentation of his disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As of March 31, 2015, Haynes had failed to take the journeyman electrician exam and been unable to get medical documentation of his dyslexia. The next day, D.C. Water sent him a letter explaining that his failure to comply with the licensing deadline meant that he could no longer perform any electrical work. D.C. Water did, however, give him sixty more days (until May 31, 2015) to pass the examination. Haynes was able to meet with a clinical psychologist on May 13, who diagnosed Haynes with a \"[r]eading [d]isorder with impairment in word reading and reading comprehension,\" and a \"[w]riting [d]isorder with impairment in written expression and spelling.\" Joint Appendix (\"J.A.\") 157. The psychologist concluded that it would be \"reasonable\" for Haynes's \"current job ... to accommodate for [these] reading and writing disabilities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272809\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/271/142/#p145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The record is silent as to whether Haynes presented this documentation to his employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   What is clear is that on May 26, 2015, Haynes went to the Washington Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). There he submitted an intake questionnaire describing what had happened at work and requesting additional counseling about whether to file a charge of discrimination. Later that day, he filed such a charge. On May 27, Haynes received a Notice of Right to Sue from the EEOC, which stated that \"[b]ased upon its investigation,\" the agency was \"unable to conclude that the information obtained establishe[d] violations of the\" Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (ADA), although the EEOC did \"not certify that [D.C. Water] [was] in compliance with the statute[ ].\" J.A. 173. The notice also contained information about Haynes's right to file a lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Haynes failed to complete the journeyman electrician license exam by the extended deadline of May 31, 2015 and was fired. At that time, there were six other Electrical Equipment Repairers in the same grade (\"11/CDL\") as Haynes. Five were black and one was white. Two of the black employees already had the necessary license for the new position before the reorganization. Prior to March 31, 2015, one black Repairer and the white Repairer completed the exam. Along with Haynes, the remaining two black employees did not complete the licensing exam by March 31, 2015 and were given the additional sixty-day extension. They also appear to have been laid off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 29, 2016, Haynes filed a pro se complaint in the district court, alleging that D.C. Water failed to accommodate his learning disability when it set the deadlines for him to acquire a new license. Haynes eventually retained counsel and filed an amended complaint that includes claims for breach of contract, disability discrimination in violation of the ADA, race discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\") and the Civil Rights Act of 1866,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Section 1981\"), and age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (ADEA).

Haynes opposed the motion as premature, seeking discovery under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d). The district court denied Haynes's request for discovery and granted summary judgment to D.C. Water.\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272809\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/271/142/#p145\">\n    271 F.

Haynes received a Notice of Right to Sue from the EEOC on May 27, 2015. Under the ADA, he had ninety days from that date to file a complaint in court, meaning that the last day for Haynes to file an ADA claim was August 25, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012117\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f).

He asserts, however, that his problems with reading and comprehension so affected his understanding of his legal rights that he was unable to handle his affairs, rendering him \"non compos mentis\" at the time his right to file suit accrued and equitably tolling the filing deadline.

To the contrary-Haynes expressly indicated on the questionnaire that he did not wish for it to be treated as a charge. Rather than check the box on the form that states \"I want to file a charge of discrimination,\" Haynes marked a separate box that says \"I want to talk to an EEOC employee before deciding whether to file a charge. I understand that by checking this box,\n   <em>\n    I have not\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    filed a charge with the EEOC\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 168 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3689271,7415415\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/904/\">\n    71 F.3d at 908-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the contents of a similar, unsworn intake questionnaire did not form part of the administrative charge for exhaustion purposes).

The section of the questionnaire where he twice wrote \"Age\" directs the filer to list the \"race, sex, age, national origin, religion, or disability of\" similarly situated employees who were \"treated better than you,\" \"if known, and if it relates to your claim of discrimination.\" J.A. 166. Following the names of the two Repairers who were also laid off, Haynes wrote the word \"Age\" twice. According to him, \"[t]he only reason ... [he] would list the age of 'similarly-situated' employees is to allege age discrimination.\" Haynes Br. 23. Haynes, however, did not actually list the ages of the other employees. He wrote the\n   <em>\n    word\n   </em>\n   age. Moreover, he then crossed out that entire section of his questionnaire, wrote \"Nobody,\" and rewrote the names of the two employees in the section of the questionnaire asking for similarly situated employees who were \"treated the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   as you\"-which, of course, is the proper place to describe the employees who Haynes alleges were also laid off for failing to timely complete the test.

In response to Haynes's allegations that he had been treated differently, D.C. Water presented evidence that all employees required to obtain journeyman electrician licenses had been subject to the same requirements and deadlines. In addition to opposing the motion on the merits, Haynes filed a declaration from his lawyer pursuant to Rule 56(d) requesting that summary judgment be delayed pending discovery. The rule provides that \"[i]f a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order.\" FED.

Cir. 2008) (considering whether the necessity of the requested evidence was \"self-evident\" and otherwise looking beyond the declaration).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   D.C. Water's proffered justification for Haynes's discharge was compliance with a D.C. law requiring that electricians possess journeyman licenses prior to working with the level of supervision Haynes had. Haynes contends that reason was pretext because other employees subjected to new licensure requirements during the reorganization were given further accommodations. As relevant here, in Haynes's complaint he describes those other employees as electricians who received additional flexibility in obtaining their journeyman electrician licenses. D.C. Water then presented evidence that the only electricians subject to new licensure requirements during the reorganization were Electrical Equipment Repairers like Haynes, and that all the Repairers were treated the same (or worse) than Haynes. J.A. 21-22, 46, 62-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   After D.C. Water produced this evidence about the other electricians affected by the reorganization, Haynes broadened the group of employees he alleged were subjected to relaxed licensing requirements. He argued that discovery regarding non-electricians was necessary to determine whether similarly situated employees existed who were given additional time to obtain non-electrical licenses. He also suggested that discovery about the reorganization more generally was necessary to determine whether it disproportionately impacted African-American employees who had long worked in limited-skill positions at D.C. Water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Discovery along these lines might have supported Haynes's claim of discrimination and a request for such discovery could have rendered summary judgment premature. Almost all the information Haynes identified in his request for discovery, however, is expressly restricted to information about\n   <em>\n    electricians\n   </em>\n   affected by the reorganization. And Haynes failed to explain adequately why the more general category of information he identified in his declaration was necessary to create a triable issue of fact. As the district court concluded, his explanations fall short of the level of particularity we have previously concluded is necessary to meet the first\n   <em>\n    Convertino\n   </em>\n   factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kohn Aff.,\n   <em>\n    Convertino v.

No. 187-1 (describing the particular aspects of the motion that discovery was necessary to rebut, the specific discovery that would be sought, and how that information would\n   create a genuine dispute of material fact with respect to six facts underlying the movant's arguments);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172480\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/509/#p513\">\n    843 F.3d at 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the first\n   <em>\n    Convertino\n   </em>\n   factor requires explaining \"how\" the requested facts \"could create a material factual dispute\"). He did not, for example, explain how the treatment of non-electricians could call into question D.C. Water's proffered reason for his discharge, which was specific to D.C. law on the licensing of electricians. He also failed to identify with even a modest level of specificity those categories of non-electricians that might have been subject to more relaxed licensing requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Haynes's response is twofold. First, he argues that we have, in the past, held that it was an abuse of discretion to deny discovery following the production of similarly vague declarations or affidavits. Haynes Br. 16-18. But the cases he relies on for this proposition were decided before\n   <em>\n    Convertino\n   </em>\n   established the applicable standard. The declarations at issue in those cases, moreover, still described with greater specificity how the requested information might create a dispute of material fact. Kohn Aff.,\n   <em>\n    Ikossi v. Dep't of Navy\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:04-cv-01392 (D.D.C. Feb. 4, 2005), Dkt. No. 10-2; Shapiro Aff.,\n   <em>\n    Chappell-Johnson v. Powell\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:03-cv-01557 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2003), Dkt No. 14-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Second, Haynes says that the district court necessarily abused its discretion by requiring him to produce evidence that D.C. Water's explanation for his discharge was mere pretext. Haynes Br. 14-15. He argues that the relevant inquiry prior to discovery is whether he stated a claim, not whether he created a dispute of material fact regarding pretext. This claim of legal error conflates two separate conclusions of the district court. First, the district court concluded that Haynes's Rule 56(d) request was deficient and denied discovery. Then it concluded that on the present record Haynes had failed to create a dispute of material fact as to whether D.C. Water's proffered reason for discharging him was pretext. Having decided that Haynes was not entitled to discovery, faulting him for failing to create a dispute of material fact was entirely proper-and indeed required to grant summary judgment. That Haynes's complaint may have survived a motion to dismiss because he stated a claim is, given the motion for summary judgment and proffer of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Convertino\n   </em>\n   provides a roadmap for securing discovery. When it comes to the first factor, that guide directs nonmovants to file an affidavit or declaration explaining, with sufficient particularity, what specific facts are required to oppose the motion and why those facts are necessary to the litigation. What counts as \"sufficient particularity\" will necessarily be a case-specific inquiry, dependent on the nature of the claims and the existing record. But the affidavits we have approved of in prior cases have two things in common. First, they discuss the specific facts that must be discovered to support a plaintiff's legal theory, rather than recite broad categories of information-even if broad categories of information will ultimately be requested to uncover those specific facts. Second, they explain why the required information\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   create a dispute of material fact, even when its ultimate import is unclear, and connect the information sought to the theory of relief advanced. Haynes's declaration was deficient on both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Though in some cases the relevance and necessity of the requested discovery are so obvious given the claims that little more than identification of the information is required to head off a pre-discovery motion\n   for summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ikossi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639465,3568687\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/516/1037/\">\n    516 F.3d at 1045-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , given the complexities of Haynes's Section 1981 theory of liability, this is not such a case. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Haynes's Rule 56(d) request for discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Haynes's ADA and DCHRA claims are untimely, his ADEA and Title VII claims were not properly exhausted before the EEOC, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Haynes's request for discovery, and summary judgment on his Section 1981 claim was appropriate. We therefore affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     National Railroad Passenger Corp. v.
