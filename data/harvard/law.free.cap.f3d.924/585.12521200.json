Federal district judges, whom Congress has tasked with tabulating those fees, frequently find themselves whipsawed between two seemingly discordant instructions: (1) ascertain the hourly rate for lawyers performing similar work \"with a fair degree of accuracy\" using \"specific evidence,\"\n   <em>\n    National Association of Concerned Veterans v.

Cir. 1982), but (2) do so without turning fee calculations into \"a second major litigation,\"\n   <em>\n    Hensley v.

To reconcile those directives, district courts often turn to a fee matrix-that is, a chart averaging rates for attorneys at different experience levels. For decades, courts in this circuit have relied on some version of what is known as the\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   matrix. Created in the 1980s, that matrix is based on a relatively small sample of rates charged by sophisticated federal-court practitioners in the District of Columbia. Litigants have updated the matrix for inflation using an assortment of tools. Recently, however, the United States Attorney's Office sought to replace this standby with a new default matrix based on data for all types of lawyers-not just those who litigate complex federal cases-from the entire metropolitan area-not just the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this case, after plaintiffs prevailed in a long-running Individuals with Disabilities Education Act class action, the district court accepted the District of Columbia's invitation to rely on the USAO's new matrix in awarding fees. But as we explain below, the new matrix departs from the statutory requirement that reasonable fees be tethered to \"rates prevailing in the\n   community\" for the \"kind and quality of services furnished.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(C). We therefore vacate the award and remand for the district court to recalculate the hourly rate based on evidence that focuses on fees for attorneys practicing complex federal litigation in the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We begin by reviewing the elementary principles governing fee-shifting rate calculations and the genealogy of fee matrices in this circuit, and then turn to the history of this particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As Congress enacted a growing number of laws securing civil rights, it confronted a problem: \"enforcement would prove difficult\" without private lawsuits, and would-be plaintiffs needed skilled lawyers to guide them through the obstacle course of complex litigation.\n   <em>\n    Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171007\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/400/#p401\">\n    390 U.S. 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171007\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/400/#p401\">\n    88 S.Ct. 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171007\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/400/#p401\">\n    19 L.Ed.2d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968). But those plaintiffs often lacked financial resources \"indispensable\" to attracting \"competent counsel\" willing and able to take on defendants of greater means.\n   <em>\n    Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v.

So Congress turned to fee-shifting provisions, simultaneously \"encourag[ing] plaintiffs to bring suit\" and allowing those who prevail to finance the cost of legal assistance by recovering fees from the defendant.

For example, for someone house hunting in Memphis, a survey of real estate prices in Seattle-even one with a perfect response rate updated daily-would be of no use. The same is true here. The USAO's matrix is helpful only if it canvasses the relevant type of lawyer, which it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To begin with, the USAO's matrix incorporates rates for the wrong types of practitioner.

Yet rather than confine its data to rates charged by attorneys practicing that genre of litigation-or even just litigators in general-the survey that the USAO drew from incorporates rates from\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   types of lawyers. Respondents include real estate lawyers, family lawyers, and insurance lawyers-lawyers manifestly not offering \"the kind and quality of services furnished\" by these plaintiffs' attorneys, as the statute requires of comparators.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(C) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277058,6785367\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/97/\">\n    793 F.3d at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (fee analysis should focus on \"lawyers ... doing the same type of litigation\" (emphasis omitted)). It is obvious that the rates charged for, say, simple wills are lower than those for complex federal litigation.

For all we know, the number could be anywhere from zero to all 350.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Compounding this first error, the USAO's custom-ordered dataset surveys lawyers far beyond the \"community in which th[is] action ... arose.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(C). Plaintiffs brought this case on behalf of District of Columbia residents regarding District of Columbia schools against the District of Columbia. Yet the USAO matrix draws from lawyers who practice in the entire \"metro area\" as defined by the United States Census Bureau. The phrase \"metro area\" suggests proximity, but-according to the Census Bureau's definition-that area stretches well beyond the District to cover thousands of square miles over three states, from rural Madison County, Virginia, to the eastern shore of Maryland, back to the foothills of Jefferson County, West Virginia. Needless to say, this case has no connection to most of those areas. Our court has held that ordinarily \"the relevant community is the one in which the district court sits.\"\n   <em>\n    Donnell v.

We see no reason why the rates that apply to the rest of plaintiffs' lawyers would yield inadequate compensation for Mehri's services. Plaintiffs contend that Mehri is instead entitled to his usual billing rate, but his sparse affidavit tells little about whether his relatively minimal contributions to the case differ sufficiently from his colleagues' to warrant a different methodology. Mehri Affidavit, No. 1:05-cv-01437-RCL, ECF No. 537-17 (Sept. 26, 2016), J.A. 428-29 (asserting he \"did work related to class certification\" and tried to \"broker a resolution to this case\").

And although stating in his affidavit that he charges the same rate no matter what type of work he performs, Mehri nowhere represents that a client on the market would hire him at that rate for the types of services he performed in this case. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by compensating Mehri using the same method as his co-counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Not so long ago, the prevailing belief was that parties would often be able to agree on reasonable attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p437\">\n    461 U.S. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p437\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Ideally, of course, litigants will settle the amount of a fee.\"). We regret that this prophecy has gone unfulfilled and fervently hope that practitioners in this circuit-on both the plaintiff and defense sides of the bar-will work together and think creatively about how to produce a reliable assessment of fees charged for complex federal litigation in the District. In the meantime, however, we must discharge our duty to ensure that the adversarial alternative produces results that respect Congress's mandates. Because the fee award in this case falls short of that goal, we vacate it and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Sentelle, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ambrose Bierce defined a lawyer as \"[o]ne skilled in circumvention of the law.\" Ambrose Bierce, The Unabridged Devil's Dictionary 147 (Univ. of Georgia Press 2000). Though I do not suggest that this is an accurate description, I nonetheless would observe that the jurisprudence of IDEA litigation attorney-fee awards well establishes that lawyers and jurists are professionals skilled in complicating the law. The jurisprudential odyssey on this sea began with a rather straightforward mandate from Congress in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3), a subsection headed \"Jurisdiction of\n   <em>\n    district\n   </em>\n   courts; attorney fees.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   More specifically, Congress provided that, \"[i]n any action or proceeding brought [under the IDEA provision providing judicial relief], the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(B)(i). While the following subsections provide some limitations and directions for the computation of the award, the basic task created by Congress and placed within the jurisdiction of the district court is a factual determination of the reasonableness of attorneys' fees to be awarded as part of the costs in IDEA actions. The congressional language would seem to rather straightforwardly call for findings of fact, concerning the reasonableness of attorneys' fees to be awarded. The district court in the present controversy made such findings which we are now called upon to review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"[T]he standard governing appellate review of a district court's finding of [facts] is that set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Bessemer City\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    470 U.S. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 573,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p573\">\n    84 L.Ed.2d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). Rule 52(a) provides that \"[f]indings of fact, whether based on oral or other evidence, must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous ....\" Not only would it seem apparent that this is the standard of review we should be applying to the issues before us, it seems especially appropriate where the question is expressly described as within the \"jurisdiction of district courts\" in the enactment creating the right to such a finding.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Indeed, we have expressly held in previous IDEA class litigation that \"[w]e review the district court's fee award for abuse of discretion, and will not upset its hourly rate determination absent clear misapplication of\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   principles, arbitrary factfinding, or unprincipled disregard for the record evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Eley v.

Cir. 2015) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citations deleted). In spite of this standard, in the present case, the majority reviews the district court's determination\n   of the factual questions before us, not for compliance with Rule 52(a), nor for abuse of discretion, but as if it were a question of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The majority asks not whether the district court committed a clear misapplication of legal principles, or arbitrary factfinding, or unprincipled disregard for record evidence, but rather whether the district court's findings of fact fit within a detailed grid, the\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix, which might be construed as a proffer by the prevailing party for findings of fact, but more closely resembles a detailed regulation adopted by some government agency after an appropriate period of notice and comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The district court found another matrix to be more factually appropriate. The making of that factual determination, under the law in general and under the governing statute in particular, is the district court's province. I grant that we as an appellate reviewing court have participated in the establishment of this legislation-like matrix. I further realize that we have the authority to establish precedent binding upon district courts and upon panels of this court such as this one.\n   <em>\n    LaShawn A. v. Barry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"653,3693839\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/1389/\">\n    87 F.3d 1389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1395 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc). Nonetheless, I have always understood our authority to make binding precedents to govern matters of law, not findings of fact. The present controversy concerns a matter of fact. This, under the binding precedent of both this circuit and the Supreme Court and the Rules of Civil Procedure is within the discretion of the district court, subject only to the limited review described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   While not necessary to my dissent, I further note that appellants proffered nothing to convince me that the LSI Matrix preferred by them is inherently more appropriate for the findings required by the district court in this case than the USAO Matrix relied upon in the district court's findings. Appellants' argument rests on the proposition that the award should have been based on fees determined by survey of a specific subcategory of attorneys out of the several set forth in their preferred matrix: specifically, practitioners in complex federal litigation in Washington, D.C. The matrix employed by the district court instead considered the rates of a broader sampling of attorneys from a broader geographic area, including not only the District of Columbia, but also adjacent portions of three states. It is not apparent how this was an abuse of discretion of the sort that would make the court's determination reversible under the standard set forth in the rules and blessed in\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Bessemer City\n   </em>\n   , and a multitude of other cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Appellants seem to argue that the district court's determination was inconsistent with Congress's instructions in section 1415(i)(3)(C). That section mandates that an IDEA fee award \"shall be based on rates prevailing in the community in which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and quality of services furnished.\" It does not mandate that the community should be limited to a \"community\" defined as only the largest municipality in a region, or to the highest priced professional practicing in that limited community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As the purpose of Congress in setting forth the general limitations of subsection (C) appears to encourage the determination of a market for assessing the reasonableness of fees, it would seem that an analysis of the fitness of either matrix to that determination could, without violating the standard under which we review factfinding, include reflecting on the reasonableness of persons obtaining legal representation in such a hypothetical market. It might be that those persons would choose the most expensive professionals for the\n   most expensive part of the market. While such conduct might not be unreasonable, neither is it inherently unreasonable that they might choose a less imposing or less expensive attorney who is nonetheless trusted and competent to do the work in the case. It may shock counsel before us to learn, but it is not necessary in every case to have the most specialized or the most expensive counsel in order to receive competent legal services. In any event, it is not arbitrary fact finding for the judge to conduct an analysis of the evidence that is consistent with such supposition. In short, I find no abuse of discretion or other reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   My colleagues disagree. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
