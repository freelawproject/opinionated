SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jose Susumo Azano Matsura aspired to participate in developing San Diego and turning it into the Miami Beach of the west coast. To help achieve this goal, Azano and his co-conspirators sought to influence local politicians during the 2012 San Diego election cycle by providing campaign contributions. However, as a foreign national, Azano was prohibited by federal law from donating or contributing to American campaigns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A jury convicted Azano and Ravneet Singh of various crimes stemming from the campaign contributions; Azano was also convicted of violating federal firearms law. Azano and Singh (together, Appellants) now appeal, raising a litany of constitutional, statutory, and procedural arguments. Although we affirm the district court in large part, we reverse their convictions on count thirty-seven (obstruction of justice in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201519\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Azano ran a successful technology business based in Mexico City, but maintained a family home in San Diego. Although Azano's wife and children are United States citizens, he is neither a naturalized United States citizen nor a permanent resident. Azano, a citizen of Mexico, entered the United States in January 2010 on a B1/B2 visa, which allows visitors entry for pleasure or business if the noncitizen \"intends to leave the United States at the end of the temporary stay.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2041.31\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Azano traveled weekly back and forth from San Diego to Mexico City for business purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, the government introduced evidence that Azano had an interest in developing San Diego, and particularly the Chula Vista waterfront area. The government introduced testimony that in order to achieve his development goals, Azano believed that he needed government cooperation, which included a relationship with the mayor of San Diego. Azano had previously formed such relationships in Mexico by making campaign contributions to candidates for various offices. Azano set about implementing a similar strategy in San Diego. With the aid of his co-conspirators, Azano sought to secure the favor of San Diego mayoral candidates who he believed would support his development plans. Azano first supported Bonnie Dumanis during the 2012 primary elections, but when she lost, he supported Bob Filner in the general election. Azano did so despite the fact that federal law prohibits \"a foreign national, directly or indirectly,\" from making \"a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value ... in connection with a Federal, State, or local election.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030121\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Azano's funding scheme involved a number of people. Ernie Encinas, head of Azano's security team, was a former San Diego police officer with useful political connections who helped represent Azano's interests within the two campaign organizations. Marco Polo Cortes provided lobbying connections and helped facilitate initial meetings with the two campaign staffs. Mark Chase was a local car dealer and Azano's \"good friend,\" who arranged straw donors to donate to the Dumanis mayoral campaign, and later disguised Azano's donations to Filner's political action committee (PAC) and other entities by writing checks from his personal and business accounts. Edward Susumo Azano Hester, Azano's son, recruited straw donors to give to the Dumanis campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Singh was the CEO of ElectionMall, a media platform offering a \"one-stop sho[p]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   of technology to candidates and political parties running for office.\" Singh first worked with Azano on a Mexican presidential campaign in 2011. This professional relationship continued into the mayoral campaigns of Dumanis and Filner. Aaron Rosheim, the former director of web strategy at ElectionMall, testified that Azano paid ElectionMall for work on the San Diego campaigns. For this work, Singh billed Azano's Mexican companies, using the code names \"Betty Boop\" for Dumanis's campaign and \"Plastic Man\" for Filner's campaign. Evidence also suggested that Singh tried to conceal any paper trail of his work for Azano. An internal ElectionMall email from Singh with the subject title \"OLD invoices for Mr. A\" stated: \"Please don't have cynthia or anyone else send things with a code name. And then list the clients name in a [sic] email. That is stupid and dangerous for me.\" Additionally, in response to an email from Encinas about forming a PAC for Dumanis, Singh stated, \"I am not responding to this email. Bec[au]se of the legal ram[i]fications.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A federal grand jury returned a Third Superseding Indictment (the Indictment) charging four individuals-Azano, Singh, Cortes, and Hester-and one corporate defendant, ElectionMall, with illegally conspiring to commit campaign finance fraud in the 2012 San Diego mayoral elections. The government later dropped ElectionMall as a defendant and the four individuals were tried together. After trial, Cortes and Hester reached plea agreements and pled guilty to participating in the campaign contribution scheme. Encinas and Chase, who had been charged as coconspirators in a separate indictment, both also pled guilty to participating in the campaign contribution scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Appellants were charged in count one of the Indictment with conspiracy to violate the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A) and 30121(a)(1)(A),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for unlawful campaign donations by a foreign national, and conspiracy to falsify campaign records, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201519\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On October 27, 2017, the district court sentenced Azano to three years in custody and three years of supervised release, and on August 31, 2017 sentenced Singh to fifteen months in custody and three years of supervised release.

As donations and contributions have grown more important to the campaign process, so too has concern over foreign influence in American elections. In 1966, Congress amended the Foreign Agents Registration Act to prohibit foreign governments and entities from contributing to American political candidates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L.

Because the line between liability and innocent conduct in that case was so narrow, the requirement of a heightened standard was necessary.

Azano further suggests it may be difficult to discern what is prohibited because only in the last thirty-five years were donations to political candidates and parties criminalized. Yet, it is our \"traditional rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse\" from liability and Azano's distinctions, then, provide no basis to apply the heightened standard.\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181885\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/184/#p191\">\n    524 U.S. at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181885\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/184/#p191\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Azano next points to\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because it appropriately applied the\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   standard, the district court did not abuse its discretion in stating the mens rea requirement for counts one or three. Moreover, the evidence proffered at trial indicated that Appellants took steps to conceal their actions, which suggests that they possessed knowledge that their actions were unlawful, not that they unwittingly engaged in criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As to the charge that Singh aided and abetted Azano's unlawful donations, the district court's jury instruction stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The evidence must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with the knowledge and intention of helping [Azano] to commit the crime of making donations and contributions by a foreign national aggregating at least $ 25,000 in calendar year 2012, in violation of Title 2, United States Code, Sections 441e(a)(1)(A) and 437g(d)(1)(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Singh objected and proposed, in part, that the jury be told that \"the government must prove ... beyond a reasonable doubt ... that Ravneet Singh knew that Mr. Azano was not a United States citizen or legal permanent resident.\" Singh argues that the district court's failure to include the material element that he\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   Azano lacked immigration status constitutes reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The government agrees that Singh's knowledge of Azano's immigration status was a material element of the charged crime, but argues that the element was included within the district court's broader instructions. That Singh was charged with aiding and abetting the making of donations\n   <em>\n    by a foreign national\n   </em>\n   implies that Singh must know that Azano was a foreign national. The government also points to various places in the record where the parties noted this requirement. For example, the prosecutor stated, \"We have to prove that the defendant knew that [Azano] was a foreign national.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We agree with the government. \"The jury must be instructed as to the defense theory of the case, but the exact language proposed by the defendant need not be used, and it is not error to refuse a proposed instruction so long as the other instructions in their entirety cover that theory.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Although the district court could have properly included an express instruction regarding Singh's knowledge of Azano's immigration status, the instructions, as a whole, adequately covered that element. The instructions stated, \"The evidence must show beyond a reasonable doubt that [Singh] acted with the knowledge and intention of helping [Azano] to commit the crime of making donations and contributions by a foreign national.\" The jury thus knew that in order to find Singh guilty, it had to find that Singh was aware that Azano was a foreign national.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The arguments and evidence presented at trial further clarified this requirement. Singh's primary defense was that he did not know Azano's immigration status. Defense counsel stated in his closing argument, \"The government has absolutely failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ravi Singh knew that Mr. Azano was not a citizen nor a green card holder and therefore was ineligible to do anything.\" In response to this theory, the government presented ample evidence of Singh's knowledge. First, Singh's relationship with Azano started with services relating to the Mexican presidential election in 2011 in connection with which he traveled to Mexico with Azano. The Appellants' relationship continued thereafter, and Singh performed other work for Azano's Mexican businesses. Next, Singh took clear steps to conceal Azano's involvement in the campaigns. In emails, Singh admonished coworkers for improper use of code names, and refused to communicate about relevant topics directly due to the \"legal ram[i]fications.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, we find that the jury instructions sufficiently covered the required mental state, as required by \u00a7 30109 and Singh's defense theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Appellants contest their convictions under counts five through thirty-seven,\n   arguing there was insufficient evidence to satisfy the material elements of \u00a7 1519. \"We review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For counts thirty-two and thirty-seven, the government argued that Singh failed to disclose that Azano paid for Singh's social media services rendered to both the Dumanis and Filner campaigns. Dumanis's campaign manager, Jennifer Tierney, discussed payment options with Singh, who responded that he would \"voluntarily help\" to \"break[ ] into the San Diego market\" after being warned \"[t]hat no one could pay someone to volunteer in a campaign.\" For the Filner campaign, campaign manager Ed Clancy testified that when discussing payment options, Singh responded, \"Don't worry. It's taken care of.\" The government argued that these material omissions caused the campaigns to file false entries on campaign disclosure reports. For Azano's remaining counts, the government argued that he made false statements to the campaigns by using strawmen donors to conceal his political donations. Azano never donated himself, but instead instructed others to write checks on his silent behalf, with the promise of reimbursement. The government argued that these straw donors caused the campaigns to file false entries on campaign disclosure reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Appellants first argue that the government failed to introduce evidence to satisfy\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the material elements of \u00a7 1519 for counts thirty-two and thirty-seven.

The government established that Singh had a long history of providing his professional services in connection with political campaigns and elections, that he had operated ElectionMall since 2003, and had even run for a political office himself at an earlier time. Tierney testified that she warned Singh \"[t]hat no one could pay someone to volunteer in a campaign,\" and \"[t]hat if any payments were made, those would have to be reported to the campaign, and we would have to report them on a [Form] 460.\" Knowing these reporting requirements, Singh still offered to \"voluntarily help\" and concealed Azano's payments by using code names and invoicing through separate companies. The jury reasonably could have found that Singh knew campaign disclosure reports required disclosing in-kind contributions, and that he withheld his funding to prevent such disclosures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Regarding Appellants' convictions pursuant to count thirty-seven-causing the Filner campaign to file false reports-we find the evidence insufficient to sustain either conviction. When the Filner campaign asked about payment for Singh's social media services, Singh stated, \"Don't worry. It's taken care of.\" Clancy, the campaign manager, did not respond with any questions, and later admitted, \"I made a mistake .... I internalized the information .... I should have let somebody know.\" Singh's statement cannot reasonably be construed as willfully causing the Filner campaign to file falsified reports. Instead, Singh's statements suggested that he was being paid by a third party, yet the campaign failed to note this in the reports. This cannot meet even the\n   <em>\n    Bryan\n   </em>\n   standard of willfulness, and so we reverse both convictions under count thirty-seven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Singh also argues that the government did not show that his actions were taken with \"the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201519\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He cites cases that focus on the nexus between the action and an investigation to argue that the government erred\n   \"by conflating the intent to commit the underlying crime with the intent to impede a subsequent investigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   On its face, the statute is particularly broad regarding the investigation element. One need not impede, obstruct, or influence an actual ongoing investigation; instead, the mere fact that the defendant contemplates an investigation satisfies this element.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518952\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/784/#p793\">\n    906 F.3d 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 793-96 (9th Cir. 2018). Congress intentionally relaxed this requirement to allow the statute to reach more broadly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 107-146, at 14-15 (\"This statute is specifically meant not to include any technical requirement, which some courts have read into other obstruction of justice statutes, to tie the obstructive conduct to a pending or imminent proceeding or matter. It is also sufficient that the act is done 'in contemplation' of or in relation to a matter or investigation.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Reading the section broadly, the government presented sufficient evidence to prove this element. The government established that Singh had a long history of involvement in campaigns and elections, and that he was warned about the reporting requirements in the San Diego mayoralty campaigns. Still, Singh stated he would \"voluntarily help\" and did not disclose any payments by Azano. Singh limited any paper trail by using code names and admonishing those discussing Azano's payments in emails. From this evidence, a jury could reasonably infer that Singh contemplated an investigation due to unlawful activity and intended to direct that investigation away from himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Lastly, Singh argues that any investigation of his conduct is not within the jurisdiction of the United States, because it involved a local campaign, and the falsified campaign disclosure forms violated state and local laws, not federal law. Section 1519 requires that the conduct \"influence the investigation or proper administration of\n   <em>\n    any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201519\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Singh misconstrues the focus of the investigation. We agree that violations of state campaign disclosure laws do not fall within the jurisdiction of the United States; however, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has jurisdiction to investigate violations of FECA. This extends to state and local elections insofar as the FBI investigates donations by a foreign national. Here, the FBI did investigate the campaigns, due to Azano's foreign nationality. That the reports were filed pursuant to state law has no bearing since they were sought in connection with the investigation of a federal crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Singh cites\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We conclude that the government presented sufficient evidence to show that Azano willfully caused the campaigns to make false entries on campaign disclosure forms with the intent of obstructing a potential investigation. Chase testified that Azano asked him to recruit straw donors for the Dumanis campaign and make a large donation to a Filner PAC, and promised to reimburse him for those donations. Azano also tasked his employee, Jason Wolter, and his own son, Hester, to \"recruit ... friends ... to write a $ 500 check to the campaign.\" The government presented a ledger seized from Azano's home that tallied all straw donations obtained. Azano made no direct donations, but his U.S.-based company, AIRSAM, made a $ 100,000 donation to fund a Dumanis PAC. A local newspaper article traced the money back to Azano, questioning whether the donation was legal due to Azano's immigration status. The government noted that, subsequently, Azano never made another donation through AIRSAM. All of the evidence presented allowed a rational trier of fact to find that Azano knowingly caused the campaigns to make false entries on campaign disclosure forms with the intent to obstruct a potential investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Azano additionally argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of count thirty-three, which involved a $ 100,000 donation from AIRSAM to a Dumanis PAC. While Azano correctly notes that AIRSAM may legally donate to a PAC,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens United v.

We find that the government presented sufficient evidence that Azano put the funds into AIRSAM's account to disguise the donation, much like the straw donations provided by U.S. citizens. The government presented documentation showing that AIRSAM's bank account did not have the funds on May 8, 2012-the date on the check to Dumanis's PAC-to pay the $ 100,000 pledged. The government then presented bank statements showing transfers from Azano's personal bank account ($ 125,000) and from his Mexican company ($ 300,000) into AIRSAM's account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In summation, we hold that an omission satisfies the actus reus element for \u00a7 1519. A reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Singh's omission willfully caused Dumanis's campaign to file false reports, and so we affirm Azano's and Singh's convictions under count thirty-two. Furthermore, a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Azano concealed his identity from these campaigns by recruiting straw donors, and that he willfully caused both campaigns to file false reports. We therefore affirm Azano's convictions under counts five through thirty-six. Finally, finding the evidence insufficient to prove that Singh willfully caused the Filner campaign to file false records, we reverse Appellants' convictions under count thirty-seven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Singh next appeals his conviction for conspiracy, charged in count one. First, he argues that the court failed \"to instruct\n   the jury that evidence of more than one conspiracy was presented to the jury.\" We review de novo whether the jury instructions adequately cover the defendant's theory of the case.\n   <em>\n    Liew\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276848\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/585/#p595\">\n    856 F.3d at 595-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   We find that the following jury instruction adequately covered Singh's multiple conspiracy theory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   [The jury] must decide whether the conspiracy charged in Count 1 of the Indictment existed, and, if it did, who at least some of its members were. If you find that the conspiracy charged did not exist for the charged Count, then you must return a not guilty verdict for that Count, even though you may find that some other conspiracy existed.

It was the jury that had to decide whether a conspiracy or multiple conspiracies existed, and the court's jury instruction adequately presented this theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Singh argues that his only objective was to make money for his social media business, not to influence elections. Yet the jury could reasonably have concluded that Singh's goal was broader. In an email from Dumanis to her campaign staff, she reported that she \"got a call, conference call, from Ernie Encinas, Susumo\n   Azano, and Ravi Singh... [Singh] apparently flew to SD just to talk with Mr. A who wanted him to talk to me!\" In an email between Singh and Encinas, Encinas mentioned, \"[Azano] was upset about the money he said\n   <em>\n    he sent you to form a PAC\n   </em>\n   and do the social media.\" These interactions with Azano suggested that Singh's role was not limited to his social media business, but included generally assisting Azano with the campaigns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Furthermore, the key participants and method of operations remained the same throughout the period of the conspiracy. All co-defendants acted from at least December 2011 to November 2012. Singh spoke with Azano and then flew to San Diego to meet with the Dumanis campaign at the end of December. At the same time, Chase and Hester secured straw donors to contribute to Dumanis's campaign. Just as Chase, Hester, and Encinas concealed Azano's donations to the campaigns, so too Singh concealed Azano's patronage. Once Dumanis lost the primary, all the participants proceeded to support the Filner campaign in much the same way. The jury could reasonably have inferred an overall agreement from the proof of a single goal, or from proof that these key participants and their general operations remained constant throughout the conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   It might be a closer question whether Singh knew, or had reason to know, about the other co-conspirators' participation. The government provided sufficient evidence that Singh knew Azano and Encinas and the role they played in coordinating efforts for the San Diego mayoral race, but there is no direct evidence that Singh knew of the subgroup who obtained straw donors. However, the government did not need to show that Singh \"knew all of the purposes of and all of the participants in the conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kearney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"938148\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/560/1358/#p1362\">\n    560 F.2d 1358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1362 (9th Cir. 1977). Instead, while there may not have been proof of direct knowledge of Hester's, Cortes's, or Chase's contributions, there was proof that Singh benefitted from them, as they all worked towards election of mayoral candidates.

It carves out exceptions\n   for visa holders who are less likely to threaten public safety. Section 922(y)(2), for example, exempts those that come to the United States for hunting or sporting purposes. And, \u00a7 922(y)(3) creates a broad waiver for visa holders who have \"resided in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 180 days\" if they receive a statement of support from their embassy or consulate, and the Attorney General confirms that they do not \"jeopardize the public safety.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (y)(3)(B)(i)-(ii), (C)(ii).

We therefore hold that \u00a7 922(g)(5)(B) survives intermediate scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   We turn next to Azano's claim that his possession of a gun fell within the \"pleasure\" designation in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2041.31\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) or automatically qualified as a \"sporting purpose\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (y)(2).

This interpretive method guides our analysis here. Section 922(g)(5)(B) plainly prohibits firearm possession by B2 visa holders, subject only to limited exceptions clearly spelled out in \u00a7 922(y).

Section 922(g)(5)(B) quite clearly prohibits possession of firearms by all those admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa. Section 922(y)(2) includes an exception to this general rule for nonimmigrant visa holders who visit the United States for lawful hunting or sporting purposes. We interpret \"sporting purposes\" according to the narrow provision that includes it. The exception reasonably implies sporting activities that involve the use of guns, such as target shooting, or trap and skeet shooting. It does not suggest a broader definition including all recreational activities or possession of guns for pleasure. Section 922(y)(2) 's legislative history also supports this interpretation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   [I]f you are someone who has come to the United States for lawful hunting or sporting hunts ... that person is exempt. That person may purchase a gun while here for that purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   144 Cong. Rec. S8641 (daily ed. July 21, 1998) (statement of Sen. Durbin).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   B1/B2 nonimmigrant visa holders do not automatically qualify for \u00a7 922(y)(2) 's exception and, by a plain reading of the statute, are subject to the prohibition on gun possession. Furthermore, \u00a7 922(y)(2) is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to B1/B2 visa holders. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's holdings and Azano's conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(5)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    VI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Finally, Appellants seek our review of the district court's denial of several trial motions. First, Azano argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial based on alleged ineffective assistance of his trial counsel, Michael Wynne. Singh also argues that the district court abused its discretion when denying his motion to sever the trial from co-defendants Cortes and Hester.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \"[W]hen a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is first raised in the district court prior to the judgment of conviction, the district court may, and at times should, consider the claim at that point in the proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Such considerations include \"the existence of evidence already in the record indicating ineffective assistance of counsel,\" \"the scope of the evidentiary hearing that would be required to fully decide the claim,\" and the need to relieve trial counsel, appoint new counsel, or consider the availability of post-conviction counsel if the claim is not heard until then.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790632\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/104/#p113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In denying Azano's motion for a new trial, the district court explained that \"the trial record here is not sufficiently developed to enable the [c]ourt to resolve\n   the multiple and varied ineffective assistance of counsel claims being asserted by Mr. Azano .... Mr. Azano sets forth, by my count, no less than a dozen separate grounds in support of that claim, each of which would have to be considered and evaluated individually.\" The court agreed with the government that there would be \"a long delay in resolving the case, and ... [it] would run afoul of this [c]ourt's duty to promote the interest of justice and judicial economy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The district court did not abuse its discretion. We agree with the court that there are a number of claims at issue even though Azano frames his motion as a single ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We observe, at a minimum, ineffective assistance of counsel claims for failure to proffer a defense, failure to introduce exculpatory evidence, and failure to adequately investigate. To address such claims, the court would have needed to examine counsel's reasons and motivations for taking and not taking certain actions, which would have resulted in a prolonged evidentiary hearing. Additionally, Azano's ability to retain post-conviction representation relieves concerns that the claim may not receive due consideration in a collateral proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Other considerations weigh in Azano's favor. Azano appointed another attorney for post-trial motions, eliminating the district court's need \"to relieve the defendant's attorney, or in any event, to appoint new counsel in order to properly adjudicate the merits of the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790632\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/104/#p113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790632\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/104/#p113\">\n    623 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   113 ). Further, waiting for post-conviction relief may result in some prejudice to Azano by \"weakening of memories and aging of evidence,\" as well as time Azano will be incarcerated waiting for the claims to be heard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 897. Still, given the considerations weighing against Azano, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Azano also requests that we review his ineffective assistance of counsel claim directly on appeal. Generally, we will not entertain ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal because the record is often undeveloped \"as to what counsel did, why it was done, and what, if any, prejudice resulted.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
