In reading the 89-page complaint, this court could find many iterations of possible allegations. As Judge Sutton notes, some of those possible allegations would not permit finding a constitutional violation. Still, others would permit such a finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When considering a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, it is not our job to find the facts. Our job is, and only is, to determine whether any possible allegation plausibly states a claim under which relief can be granted. To decide any other issue would be judicial overreach. To discuss anything further would be an advisory opinion. Both the majority and dissent rushed to articulate a standard before the facts had been fully discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiffs, with whom every opinion expresses sympathy, are entitled to the full benefit of the rule's broad standard. That means that, so long as they have pled plausible allegations that would constitute a constitutional violation, they are entitled to discovery. The 12(b)(6) standard \"does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal [conduct].\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Monasky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519032\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/907/404/#p408\">\n    907 F.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408 (6th Cir. 2018) (en banc).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCURRENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <judges id=\"p-15\">\n   SUTTON, Circuit Judge, concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc.\n  </judges>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   If bad facts run the risk of making bad law, terrible facts run the risk of disfiguring\n   law and silencing it altogether. In their complaint, the plaintiffs in this traumatic case plant the seeds of two potential stories. One speaks of local officials who bungled their response to a water crisis and in the process inadvertently polluted the water supply for the people of Flint, Michigan. The other speaks of local officials who intentionally poisoned Flint's water supply. In each telling, the claimants invoke the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In each telling, the claimants invoke the most far-reaching and the least guide-posted permutation of that guarantee: substantive due process. And in each telling, the claimants seek hundreds of millions of dollars in retroactive money damages for the alleged constitutional violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Each story leads to a different end.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Negligent, even grossly negligent, conduct by local officials does not generally violate citizens' substantive due process rights. Least of all would these actions clearly violate such rights, as there is very little that is clear about substantive due process. If that's what happened here, this litigation needs to end-promptly. It is a distraction to the key goal (fixing Flint's water supply), and it is unfair to the public servants to boot. Their mistakes may deserve public criticism, but they do not deserve the tag of violating clearly established constitutional rights and what comes with it: exposure to crippling monetary judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   But an intentional or reckless effort to poison Flint's water supply is another matter. If that's what happened, the case must proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   So which account is the right account? It's too early to say. At the pleading stage of a case, plaintiffs are entitled to make plausible allegations in their complaint and use the discovery process to ferret out support for their preferred account through depositions, emails, and documents. At this early stage of the case, we must give the benefit of the doubt to the plaintiffs' preferred theory of the case and allow the discovery process to determine whether plausible allegations in their complaint mature into fact-supported allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In view of the starkly different nature of these two accounts and in view of the starkly different outcomes for each of them, I would have written the majority opinion-permitting this case to proceed to discovery-in a different key. At least five features of this unfortunate case warrant a tone of caution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Cautionary feature one. This is a money damages case against public officials in their individual capacities. We do not lightly allow citizens to tap private pockets or the public treasury by suing the public officials that a majority of them selected to handle these jobs. That's why claimants must show that (1) the officials violated their constitutional rights and (2) the officials were on notice of the prohibition because they violated well-established constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    Harlow v.

That is a rigorous standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Cautionary feature two. Even when viewed in its best light, the plaintiffs' claim of unconstitutionality takes us to the outer\n   edges of judicial competence. Unlike claims anchored in the U.S. Constitution's text, substantive due process cases offer little guidance about the reach of our authority, inviting a free-floating inquiry devoid of textual rhyme or reason. That's why we are directed to proceed slowly in this area \"lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of\" any two judges on this court.\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

All of this means that our court and the district court must carefully match allegations to individual defendants to determine whether the plaintiffs can show that each official engaged in conscience-shocking behavior-and clearly established behavior at that. Doubt clouds several aspects of the claims that remain in the case. By the plaintiffs' own account, the defendants relied on independent experts in making the most crucial decisions. How could that conduct show intentional misconduct-intentional poisoning of the people of Flint-given that the officials, aware of their own limitations, sought outside help? That does not sound like intentional or reckless behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A like concern arises from the allegations against individual defendants still in the case. Take Darnell Earley as one example of this problem. He served as Flint's emergency manager from November 2013 until January 12, 2015. The complaint alleges that he \"made the decision to switch to Flint River water,\" R. 1 at 7, then \"forced the transition through\" before Flint's treatment plant was ready in order to keep up with his \"aggressive deadline,\" R. 1 at 21. He also allegedly made false and misleading statements that Flint's water was safe. But the complaint does not allege that he knew those statements were false. It instead says that the government hired an outside engineering firm to make sure the city properly treated the water. Those experts did not recommend that the city set water quality standards or implement corrosion control before using the river's water. And the first report of lead in Flint's drinking water did not come until January 9, 2015. That's only four days before Gerald Ambrose replaced Earley as the emergency manager and around the same time that officials employed a second outside engineering firm to investigate complaints. (That firm also concluded that the water was safe.) I struggle to see how Earley's actions, all consistent with outside experts' advice, rise to the threshold of a clearly established substantive due process violation. The same may be true of other individual defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Cautionary feature five. A similar case already exists in state court. Based on the same events, several individuals filed a putative class action in the Michigan courts against most of the same defendants under the substantive due process guarantee of the Michigan Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mays v.

For that reason, if the underlying state and federal claims in today's case turned on process in its conventional sense, the federal courts presumably would stay their hand to determine what process the State provided. If that approach makes sense in the context of\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   due process, it makes doubly good sense in the context of\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   due process.

Two features of this case offer some support for these decisions-sufficient support to wait and see before granting a petition to review the case as a full court. One reasonable explanation for waiting to review the dispute is the stage of the case-Rule 12(b)(6)-from which these decisions arose. This is not a barebones complaint based on implausible allegations. It comes in at 89 pages. And it offers plenty of details that at least plausibly allege public acts of recklessness and intentional misbehavior. The point of discovery is to allow claimants and the courts to determine whether facts support plausible claims. That opportunity should help us all in resolving this case fairly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A second reasonable explanation for waiting to review this case as a full court is the hard-to-pin-down nature of the clearly established inquiry. The officials, it is true, can be found liable only if this lawsuit falls into the narrow category of cases so egregious, so obvious, that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   reasonable officials\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   have known what they did was wrong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hope v.

What's tricky is figuring out what counts as reckless or intentional behavior-in the context of a clearly established conscience-shocking standard of care. For better or worse, the case law seems to present a sliding scale-the more evidence of unforgiveable intent, the less necessity to identify a case just like this one. That is what seemed to happen in\n   <em>\n    Hope v. Pelzer\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The facts were unique.

Nobody forcibly injects or stomach-pumps or conducts medical experiments upon another person by accident. Yet the claim at issue here, as the plaintiffs themselves make it, indisputably sounds in negligence: that \"Defendants violated Plaintiffs' rights to bodily integrity, insofar as Defendants failed to protect Plaintiffs from\n   <em>\n    a foreseeable risk of harm\n   </em>\n   \"-the classic formulation, as any first-year law student knows, of a negligence claim-from \"exposure to lead contaminated water.\" Compl. \u00b6 384 (emphasis added). And even the majority concedes that \"[t]here is no allegation defendants intended to harm Flint residents.\" Maj. Op. at ----. Thus, the only manner in which the majority's \"examples illustrate the breadth\" of the right to bodily integrity, Maj. Op. at ----, is to show that the right is inapposite here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   What the majority opinion does, in response, is simple: it changes the level of generality at which it describes the putative right, until the description is general enough to reach the plaintiffs' allegations of negligence. Specifically, what the court first describes as a \"constitutional right [of persons] to be free from\n   <em>\n    forcible intrusions on their bodies against their will\n   </em>\n   ,\" Maj. Op. at ---- (emphasis added), on the next page becomes a sweeping right of \"nonconsenting individuals\" to be free of \"foreign substances with no known therapeutic value[,]\" Maj. Op. at ---- -in short, a constitutional right to be free of unwanted\n   substances. That putative right is violated every day, indeed every time that virtually any of us takes a breath. But more to the point, the majority's formulation elides what the prior cases require-namely that the officer's injection or intrusion of the \"foreign substance\" into the plaintiff's body be intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   No official-no matter how blameworthy he might be on moral grounds-can be expected to recognize in advance that a court will recast a legal rule so that it applies to conduct to which it has never applied before. That in part is why the Supreme Court has \"repeatedly stressed that courts must not 'define clearly established law at a high level of generality[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Wesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615996\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/577/#p589\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Plumhoff v.
