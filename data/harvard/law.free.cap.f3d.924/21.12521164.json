Specifically, this case calls upon us to answer two questions of first impression in this Circuit: (1) whether second-degree burglary in violation of North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 14-51 qualifies as a \"violent felony\" under ACCA's \"enumerated clause\"; and (2) whether federal bank robbery in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) qualifies as a \"violent felony\" under ACCA's \"elements clause.\" For the reasons outlined below, we answer these two questions in the affirmative and hold that both statutes are \"violent felonies\" within the ambit of ACCA. We therefore AFFIRM the July 14, 2017 judgment of the district court sentencing Defendant-Appellant Ronald Evans pursuant to ACCA (Richard J.

Evans acknowledged in his written plea agreement that he qualified as an armed career criminal based on three prior violent felony convictions, subjecting him to a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. The district court accordingly sentenced Evans to 180 months' imprisonment on September 25, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 3, 2016 Evans filed a motion in conjunction with a previously filed habeas petition, asserting that his ACCA status had been rendered retroactively invalid under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/#p2556\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which struck down ACCA's residual clause under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. The district court granted Evans's motion, concluding that his prior sentence had indeed been rendered retroactively invalid under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   because one of his three ACCA predicate convictions (for attempted burglary in the third-degree in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20140.20\">\n    N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 140.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) had qualified as a violent felony only under ACCA's voided residual clause. The district court, however, transferred the matter to the original sentencing judge for resentencing, directing the court to consider whether any of Evans's\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   prior convictions could be substituted as ACCA predicates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At a resentencing hearing held on June 16, 2017, the district court determined that among Evans's criminal history at least three offenses qualified as \"violent felonies\" under ACCA, such that Evans continued to face a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years. Appendix (\"A.\") 477-505. First, Evans was convicted in 1982 of federal bank robbery in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202213\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). According to his presentencing report, this conviction occurred after he approached a teller window at a bank branch in Buffalo, New York, and then handed the teller a blue tote bag and a demand note that read, \"I have a gun fill bag.\" Next, in 1983, Evans was convicted of federal armed bank robbery in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). The conduct underlying this conviction involved Evans and two co-conspirators entering a bank in Buffalo wearing ski masks and armed with a pistol and a shotgun, yelling \"Everyone get down, this is a hold up!\" Finally, Evans was convicted in 2001 in North Carolina of\n   second-degree burglary in violation of N.C. Gen Stat. \u00a7 14-51. According to his presentencing report, this conviction occurred after he and an accomplice broke into a home, confined and restrained the victims therein, hit one victim with a hand gun and proceeded to steal property with a combined value of $ 30,000. The district court determined that the first two offenses qualified categorically as violent felonies under ACCA's elements clause, and that the final offense qualified categorically as a violent felony under ACCA's enumerated clause. Accordingly, the district court re-sentenced Evans to 180 months' imprisonment, the same sentence as was originally imposed.
