We address the petitioner's other arguments in a concurrently filed memorandum disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Denys Honcharov is a Ukrainian national who was admitted to the United States in 2004 on a five-month visa. After the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings in 2009, Honcharov conceded removability but requested asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture protection. An immigration judge (IJ) held a hearing on Honcharov's claims and asked Honcharov what social group he was a member of that led to his persecution. Honcharov responded \"Ukrainian businessmen\" and \"witness victim to crime.\" The IJ denied all relief after determining that these groups did not qualify as \"particular social groups\" within the meaning of the asylum statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Honcharov appealed to the Board, now claiming that he was a member of three new particular social groups: \"Ukrainian businesses targeted for and subject to extortion who thereafter refuse to cooperate,\" \"Ukrainian businessmen subject to extortion by gangs the government is unwilling or unable to control,\" and \"victim witnesses to criminal enterprises which the government is unwilling or unable to control.\" The Board declined to consider these particular social groups because they were raised for the first time on appeal. Honcharov then timely petitioned this court for review, arguing that the Board erred by failing to consider his proposed particular social groups. We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we deny the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Waiver and forfeiture are an important part of any adjudicative system, whether judicial or administrative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   These doctrines \"preserve the integrity of the appellate structure\" by ensuring that \"an issue must be presented to, considered and decided by the trial court before it can be raised on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Torres de la Cruz v.

Particularly when the issue requires resolving disputed facts, such presentation is crucial because it allows\n   the adjudicator with the best understanding of the case to make an initial determination, make the necessary findings, and conduct any additional proceedings necessary to reach a fair and just result. Waiver and forfeiture also encourage the orderly litigation and settlement of claims by preventing parties from withholding \"secondary, back-up theories\" at the trial court level, thus allowing party-opponents to appraise frankly the claims and issues at hand and respond appropriately.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641952\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/104/1229/#p1233\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Waiver and forfeiture are thus important tools for preserving the structure of hierarchical court systems by allowing appellate courts to act as courts of \"review, not first view.\"\n   <em>\n    Maronyan v.

The Board also has the authority to prescribe procedural rules that govern the proceedings before it, and procedural default rules are consistent with this authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4) ;\n   <em>\n    Pinos-Gonzalez v.
