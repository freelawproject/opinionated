GSK had previously designated some of these documents as confidential and contended that they should remain so on appeal; the plans disagreed. That led GSK to ask the District Court, on two occasions and pursuant to the applicable protective order, to maintain the confidentiality of certain documents. The plans opposed these requests, arguing that the common law right of access and the\n   First Amendment right of public access required the unsealing of the documents. The District Court largely sided with GSK, refusing to unseal most of the documents. The plans have appealed the District Court's two post-judgment sealing orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We conclude that the District Court failed to apply the proper legal standard for the common law right of access, which requires as a starting point the application of a presumption of public access.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of Am.

By applying, instead, our standard for a protective order under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26, the able District Judge incorrectly placed a burden on the plans to show an interest in disclosure-rather than on GSK to justify continued sealing. We will therefore vacate and remand to allow the District Court to consider GSK's motions for continued confidentiality under the appropriate standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   GSK manufactures, markets, and sells Avandia, a drug indicated to treat Type II diabetes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re Avandia Mktg., Sales Prac. &amp; Prod.

The plans contend that GSK concealed evidence of Avandia's cardiovascular risk and, instead, promoted Avandia as providing cardiovascular benefits. According to the plans, this marketing strategy was false and misleading because GSK's own studies showed that Avandia increased certain markers of cardiovascular risk. The plans assert that, for years, GSK buried bad study results, misrepresented the truth about Avandia's cardiovascular profile to doctors and pharmacy benefit managers, and reaped billions of dollars in profits. In 2007, an independent researcher published an article in the\n   <em>\n    New England Journal of Medicine\n   </em>\n   claiming that Avandia increased the risk of heart attack and cardiovascular disease.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356670\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/633/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; App. 1064. Lawsuits ensued, the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") investigated, and even the United States Senate Finance Committee released a report revealing GSK's misdeeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 21, 2010, in the midst of heightened regulatory and public scrutiny of Avandia, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776 and Participating Employers Health and Welfare Fund (\"UFCW\") filed suit against GSK in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. UFCW alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), as well as various state consumer protection laws. J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (\"J.B. Hunt\") filed a complaint containing similar claims on June 20, 2011. Both UFCW and J.B. Hunt (collectively referred to as \"the plans\") filed suit on behalf of a proposed class of United States health benefit providers that had purchased Avandia. These third-party payor cases became part of a multi-district litigation (\"MDL\"), which also included\n   consumer and personal injury cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of the MDL, the cases were governed by a protective order, PTO 10, which covered discovery of confidential materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In November 2010, GSK moved to dismiss the plans' complaints, arguing that the plans lacked standing to bring RICO claims. In October 2013, the District Court denied that motion; it later certified its decision for interlocutory appeal. We granted permission to appeal and, in October 2015, affirmed the District Court's denial of GSK's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Avandia I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356670\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/633/#p635\">\n    804 F.3d at 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Less than a year later, GSK moved for summary judgment as to the plans' consumer protection claims on federal preemption grounds. GSK also contended that the plans' RICO claims should be dismissed for failing to identify a distinct RICO enterprise. In the course of briefing GSK's motion for summary judgment, the parties filed documents under seal pursuant to PTO 10. At that time, neither party raised any issue as to the confidentiality of the sealed exhibits. On December 7, 2017, the District Court granted GSK's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the plans appealed the District Court's summary judgment ruling, GSK indicated that it wanted to maintain the confidentiality of certain sealed documents that had been filed in connection with the summary judgment motion. GSK therefore moved in the District Court to keep some of the summary judgment records under seal. On May 31, 2018, the District Court granted in part and denied in part GSK's motion (the \"May Sealing Order\"). App. 2459. The Court unsealed its own summary judgment opinion but maintained the confidentiality of the remainder of the documents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356670\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/633/#p635\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A few weeks later, GSK again moved to maintain under seal additional summary judgment records.

But we apply the more rigorous common law right of access when discovery materials are filed as court documents. In addition to recognizing fewer reasons to justify the sealing of court records, the public right of access-unlike a Rule 26 inquiry-begins with a presumption in favor of public access.\n   <em>\n    Goldstein v.

Unlike the Rule 26 standard, the common law right of access begins with a thumb on the scale in favor of openness-the strong presumption of public access.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pansy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511723\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/772/#p783\">\n    23 F.3d at 780-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the common law right of access doctrine and recognizing the presumption of access),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511723\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/772/#p783\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511723\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/772/#p783\">\n    at 783-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the standard applicable to protective orders and enumerating the\n   <em>\n    Pansy\n   </em>\n   factors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, some of the\n   <em>\n    Pansy\n   </em>\n   factors are incompatible with our case law on the common law right of access.

It failed, however, to acknowledge the presumption of public accessibility.

This analysis gave insufficient weight to the public's interest in openness. Consideration of the public's right of access must be the starting point, not just one of multiple factors. The scale is tipped at the outset in favor of access. And the right of access is not a mere formality-it \"promotes public confidence in the judicial system\"; \"diminishes possibilities for injustice, incompetence, perjury, and fraud\"; and \"provide[s] the public with a more complete understanding of the judicial system and a better perception of its fairness.\"\n   <em>\n    Littlejohn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11350846\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/851/673/#p678\">\n    851 F.2d at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These interests are particularly important in a case such as this one, which implicates the public's trust in a well-known and (formerly) widely-used drug. By giving insufficient weight to the public's strong interest in the openness of judicial records, the District Court erred as a matter of law in applying the common law right of access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The District Court also erred by not conducting a document-by-document review, instead analyzing sixty-five disputed documents in a single paragraph contained in a footnote.

This declaration, the Walker Declaration, contains broad, vague, and conclusory allegations of harm that are, standing alone, insufficient to overcome the presumption of public access.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, the Walker Declaration claims that disclosure of\n   GSK's old research strategies \"would still aid competitors in developing research strategies and\n   <em>\n    could be used\n   </em>\n   to harm GSK's relationship with patients and physicians.\" S.A. 1956, \u00b6 31 (emphasis added). The Walker Declaration does not explain, however, how twenty-year-old research strategies could assist current competitors or harm GSK's current relationships with patients and physicians.

For example, the District Court discussed the \"harm to [GSK's] competitive standing, to its commercial reputation, and to its relationships with physicians and patients.\" App. 2461 n.1.

While I agree with the majority that this case should be remanded for the District Court to apply the appropriate standard under the common law right of access, such a holding is not\n   <em>\n    dispositive\n   </em>\n   : we cannot be certain that \"the common law right affords sufficient protection\" in this case because the District Court will make that determination on a document-by-document basis on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The majority appears to acknowledge that our holding is not a final determination on the merits of this matter insofar as the majority recognizes that this litigation will continue, and the Court subsequently will be required to address the First Amendment issues, if the District Court finds on remand that certain of the sealed documents merit continued confidentiality under the more lenient common law right of access standard. In such an event, as one of our sister circuits has recognized, \"[e]ach passing day\" between the District Court's decision to maintain the confidentiality of a sealed document and this Court's eventual adjudication of the First Amendment issues \"may constitute a separate and cognizable infringement of the First Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Lugosch v.

Thus, given the possibility that our present avoidance of the First Amendment issues may result in a potentially continual constitutional violation if, on remand, the District Court does not unseal particular documents, our holding cannot be fairly characterized as \"dispositive.\" For that reason, we should address the First Amendment issues raised by the plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The cases cited by the majority-in which this Court utilized only the common law right of access standard, rather than the more rigorous First Amendment standard-do not persuade me otherwise.

Statistical analysis performed by the Federal Judicial Center supports these commentators' claims and confirms that district courts are granting motions for summary judgment more frequently: between 1975 and 2000, \"the rate of cases with [summary judgment] motions granted in whole or in part, and the rate at which cases were terminated by summary judgment, doubled.\" Joe S.

In light of the contemporary trend toward disposing of civil cases through summary judgment, the public should have a qualified right to view the documents submitted by parties in connection with motions for summary judgment.

The public can only have confidence in the propriety of summary judgment procedure-which plays an increasingly important role in civil litigation-if the documents that form the bases of district courts' decisions to grant summary judgment are open for review and inspection, rather than shielded from public scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In sum, I respectfully disagree with the majority's application of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, which should only be invoked by a federal court when the court can decide a case on a \"\n   <em>\n    dispositive\n   </em>\n   nonconstitutional ground.\"\n   <em>\n    Hagans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178436\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/528/#p547\">\n    415 U.S. at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178436\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/528/#p547\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The doctrine of constitutional avoidance is prudential in nature, yet its invocation in this case may lead to the imprudent result of piecemeal litigation while constitutional rights potentially are being violated on a continual basis. Therefore, it is not only appropriate, but also\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   , for the Court to address the First Amendment issues raised by the plans at this juncture, and I would resolve the First Amendment issues in favor of transparency and broader public access to the federal courts.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    As an ancillary matter, GSK's argument regarding the plans' lack of \"standing\" is something of a misnomer. This is not a case in which a named plaintiff failed to demonstrate Article III standing to bring the substantive claim in a complaint on behalf of a putative class; it is undisputed that the District Court has jurisdiction over the underlying matter. Rather, this appeal arises out of the District Court's grant of two motions filed by GSK in the underlying matter to preserve the confidentiality of the documents submitted in connection with its motion for summary judgment. The plans opposed both of these motions and, either explicitly or through citation to case law, raised (and, consequently, preserved) arguments with respect to the First Amendment right of public access. The plans-as the named plaintiffs in a putative class action-are required to \"fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4), in order \"to ensure that absentees' interests are fully pursued,\"\n    <em>\n     Georgine v. Amchem Prods., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644335\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/610/#p630\">\n     83 F.3d 610\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 630 (3d Cir. 1996). The obligation to protect the interests of the class undoubtedly extends to opposing motions-and appealing orders-that adversely affect the interests of absentee class members, whose interests are at issue in a \"peculiar\" way when litigation centers on the right of access.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cendant\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9496651\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/183/#p192\">\n     260 F.3d at 194\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that the \"right of access should be applied ... with particular strictness\" due to \"the peculiar posture of class actions whereby some members of the public are also parties to the class action\"). To accept GSK's argument that the plans do not have \"standing\" to raise issues with respect to the First Amendment rights of absentee putative class members-who received notice of neither GSK's motions nor the District Court's orders and whose rights are peculiarly at issue-would be to contravene both the letter and spirit of Rule 23.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
