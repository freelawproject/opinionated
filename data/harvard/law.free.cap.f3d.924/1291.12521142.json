His theory is that neither bank robbery nor carjacking is a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), because the definition of \"crime of violence\" in that subsection is unconstitutionally vague, so he was not properly convicted of using a firearm during a crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The definition of \"crime of violence\" in \u00a7 924(c)(3) includes both a \"force clause\" and a \"residual clause.\" The \"residual clause\" encompasses a felony offense \"that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(B).\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   held that a different residual clause in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) was unconstitutionally vague, and Estell's post-conviction motion urged that the logic of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   compelled the same conclusion under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). He also asserted that the bank robbery and carjacking offenses did not qualify as crimes of violence under the force clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), so the alleged unconstitutionality of the residual clause made his convictions invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The district court denied Estell's motion based on\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court granted a certificate of appealability, and Estell argues on appeal that\n   <em>\n    Prickett\n   </em>\n   is both wrong and superseded by intervening authority.

The Supreme Court is now considering the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Davis\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-431 (argued Apr. 17, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The government responds that even if the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutionally vague, Estell's bank robbery and carjacking qualify as crimes of violence under the force clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). An offense qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under that clause if it is a felony and \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A). Bank robbery and carjacking both have as an element the use or threatened use of physical force, because each offense must be committed either \"by force and violence\" or \"by intimidation,\" which means the threat of force.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), 2119;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We have thus said in prior decisions that each of Estell's underlying offenses is a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354118\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/894/#p894\">\n    836 F.3d 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 894 (8th Cir. 2016) (bank robbery);\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mathijssen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1095684\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/406/496/#p500\">\n    406 F.3d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 500 (8th Cir. 2005) (carjacking);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525049\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/34/596/#p601\">\n    34 F.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601-02 (8th Cir. 1994) (carjacking).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Estell argues nonetheless that his offenses do not categorically require the use or threatened use of force because the \"intimidation\" element in the bank robbery statute may be met through a defendant's reckless or negligent conduct. He also contends that bank robbery does not require \"violent physical force,\" because intimidation occurs when a person \"reasonably could infer a threat of bodily harm from the defendant's acts,\" and \"it is possible to cause bodily injury without employing violent physical force.\" He asserts that the intimidation element in the carjacking statute likewise disqualifies that offense as a categorical crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Estell's arguments are foreclosed by the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    United States v. Harper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265762\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/624/\">\n    869 F.3d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2017). There, we explained that even though bank robbery by intimidation does not require a specific intent to intimidate,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Yockel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9327577\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/818/#p824\">\n    320 F.3d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 824 (8th Cir. 2003), it still constitutes a threat of physical force because \" 'threat,' as commonly defined, 'speak[s] to what the statement conveys-not to the mental state of the author.' \"\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265762\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/624/\">\n    869 F.3d at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Elonis v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589931\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2001/#p2008\">\n    135 S. Ct. 2001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2008,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589931\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2001/#p2008\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ). Thus, if the government establishes that a defendant committed bank robbery by intimidation, it follows that the defendant threatened a use of force causing bodily harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yockel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9327577\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/818/#p824\">\n    320 F.3d at 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And \"[a] threat of bodily harm requires a threat to use violent force because 'it is impossible to cause bodily injury without using force capable of producing that result.' \"\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265762\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/624/\">\n    869 F.3d at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Winston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177827\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/876/#p878\">\n    845 F.3d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 878 (8th Cir. 2017) ). The same goes for carjacking by intimidation. We therefore conclude that Estell's underlying offenses of bank robbery and carjacking qualify as crimes of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). His convictions and sentences under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) for using a firearm during and in relation to those crimes are not unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The Honorable Susan O.
