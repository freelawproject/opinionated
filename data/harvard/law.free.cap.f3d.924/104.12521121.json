Indeed, much of the key incident is captured on soundless video footage, which we have reviewed carefully. Except where we attribute an allegation to a particular party, the following account is not contested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The use of force in question occurred in 2013, when Altony Brooks was serving a prison sentence with the South Carolina Department of Corrections. On September 17 of that year, Brooks was transported to the Hill-Finklea Detention Center for a one-night stay, so that he could attend a nearby court appearance the next morning. From the time of his arrival, Detention Center officers reported, Brooks was \"very disrespectful[ ] and uncooperative,\" \"continuously threaten[ing] to sue the officers for anything he didn't like.\" J.A. 681-82 (contemporaneous incident report filed by corrections officer) (\"Incident Report\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Detention Center policy requires that an identification photograph be taken whenever an inmate enters the facility. According to corrections officers, Brooks would not cooperate with their efforts to photograph him when he began his stay on September 17. The officers tried a second time the following afternoon, before Brooks's scheduled return to his permanent correctional facility. Brooks once again refused to cooperate, and the result was the episode at issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This time, instead of forgoing the picture, Detention Center officers escorted Brooks to the booking area that housed the photography equipment. From this point on, Brooks was in handcuffs and held by two or more officers while additional officers closely flanked him; the total number of officers on the scene grew from five to six as events unfolded. According to the officers, this did not stop Brooks from using \"aggressive\" language and verbally threatening at least some of those present.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 689 (affidavit of defendant Captain Jacumin) (\"Jacumin Affidavit\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Incident Report, J.A. 681 (describing Brooks as \"making threats to the officers\"). Brooks denies threatening the officers, but his own account includes what could be described as \"aggressive\" verbal resistance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 28 (\"I advised that I was sovereign and I'm not taking any pictures. ... I stated ... that I was already false[ly] imprisoned and I'm not giving them no picture.\"). The soundless video cannot resolve inconsistencies on this point, and so we take the view more favorable to Brooks, as the party opposing summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henry v. Purnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759662\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/524/#p527\">\n    652 F.3d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 (4th Cir. 2011) (en banc).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The start of the video shows a substantial period of time - roughly seven and a half minutes - during which the officers appear to be \"attempting to convince [Brooks] to let them take his picture,\"\n   <em>\n    Brooks v. Jacumin\n   </em>\n   , No. 9:15-cv-2677-PMD-BM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203307648\">\n    2017 WL 3307648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D.S.C. Aug. 3, 2017), consistent with the officers' own account,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Incident Report, J.A. 681 (referring to \"several minutes of trying to reason with inmate Brooks\"). But as the district court explains, it is clear from the video that Brooks continues to resist having his photograph taken, by \"moving his head repeatedly to prevent a clear picture.\"\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203307648\">\n    2017 WL 3307648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. This, too, is roughly consistent with the accounts of both Brooks and the officers involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, J.A. 28 (\"I refused and turned my head repeatedly\"); Jacumin Affidavit, J.A. 688 (\"Brooks refused to allow [the officers] to take his\n   picture by bending over out of the camera view and hiding his face.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After this seven-and-a-half-minute period, the video shows one of the officers - Sergeant Sheila Johnston - pointing a taser gun at Brooks while two other officers hold Brooks in place. Though the record does not establish precisely what Johnston said, the parties agree, in substance, that Johnston warned Brooks that she would deploy the taser if he did not cooperate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, J.A. 28 (\"if you move again I'll taze you\"); Jacumin Affidavit, J.A. 689 (\"Johnston warned [Brooks] that she would tase him if he did not stop.\"). Approximately ten seconds later, when Brooks continued to move around, Johnston deployed the taser for the first time, hitting Brooks in the leg. As the district court describes, Brooks \"fell to the ground, writhed and kicked for approximately five seconds, and ultimately laid still.\"\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203307648\">\n    2017 WL 3307648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While lying on the ground, Brooks was well outside the camera's frame, so his photograph could not be taken. Roughly 16 seconds after the first shock, while Brooks remained on the ground with two officers standing over him, Johnston deployed the taser for the second time. On the video, Brooks appears to thrash in pain. Two officers then brought Brooks to his feet, so that his head again was in camera range, and the officers tried once more to take his photograph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Brooks, held by the officers, continued to move instead of holding still for the camera, though the parties dispute whether Brooks's movements were continued resistance,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Incident Report, J.A. 682 (Brooks \"continued to ... struggle with the officers\"), or an involuntary response to the two taser shocks already administered,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Complaint, J.A. 29 (Brooks \"tried to stay still\"). Approximately 45 seconds after Brooks was pulled upright by the officers, Johnston deployed her taser for the third time. This time, the officers caught Brooks as he fell. The video concludes shortly thereafter, but the parties agree that the officers then were able to take Brooks's photograph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Brooks alleges that he has experienced knee pain ever since the incident, and an MRI taken two years later revealed a kneecap irregularity and a possibly torn meniscus that he attributes to the use of force against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Brooks, proceeding pro se - that is, without the assistance of counsel - filed a complaint under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Johnston and several other officers present during the incident. As relevant here, Brooks alleged that the corrections officers used excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits the infliction of \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" U.S. Const. amend. VIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Two procedural issues arose in the early stages of Brooks's case. First, several months after Brooks filed his complaint, the district court dismissed Sergeant Johnston - the officer who deployed the taser - as a defendant in the case because Brooks had not properly served her during the 120-day period allowed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brooks's complaint had misidentified Johnston, who is a sergeant, as a lieutenant, and misspelled her name as \"Johnson,\" dropping the \"t.\" As a result, the United States Marshals Service, which often effects service on behalf of prisoners like Brooks,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), was unable to serve process on Johnston. Brooks made multiple efforts to advise the Marshals and the court of his initial error in identifying Johnston, sending the Marshals a letter with a corrected name and title and advising the court that he had run out of service forms and needed its assistance. A magistrate judge nevertheless recommended dismissing Johnston from the case, and the district court adopted that recommendation, finding that Brooks had not shown \"good cause\" for his failure to serve Johnston. J.A. 449.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Johnston's dismissal left just two corrections officers as the defendants for Brooks's Eighth Amendment claim: Captain Kris Jacumin and Officer Selisa Fludd, who were present during the incident but did not themselves deploy the taser.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The case proceeded to discovery, at which point the second preliminary issue arose: a dispute over production of the Detention Center's use-of-force policies. When Brooks requested copies of those policies, the defendants objected, arguing that production would raise security concerns. The magistrate judge denied Brooks's motion to compel, noting only that the court \"does not generally order production of restricted policies to inmates.\" J.A. 379.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After discovery closed, officers Jacumin and Fludd moved for summary judgment. Because they had not operated the taser, they could be held liable, if at all, only under a theory of bystander liability, which permits relief against an officer who \"(1) is confronted with a fellow officer's illegal act, (2) possesses the power to prevent it, and (3) chooses not to act,\"\n   <em>\n    Randall v. Prince George's Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11435651\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/302/188/#p203\">\n    302 F.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203 (4th Cir. 2002) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203307648\">\n    2017 WL 3307648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. The officers' argument, however, did not focus on their bystander status. Instead, they argued that Brooks's claim failed under the first prong of the bystander-liability test because Johnston - who\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   deployed the taser - had not acted unlawfully in doing so. According to the officers, multiple taser shocks were a proportionate response to Brooks's admitted and persistent refusal to \"comply with the simple order to stand still and face the camera,\" and thus administered in a \"good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline\" rather than maliciously to inflict pain. J.A. 656-57. In the alternative, the officers invoked qualified immunity: Even if Brooks's Eighth Amendment rights had been violated by the malicious use of force, they contended, the law was not so clearly established that they would have been on notice as to that violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The district court granted the officers' motion for summary judgment, finding that the record facts, viewed in the light most favorable to Brooks, failed as a matter of law to establish an Eighth Amendment violation.\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203307648\">\n    2017 WL 3307648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4. As the court recognized, the critical Eighth Amendment question was\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   Johnston had shocked Brooks three times using a taser: Was it in a good faith effort to secure his cooperation to take his picture, or maliciously and for the purpose of causing pain?\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203307648\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Whitley v.

This was not a case, the court understood, in which the officers had used force in order to protect against an immediate threat to safety; handcuffed and surrounded by up to six officers, Brooks posed no physical safety risk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. But corrections officers also are entitled to use appropriate force to \"maintain or restore discipline,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Whitley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202378\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/312/#p320\">\n    475 U.S. at 320-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202378\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/312/#p320\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and here, the court concluded, the record facts established beyond dispute that the reason for the multiple taser shocks was simply \"to acquire [Brooks's] compliance with [the Detention Center's] picture policy,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court did not doubt that the taser shocks were painful to Brooks and constituted a serious use of force. But on Brooks's own account, the court explained, he \"was refusing to obey the ... officers' commands that he allow them to take his picture,\" and the video likewise shows him \"refusing to comply\" and instead \"moving his head repeatedly to prevent a clear picture.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-3. Moreover, the court emphasized, the officers can be seen on the video attempting for over seven minutes to \"convince [Brooks] to allow his photograph to be taken,\" and resorted to violent force only after that \"extended attempt to reason with him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Given those undisputed facts, the court concluded, there was no \"jury question as to excessive force\" under\n   <em>\n    Whitley\n   </em>\n   's subjective standard: As a matter of law, the officers used force not maliciously but to compel compliance with the Detention Center's photograph policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And because no constitutional violation had occurred, the bystander officers could not be held liable, and there was no need to reach the question of qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Now represented by pro bono appellate counsel, Brooks advances several arguments on appeal. First and foremost, he argues that because there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the officers used force against him maliciously rather than in a good faith effort to secure his cooperation, the district court erred by granting summary judgment to the defendants. Second, Brooks contends that the district court should not have dismissed Johnston from the case because he demonstrated \"good cause\" for his failure to serve her within the 120-day period. And third, Brooks argues that the magistrate judge improperly denied his motion to compel production of the Detention Center's use-of-force policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We agree with Brooks in all three respects. We begin with the main issue on appeal - Brooks's challenge to the grant of summary judgment - and conclude that whether Brooks was shocked by a taser three times in order to induce his compliance or as punishment for his continued resistance and belligerence is a jury question that was improperly decided by the district court as a matter of law. We then turn to Brooks's additional arguments for relief, and direct the district court, on remand, to allow Brooks additional time to serve Johnston and to compel the production of relevant Detention Center use-of-force policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We start with the district court's summary judgment ruling. \"Whether a party is entitled to summary judgment is a question of law we review de novo using the same standard applied by the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Henry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759662\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/524/#p527\">\n    652 F.3d at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, we \"recogniz[e] that a court should grant summary judgment only if, taking the facts in the best light for the nonmoving party, no material facts are disputed and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Ausherman v. Bank of Am. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9298332\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/352/896/#p899\">\n    352 F.3d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 899 (4th Cir. 2003). So here, we review the facts, including the video footage of the episode, in the light most favorable to Brooks, drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. If those facts are enough to generate a genuine dispute as to why Johnston used force against him, then summary judgment may not be granted under the\n   first prong of the test for bystander liability. \"A dispute is genuine if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for [Brooks as] the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacobs v. N.C. Admin. Office of the Courts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073945\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/562/#p568\">\n    780 F.3d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568 (4th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The officers advance two alternative arguments for why summary judgment was properly granted, paralleling their arguments before the district court. First, they contend, the district court correctly held that it was beyond genuine dispute that Johnston had used the taser in good faith, and so had not violated the Eighth Amendment. And because there was no underlying constitutional violation by Johnston, they conclude, they may not be held liable as bystanders. Second, the officers argue that even if the district court erred in this assessment, they nevertheless are protected by qualified immunity because any Eighth Amendment violation was not clearly established at the time of the incident. We disagree with both arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We begin with the question at the heart of this case: whether, as the district court held, the record indisputably shows that the use of three taser shocks against Brooks was a \"good faith effort\" to induce his cooperation in having his picture taken, and thus constitutionally permissible under the Eighth Amendment's subjective standard; or whether, as Brooks argues, there is a genuine dispute of fact on that point that must be resolved by a jury. As we explain below, we agree with Brooks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   An inmate's Eighth Amendment excessive force claim involves both an objective and a subjective component. The objective component asks whether the force applied was sufficiently serious to establish a cause of action.

The defendants, consistent with this authority, maintain that they were on the right side of\n   <em>\n    Whitley\n   </em>\n   's subjective inquiry, and that Johnston deployed her taser three times only in a good faith effort to compel Brooks's obedience with the order to stand still for a photograph. Brooks offers a different account, emphasizing the Incident Report's references to his \"disrespectful\" and \"uncooperative\" attitude from the time of his arrival at the Detention Center, J.A. 681, and maintaining that the defendants used the taser to \"wantonly punish[ ]\" him,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641618\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/756/#p761\">\n    77 F.3d at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for his belligerent resistance. Considering the facts in the light most favorable to Brooks and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, as we must, we think a reasonable jury could agree with Brooks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First and foremost is the fact that Brooks was shocked with a taser not once but three times, and in quick succession. We have held that even where an initial use of force does not by itself raise questions about a corrections officer's intent under\n   <em>\n    Whitley\n   </em>\n   , the continued application of force may give rise to an inference that force was used for malicious or punitive purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5896808\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/225/#p239\">\n    535 F.3d at 239-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 n.11 (though initial use of pepper spray to carry out cell extraction appeared warranted, four additional bursts of pepper spray - including one when inmate was lying on floor - gave rise to reasonable inference that force was applied maliciously). The same is true here. We may assume for the moment that by itself, the first deployment of the taser - while Brooks was standing and refusing to hold still for a picture - does not suggest anything other than a \"good faith effort\" to restore discipline. But coupled with the next two deployments - one 16 seconds later, while Brooks was lying on the ground; the next less than a minute after that, after officers pulled Brooks back to his feet - the picture changes, and a reasonable jury could begin to question whether the entire series of taser shocks in fact was intended to punish Brooks, through the wanton infliction of pain, for his noncompliance and verbal aggression.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641618\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/756/#p761\">\n    77 F.3d at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the infliction of continued pain after initial use of force supports an inference of impermissible punitive motive under\n   <em>\n    Whitley\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A jury might find that the second use of the taser, in particular, is hard to square with the officers' account. According to the officers, that second shock - which came 16 seconds after the first, and after Brooks had fallen, \"writhed and kicked,\" and then \"laid still,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203307648\">\n    2017 WL 3307648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 - was intended to induce Brooks to hold still for a photograph. But at that point, Brooks was lying on the ground, making it impossible for him to put his head into camera range. And 16 seconds, at least some portion of which appears to have been spent in excruciating pain, does not give a recalcitrant inmate much time to reconsider and mend his ways.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Austin v.

But Brooks denies that, and the district court viewed it differently,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203307648\">\n    2017 WL 3307648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (describing Brooks as lying \"still\" on the floor when he was shocked the second time). At a minimum, it is fair to say that the video footage does not clearly support the officers' account, and so, at the summary judgment stage, we take the facts in the light more favorable to Brooks (and as described by the district court). Similarly, we cannot assume, as the officers assert, that Brooks continued to move around after he was brought to his feet and before the third taser shock because he had decided to maintain his resistance. Again, Brooks offers a contrary account, denying that he was resisting at that point and describing his shaking as an involuntary response to having sustained two taser shocks in under a minute. And again, a jury reasonably could question whether the 45 seconds that elapsed after Brooks was pulled to his feet and before he was shocked - for the third time in 70 seconds - gave Brooks the time and ability to collect himself and signal a decision as to whether he would comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, whether or not the first use of the taser, standing alone, would give rise to any inference of malice, a reasonable jury viewing the three shocks together - three uses of an instrument designed to inflict excruciating pain in under 70 seconds - could infer \"wantonness in the infliction of pain,\" intended not to restore order and induce compliance, but to punish Brooks for his belligerence.\n   <em>\n    Iko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5896808\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/225/#p239\">\n    535 F.3d at 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Whitley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202378\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/312/#p320\">\n    475 U.S. at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202378\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/312/#p320\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steffen v.

According to Brooks - who denies making violent threats, but whose own account otherwise is consistent with the officers' complaints - a reasonable jury could infer that the officers' use of force was motivated at least in part by their anger at those repeated provocations. And indeed, we held in\n   <em>\n    Orem\n   </em>\n   that that use of a taser against a detainee just after she \"forcefully stated 'fuck you' \" to an officer could support an inference under\n   <em>\n    Whitley\n   </em>\n   that force was used not to restore order,\n   but \"for the very purpose of harming and embarrassing\" the detainee in response.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784171\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/442/#p446\">\n    523 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   447 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sawyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3631355\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/537/283/\">\n    537 F.

We do not doubt that the officers would have been enormously and justifiably frustrated by Brooks's persistent intransigence in the face of their efforts.

Accordingly, the defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds on this basis, as they argue in the alternative on appeal. We therefore vacate the district court's grant of summary judgment for the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We turn now to Brooks's other arguments on appeal, starting with his contention that he demonstrated good cause for his failure to timely effect service on Johnston. We agree, and therefore vacate the dismissal of Johnston from the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m) allows the court to dismiss any defendant who is not served within the applicable timeframe. Generally, \"[a]s with other procedural dismissals, we review a dismissal under Rule 4(m) for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Attkisson v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520592\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/919/789/#p809\">\n    919 F.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 809 (4th Cir. 2019). But importantly, the rule makes clear that \"if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   extend the time for service for an appropriate period.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) (emphasis added). Accordingly, a court abuses its discretion if the plaintiff makes a clear showing of good cause and the court nonetheless declines to grant an extension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   That is what happened here. As many of our sister circuits have held, when a plaintiff in an\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   action, like Brooks, provides the Marshals with the correct information to serve the defendant,\n   a subsequent failure to effect service upon that defendant constitutes \"good cause\" for an extension.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rance v. Rocksolid Granit USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5757345\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/583/1284/#p1287\">\n    583 F.3d 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1287 (11th Cir. 2009) (collecting cases). The defendants here do not dispute that Brooks ultimately provided the Marshals with the information required to serve Johnston. Instead, they argue that Brooks's efforts were inadequate because the information was belated and not on the proper form. Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that those facts do not negate the establishment of \"good cause\" for an extension under Rule 4(m).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   First, Brooks made multiple attempts during the 120-day service window to advise the Marshals and the district court of Johnston's service information, including her correct name and title. He also informed the district court that he had run out of the proper forms, and asked for the court's assistance. We think those efforts to comply with the service rules are consistent with a finding of \"good cause.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Himmelreich v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3423196\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/285/5/#p7\">\n    285 F. App'x 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7 (3d Cir. 2008) (finding that plaintiff demonstrated \"good cause\" under Rule 4(m), despite failing to submit the proper form to the Marshals, when he did not receive Service of Process forms and made substantial attempts to comply with the service rules).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Second, we note that Johnston does not point to any prejudice from a delay in effecting service on her. Nor does it seem that she could. Johnston was represented by the same attorneys as her co-defendants, who filed a notice of appearance on her behalf; she presumably was fully aware of the case as it proceeded. Indeed, through counsel, Johnston was able to advise the district court, during the service window, that Brooks's complaint misspelled her name and misidentified her title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Accordingly, we find that Brooks has established good cause for his failure to effect timely service and that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing Johnston under Rule 4(m). We therefore vacate Johnston's dismissal from the case and instruct the district court, on remand, to allow Brooks additional time in which to serve Johnston.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, and for the purpose of clarifying what evidence will enter the record as this case proceeds, we address Brooks's third argument: that the magistrate judge erred by failing to compel production in discovery of the Detention Center's use-of-force policies. We agree that Brooks was entitled to those documents, and therefore instruct the that their production be compelled on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We recognize, of course, that this court \"affords a district court substantial discretion in managing discovery and reviews the denial or granting of a motion to compel discovery for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon, Inc. v. Alpha of Va., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11312710\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/43/922/#p929\">\n    43 F.3d 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 929 (4th Cir. 1995). But that discretion is not boundless, and a district court or magistrate judge may abuse its discretion when it denies a motion to compel production of non-privileged materials whose relevance greatly exceeds the burden or expense of production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   That high standard is met here. As detailed above, Brooks's Eighth Amendment claim turns on a question of subjective intent: Johnston violated the Eighth Amendment if she intended to cause harm\n   maliciously, but not if she acted in good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202378\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/312/#p320\">\n    475 U.S. at 320-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202378\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/312/#p320\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As our cases make clear, whether an officer has complied with or, alternatively, violated a relevant use-of-force policy, while not dispositive, is highly relevant to that inquiry. Adherence to a policy, we have explained, \"provide[s] powerful evidence that the application of force was tempered and that the officers acted in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641618\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/756/#p761\">\n    77 F.3d at 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So if Detention Center policy calls for the use of a taser to induce inmates to cooperate in efforts to take their pictures, or in similar circumstances more broadly defined, then that would support the officers' contention that Johnston acted in a good faith effort to enforce discipline.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641618\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/756/#p761\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If, on the other hand, Johnston was acting in contravention of an applicable use-of-force policy when Brooks was subjected to three taser shocks, then that would tend to suggest the opposite: that she applied force in bad faith and with punitive intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5896808\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/225/#p239\">\n    535 F.3d at 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (relying in part on violation of \"Use of Force Directive\" to support inference that pepper spray was administered for improper and malicious purpose);\n   <em>\n    Orem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784171\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/442/#p446\">\n    523 F.3d at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (relying in part on violation of taser policy to support inference that taser was deployed maliciously).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Nor are we persuaded by the magistrate judge's apparent rationale that requests for use-of-force policies typically are denied for security reasons. As demonstrated by\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Iko\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Orem\n   </em>\n   - along with numerous other cases cited by Brooks - relevant use-of-force policies routinely are considered in excessive-force litigation, including litigation that arises in the prison context. Accordingly, the magistrate judge erred by denying Brooks's motion to compel production of relevant policies concerning the use of force against inmates in similar circumstances. Of course, reasonable mechanisms - such as redaction of text that is not relevant to the case - may be permitted in order to limit any purported security concerns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the grant of summary judgment to the defendants on Brooks's Eighth Amendment claim and the dismissal of Johnston from the case, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Rule 4(m) subsequently was amended to shorten the presumptive service window to 90 days.

The district court rested entirely on that prong, holding that \"fellow officer\" Johnston did not commit an \"illegal act\" when she deployed the taser.

On remand, however, we suggest that the court consider appointing counsel for Brooks to assist in litigating the case, consistent with applicable local rules and procedures.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Williams v.
