Under this policy, certain noncitizens who came to the United States as children could receive deferred action-a decision forbearing their removal from the country. Hundreds of thousands of individuals, including\n   those who appear as Plaintiffs in these appeals, applied for and received grants of deferred action under DACA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2017, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security rescinded DACA, which prompted a flurry of lawsuits across the country challenging the action. Plaintiffs in these appeals (a group of individuals and organizations) allege that the government's decision to rescind DACA (and its changes to policies governing the use of information provided by DACA applicants) violates the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and common law principles of estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the government's motion for summary judgment, the district court determined that Plaintiffs' challenges were subject to judicial review, that the rescission of DACA and changes to the government's policies on use of DACA applicant information did not violate the APA, that the constitutional claims were without merit, and that DACA's rescission did not violate principles of estoppel. The court, however, ordered the government (on grounds of estoppel) to comply with the policies promulgated in 2012 on the use of information provided by DACA applicants and enjoined it from altering these policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As we explain, we agree with the district court that Plaintiffs' challenges are subject to judicial review. We also agree with the district court that the government's decision to rescind DACA did not require notice and comment under the APA. But the decision nonetheless violated the APA because-on the administrative record before us-it was not adequately explained and thus was arbitrary and capricious. We also conclude that the district court erred in ordering the government to comply with its policies promulgated in 2012 on the use of information provided by DACA applicants and enjoining it from altering those policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Given our resolution, we decline, under the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, to decide whether Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment rights were violated. Nor do we address Plaintiffs' remaining arguments challenging the district court's grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before turning to the record material, some context is in order.

To ensure government resources were not spent on the \"low priority cases\" of \"certain young people who were brought to [the United States] as children and know only this country as home,\" J.A. 129, then Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano announced in a June 15, 2012, memorandum the policy that has become known as DACA. The DACA Memo made renewable two-year terms of deferred action from removal and authorization for employment available to individuals who came to the United States as children, satisfied certain other eligibility criteria,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and passed background checks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To be considered for deferred action under DACA, applicants had to submit to biometric screening and provide extensive personal information to the Department of Homeland Security.

According to the Attorney General:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   DACA was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and\n   with no established end-date, after Congress' repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result. Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch. The related ... DAPA ... policy was enjoined on a nationwide basis in a decision affirmed by the Fifth Circuit on the basis of multiple legal grounds and then by the Supreme Court by an equally divided vote. ... Because the DACA policy has the same legal and constitutional defects that the courts recognized as to DAPA, it is likely that potentially imminent litigation would yield similar results with respect to DACA.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   In light of the costs and burdens that will be imposed on DHS associated with rescinding this policy, DHS should consider an orderly and efficient wind-down process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   J.A. 379 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The next day, Acting Secretary Duke rescinded DACA and instructed Department personnel to \"wind-down\" the policy. J.A. 380, 383. The Secretary's Rescission Memo recounts in a \"Background\" section the DACA and DAPA policies, the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation, Secretary Kelly's rescission of DAPA, the letter to Attorney General Sessions from the plaintiffs in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation, and General Sessions's September 4 letter. The Rescission Memo then states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Taking into consideration the Supreme Court's and the Fifth Circuit's rulings in the ongoing litigation, and the September 4, 2017[,] letter from the Attorney General, it is clear that the June 15, 2012[,] DACA program should be terminated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   J.A. 383.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Rescission Memo-which issued without notice or an opportunity for public comment-did not end DACA outright. Rather, it allowed for a case-by-case basis adjudication of initial applications for deferred action and employment authorization accepted by September 5, 2017, and renewal requests accepted by October 5, 2017, from current DACA beneficiaries whose benefits would expire between September 5, 2017, and March 5, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Memo stated that the Department would not terminate existing grants of deferred action and employment authorization under DACA \"solely based on the directives\" in the Memo and would \"generally honor\" approved applications for advanced parole.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598061\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2271/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But it made clear that the Department would reject all other DACA applications, including initial applications filed after September 5, 2017, and all pending and future applications for advance parole under DACA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598061\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2271/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Memo, however, explicitly placed \"no limitations\" on the Department's \"otherwise lawful enforcement ... prerogatives.\" J.A. 384.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Department also announced that once an individual's deferred action under DACA expired, information provided by applicants would not be \"proactively provided to [law enforcement agencies] for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings\" unless the requestor met criteria for commencement of removal proceedings or referral to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for a determination whether to commence removal proceedings. J.A. 1142. For individuals whose pending DACA requests were denied, the\n   announcement stated that \"[g]enerally, information provided in DACA requests will not be proactively provided to other law enforcement entities ... for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings\" unless the requestor posed \"a risk to national security or public safety\" or met criteria for commencement of removal proceedings or referral to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for a determination whether to commence removal proceedings.

First, the complaint alleges that the rescission is a substantive rule and thus requires notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA. Next, it asserts that the government's decisions to rescind DACA and change the way the government proposed to share personal information collected from DACA applicants were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, in violation of the APA, and violated the substantive and procedural due process protections of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs also allege that the decision to rescind DACA violates the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment. Finally, Plaintiffs say that the government should be equitably estopped from rescinding DACA or using information provided by DACA applicants for immigration enforcement purposes beyond those first announced in 2012, when the government's information-sharing policies were first implemented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The district court granted partial summary judgment to the government.

It claims DACA's rescission involved discretionary balancing because it was based on concerns about its legality and \"litigation risk,\" a term that appears to\n   refer to the likelihood the policy would have been invalidated had it been challenged in the\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   litigation. But the Rescission Memo doesn't identify the \"risk\" of litigation as a \"consideration\" on which the Acting Secretary relied in rescinding the policy.

But we agree with the determination of our district court colleague Judge Bates in his opinion resolving challenges to DACA's rescission that this justification \"was too closely bound up with [the Attorney General's] evaluation of DACA's legality,\"\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   , 298 F.Supp.3d at 234, and thus cuts against\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   's presumption of unreviewability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Nor are we persuaded by the government's claim that DACA's rescission rested on the Department's view of the scope of its enforcement authority, not the substantive unlawfulness of the policy. As Judge Bates aptly noted when presented with the same argument, \"this strikes the [c]ourt as a distinction without a difference. To say that a particular agency action is 'without statutory authority' is simply to say that no statutory provision authorizes that action; in a sense, therefore, it is a determination of the substantive content of each statutory provision that might plausibly apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 232.

But there, the Supreme Court held only that \"where a party petitions an agency for reconsideration on the ground of material error,\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., on the same record that was before the agency when it rendered its original decision, an order which merely denies rehearing of the prior order is not itself reviewable.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212494\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/270/\">\n    482 U.S. at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212494\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/270/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks, ellipsis, and alteration omitted).

Chaney\n   </em>\n   to hold that an agency's nonenforcement decision was presumptively unreviewable under the APA. In that case, the Food and Drug Administration refused to take civil enforcement action against a class of drug manufacturers and others who produced and distributed drugs used by states to perform executions. The FDA explained its decision not to institute any enforcement action as a product of concerns that it lacked jurisdiction to address the use of drugs in such a way. Yet even if it could, the FDA noted that it would decline to exercise jurisdiction over those manufacturers under its inherent enforcement discretion. The Court found the decision to be presumptively unreviewable under the APA because agency enforcement decisions \"involve[ ] a complicated balancing of a number of factors,\" like allocating resources and prioritizing policies, that \"are peculiarly within [the FDA's] expertise\" and are thus generally unsuitable for judicial review.\n   <em>\n    Chaney\n   </em>\n   , 470 U.S. at 831,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11300314\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/821/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wayte v.

At least by its own terms, DACA did not eliminate the individualized discretion over enforcement decisions: it created procedural and substantive scaffolding to guide that discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Napolitano Memorandum at 2. Rescinding DACA took away the scaffolding but left the underlying core-individualized discretion-untouched. Thus, insofar as DACA is merely a programmatic enforcement decision, so is its rescission, and both are unreviewable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The best argument in favor of reviewability is that DACA itself was something other than an enforcement decision. Once granted, deferred action makes recipients eligible for benefits such as the ability to work legally in the country. These are subsidiary or collateral benefits that arise from other legal provisions not challenged here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) (\" '[U]nauthorized alien' means ... that the alien is not at that time ... authorized to be so\n   employed by this chapter or by the Attorney General.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(c)(14).

Moreover, some have argued that DACA only masquerades as a program involving individualized discretion and in fact amounts to an entitlement of benefits for the class of aliens who meet the program's threshold criteria. Again, the Fifth Circuit reached a similar conclusion about DAPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/#p178\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058486\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/134/#p178\">\n    at 171-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   But neither side presses such an argument in this case, and for good reason. The government does not because it claims DACA's rescission is unreviewable. Nor do the plaintiffs, because if they did, their case would be much harder on the merits. DACA relied on identified individualized enforcement as a necessary predicate for the program's existence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   The Department of Homeland Security's Authority to Prioritize Removal of Certain Aliens Unlawfully Present in the United States and to Defer Removal of Others, 38 Op.

If that predicate was false, then DACA was almost surely procedurally and substantively invalid. And that would mean one of the Department's proffered explanations for rescinding DACA-that it was likely unlawful-was valid. Unsurprisingly then, the plaintiffs do not rely on this point, giving us no occasion to consider whether DACA might be anything other than what it claimed to be: a program for a specific exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   No other exception makes the plaintiffs' APA claims reviewable.

The head of an agency has every right to exercise enforcement discretion. Standardizing (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , generalizing) how agents use their prosecutorial discretion does not alter its character. Whether the Secretary exercises her discretion over an individual case or provides guidance for how discretion should be applied in a class of cases, the decision is unreviewable as one \"committed to agency discretion by law.\" Under the plaintiffs' view, a line agent's decision not to remove a cancer-stricken alien would be unreviewable, but a front-office policy directing line agents to consider whether an alien is terminally ill would be reviewable. That distinction is untenable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perales v.

Supervision through generalized guidance that directs the exercise of enforcement discretion cannot transform the enforcement directive into a reviewable action. To find that discretionary enforcement decisions are unreviewable only when inferior officers exercise single-shot enforcement decisions also brushes aside the separation of powers that the Constitution lays out. The President is empowered by Article II to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\" and thus may hire officers to assist in these duties. But the constitutional responsibility remains firmly at the President's feet, and therefore, the President remains responsible for his subordinates' exercise of executive power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    Free Enter.

Such general decisions on enforcement policy, no less than the individual decisions that flow from them, cannot be reviewed by the courts without intruding on the prerogatives of the Executive Branch.

If the Acting Secretary was wrong about the likely illegality of DACA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   then this might mean that she had provided\n   <em>\n    no lawful reason\n   </em>\n   for the rescission. But in the context of the Executive's enforcement discretion, this is perfectly appropriate. The Executive need not explain why it makes particular enforcement and non-enforcement decisions. The Judicial Branch cannot bootstrap review of decisions committed to the discretion of the other branches simply because the reasons provided are of a type that judges consider themselves competent to evaluate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   In any event, the Acting Secretary's rescission memorandum was not a mere statement on the legality of DACA. Instead, the memorandum considered various court rulings as well as the Attorney General's letter before concluding that the \"DACA program\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   be terminated.\" Duke Memorandum at 4 (emphasis added). She did not say that DACA\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be terminated or that she lacked the legal authority to enforce DACA or a DACA-like program.

A selective-prosecution claim normally requires differential treatment of \"similarly situated individuals of a different race.\"\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/#p464\">\n    517 U.S. at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745202\" index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/456/#p464\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet who is \"similarly situated\" to DACA recipients except other DACA recipients? Setting aside the closely related and now-rescinded DAPA program, DACA stands alone as a unique exercise of Executive authority. While there are other deferred action programs (many of which are statutory), none resembles DACA. And the Department rescinded DACA for all recipients, not just for those of a particular ethnicity or nationality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Second, the plaintiffs rely on presidential campaign tweets, which they claim show invidious animus. But the plaintiffs must create a plausible inference that the same animus allegedly underlying these statements also motivated the Attorney General and the Acting Secretary to take the official government actions at issue. Their complaint simply lacks the connective tissue required to draw that inference. There is also an \"obvious alternative explanation\" for these officials' actions.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Changes in government policy are perfectly lawful, and for a selective-prosecution claim, we must presume that the Attorney General and the Acting Secretary were motivated by such a lawful purpose.\n   <em>\n    AAADC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"344\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n    525 U.S. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"345\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p484\">\n    119 S.Ct. 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
