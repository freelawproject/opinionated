The supporting affidavit detailed a drug investigation, which included a controlled drug buy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Within the past four days, at my direction and while under my direct surveillance, [Reliable Confidential Informant] #1 was provided money to purchase cocaine from Bradley in Boone County, Missouri. I watched RCI #1 and Bradley meet at an undisclosed [location] in Boone County. Bradley arrived at the meeting location driving a black, Ram, 4-door pickup bearing Missouri Registration 4MV269. After the transaction RCI #1 gave me cocaine they stated had been sold to them by Bradley. RCI #1 positively identified Bradley from pictures that I provided. The cocaine field-tested positive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Three other tipsters-two reliable cooperating citizens and a Crimestoppers caller-connected Bradley to drug dealing, two of whom told police he kept drugs in his truck. Weber swore that, within the past 24 hours, he saw another \"short-term transaction\" involving Bradley that he believed was drug-related based on his training and experience. The affidavit noted Bradley had prior convictions for drug trafficking, distribution, and felony possession. A state judge issued the GPS warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on information from the GPS tracker and physical surveillance, police obtained search warrants for Bradley's truck and a residence in Boone County. When police entered the residence, Bradley was in the living room. Officers recovered four firearms. One was atop a table next to Bradley, one under the table, one atop a television stand in the living room, and one in an upstairs bedroom. They also recovered over $ 12,000 cash from a pair of men's shorts in the living room. In a Mirandized interview, Bradley accurately described the firearms' locations and said they belonged to Tiffany Smith, his girlfriend and the tenant there. The truck was parked in front of the residence. In its console, police recovered around 151 grams of cocaine, 28 grams of cocaine base, and a digital scale. He was indicted for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, 28 grams or more of cocaine base, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Bradley moved to suppress \"all physical evidence allegedly seized\" and \"any statements attributed to him.\" He challenged the GPS warrant's probable cause. After a suppression hearing, a magistrate judge recommended denying the motion, reasoning that the controlled buy provided probable cause, the other information in the affidavit supported it, and, even if probable cause were lacking, the good-faith exception applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Bradley was the only adult in the residence when the firearms were recovered. Three were in his immediate vicinity. He admitted knowing the other was under a pillow in an upstairs bedroom. Tiffany Smith testified that although three of the recovered guns were hers, they were in a closed box in a spare bedroom when she left the morning the warrants were executed. The evidence supports a reasonable inference that Bradley removed the firearms from the box and put them where police found them-enough for constructive possession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Government presented sufficient evidence of Bradley's dominion and control of the\n   truck. Tiffany Smith testified he drove the truck to her home the morning the warrants were executed. She also testified that the truck belonged to Bradley and another woman, and the Government presented evidence that the truck was re-titled to Bradley alone days before the warrants were executed. The jury was free to reject his theory that one of the other persons with access to the truck exclusively possessed the drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
