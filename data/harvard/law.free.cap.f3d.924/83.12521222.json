After law enforcement officers looked into these events, a federal grand jury charged one of them, Rehelio Trant, with being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Trant proceeded to trial and a jury found him guilty. On appeal, Trant argues that his conviction should be vacated because the District Court impermissibly allowed the Government to reopen its case-in-chief and also made two evidentiary errors. Trant also contends that the record contains insufficient evidence to support his conviction. Concluding that none of Trant's challenges have merit, we will affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the fall of 2017, Rehelio Trant and Jimez Ashby had a heated encounter at a gas station in Bovoni, St. Thomas, that ended with each displaying his pistol to the other. Trant wanted to use a can opener inside the gas station, but Ashby was at a counter and in his way. Trant asked Ashby to move, but Ashby did not hear him. Trant then yelled his request in Ashby's ear. Although Ashby complied, he admonished Trant for screaming at him. The encounter seemed to have ended when the two men shook hands and Trant exited the store. Yet Trant signaled Ashby to join him outside. When Ashby did so, a breeze blew hard enough against Trant that Ashby, standing less than a car's length away, was able to see Trant's waistband tighten and the imprint of a gun against his body. Ashby immediately brandished his firearm and backed away. Then standing \"a little more than a car length\" from Ashby, Trant lifted up his shirt and revealed a gun in his waistband. (App. 61.) Just then, a woman walked between the two men, and Trant left the gas station. Ashby quickly called the police to report the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Several months later, a federal grand jury charged Trant with one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Before trial, the Government and Trant stipulated that he had a prior felony conviction. In addition, Trant filed a motion in limine seeking the Court's permission to inquire into \"Ashby's unlawful possession\n   of two firearms for impeachment purposes which are probative of his character for untruthfulness.\" (App. 24-25.) The District Court deferred ruling on this motion until trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, the Government's case included the testimony of Ashby and Sergeant Bernard Burke, the Supervisor of the Virgin Islands Police Department's Firearms Unit. Ashby described his encounter with Trant, and added that the light \"was good\" when he saw both the imprint of a gun in Trant's waistband and Trant lift his shirt to expose the gun. (App. 60, 76-77.) On cross examination, Ashby testified that he knew the imprint in Trant's waistband was of a gun and recalled telling the police that Trant's firearm \"look[ed] like a Glock\"-a gun that Ashby said resembled his own Glock pistol. (App. 71.) Trant's counsel attempted to ask Ashby three questions about the unlawfulness of his possession of a firearm at the time of the altercation with Trant, but the District Court sustained, apparently under Federal Rules of Evidence 608 and 609, the Government's objections to these questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government then called Sergeant Burke to testify that there are no firearm manufacturing facilities within the territorial boundaries of the V.I. After that, the Government rested its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Next, Trant moved under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(a) for a judgment of acquittal. The District Court, noting that the trial record lacked evidence that Trant was a convicted felon (a requirement for conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

She responded that she had forgotten to move the admission of the stipulation of Trant's prior felony conviction. The prosecutor then incorrectly asserted that she had \"asked the Court prior to the jury coming in to address [the stipulation] and to inquire as to when that stipulation would be presented to the jury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (App. 85.) This left the Government with no alternative but to move to reopen its case-in-chief. In support of its motion, the prosecutor argued that the Court should grant the motion because Trant would not suffer any prejudice from the admission of the stipulation. Trant objected but offered no reason why the Court should deny the motion other than that \"it's too late\" and \"[t]he [G]overnment has rested.\" (App. 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The District Court granted the Government's motion to reopen. After the stipulation was admitted into evidence, the Government again rested. Trant, not presenting any evidence of his own, also rested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The jury found Trant guilty of violating \u00a7 922(g)(1), and Trant was later sentenced to 71 months' imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Trant timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The District Court had jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201612\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and we have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, Trant raises three issues. He contends that the District Court erred by granting the Government's motion to reopen its case-in-chief and by restricting his cross examination of Ashby. Trant also asserts that the record lacks the necessary evidence to support his conviction. We reject each of his challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Trant argues that the District Court impermissibly granted the Government's motion to reopen because the Government lacked a reasonable explanation for failing to present the stipulation during its case-in-chief. Trant adds that \"the [G]overnment added insult to injury by misrepresenting what had occurred.\" (Trant's Br. at 21.) He further contends that our review of the District Court's ruling should \"end\" with the Government's inadequate justification for failing to move the stipulation into evidence because, he implies, a reasonable explanation was necessary for reopening. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) Alternatively, Trant asserts that the Court abused its discretion by granting the motion because he was prejudiced by the reopening-i.e., he lost the opportunity to be acquitted based on the Government's failure to prove that he is a convicted felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There is scarce authority in our circuit on the standard governing this Court's review of a ruling on a motion to reopen the Government's case-in-chief during a criminal trial. We therefore take this opportunity to clarify and build upon our case law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   When considering a party's motion to reopen its case at trial, \" 'the district court's primary focus should be on whether the party opposing reopening would be prejudiced if reopening is permitted.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As in the suppression context, two principal considerations for the district court's inquiry are the timing of the moving party's request to reopen (whether, if the motion is granted, the opposing party will have a reasonable opportunity to rebut the moving party's new evidence) and \"the effect of the granting of the motion\" (whether granting the motion will cause substantial disruption to the proceedings or result in the new evidence taking on \"distorted importance\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11193275\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/213/#p220\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

We conclude that any such caution against reopening the record in the trial context would constitute an anomalous constraint on a district court's traditional and well-understood exercise of its discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We will not, therefore, direct a district court to place a thumb on the scale by suggesting that reopening a trial record is somehow disfavored, while at the same time giving lip service to our reliance upon the trial judge's sound discretion. In our view, this would only confuse a trial judge's inquiry into whether or not to reopen, as well as our eventual review for abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We add that our cautionary warning against reopening suppression hearings upon remand is not warranted in the trial context for three additional reasons. First, in comparison to suppression hearings, trials present a greater need for district courts to be unconstrained in the exercise of their case-management discretion. Trials are fluid proceedings with a much wider horizon of evidence for district courts to consider than in suppression hearings, and courts enjoy broad discretion during trial precisely so that they can promptly and effectively respond to the varied and often unanticipated issues that may arise.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schiff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919909\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/152/\">\n    602 F.3d at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting district courts have \"broad discretion\" to engage in case management during trial). Second and relatedly, suppression hearings usually present fewer and more narrow issues than arise at trial. That means that parties moving to reopen suppression hearings will generally have less justifiable reasons for failing to introduce the desired evidence into the record than parties moving to reopen at trial. As\n   <em>\n    Coward\n   </em>\n   noted, \"[r]eopening is often permitted to supply some technical requirement ... or to supply some detail overlooked by inadvertence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9402643\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/176/#p181\">\n    296 F.3d at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We believe that, as exemplified by this case, there are more opportunities for technical requirements or details to be overlooked during the often high pressure of a trial proceeding than in a suppression hearing where a jury is never present. Third,\n   courts should not be distracted at trial by a suggestion that reopening is disfavored, because deciding whether to allow the Government to reopen its case-in-chief will more often be outcome determinative (as in this case) than in the suppression-following-remand context. In the latter situation, the Government may be able, through time and investigative resources, to obtain alternative evidence to present at trial. This higher likelihood of reopening at trial being outcome determinative makes it even more critical that a district court apply our reopening standard in a straightforward manner, focusing first on prejudice to the party opposing the motion, while also considering the nature and probative value of the new evidence. Quite simply, the purpose, procedure and pressures of a trial are way too different from the suppression hearing context to warrant application of a \"one size fits all\" approach to resolving a motion to reopen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   With this standard now defined, we turn to Trant's argument that the District Court impermissibly granted the Government's motion to reopen its case-in-chief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with Trant that the Government's reason for failing to introduce the stipulation before resting (it \"simply forgot\" (Gov. Br. at 16)) is hardly compelling. But prejudice to the party objecting to reopening the trial record constitutes the primary consideration for a district court that must rule on a motion to reopen. The Court was not required to deny the motion solely because the Government's explanation was weak.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wrensford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275339\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/76/\">\n    866 F.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88 n.6 (3d Cir. 2017) (\"Reopening may ... be permitted to allow the presentation of evidence about a technical matter overlooked by inadvertence.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by granting the motion because Trant was not prejudiced by the Government's reopening of its case-in-chief: the Government moved to reopen before Trant had the opportunity to present his evidence, thereby giving him the opportunity to respond and also limiting any disruption to the proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9402643\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/176/#p181\">\n    296 F.3d at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Where, as in this case, reopening is permitted after the [G]overnment has rested its case in chief, but before the defendant has presented any evidence, it is unlikely that prejudice sufficient to establish an abuse of discretion can be established.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). And importantly, the object of the motion to reopen was the admission of a\n   <em>\n    stipulation\n   </em>\n   -Trant had agreed to it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Contrary to Trant's assertion, prejudice in this context does not mean the loss of an opportunity for an unearned windfall. Prejudice results when a party experiences an unfair or unreasonable impairment of his defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070402\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/107/#p114\">\n    751 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   114 ;\n   <em>\n    Coward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9402643\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/296/176/#p181\">\n    296 F.3d at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, we emphasize that the parties do not dispute that the stipulation was admissible and that it had significant probative value.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   A trial should be a solemn exercise in a search for truth, not a game of \"gotcha.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Trant next contends that the District Court committed two errors by preventing him from cross examining Ashby about his unlawful possession of a firearm. First, Trant argues that the Court should have permitted him to question Ashby about this matter, suggesting it was probative of Ashby's character for untruthfulness and necessary for the jury to evaluate Ashby's credibility. Trant asserts that Ashby's own illegal activity gave him a reason to lie about Trant's gun possession. When Ashby called the police, Trant contends, he wanted officers to focus on Trant's criminal activity and not his own. In support, Trant points to\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The District Court permissibly halted Trant's proposed questioning because Ashby's illegal possession of a firearm did not have any bearing on his character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. As the Tenth Circuit has explained, \"[t]here is a point which constitutes a prosecution of the witness for the offense inquired about rather than a testing of his credibility and when that point is reached the court acts properly in closing down the questioning, for there is no valid interest to be served in shifting the emphasis from the accused person[ ] on trial to the witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Estell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1039969\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/539/697/\">\n    539 F.2d at 699-700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

His questions, Trant contends, would have demonstrated Ashby's bias against Trant and his motivation\n   to lie. Trant again suggests that because Ashby illegally had a gun during their encounter at the gas station, he had the motive to report Trant's unlawful possession of a firearm to the police so as to distract law enforcement from his own criminal conduct.

Had the cross examination taken place, no reasonable jury could have believed that Ashby testified against Trant to avoid his own prosecution for illegally having a firearm. And how could they? It was Ashby himself who first called the police and reported to them that he had brandished his own firearm in the presence of Trant.

First, he asserts that Ashby's testimony lacks adequate specificity for a rational factfinder to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the object Ashby saw in Trant's possession fit the definition of a firearm under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Trant emphasizes that the object may not have been a firearm at all; alternatively, he suggests that \"the object could have been an antique firearm which the statute specifically excludes as meeting the definition of a firearm.\" (Trant Br. at 14.) And during oral argument before us, Trant stressed that Ashby lacked the expertise and experience of a police officer in identifying firearms and that Ashby's account lacked corroboration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ashby's testimony, however, provides sufficient evidence to satisfy the requirement for a \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction that a defendant possess a firearm as defined in \u00a7 921(a)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   When reviewing a\n   jury verdict to determine whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the conviction, \"we review the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt[ ] beyond a reasonable doubt. ...

That alone would justify a rational trier of fact in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Trant's firearm traveled in interstate commerce. This Court has previously held that the testimony of Virgin Islands police officers can be sufficient to establish that, because particular goods were not manufactured in the Virgin Islands, their presence on the islands meant that they had been transported in interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Those holdings are applicable here. Sergeant Burke's testimony tracks that of Virgin Islands police officers in earlier cases in which we have deemed such testimony sufficient to establish that a particular good or product moved in interstate commerce.
