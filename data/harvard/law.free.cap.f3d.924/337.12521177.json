Following an evidentiary hearing as to the appropriate remedy for the reporting violation, the court entered a permanent injunction which, in its final form, requires Spectrum to adhere to its newly-implemented CPSA compliance practices and to retain an independent consultant to recommend additional modifications to those practices. Spectrum appeals, contending both that the government's late-reporting claim is barred by the statute of limitations, that the district court had no authority to enter a forward-looking injunction, and that the court otherwise abused its discretion in awarding permanent injunctive relief, including the requirement that it engage the expert. Finding no merit in any of these challenges, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Spectrum is a global, diversified consumer products company headquartered in Middleton, Wisconsin. During the years relevant to this action, Spectrum distributed to retailers more than 24 million individual products per year across more than 500 stock keeping units. Among the products it sold was a line of under-the-cabinet Black &amp; Decker SpaceMaker coffeemakers, distributed by its subsidiary, Applica Consumer Products, Inc. (\"Applica\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a purveyor of consumer products, Spectrum is legally obligated to notify the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission (\"CPSC\" or \"Commission\") of potentially hazardous defects in any of its products. Specifically, section 15(b) of the CPSA requires a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of a consumer product \"who obtains information which reasonably supports the conclusion that such product\" contains \"a defect which- ... could create a substantial product hazard\" to \"immediately\" inform the Commission of said defect, \"unless such manufacturer, distributor, or retailer has actual knowledge that\n   the Commission has been adequately informed of such defect ... .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202064\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3).

Separately, the statute makes it unlawful for any person to \"fail to furnish information required by section 2064(b).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202068\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By February 2009, Spectrum's third-party customer call center had received a number of complaints from consumers regarding the SpaceMaker coffeemakers, including in particular complaints that the plastic handle on the coffeemaker's 12-cup carafe had broken. In one instance, the failure of a handle had caused a consumer to suffer a burn from the hot coffee in the carafe. It appears from the record that when the carafe handle failed, typically its top portion (which was secured by a screw) detached from the glass carafe, while the bottom of the handle (which was fastened by a metal band running around the bottom of the carafe) remained securely in place. This caused the carafe to tip or wobble in the consumer's hand. When the carafe was full of hot coffee, the sudden movement could cause the consumer to spill the coffee or drop the carafe altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In April 2009, in the face of continuing complaints about broken handles, Spectrum commenced an investigation which culminated in a decision to modify the design of the carafe handle. The manufacturer was instructed to cease fabricating the original version of the carafe and to scrap any units already in production. Spectrum began stocking coffeemakers with the modified handle beginning in May. Rather than ceasing sales of the original coffeemakers with the problematic carafe, however, Spectrum implemented a \"rolling change\" pursuant to which it continued to sell the older versions so long as they remained in stock. Although Spectrum has assumed that the engineering change fixed the problem with the carafe handle, there is no proof in the record as to whether all of the consumer complaints that Spectrum received about the carafe prior to the eventual recall of the coffeemakers in 2012 were limited to the original version of the carafe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Meanwhile, Spectrum continued to receive complaints about broken handles on the carafes. By the end of 2009, it had received an additional 300 such complaints, which included more than a dozen reports of burns or lacerations. During this time, the CPSC itself received a report about a faulty handle, and the Commission, consistent with its practice, passed the report on to Spectrum without investigation, reminding the company of its duty under section 15(b) to notify the Commission if Spectrum was aware of a potentially hazardous defect\n   in its product. Spectrum did not file a section 15(b) report at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Over the course of the next two years, the company remained silent about the carafe handle even as more complaints of handle failures and resulting injuries made their way to Spectrum. During this time, the CPSC itself received and forwarded another seven broken-handle reports to Spectrum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Not until April 2012 did Spectrum finally file a section 15(b) report with the Commission. The report was what the CPSC called a \"fast-track\" report which indicated the company's intent to recall the coffeemaker. One month earlier, a class action suit had been filed against Spectrum alleging that there was a design defect in the carafe handle, and that suit evidently persuaded the company that the best course of action was to recall the product entirely, including models with both the original and re-engineered carafe handles. The report as amended advised the Commission that Spectrum had received over 1,600 complaints of handle failures\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and more than 60 reports of associated injuries to consumers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two months later, in June 2012, Spectrum and the CPSC jointly announced a recall of the defective coffeemakers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   By the time the recall was announced, Spectrum had sold some 159,000 of the coffeemakers, with the majority of them having been sold by December 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Despite the recall, due to gaps in its inventory-control procedures, Spectrum inadvertently continued to sell the recalled coffeemakers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   By June of 2013, it had sold\n   another 641 such coffeemakers. A secondary recall was implemented to reach those coffeemakers. At that point, sales of the product finally ceased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In June 2015, three years after Spectrum recalled the defective coffeemakers, the government filed a civil complaint against the company in the district court. As relevant here, the complaint alleged that Spectrum, beginning in February 2009, obtained information reasonably supporting the conclusion that the coffeemakers it was distributing contained a hazardous defect or posed an unreasonable risk of injury, failed to so inform the CPSC for several years thereafter, and thereby knowingly violated section 15(b) of the Act. \u00a7 2064(b)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint also alleged that Spectrum committed a second violation of the Act by continuing to distribute or sell coffeemakers that it had previously recalled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202068\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The CPSA authorizes civil penalties of up to $ 100,000 for each knowing violation of the Act, not to exceed a ceiling of $ 15,150,000 for \"any related series of violations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202069\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2071%2C554\">\n    76 Fed.

The uncontested facts indicated to the district court that, as early as May 2009 (when the company had already received 60 reports of broken carafe handles and four consumer burns), and certainly no later than June 2010 (by which time it was aware of over 700 handle failures and 35 injuries), Spectrum possessed information supporting a conclusion that the carafe handle on the coffeemakers the company was distributing contained a defect which could create a substantial product hazard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271440\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/794/#p818\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271440\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/794/#p818\">\n    at 821-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Spectrum's theory was that the limitations period began to run in May 2009, when (as the district court postulated) its duty to report arguably first arose, and expired in May 2014, more than a year before the government filed suit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202462\">\n    at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reasoned that the reporting obligation imposed by section 15(b) is a continuing one, such that a company's violation of its duty is not complete until such time as the\n   company finally submits a report to the Commission or acquires actual knowledge that the Commission has otherwise been adequately informed of the product defect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202462\">\n    at 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, in the district court's view, a cause of action for breach of the reporting requirement does not accrue until this time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A contrary understanding, the court pointed out, would encourage a company that has not immediately filed a section 15(b) report with the Commission to continue to withhold information about a product defect until such time as the limitations period has run, and thereby undermine the statutory goal of encouraging the timely reporting of product failures in order to protect the public from harm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Deeming a failure to report as a discrete, time-limited violation struck the court as \"nonsensical,\" particularly where the egregiousness of the failure to report increases exponentially over time with continuing consumer complaints of product failures and injuries, as occurred in this case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court likewise rejected Spectrum's contention that the court lacked authority under the CPSA to impose the forward-looking injunctive relief on the company that the government had sought (in addition to monetary penalties) in its prayer for relief. Because the statute authorizes injunctive relief as necessary to \"[r]estrain any violation\" of the Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), the court inferred that its power to award injunctive relief included the power to enjoin future violations.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271440\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/794/#p818\">\n    218 F.

The government, it concluded, had put forth a plausible case that Spectrum's \"knowing, arguably outrageous, conduct\" warranted such an injunction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271440\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/794/#p818\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271440\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/794/#p818\">\n    at 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court therefore declined to dismiss this portion of the government's prayer for injunctive relief, reserving judgment as to whether an injunction was warranted pending further development of the facts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271440\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/794/#p818\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following an evidentiary hearing as to the appropriate remedies for Spectrum's violations of the CPSA and a thorough canvassing of the criteria set forth in the statute and regulations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202069\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201119.1\">\n    16 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1119.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1119.4 ; R. 234 at 5-12, the district court issued a decision imposing both fines and a permanent injunction. The court ordered the company to pay civil penalties totaling $ 1,936,675-$ 821,675 for the section 15(b) reporting violation and $ 1,115,000 for the sale of recalled products. R. 234 at 12-16. The court also concluded that the government had established a reasonable likelihood of future violations warranting a permanent injunction requiring Spectrum to reform its internal compliance programs and procedures. R. 234 at 17-21. The court found that a key problem contributing to the company's failure to timely report the problem with its problematic coffee carafe was a lack of communication among employees responsible for evaluating consumer complaints, those employees with knowledge of the product's design and defect, and senior management personnel. R. 234 at 18-19. Similar communication failures, along with the failure to implement relatively simple measures to prevent the distribution of recalled products, largely explained Spectrum's continuing sales of the recalled coffeemaker. R. 234 at 19. The court acknowledged a report prepared by Spectrum's expert witness identifying a number of procedures the company was utilizing to gather, evaluate, and escalate product information that might require reporting to the CPSC. But that report did not address whether these same procedures were in place during prior years, when Spectrum had failed to report the carafe-handle defect to the Commission despite ongoing reports of handle failures and injuries. Nor did the report discuss whether these procedures were written,\n   disseminated, and enforced within the company and whether appropriate company personnel were trained in these procedures. R. 234 at 19. Moreover, so far as the record revealed, Spectrum had not commissioned an independent audit to gauge the efficacy of these measures. R. 234 at 21. The court found it telling that senior engineering and global quality personnel at Spectrum could not recall meaningful discussions of the problems with the carafes prior to 2012, notwithstanding the receipt of consumer complaints beginning in 2009. R. 234 at 20. Consequently, the court was left with serious doubts as to the efficacy of the efforts Spectrum had undertaken to address the faults that had caused the company to violate its reporting obligations under section 15(b) and to prevent the continued sales of recalled products.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Q]uestions ... remain regarding the extent to which Spectrum has undertaken a meaningful independent audit of its CPSA reporting and recall obligations, and addressed the deficiencies in its systems and programs that led to its violation of these obligations. While Spectrum appears to have made some efforts to prevent similar violations from occurring in the future, the seriousness of its offens[es] to date require that the systems that it has in place to comply with the CPSA should by now be rigorous and well-defined. ... Accordingly, the court finds that plaintiff has made an adequate showing of the need for permanent injunctive relief to address Spectrum's auditing, compliance and training regarding compliance with the CPSA's reporting requirement and post-recall sale prohibition going forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   R. 234 at 21. The court went on to enter a forward-looking permanent injunction which, among other things, required Spectrum to \"maintain sufficient systems, programs, and internal controls to ensure compliance with the CPSA and the regulations enforced by the CPSC\" and to \"implement appropriate improvements to its compliance programs\" within six months of the court's order. R. 234 at 22. The order also required Spectrum to disseminate copies of the court's summary judgment and penalty decisions to its directors, officers, management personnel, and in-house counsel to the extent they were involved in the manufacturing and distribution of consumer products in the United States. R. 234 at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Spectrum filed a motion asking the court for a partial stay of its judgment. It asked the court to stay both the penalty imposed for the section 15(b) late-reporting violation as well as the bulk of the injunction the court had entered, both of which it intended to appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to the injunction, Spectrum argued that a stay was warranted,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , because the terms of the injunction were so vague as to render it nothing more than a command to \"obey the law.\" R. 237 at 5-6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C v.

The court acknowledged that in setting forth what the injunction required of Spectrum, it might have \"fall[en] short\" of the specificity required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d)(1)(B) and (C). R. 243 at 4. With an eye to correcting that problem, the district\n   court ordered Spectrum to file a memorandum detailing the specific steps it had already taken to ensure compliance with the CPSA and the CPSC's regulations; it also ordered the government to file a response as to the sufficiency of the measures Spectrum had taken along with any proposals of its own.

Wis. Apr. 9, 2018), and Spectrum took a fresh appeal from the new judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Spectrum's appeal is focused on two aspects of the remedies the district court ordered for its violations of the CPSA. It contends that the district court lacked authority to impose the $ 821,000 penalty for its section 15(b) reporting violation, because the government's suit on that violation was barred by the statute of limitations. Spectrum does not otherwise challenge the propriety or calculation of the penalty for failing to report, nor does it challenge in any respect the $ 1.1 million penalty the district court ordered for continuing to sell the SpaceMaker coffeemakers in question after they were recalled. As for the injunction the court entered, Spectrum presses several arguments: that the court lacked authority to enter forward-looking injunctive relief; that it abused its discretion in thinking such relief was appropriate in this case; and that the court abused its discretion in requiring the company to engage an outside expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A. Statute of limitations for reporting violations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Section 15(b) does not specify a limitations period for failure-to-report claims, so we look to the default, catchall limitations provision for civil penalty actions set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202462\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In relevant part, that provision specifies that \"an action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, shall not be entertained unless commenced within five years from the date when the claim first accrued ... .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Spectrum argues that because its duty under section 15(b) was to \"immediately\" report a potentially hazardous defect in its product, and because the regulation makes clear that \"immediately\" means within 24 hours of obtaining information reasonably pointing to the existence of such a defect, the government's cause of action for Spectrum's failure to make a timely report first accrued no later than May 2009, by which time the company had received from consumers 60 reports of broken carafe handles and four burns associated with such failures. In its summary judgment decision, the court found that Spectrum arguably had a duty to make a report to the Commission at that point.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271440\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/218/794/#p818\">\n    218 F. Supp. 3d at 821-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Spectrum's view, the five\n   years that section 2462 allowed for filing suit thus began to run in May 2009 and expired in May 2014, roughly 13 months before the government actually filed its complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Like the district court, and for the same reasons, we reject Spectrum's contention that the government filed suit too late. Because, as we shall explain, Spectrum's failure to report is properly understood to constitute a continuing violation of its statutory reporting obligation that did not end until Spectrum finally submitted a section 15(b) report in 2012, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until that time. The government thus had five years from the filing of Spectrum's section 15(b) report to file suit, and it did so well before the limitations period expired in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Spectrum contends that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gabelli v.

In\n   <em>\n    Gabelli\n   </em>\n   , the government had filed a civil enforcement action charging the defendants with securities fraud and seeking monetary penalties for the fraud some six years after the alleged scheme of securities fraud had ended; as here, section 2462 supplied the applicable statute of limitations-five years. The government contended the suit was timely because it had only discovered the fraud after the scheme was over, and less than five years before filing suit. However, after noting that the \"standard rule\" in such cases was that a claim accrues \"when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , when the fraud occurs,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407574\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/442/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407574\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/442/\">\n    at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407574\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/442/\">\n    133 S.

Whereas the typical fraud victim \"do[es] not live in a state of constant investigation\" and will have no reason to cause to search for wrongdoing in the absence of an apparent injury, the very purpose of a regulatory agency like the S.E.C. is to root out fraud, and such an agency-unlike the ordinary private plaintiff-has any number of tools at its disposal to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407574\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/442/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407574\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/442/\">\n    at 450-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407574\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/442/\">\n    133 S.

The statute requires a consumer products manufacturer, retailer, or distributor which comes into possession of information supporting the conclusion that its product has a potentially hazardous defect to file a report with the Commission; the company is relieved of that obligation only if it knows that the Commission had already been properly informed of that defect. Although, as Spectrum naturally emphasizes, the company's duty is to make an\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   report, which the regulation defines to mean within 24 hours of the company coming into information regarding the hazard posed by its product, there is no reason to think that the company's dereliction of its duty is a one-time defalcation that is complete for statute of limitations purposes once 24 hours have passed without the filing of a report. The statutory obligation, after all, is to convey information to the Commission so that it may take action as necessary to protect the public from the potential harm posed by the company's product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zepik v.

Nothing about the significance of that information or the need for governmental intervention changes with the passage of time in and of itself: So long as the defective product is offered for sale and otherwise remains in use by consumers, the potential danger presented by the product and the need for action to address that danger remain unabated. Thus, although a product distributor may have breached its obligation under section 15(b) by sitting on information regarding a product hazard for more than 24 hours, its transgression continues so long as it fails to file the requisite report with the CPSC. To paraphrase\n   <em>\n    Yashar\n   </em>\n   , once a company\n   has omitted to \"immediately\" inform the Commission of a potentially hazardous product defect, the elements of its statutory breach are present, but the wrong manifested by its silence perdures beyond the initial failure to make a timely report. The fact that the statute relieves the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of the duty to report only when the company has actual knowledge that the Commission already knows about the defect reinforces the point: the duty is tied to the Commission's awareness of the defect rather than the passage of any arbitrary period of time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Spectrum did not come into information revealing the hazard on one occasion, but on many occasions in the years that it remained silent. Recall that by the time Spectrum finally filed its section 15(b) report, it had received over 1,600 complaints from customers. Each time it received a consumer complaint regarding a carafe failure, Spectrum had a fresh opportunity and obligation to consider the potentially hazardous nature of its product and to reassess its reporting obligation. And with each new complaint, it would have become more clear to Spectrum that the incidents its customers were reporting were not flukes, and that carafe failures and consumer injuries would continue so long as the defective version or versions of the carafe remained in circulation. To say then, as Spectrum does, that both its duty to report and its failure to report were ripe at a single point in time-May 2009-and that the limitations period began to tick irrevocably at that time, is to ignore that the potential hazard posed by its product persisted beyond that point, and with each additional complaint of a carafe failure, the company was placed on renewed notice of an ever more compelling need to act. These complaints continued right up until the time that Spectrum finally filed its section 15(b) report with the CPSC in 2012. To paraphrase\n   <em>\n    Yashar\n   </em>\n   's rationale again, each day that Spectrum did not make a report to the Commission brought a renewed threat of the evil that Congress sought to prevent by requiring a company to report a possible hazard with its product.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397250\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/873/\">\n    166 F.3d at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whether one views Spectrum's silence in response to each new complaint as a separate violation of section 15(b), or instead sees the unending stream of complaints as a manifestation of the continuing risks posed by the company's failure to report the hazard to the Commission, it is clear that the nature of Spectrum's wrongdoing cannot logically be confined to one point in time but must be seen as a continuing wrong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Loghlin v.

The government disagreed, but it did not file suit to enforce the permit requirement until 2009, a decade or more after the modifications were made. ComEd invoked the five-year limitations period specified by section 2462 and argued that the suit was untimely.

The statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Midwest Generation\n   </em>\n   incorporated an explicit and obvious external deadline for the obligation it imposed: the company was required to obtain a permit before construction commenced. There is no comparable deadline set forth in section 15(b): the statute calls for a timely (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   immediate) disclosure, but it does not tie that disclosure to some other event or point in time akin to the commencement of construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colo.

Moreover, when the deadline in\n   <em>\n    Midwest Generations\n   </em>\n   came and went with the commencement of construction, the nature of the problem changed materially from a regulatory standpoint. Once the utility company had modified its power plants, permits were a moot point; there was no longer an opportunity for regulators to review the proposed modifications and condition those modifications upon the installation of better pollution controls. The harm post-construction was now higher emissions of pollutants, and that harm, as we pointed out, was subject to remedy via different statutory provisions. By contrast, the wrongfulness of Spectrum's failure to disclose the potential defect in its product neither ended nor transmogrified into a different form as of any particular time. At all times, the failure to disclose deprived the Commission of the opportunity to investigate the product and take appropriate action (including a product recall) in order to protect consumers; and that wrong and the hazard it posed could be addressed no matter how long it took for Spectrum to make its disclosure to the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Nor are we persuaded by Spectrum's contention that the single express reference to a continuing violation in one section of the CPSA's civil penalty provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202069\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , rules out treating a section 15(b) violation as a continuing wrong.

The recognition that one type of violation of the CPSA (a failure of record-keeping) can be a continuing offense, for penalty assessment purposes, does not rule out the possibility that another violation, including the failure to report a potentially hazardous product defect, can be a continuing offense for limitations purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Advance Mach.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5686496\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/547/1085/#p1090\">\n    547 F.

The company reasons that so long as Spectrum had come into the requisite information about a possible product hazard and failed to make a report within 24 hours, it was in violation of the statute and all elements of the government's cause of action were established; thus, the government's reporting claim first accrued at that time, and the limitations clock began to tick, giving the government five years from that date to commence suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   There is a superficial logic to this line of argument, but it fails to recognize the underlying rationale of the continuing violation doctrine. Cases applying this doctrine recognize that the elements of a crime or a civil statutory violation may be present early on in the course of a defendant's\n   wrongdoing, so that the government, if it were aware of the wrongdoing, would be free to pursue a charge. But given the continuing nature of the underlying wrong, the doctrine delays the accrual of the government's cause of action,\n   <em>\n    for limitations purposes\n   </em>\n   , until the defendant's last act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

So although nothing would have prevented the Commission from bringing suit in May 2009 had the Commission been aware of the material facts, the continuing violation doctrine delayed the clock from running on the government's right to bring suit until such time as Spectrum filed its section 15(b) report and its ongoing violation of the statute ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We recognize that\n   <em>\n    Gabelli\n   </em>\n   admonishes us not to construe a statute of limitations in such a way as to \"abolish effective time constraints on litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Midwest Generation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056780\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/644/\">\n    720 F.3d at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, for all of the reasons we have explained, the duty to report a potentially dangerous defect in a product so that the Commission can take appropriate action to protect consumers is necessarily an ongoing duty which, by the terms of section 15(b), does not end until such time as the product's maker, distributor, or seller either makes a report or actually knows the Commission has been properly informed. At all times, it was within Spectrum's ability to start the clock running on the government's cause of action by filing a section 15(b) report. The filing of such a report entails minimal time and effort.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   It could not have been the intent of Congress to treat the failure to make such a report as a \"one and done\" event that confines a company's duty, for limitations purposes, to the earliest possible point in time and effectively ignores the stream of consumer complaints presented to the company in the ensuing months and years, the many opportunities the company had to reevaluate its obligation to report, and the missed opportunities for the Commission to take remedial action to protect consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This action is therefore timely. For purposes of the statute of limitations, Spectrum's wrongdoing did not end, and the government's cause of action did not first accrue, until April 2012, when the company finally complied with its section 15(b) obligation by filing a report with the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   B. Propriety of permanent injunction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Spectrum also challenges the permanent injunctive relief awarded by the district court. As we have noted, Spectrum contends in the first instance that the court had no authority to enter a permanent, forward-looking injunction in the absence of an ongoing violation of the CPSC. Beyond that, the company argues that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to order such relief here, and in particular to require the company to engage an expert\n   to evaluate its compliance procedures and make recommendations for improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We reject at the outset Spectrum's contention that the CPSA does not authorize forward-looking injunctive relief.

Thus, we are not persuaded that the lack of express statutory authorization for forward-looking injunctive relief,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77t(b), 78u(d)(1) (authorizing injunctions to restrain imminent violations of securities laws), deprived the district court of the power to enter such an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Nor has Spectrum persuaded us that the district court abused its discretion in deciding that injunctive relief is appropriate in this case. The burden of proof on this point of course belonged to the government, and the court did not improperly shift the burden to Spectrum, as the company suggests it did. R. 234 at 17 (recognizing that burden belonged to government as plaintiff); R. 234 at 21 (\"the court finds that plaintiff has made an adequate showing of the need for permanent injunctive relief ...\"). The burden was not onerous: once the government \"has demonstrated a past violation, it need only show that there is a reasonable likelihood of future violations in order to obtain injunctive relief.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Yang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4287527\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/795/674/#p681\">\n    795 F.3d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681 (7th Cir. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    S.E.C. v.

The district court did not clearly err in finding that the government met this burden. Spectrum describes its violations as an \"isolated occurrence.\" Spectrum Reply Br. 22. That may be true in the sense that its violations of the CPSA involved a single defect in one line of coffeemakers. But it is not isolated in any other sense of the word. For three years\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Spectrum itself concluded that the original handle on its SpaceMaker carafe was defective and ordered changes to the design, the company failed to report the defect to the CPSC, notwithstanding the many hundreds of complaints it continued to receive during\n   that period and the knowledge that the handle failures resulted in consumer injuries with some regularity. And when it finally recalled the coffeemaker, Spectrum (inadvertently) continued to sell the product. The evidence produced at the remedies hearing showed-and the district court found-that Spectrum's violations of the statute were due to serious and systemic defalcations within the company, among them: a failure of communication between staff who were familiar with the defects in the design of the original carafe handle and staff who handled customer complaints; a failure among senior managers to meaningfully confront the situation with the coffeemaker's carafe until 2012 despite knowing as early as April 2009 that there were problems with the product; the lack of systems to prevent the continued distribution of recalled products; and the failure to train staff on compliance with the CPSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Given the gravity of these failures and the company's delay in complying with its reporting obligation, the district court justifiably concluded that there was a reasonable likelihood that Spectrum might again commit similar violations of the statute in the future. To be sure, Spectrum by the time of the remedies hearing had undertaken significant efforts to address the weaknesses in its corporate culture that had resulted in its continued sales of the defective coffeemaker and its failure to timely report the hazard posed by the defect to the Commission. But, as the district court pointed out, Spectrum had not submitted to an independent audit to evaluate its compliance systems or processes and to solicit external advice as to what additional changes, if any, might be prudent. Nor, we would add, was there evidence before the court as to how effective the remedial measures undertaken by the company in the wake of the coffeemaker matter had thus far proven to be in practice. The court reasonably concluded that a permanent injunction requiring the company to take specified categories of proactive measures was a necessary and appropriate step aimed at reducing the likelihood that the company would, in the future, commit violations similar to those that had led the court to fine the company.

Recall that in its first iteration, the injunction ordered Spectrum to \"maintain sufficient systems, programs, and internal controls\n   to ensure compliance with the CPSA and the regulations enforced by the CPSC\" and, within a period of six months, to \"implement appropriate improvements to its compliance programs.\" R. 234 at 22. When Spectrum subsequently sought a partial stay of the district court's judgment pending appeal, including most of the requirements imposed by the injunction, the company argued among other things that the injunction was impermissibly vague and overbroad. It was in response to that line of argument that the court, recognizing that its injunction may not have been as specific and concrete as it ought to have been, treated Spectrum's motion as one to clarify the obligations imposed by the injunction. R. 243 at 3-4. Following briefing as to the nature and sufficiency of the improvements Spectrum had already made to its compliance procedures and programs, the court endeavored to do just that. It modified the injunction to include six specific requirements tracking the improvements Spectrum averred were already in place; the court viewed these improvements as sufficient to resolve Spectrum's concerns about the vagueness of the injunction and to ensure preservation of the status quo pending appeal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20502736\">\n    2018 WL 502736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-*3. But the court agreed with the government that these improvements might not be sufficient, in and of themselves, to ensure compliance with the spirit of the court's injunction and to avoid a repetition of the events that led to the company's violation of the CPSA. For that reason, the court accepted the government's proposal that Spectrum also be required to engage an outside consultant to assess the efficacy of its compliance systems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The court viewed the consultant as \"a straightforward, specific way for Spectrum to ensure its good faith compliance with the permanent injunction, rather than continuing to live under the vagueness of the admonition to 'obey-the-law' currently contained in the permanent injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Recognizing, however, that engaging a consultant went beyond the status quo, the court stayed enforcement of that specific requirement pending appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   To the extent the requirement to engage a consultant constituted a substantive modification, as opposed to a simple clarification, of the original injunction, it was well within the court's authority to make this modification in response to Spectrum's arguments that the injunction's vagueness made it impossible for the company to know how precisely to comply with the court's command. R. 237 at 6. True, Spectrum did not formally ask the court to modify the injunction and neither did the government separately make such a motion. But it was well within the court's power to look beyond the label to the substance of Spectrum's motion and to treat the request for a stay not only as one to clarify the injunction, but also as one to modify the injunction as necessary to address Spectrum's concerns-which is precisely how the court construed the motion. R. 243 at 3-4 &amp; n.1.

There appears to be no dispute that wholesale reforms to Spectrum's regulatory compliance systems and culture were called for; the number of consumer products that Spectrum distributes only makes the need for those reforms more imperative. Although the company had endeavored to make the changes needed, those reforms, as we have said, had not been subjected to independent scrutiny. It was reasonable for the district judge to think that a second opinion as to the sufficiency of these reforms would be useful as an additional means of ensuring that Spectrum did not commit similar violations in the future. Moreover, Spectrum itself, in seeking a partial stay of the judgment, had expressed concern about its ability to comply with the spirit of the court's injunction. It complained of the \"difficulties inherent in operating a large consumer business pursuant to a vague injunction that does not specify what Spectrum must do in order to ensure that it is complying with the Court's order.\" R. 237 at 6. The advice of an independent consultant would no doubt help to address this very concern. We add, finally, that the district court included a procedure for judicial review of any proposals by the consultant that Spectrum found objectionable, which will serve as a check on the consultant's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For all of the reasons we have discussed, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Manion, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   I write separately to note a narrow point of disagreement with the court's detailed opinion relating to the statute of limitations issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   I agree Spectrum's\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   conduct amounts to a \"continuing violation\" that lasted into 2012, and therefore the government's complaint was timely.

The government would then have five years to file a complaint, probably noting that customers continued to complain.

At the time of the merger, Spectrum assumed all of the assets and obligations of Applica, and there is no dispute that the assumed liabilities include Applica's liability with respect to the events underlying this case.

The coffeemaker, including the carafe, had been thoroughly tested before it was placed on the market, so the company had reason to believe that there was no fault in the design of the carafe. The testimony presented to the district court suggests that it is not uncommon for a consumer to complain about a broken product and seek a refund or replacement based on a purported defect in the product, when in fact it is the consumer who has caused the product to break through his own misuse or clumsy handling. Spectrum (really, Applica) thus had a practice of not investigating its products for potential design and/or safety flaws unless a consumer was willing to return the broken product to the company for inspection. Early on, two consumers did return failed carafes to the company, and it was the company's investigation as to those failures that resulted in the re-engineering of the carafe handle in 2009. At that point, Spectrum evidently considered any problem with the carafe to have been solved. The company viewed the ongoing complaints about the carafe as a quality-control problem with the production of the carafe rather than a safety issue. And Applica's prior experience with another coffeemaker, as to which it filed a report with the Commission but was required to take no remedial action, lulled the company into thinking there was no need to file a report as to the Black &amp; Decker carafe.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    A long-serving CPSC employee would later testify that this number of complaints was extremely high for a product-perhaps the most he had seen in his two decades at the Commission.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Some 900 of these complaints were received after Spectrum took over Applica, the importer and distributor of the coffeemakers, in 2010.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    A section 15(b) report would ordinarily trigger an investigation by the Commission to determine whether,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , a recall of the product was appropriate. However, because Spectrum had signaled its intention to voluntarily recall the coffeemaker, no such investigation was necessary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Spectrum had placed a product hold on the recalled coffeemakers, which stopped distribution of units already on its warehouse shelves, but the hold did not reach products in transit from China.

The government's complaint contained a count alleging that Spectrum's coffeemaker contained such a defect. However, Spectrum disputed the notion that its coffeemaker posed a risk of causing anything more than minor injuries; and because the district court found that the defect in the coffeemaker could create a \"substantial product hazard,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 2063(b)(3), and Spectrum was required to give notice to the Commission on that basis, the court saw no need to determine whether notice was additionally required on the ground that the product posed a risk of serious injury or death.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
