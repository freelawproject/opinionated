This case is about when and how the LNC can spend that money. The LNC argues that the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), which imposes limits on both donors and recipients of political contributions, violates its First Amendment rights in two ways: first, by imposing\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   limits on the LNC's ability to accept Shaber's contribution, given that he is dead; and second, by permitting donors to triple the size of their contributions, but only if the recipient party spends the money on specified categories of expenses. Scrutinizing each provision in turn, we find no constitutional defects and reject the LNC's challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Over half a million voters have registered as Libertarians.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact (\"CF\") \u00b6 3,\n   <em>\n    Libertarian National Committee, Inc. v.

The LNC, the national committee of the Libertarian Party, has over 130,000 members and about 15,000 active donors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During his lifetime, Joseph Shaber was one of those donors, contributing a total of $ 3,315 in a series of relatively small donations over some twenty-five years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CF \u00b6\u00b6 109-10.

In 2015, shortly after Shaber had passed away, the LNC learned that Shaber left it the generous sum of $ 235,575.20.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CF \u00b6\u00b6 117, 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   But the LNC had a problem.

Furthermore, the Federal Election Commission (the \"Commission\"), the agency charged with enforcing FECA, interprets \"person\" to include the dead and their estates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FEC Advisory Opinion 1999-14 (Council for a Livable World),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20521238\">\n    1999 WL 521238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (July 16, 1999) (\"[A] testamentary estate is the successor legal entity to the testator and qualifies as a person under the Act ....\"). Taken together, these restrictions prohibited the LNC from accepting more than $ 33,400 of Shaber's donation into the LNC's general fund in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   But there was another way. Just the previous year, in 2014, Congress had amended FECA to permit donors to contribute, over and above their general-purpose contributions, amounts up to three times the base limit into each of three new kinds of \"separate, segregated\" party-committee accounts.

In 2015, then, the LNC could have accepted up to $ 334,000 from Shaber's bequest, taking $ 33,400 into its general fund and $ 100,200 into each of three segregated funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The LNC, however, preferred not to tie up the majority of Shaber's gift in segregated accounts, and the trustee in charge of distributing Shaber's gift concluded that she had no authority to require the LNC to accept the full bequest into a combination of general- and dedicated-purpose accounts because she \"could not impose restrictions on Mr. Shaber's bequest that Mr. Shaber did not himself place.\" CF \u00b6\u00b6 126-27. Accordingly, the LNC accepted only $ 33,400 of Shaber's donation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CF \u00b6 119, and the trustee asked the Commission for an advisory opinion on what to do with the rest,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030108\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (requiring the Commission to issue written advisory opinions upon request). In that request, the trustee proposed to put the balance of Shaber's bequest into an escrow account that would disburse the maximum base-limit contribution into the LNC's general fund each year until the entire gift had been depleted (about seven years in total).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FEC Advisory Opinion 2015-05 (Shaber),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204978865\">\n    2015 WL 4978865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Aug. 11, 2015).

The Commission sees three defects in the LNC's standing. We see none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Commission first argues that by electing to place the balance of Shaber's gift into escrow instead of accepting it into segregated accounts, the LNC has inflicted its own injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    National Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health Ass'n v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3560468,8454871\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/826/\">\n    468 F.3d 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 831 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (explaining that self-inflicted harm \"does not amount to an 'injury' cognizable under Article III,\" nor is it \"fairly traceable to the defendant's challenged conduct\"). Of course the Commission is correct in the most literal sense: the LNC did, indeed, put pen to paper and sign the escrow agreement. But as the district court explained in rejecting the Commission's self-infliction argument, the LNC's injury stems not from its inability to accept the entire bequest immediately (which it could have done), but rather from the committee's \"inability to accept [immediately] the entire bequest for\n   <em>\n    general expressive purposes\n   </em>\n   \" (which FECA prohibits).\n   <em>\n    Libertarian National Committee, Inc. v. Federal Election Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269111\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/19/#p25\">\n    228 F. Supp. 3d 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 25 (D.D.C. 2017). The Commission forced the LNC to choose between immediate access to the money and long-term flexibility in spending it; that the committee chose the lesser of two evils hardly transforms FECA's limitation into a self-imposed restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Commission, however, has a response: because \"[m]oney is fungible,\" a dollar contributed into a segregated account \"is an extra dollar from the ... general account that becomes available for [the LNC's] general expressive purposes.\" Federal Election Commission's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction (\"Motion\") at 14-15. Perhaps so, but the arithmetic just does not work. In 2015, the year the LNC first gained access to Shaber's $ 235,575 bequest, it spent only $ 341 on its 2016 presidential nominating convention and $ 7,261 on legal proceedings. Therefore, even assuming the LNC could have maxed out its headquarters spending at $ 100,200 and accepted an additional $ 33,400 into its general account, some $ 94,373 of Shaber's bequest would have remained unused as of December 31, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Contrary to the Commission's argument, we have no need to examine the LNC's \"2016 budget expectations and expenditures.\" Motion at 17. True, the LNC must demonstrate standing \"as of the time [its] suit commence[d]\" in January 2016,\n   <em>\n    Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3664274,3542437\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/570/316/\">\n    570 F.3d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 324 (D.C. Cir. 2009), and expense reports reveal that by the end of 2016, the LNC had incurred enough convention, headquarters, and legal costs to have fully absorbed what remained of Shaber's donation-assuming the money it spent on those expenses was itself unrestricted and thus fully fungible. But by January 2016, Shaber's bequest sat locked in an escrow account over which-at the Commission's direction-the LNC exercised \"no control.\" FEC Advisory Opinion 2015-05 (Shaber),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204978865\">\n    2015 WL 4978865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Aug. 11, 2015). The relevant date is therefore September 2015, when the LNC committed itself to the escrow arrangement. At that time, although the committee may have projected certain expenses, it lacked perfect information about what costs it would incur and what other donations it might receive in the new year. We cannot\n   rely on hindsight to fault the LNC for its failure of foresight, and in any event, our task is not to assess the committee's financial planning acumen. Rather, we must determine only whether the LNC suffered a cognizable injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the Commission's conduct (and, by extension, to FECA). The LNC easily clears that bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Next, the Commission argues that a favorable judicial determination could not redress the LNC's injury because this suit, filed in 2016, seeks only injunctive and declaratory relief for harm suffered a year earlier in 2015, when Shaber's bequest became available. To be sure, our Article III authority does not include the power to turn back time. Nonetheless, much of the money remains tied up in escrow, and we most certainly do have authority to invalidate the challenged portions of FECA-which, per the escrow agreement, would afford the LNC immediate access to the remainder of the bequest for all purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Escrow Agreement \u00b6 3. That is redress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, the Commission points out that the LNC \"lacks standing to the extent its claims\" depend on the allegation that the challenged contribution limits \"place the Libertarian Party at a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis other political parties,\" which, the Commission argues, \"is akin to the oft-rejected argument that a party is harmed because it is at a fundraising disadvantage to its competitors.\" Motion at 20-21. But according to the LNC, \"that extent is zero.\" Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (\"Opposition\") at 15. Taking the LNC at its word, we conclude, as did the district court, that the committee has alleged a cognizable harm in its inability to accept immediately \"the entire bequest for\n   <em>\n    general expressive purposes\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Libertarian National Committee, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269111\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/228/19/#p25\">\n    228 F.

But even though Shaber no longer speaks nor associates,\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   and its progeny hardly foreclose application of closely drawn scrutiny to the contribution limit at issue in this case. We shall therefore assume, without deciding, that closely drawn scrutiny applies to the imposition of contribution limits on Shaber's bequest.

Individuals planning to bequeath a large sum to a political party have two points of leverage during their lifetimes: they may tell the party about their intentions, and they may change their minds at any time. That latter possibility, as the district court found, \"creates an incentive for a national party committee to limit the risk that a planned bequest will be revoked\" and could cause that party, \"its candidates, or its office holders to grant political favors to the individual in the hopes of preventing the individual from revoking his or her promise.\" CF \u00b6 100 (first quoting Findings of Fact \u00b6 92,\n   <em>\n    Libertarian National Committee, Inc. v.

In other words, a donor's death simply imposes a sequencing constraint on a quid pro quo exchange. Instead of money for votes, the donor requires votes for money-or, to be more precise, political favors\n   <em>\n    now\n   </em>\n   for the promise of money\n   <em>\n    later\n   </em>\n   . And even that constraint evaporates in the case of corrupt donors seeking favors for their survivors.

Voters lack the means to examine the intentions behind suspiciously sizable contributions, a problem that becomes especially acute in the case of a deceased donor who, of course, is forever unavailable to answer inquiries.

The government may, just like any other litigant in any other case, accept an opposing party's concession. Moreover, among the district court's findings that the LNC declines to dispute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Rec. 32:01-18 (conceding that this court is bound by the district court's findings of fact unless clearly erroneous), are several that amount to substantial evidence demonstrating the government's anticorruption interest in regulating bequests. To begin with, contrary to the dissent's assertion that \"bequests are rarely used for political contributions,\" Op. at 563 (Katsas, J.), the district court found that since 1978 donors have contributed \"more than $ 3.7 million in bequeathed funds,\" not infrequently in five- and six-figure amounts. CF \u00b6 102;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   CF \u00b6\u00b6 103-08 (listing bequeathed contributions to national political party committees). And that figure is \"likely underreported,\" as \"reporting entities are not required to inform the [Commission] that a particular contribution they received came from a bequest.\" CF \u00b6 102. In fact, the LNC did not report Shaber's bequest as such.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CF \u00b6 102. Furthermore, the district court found that \"nothing prevents a living person from informing the beneficiary of a planned bequest about that bequest,\" CF \u00b6 94; that \"[p]olitical committees 'could feel pressure to ... ensure that a (potential) donor is happy with the committee's actions lest [that donor] revoke the bequest,' \" CF \u00b6 100 (second and third alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    LNC I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3876721\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/930/154/#p186\">\n    930 F.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The LNC first contends that because the statute now restricts how certain funds may be \"used,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030116\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9), the cromnibus amendment \"transformed\" FECA's contribution limit into an expenditure limit, Appellant's Br. 41. But\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   forecloses this argument. That decision teaches that the difference between an expenditure limit and a contribution limit hinges not on the statute's use of magic words such as \"spend\" (as in BCRA) or \"use\" (as in the cromnibus amendment), but rather on a functional test. \"The relevant inquiry is whether the mechanism adopted to implement the contribution limit, or to prevent circumvention of that limit, burdens speech in a way that a direct restriction on the contribution itself would not.\"\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p135\">\n    540 U.S. at 138-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p135\">\n    124 S.Ct. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   That test makes this an easy case.

The cromnibus amendment says nothing about how much money political party committees may expend on general purposes, conventions, headquarters, and recounts. Instead, the two-tiered scheme does nothing more than its single-tiered predecessor: it \"simply limit[s] the source and individual amount of donations\" for each category of expenses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p135\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Or, as the Court put it in\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he overall effect of the Act's contribution ceilings is merely to require ... political committees to raise funds from a greater number of persons ... rather than to reduce the total amount of money potentially available to promote political expression.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. at 21-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is a contribution limit through and through.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The LNC's second tack is somewhat more creative, albeit no more successful. Consider, the LNC posits, a contribution from Donor Doe that exceeds the base limit by $ 1, i.e., a $ 33,401 donation. Under the cromnibus amendment's two-tiered contribution limit, the committee may use Doe's extra dollar to pay for a presidential nominating convention but not a midterm convention, or for a sign on its headquarters but not a billboard on the street. According to the LNC, then, regardless of whether the two-tiered limit imposes a permissible contribution ceiling on donors, with respect to recipients, FECA's \"spending\n   purpose restrictions directly limit how the LNC may express itself\" based on the content of its speech. Appellant's Br. 46;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reply Br. 20 (criticizing the Commission's \"obsessive focus on contributors' interests\" as \"irrelevant, because the restrictions at issue target\n   <em>\n    the parties'\n   </em>\n   accounts\" and because \"[i]t is not the donors who are barred from spending beyond the accounts' segregated purposes\"). For this proposition, the LNC relies on\n   <em>\n    Reed v. Town of Gilbert\n   </em>\n   , in which the Court recently held that laws \"defining regulated speech by particular subject matter, ... function[,] or purpose,\" \"are subject to strict scrutiny.\" --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2227\">\n    135 S.

Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2226-27 )).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   But the LNC misses one crucial element in the \"content-based restriction on speech\" inquiry: speech. Recall that\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   drew a clear distinction between spending money (expenditures) and receiving money (contributions). Restrictions on the former regulate speech, as \"virtually all meaningful political communications in the modern setting involve the expenditure of money\" so that an absolute limit on a political party's expenditures necessarily restricts its total amount of expression.\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Restrictions on the latter, however, are something different. Receiving money\n   <em>\n    facilitates\n   </em>\n   speech, to be sure, but a bank account balance becomes speech only when spent for expressive purposes. This is why the Court has made clear \"that contribution limits impose serious burdens on free speech only if they are so low as to 'preven[t] ... political committees from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.' \"\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p135\">\n    540 U.S. at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p135\">\n    124 S.Ct. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   So there lies the solution to the Donor Doe problem. The LNC's speech occurs when it spends Doe's money on political expression. That speech remains unencumbered by FECA because, as discussed above,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 547, the cromnibus amendment's two-tiered contribution limit imposes no expenditure limit. True, the LNC may not spend Doe's additional dollar on a billboard. But it may spend as many dollars from as many non-Does as it wants on billboards, so long as it spends no more than $ 33,400 from any single donor. The LNC's speech is thus subject to no restriction, content-based or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We emphasize that this case implicates only the sort of line-drawing exercises that inhere in a system of federal campaign finance regulation-that is, lines that define in evenhanded terms covered recipients, donors, and contributions. This case, in other words, presents no plausible claim that FECA's two-tiered contribution limit restricts contributions based on the donor's identity or viewpoint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   And yet, the LNC argues that FECA's two-tiered contribution limit merits strict scrutiny. Consequently, by the LNC's logic, FECA would be rife with content-based restrictions on recipients' speech. For example, the\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   -approved BCRA prohibits national party committees from \"spend[ing] any funds,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030125\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), donated in excess of FECA's limits, which, in turn, apply to contributions made \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030125\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30101(8)(A)(i). Likewise, BCRA's soft-money ban prohibits state party committees from spending non-FECA contributions\n   on \"Federal election activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30125(b). If, as the LNC argues, a limit on contributions made to segregated accounts dedicated to particular \"uses\" counts as a content-based restriction on speech, then so, too, would restrictions on spending donations \"made ... for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office\" or on expending funds for \"Federal election activity.\" But that, of course, is not the case: as the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   , BCRA does not \"burden[ ] speech in a way that a direct restriction on the contribution itself would not.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p135\">\n    540 U.S. at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p135\">\n    124 S.Ct. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Consequently, the LNC essentially asks us to conclude that\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   's application of strict scrutiny to laws that \"defin[e] regulated speech by particular subject matter, ... function[,] or purpose,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2227\">\n    135 S.

Indeed, the LNC invokes the district court's factual finding on this point: \"[T]he essential truth,\" says the committee, \"is that '\n   <em>\n    [a]ll\n   </em>\n   contributions to political parties can create the risk of corruption or its appearance regardless of the way that money is ultimately spent ....' \" Appellant's Br. 57 (alterations in original) (quoting CF \u00b6 36). Rather than contesting the need for contribution limits, the LNC makes a more refined point. \"It is one thing to generalize that larger contributions pose a greater\n   risk, and for that reason, impose a simple contribution limit,\" argues the committee, but \"[r]estricting how a party spends 90% of a contribution, in 30% tranches tied to presidential nominating conventions, buildings, and litigation, cannot be explained on a corruption-fighting rationale.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. In other words, conceding the need for an overall contribution limit, and taking no issue with drawing that line at either $ 33,400 or $ 334,000, the LNC questions whether the government can demonstrate an anticorruption interest in treating general- and dedicated-purpose contributions differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Right out of the gate, the LNC's argument faces a high hurdle: the cromnibus amendment\n   <em>\n    increased\n   </em>\n   the total amount individuals may contribute to a political party. Before 2014, the LNC could accept only a base-limit sized contribution from any one person; now it may accept ten times that amount. Consequently, the LNC's argument sounds very much like a grievance with Congress's decision to\n   <em>\n    raise\n   </em>\n   contribution limits. But so long as contribution limits apply equally to all donors and recipients, \"[t]here is ... no constitutional basis for attacking contribution limits on the ground that they are too high.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

The cromnibus amendment, by contrast, did just the opposite: it relaxed contribution limits. Had BCRA's extensive legislative history identified some troubling finding related specifically to conventions, headquarters, or legal expenses, we would perhaps harbor more concern about the cromnibus amendment's relatively stingy congressional record. But we have discovered in that record no basis for any such concern, leaving us without any reason to conclude that the Congress of 2014 committed constitutional error by determining that, a dozen years after BCRA, times and circumstances had sufficiently changed to permit it to deal more generously with expense categories less directly tied to particular candidates or elections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wagner v.

As the majority points out, the higher limits on contributions to pay for presidential nominating conventions were prompted by the end of public funding for such conventions in 2014. The cromnibus amendments gave parties a \"tool for making up for that shortfall.\" Maj. Op. at 550. That explanation is understandable, but it does not establish that there are lesser corruption concerns with contributions that help put on nominating conventions. There can be no serious doubt that the nominating conventions of the major parties are closely connected to elections. Contributions to their staging therefore appear to raise the same corruption risks as general contributions, and the record provides no reason to think otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The record is similarly slim as to the segregated accounts for maintaining party headquarters and contesting election results. The majority offers that \"Congress could have permissibly concluded that unlike contributions that can be used for, say, television ads, billboards, or yard signs, contributions that fund mortgage payments, utility bills, and lawyers' fees have a comparatively minimal impact on a party's ability to persuade voters and win elections.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755763\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/460/#p463\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Perhaps, but that inference lacks record support. The record gives no reason to think that spending on party headquarters or election contests has a different influence on elections than general-account spending, and the majority might just as reasonably have said the opposite: that Congress \"could have\" determined that elections are significantly influenced by a party headquarters (where parties might host donors and connect them to party leaders and candidates) and election recounts and litigation (which resolve whether an actual candidate wins or loses a particular election). My point is not that either of these potential determinations is more reasonable than the other; my point is that without record support they are \"too speculative\" to carry a First Amendment burden.\n   <em>\n    McCutcheon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706989\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/185/#p191\">\n    572 U.S. at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579115,12706989\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1434/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Finally, the factual findings made by the district court provide no better support for the government. The district court found that \"unrestricted funds are more valuable to national party committees and their candidates than funds that may only be used for particular categories of expenses.\" Findings of Fact (\"CF\") \u00b6 50,\n   <em>\n    Libertarian Nat'l Comm. v.

And according to the government, \"it is simple common sense that the more a political party values a contribution, the more likely that contribution will be or appear to be part of a quid pro quo corruption scheme,\" making it more reasonable for the cromnibus amendments to treat general contributions more restrictively than segregated contributions. FEC Br. 47. The problem for the government, however, is that the district court's findings simultaneously point in the opposite direction: \"A political party may in some circumstances value a contribution with use restrictions more highly than a smaller contribution without such restrictions,\" particularly because money is generally fungible and every dollar received through segregated accounts \"potentially frees up another dollar in the recipient's general account for unrestricted spending.\" CF \u00b6\u00b6 38-39. The record does not clarify whether such a \"circumstance\" is presented by this case; again, we just don't know. Moreover, even if a dollar donated to a general account raised more corruption concerns than a dollar given to a segregated account, the government acknowledges\n   that \"larger contributions to political parties are generally more likely to lead to actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements and can do so regardless of how the funds are ultimately used.\" CF \u00b6 35 (alterations omitted). This further highlights the poor fit of the cromnibus amendments, which treat larger contributions to segregated accounts as if they were\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   likely to raise corruption concerns than substantially smaller contributions to a general account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In the absence of any corruption-related difference between general and segregated contributions, the government has not carried its burden of showing that the two-tiered scheme is closely drawn to serve anticorruption interests. This conclusion does not rely on a \"freestanding underinclusiveness limitation,\" as Judge Katsas fears. Op. at 568 (Katsas, J.) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.

The two-tiered scheme's exceptions loosen restrictions on the very contributions that are highly sought by major parties but of little use to minor parties. In my view, this further undercuts the government's position that the scheme pursues the only permissible government interest: combating quid pro quo corruption and its appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Under the scheme, a donor may contribute a total of $ 334,000 to a political party: $ 33,400 to the general account and $ 100,200 to each of the three segregated accounts. The major parties benefit from this scheme because they spend substantial sums on activities that can be paid for through segregated accounts: They put on lavish nominating conventions that are spectacles made for a national audience, they maintain expensive headquarters, and they challenge and defend in court the outcomes of numerous elections across the country. Indeed, from December 2014 through December 2016, the Republican Party received more than $ 23 million for its convention, $ 26 million for its headquarters, and $ 5 million for election recounts\n   and litigation; the Democratic Party received more than $ 12 million for its convention, $ 3 million for its headquarters, and $ 6 million for election recounts and litigation. CF \u00b6\u00b6 45-46; J.A. 90. The cromnibus amendments enable the major parties to raise such sums with individual contributions of up to $ 334,000. What's more, those contributions are in effect no different from general contributions. So long as a party has segregated-account expenses, a dollar received in a segregated account frees up a dollar in the general account that otherwise might have been used to defray the segregated-account expenses. Therefore, until a party receives enough money to cover its segregated-account expenses, the two-tiered scheme establishes an effective\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   contribution limit of $ 334,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   By contrast, minor parties gain little from this scheme because they do not have much use for segregated-account contributions. The LNC, for example, holds more modest conventions and maintains a less expensive headquarters than the major parties, and the LNC has never spent money on election recounts and is unlikely to do so in the future.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LNC Br. 13-15. In most years, its expenses for these purposes are less than $ 500,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064970,4280410\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/996/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; CF \u00b6\u00b6 25-29. Lacking further segregated-account expenses, the LNC and similar minor parties do not benefit much from the higher limit for segregated-account contributions. Instead, they seek contributions that can be used for other purposes, and those contributions are limited to $ 33,400.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In this way, the scheme's exceptions loosen restrictions on those contributions that are useful to major parties but not to minor parties. Of course, this effect is in part attributable to the various levels of support for different parties and the parties' decisions on how to raise and spend contributions. And as the majority notes, this effect alone does not render the scheme unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 551. Even so, it raises further doubts that the scheme is tailored to serve anticorruption interests rather than an impermissible interest, such as disadvantaging minor parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.

For another, there is no easy means for deceased donors or their beneficiaries to enforce any corrupt bargains. In the context of contributions from living donors, such bargains are managed through winks and nods over time, as money flows one way and political favors flow the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p135\">\n    540 U.S. at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897054\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/93/#p135\">\n    124 S.Ct. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting lobbyist's testimony that \"overt words are rarely exchanged about contributions, but people do have understandings\"). Bequests cannot work like that, because the money flows only once, and at death. So, if a corrupt donor seeks political favors during his lifetime, when the bequest is nothing more than a revocable promise, the recipient will have no way to prevent the donor from accepting the favors but then reneging on the promise. Or, if the donor seeks favors for survivors, he will have no way to ensure delivery after death makes the bequest irrevocable and removes him from the picture. Either way, inherent constraints limit the feasibility of any contemplated exchange. Bequests are thus generally \"less susceptible ... to misuse,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    Beaumont\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897598\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/146/#p161\">\n    539 U.S. at 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897598\" index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/146/#p161\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , than contributions from living donors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The evidence confirms this point. To justify its concerns about possible corruption through bequests, the FEC could have pointed to anything in any of four records: the legislative record of a select committee established by Congress to investigate fundraising for the 1972 presidential election,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"435902,3693647\" index=\"433\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/519/821/\">\n    519 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   839 n.35 ; the 100,000-page record compiled for the three-judge district court in\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1944964\" index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/251/176/#p209\">\n    251 F.

Yet, despite the massive records in\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   , and the two records made in the bequest-specific\n   <em>\n    LNC\n   </em>\n   cases, the FEC points to nothing substantiating its concerns.

From 1978 through August 2017, bequests accounted for only about $ 3.7 million in contributions to federal candidates, political parties, and all other entities required to file reports with the FEC.\n   <em>\n    LNC II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525872\" index=\"435\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/317/202/\">\n    317 F.

Of course, bequests to political parties might increase if the relevant contribution limits were invalidated.

As Judge Griffith explains, the argument is compelling: money is fungible, the exceptions dwarf the rule, and there is no plausible anti-corruption rationale to explain the disparate treatment. Nonetheless,\n   <em>\n    McConnell\n   </em>\n   held that BCRA's $ 25,000 contribution limit substantially advances, and is narrowly tailored to, the important government interest in combatting actual or apparent\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   corruption.
