The district court denied the motion. Having jurisdiction under \u00a7 1292(a)(1), this court reverses and remands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Willson has three stake-mounted, freestanding signs in the front yard of his residence in Bel-Nor, Missouri. He has displayed \"Clinton Kaine\" and \"Jason Kander U.S. Senate\" signs since 2016, and a \"Black Lives Matter\" sign since 2014. In December 2017, he received an information and summons charging him with violating Bel-Nor Ordinance 983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Months earlier, the Bel-Nor Board of Alderman passed Ordinance 983, codified as Bel-Nor Municipal Code \u00a7 400.120(E). The Ordinance permits \"each improved parcel\" of private property \"to post one stake-mounted and self-supporting freestanding sign\" and \"Not more than one (1) flag.\" It includes several requirements for the size, placement, and features of permissible signs and flags.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Willson sought preliminary injunctive relief, arguing Ordinance 983 is content-based, vague, and overbroad in violation of the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. The district court denied the motion. \"A district court considering injunctive relief evaluates the movant's likelihood of success on the merits, the threat of irreparable harm to the movant, the balance of the equities between the parties, and whether an injunction is in the public interest.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gresham v.

The district court held that Willson was unlikely to succeed on the merits of his First Amendment challenge.

A sign is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Any poster, object, devise [sic], or display, situated outdoors, which is used to advertise, identify, display, direct or attract attention to an object, person, institution, organization, business, product, service, event, idea, belief or location by any means, including but not limited to words, letters, figures, designs, symbols, colors, logos, fixtures, cartoons or images.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to one sign, the Ordinance allows each improved parcel \"[n]ot more than one (1) flag.\" A flag includes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   any fabric or bunting containing distinctive colors, patterns or symbols used as a symbol of a government or institution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under this section of the Ordinance, \"flags shall not be considered 'signs.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   These definitions show that the content of a flag or sign determines whether it is a flag or sign. For example, applying the ordinary meaning of \"government or institution,\n   \" a fabric with a Cardinals logo is a \"sign,\" while a fabric with an Army logo is a \"flag.\" This inquiry is content-based because whether a fabric is a sign or a flag-and whether it is prohibited by the Ordinance-depends on the \"the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Reed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/#p2226\">\n    135 S.

It advances an \"exceptionally broad\" definition of \"institution,\" encompassing \"[a]ny significant practice, relationship or organization in a society or culture.\" According to Bel-Nor, the Cardinals are an institution, marriage is an institution, and even a \"Black Lives Matter\" sign may be a \"flag\" under the Ordinance.
