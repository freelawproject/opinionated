The panel voted to deny rehearing, and a majority of the judges in active service voted to deny rehearing en banc. Chief Judge Wood and Judges Rovner and Hamilton voted to grant rehearing en banc.

But three of our colleagues, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, have published an opinion that does more than just repeat the arguments already made by the panel dissent. These new points merit a response, lest it appear that the court did not consider them in deliberating whether to rehear the case. It is also important to clearly reject any implication that the panel's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Yafai v.

The officer in\n   <em>\n    Yafai\n   </em>\n   did that, but our dissenting colleagues would require more. They are not alone in pressing that argument: Supreme Court justices have made the same point in dissents from the controlling cases.

Mohsin Yafai and Zahoor Ahmed were born, raised, and married in Yemen. Yafai became a naturalized United States citizen in 2001. Several years later when Ahmed applied to become a citizen, a consular officer denied her visa application. The officer based the denial on attempted smuggling under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(E), which provides that \"[a]ny alien who at any time knowingly has encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law is inadmissible.\" The consular officer both cited to the statute and provided the factual basis for the decision: \"You attempted to smuggle two children into the United States using the identities Yaqub Mohsin Yafai and Khaled Mohsin Yafai.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Yafai and Ahmed requested that the consular officer reconsider his decision. They said that Yaqub and Khaled were their children but that both had tragically drowned. The consular officer agreed to reconsider the application and requested that Ahmed provide additional documents about the children. While the decision was still pending, the officer wrote in an email to Yafai and Ahmed's attorney that \"your clients do not testify credibly, testify contradictorily, deny the existence of evidence, and otherwise cast doubt on the accuracy of their responses.\" The officer later reaffirmed the visa denial for attempted smuggling under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Yafai and Ahmed subsequently filed suit challenging the denial under the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. They did not contend that the officer's decision resulted from racial, religious, political, or any other kind of bias. Instead, their claim sounds in procedural due process: they maintained that the officer could not deprive Yafai of his liberty interest in bringing his wife to America absent a more detailed explanation for why she is inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Everyone agrees that due process is satisfied if the consular officer provides a \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" reason for his decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kleindienst v. Mandel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p770\">\n    408 U.S. 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 770,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p770\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p770\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972). The dispute is about what it takes to satisfy this standard. Our dissenting colleagues maintain that a consular officer must provide more than a citation to a statutory basis for the denial; in their view, the officer must also be able to point to some factual support for his decision. Unfortunately, that argument is foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   provides the foundational rule: it holds that when the executive offers a \"facially legitimate and bona fide reason\" for denying a visa, courts will not \"look behind the exercise of that discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court reached this result over the dissent's protest that \"[t]here is no basis in the present record for concluding that Mandel's behavior\" violated the statutory provision that the Attorney General cited as the basis for Mandel's exclusion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p770\">\n    at 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p770\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Marshall, J., dissenting);\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p770\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[W]ithout even remanding for a factual hearing to determine whether there is any support for the Attorney General's determination, the majority declares that his reason is sufficient to override the appellees' [constitutional] interests.\"). This is the very same argument that our dissenting colleagues make here: they argue that the consular officer's decision lacks any basis in the record and that he must be able to identify evidentiary support for it. Dissenting Op. at 978-79. Whatever the virtues of that position, we are not at liberty to embrace it. We are bound by the Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   , which held that the Attorney General was not required to identify the factual support for his decision that Mandel was ineligible for admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   If\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   were not clear enough,\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   dispels any doubt about the applicable standard. In\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner contended that the State Department violated her due process right by denying her spouse's visa application with no more explanation than a citation to a statute prohibiting the issuance of visas to those who have engaged in terrorist activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590180\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2128/\">\n    135 S. Ct. at 2139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice Kennedy's concurrence explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Here, the consular officer's determination that Din's husband [Berashk] was ineligible for a visa was controlled by specific statutory factors. The provisions of \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B) establish specific criteria for determining terrorism-related inadmissibility. The consular officer's citation of that provision suffices to show that the denial rested on a determination that Din's husband did not satisfy the statute's requirements.

This statement thus rejects the precise argument that the dissenters advance here: that a consular officer must do more than simply cite to a statute whose provisions refer to discrete factual predicates. Justice Kennedy could not be clearer that the statutory citation\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   suffices to show that the consular officer's decision was\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   facially legitimate and bona fide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Just last year, the Supreme Court described Justice Kennedy's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   as the one to which it has long subscribed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [O]ur opinions have reaffirmed and applied [\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   's] deferential standard of review across different contexts and constitutional claims.

Ct. at 2419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). The dissenters dismiss this passage, arguing that it misunderstands what Justice Kennedy said. But we are not free to treat the Court's understanding of either\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   or Justice Kennedy's opinion so lightly. And in any event, the Court's explanation of Justice Kennedy's approach is accurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In arguing that the Court misunderstood Justice Kennedy's concurrence, the dissenters reason that while Justice Kennedy may have said that a statutory citation is sufficient, the circumstances of\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   show otherwise. They rely on Justice Kennedy's observation that Din admitted in her complaint that Berashk worked for the Taliban government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Din,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590180\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2128/\">\n    135 S. Ct. at 2141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\"Din, moreover, admits in her Complaint that Berashk worked for the Taliban, which even if itself insufficient to support exclusion, provides at least a facial connection to terrorist activity.\"). The dissenters take from this statement that Justice Kennedy treated the statutory citation as sufficient only because \"[t]here can be no doubt that the government's reliance on the statutory terrorism bar\n   <em>\n    encompassed\n   </em>\n   Din's admission that Berashk worked for the Taliban.\" Dissenting Op. at 980.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   There are a number of problems with the dissenters' effort to graft Din's admission onto the test that Justice Kennedy applied. Most significantly, Justice Kennedy himself didn't make it part of the test. He said that citing a statute alone was enough. And neither the\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   dissenters nor the Court in\n   <em>\n    Trump v.

His government work would not have been enough to disqualify him under the statute, so it was unclear whether the officer judged Berashk's work to be something more than he said that it was or whether the officer thought that Berashk had been involved in terrorist activity unrelated to his job.

The latter possibilities do not seem to bother the majority of the full court. Instead, it is content to allow a consular officer to offer a naked citation to a statute, thereby concealing whatever reasons she may have for her decision and insulating herself from any shred of accountability. Even constitutional violations, such as a decision based on racial or religious animus, would be, as a practical matter, immune under the majority's view. Because I view this result as a deeply troubling extension of current law, I dissent from the decision not to rehear this case\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   I begin with a brief word about whose constitutional rights are violated here. The plaintiff, U.S. citizen Mohsin Yafai, is trying to challenge the decision of a consular officer to reject the visa application of his Yemeni-citizen wife, Zahoor Ahmed. The Supreme Court has not yet definitely ruled on the question whether a U.S. citizen has a cognizable liberty interest in living with his or her spouse. In\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   , the Justices split on the question: four Justices would have held that the plaintiff did have such an interest, three maintained that she did not, and two assumed for the sake of argument that such an interest existed but found that she had received all the process that was due to her for purposes of the terrorism bar (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B) ). As our court has done in the past, the panel majority adopted the approach of the concurring Justices in\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   , assuming without\n   deciding that Yafai has a liberty interest in living with his wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   I would go further, as did Judge Ripple in dissent, and hold that Yafai indeed has such a liberty interest, and that it is protected by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. There can be no doubt that he has been personally and adversely affected by the course of events that unfolded. Yafai learned almost nothing about the reasons for the consular officer's refusal to issue the visa for Ahmed. When Ahmed first applied, the consular officer issued a statement accusing her of \"attempting to smuggle children into the United States using the identities Yaqub Mohsin Yafai and Khaled Mohsin Yafai.\" These were two of Yafai and Ahmed's children; tragically, they drowned in an accident on July 8, 2012, while the visa application was still pending. Yafai and Ahmed had no idea why the consular officer thought that smuggling had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Yafai and Ahmed speculated that the officer doubted that the drowned children were biologically related to them. On that supposition, they attempted to supplement the record with corroborating evidence (school records, pre-natal records, immunization records, newspaper articles). But they did not know if this material was pertinent to the consular officer's concerns, nor did they receive any indication that the officer so much as glanced at their new evidence. Instead, the officer issued a second denial that did no more than cite \"section 6(e),\" presumably referring to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(E), the smuggling ground of inadmissibility. The majority decision in this court, and now a majority of the full court, find nothing wrong with this course of events. The panel held that whatever due process rights Yafai might have were satisfied, and that he was not entitled to any more information than he received-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , none-about the factual basis for the consular officer's belief that Ahmed has engaged in smuggling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In dissent, Judge Ripple explained why he thought that due process demanded more than Yafai received in this case. He recognized that this conclusion required him to address the question whether Yafai had a protected liberty interest in living with his wife in the United States. I have nothing to add to his analysis in that respect. His dissent compellingly demonstrates that it would be \"far more compatible with the values of our constitutional tradition\" to recognize such a right than to deny its existence.\n   <em>\n    Yafai,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519619\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/1018/\">\n    912 F.3d at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ripple, J., dissenting).

I concur fully with Judge Ripple's reasoning on this issue. Like him, I would find that the government cannot deny a U.S. citizen the possibility of pursuing a life in the United States with his or her non-citizen spouse without observing the basic requirements of due process. Anything less\n   than that would amount to the right to banish any U.S. citizen with the temerity to marry a non-citizen, without so much as a reason-hardly an outcome that comports with the Constitution, as this court observed more than a century ago. See\n   <em>\n    Moy Suey v.

If I thought that the government had satisfied the demands of due process in this case, I would, like the majority, leave for another day a definitive ruling on the question of a citizen's liberty interest in his spouse's presence in the United States. But by holding that we are compelled to leave unexamined the government's no-admissibility determination, the panel has wiped out our ability to vindicate\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   constitutional claims brought by a U.S. citizen affected by a visa denial.

In order to explain why the government fell short of the constitutional minimum of due process in this case, I return briefly to the underlying facts. As I noted earlier, Yafai is a U.S. citizen trying to obtain a visa for his non-citizen wife, Zahoor Ahmed. He filed the proper I-130 petitions on behalf of Ahmed and the couple's children, but the consular officer in Yemen denied the application. The officer wrote that the denial was based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(E), which renders inadmissible \"[a]ny alien who at any time knowingly has encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of the law.\" The officer further asserted that Ahmed \"attempted to smuggle two children into the United States using the identities Yaqub Mohsin Yafai and Khaled Mohsin Yafai.\" The officer did not identify any factual basis whatsoever for that contention, nor can one be found in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The record does indicate, and Yafai\n   <em>\n    freely admitted\n   </em>\n   , that the couple had indeed applied for visas on behalf of two children with those names. Yafai and Ahmed explained that these were in fact their children, but that the children had drowned while their applications were pending. Yafai and Ahmed were also seeking visas for their other children. Despite the consular officer's denial of\n   <em>\n    Ahmed\n   </em>\n   '\n   <em>\n    s\n   </em>\n   visa on the basis of the alleged attempt to smuggle Yaqub and Khaled into the United States, most of the other children received U.S. visas or passports. The consular officer did not explain what it was that justified distinguishing\n   among the couple's children. Nor did the officer offer even a hint about the basis on which she drew the conclusion that Ahmed's inclusion of Yaqub and Khaled in the application amounted to a violation of Section 1182(a)(6)(E) rather than an honest attempt to obtain visas for two of her children who were alive at the time of her application but who later died. Neither Yafai nor we have any idea whether the officer thought that Yafai and Ahmed had\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   had two children named Yaqub and Khaled, or if the officer thought that those two children had existed but were somehow ineligible for admission, or if the parents were trying to smuggle two different children into the United States, or if the officer had some other concern. That information void made it effectively impossible for Yafai to present an effective rebuttal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   He did try, however. In his petition for rehearing in this court, Yafai says that \"[i]t appears that the consular officer determined with no known basis, that the drowned children were not biologically related to Ms. Ahmed ....\" Petition for Rehearing at 7. On the assumption that this was the problem-though again, they were left to guess-Yafai and Ahmed tried to respond by adducing a significant amount of evidence showing that Yaqub and Khaled were their biological offspring. That evidence included pre-natal records, immunization records, and school records. An embassy fraud-prevention manager acknowledged receipt of the additional evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the end, Yafai's efforts were unavailing. Several months later the consular officer reaffirmed the initial denial, citing the same statutory provision, again without any explanation or even a hint that the records had been reviewed and rejected, reviewed and found irrelevant, or thrown away. The consular officer offered only a mysterious comment on Yafai and Ahmed's credibility, but the comment is singularly unhelpful. It has the ring of boilerplate: \"your clients do not testify, testify contradictorily, deny the existence of evidence, and otherwise cast doubt on the accuracy of their responses.\" Which is it: A failure to testify? Testimony that contained contradictions? Refusal to accept incontrovertible evidence? Shiftiness or some other reason to find them not worthy of belief? Who knows? The only thing that is apparent is that the officer's comment is no more illuminating than silence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Yafai challenged the consular officer's decision in the district court, which ruled against him; he then appealed to this court. The panel majority found that the government had done enough by citing a particular section of the statute, ( section 1182(a)(6)(E) ), which for all we can tell was selected randomly. The panel held that the consular officer \"need not disclose the underlying facts that led him to conclude that the statute [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the inadmissibility ground] was satisfied.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519619\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/1018/\">\n    912 F.3d at 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It was enough, the majority thought, for the officer to provide \"a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for denying Ahmed's application,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519619\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/1018/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and the majority accepted that the officer's stated reason for denial met that standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   At that point, both the majority's opinion and its supplemental statement on the petition for rehearing en banc become hard to follow. On the one hand, the majority asserts in both places that it is forbidden to look behind the stated reason. Yet it concedes that a facially legitimate decision might have been made in bad faith,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519619\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/1018/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1022 ; rehearing statement at 10-11, and if it was, that would be a reason to reject it. But the majority leaves the applicant with no ability to ferret out bad faith. We know this because the majority finds nothing in the unexplained decision in Yafai's case that supports even an inquiry\n   into bad faith. It is impossible to discover bad faith (which includes a disingenuous explanation designed to cover up arbitrariness) without some consideration of the underlying facts-here, the reason why the officer thought that the children were being smuggled. No applicant would ever be able to make \"an affirmative showing of bad faith on the part of the consular officer,\"\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   , 135 S. Ct. at 2141 (Kennedy, J., concurring), without a right to a comprehensible description of the information on which the officer relied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Unlike the majority, I do not believe that this limited inquiry would put us on a slippery slope that ends up in plenary review of consular decisions. Other areas of the law provide examples of highly deferential review of factual findings. The majority's supplemental opinion notes the uncontroversial proposition going back at least as far as\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    424 U.S. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976), that due process is context-specific. I have no quarrel with that. My point is only that when a constitutionally protected liberty interest is at stake, as I believe it is here,\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   process is due. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   contradicts that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In the visa-issuance context, I accept that the process due is at the minimal end of the spectrum. Moreover, this is not the only area in which substantial deference to executive authorities is appropriate. Another such area is the prison-disciplinary setting. There, we ask only that the officer be able to point to \"some evidence\" that supports the critical finding. See\n   <em>\n    Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst., Walpole v.

A comparable light touch would be appropriate here-just enough to ensure that there was a permissible basis for the consular officer's action. The Constitution and laws of this country require no less, as Judge Ripple explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   We cannot forget, however, that Congress has given the Judiciary the obligation to curb arbitrary action.

We have the responsibility to ensure that such decisions, when born of laziness, prejudice or bureaucratic inertia, do not stand.

There can be no doubt that the government's reliance on the statutory terrorism bar\n   <em>\n    encompassed\n   </em>\n   Din's admission that Berashk worked for the Taliban. We know from the two concurring Justices and the four dissenting Justices that the\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   Court had before it basic information about the factual predicates underlying the consular officer's decision.

My colleagues therefore significantly overstate the case when they assert that\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   \"held that the Attorney General was not required to identify the factual support for his decision to show that Mandel was ineligible for admission.\" Such a statement can be found nowhere in the Court's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Similarly, the government identified factual material supporting the visa denials in our court's earlier decisions in\n   <em>\n    Hazama,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277550\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/706/\">\n    851 F.3d at 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (undisputed evidence of rock-throwing) and\n   <em>\n    Morfin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277555\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/710/\">\n    851 F.3d at 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (indisputable indictment for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute).

The same cannot be said for this case, in which-for the first time-we endorse a visa denial that for all we know was based on no real-world facts at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   My dispute with the majority turns largely on the meaning and importance of the phrase \"facially legitimate and bona fide.\" Given the facts in\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   , along with Justice Kennedy's statement in\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   that the government had relied upon a \"bona fide\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   basis\" for the denial of Berashk's visa, 135 S. Ct. at 2140 (emphasis added), I take \"bona fide\" to mean derived from actual facts rather than invented out of whole cloth. In the absence of such facts, the agency's mere citation of a statutory ground usually says nothing about whether it has done what the statute requires. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , this does not mean that the consular officer must open her entire file to the disappointed applicant. She must merely point to, or at least describe, some evidence supporting the key conclusions she drew and link that evidence to the admissibility determination. And when undisputed facts in the record already provide \"at least a facial connection\" to the factual predicates in the cited statutory ground for inadmissibility-as in\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   -it is possible that no further explanation would be required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The scope of the court's review will be narrow, as it typically is when the law gives an executive or administrative officer wide discretion.

But in either circumstance, as long as the consular simply affixed a one-sentence accusation that cited \"smuggling\" as the ground for inadmissibility under the statute, the noncitizen would have no way of knowing that the decision had no basis in fact, and thus no way of challenging it for arbitrariness, unlawfulness, or bad faith.

Who is to say, if the officer points to nothing supporting the accusation? Yafai and Ahmed tried to assuage the officer's concerns, but for all we know the officer never bothered to look at their supplemental information.

As it had done before, it took care to save the issue now before us for another day.

But the Government has suggested that it may be appropriate here for the inquiry to extend beyond the facial neutrality of the order.... For our purposes today, we assume that we may look behind the face of the Proclamation to the extent of applying rational basis review. That standard of review considers whether the entry policy is plausibly related to the Government's stated objective to protect the country and improve vetting processes.... As a result, we may consider\n   plaintiffs' extrinsic evidence, but will uphold the policy so long as it can reasonably be understood to result from a justification in-dependent of unconstitutional grounds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/#p2419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/#p2419\">\n    at 2420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/#p2419\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   I take several points away from this passage, and from\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   as a whole. First, consular nonreviewability is not a jurisdictional doctrine. Second, the Court adheres to the basic holdings of\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   , insofar as they require a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for the visa decision. Third, the Court has continued to look behind the surface of the executive action to see if it results from \"a justification independent of unconstitutional grounds.\" What the Court did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   do in\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   , was to hold (as our panel majority does) that it was\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to stop with the president's Proclamation and refuse to look at the underlying facts, because the judiciary is categorically barred from doing so. The panel's opinion in our case thus breaks new ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The right to demonstrate bad faith is empty if an applicant for the spousal visa has no right to know anything about the information on which the consular officer relied. Due process demands more than this, and the system will not crumble if we follow our constitutional commands. At its root, due process requires that the person subject to a governmental action be given enough information to be able to know what the accusation against her is. A regime in which the consular official can just say \"no,\" and the U.S.-citizen spouse must guess both about the accusation that supposedly supported that decision and-critically-what facts lay behind the \"no,\" is not worthy of this country. I dissent from our court's denial of rehearing\n   <em>\n    en banc.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    We are unsure why our dissenting colleagues say that \"[w]e know from the two concurring Justices and the four dissenting Justices that the\n    <em>\n     Din\n    </em>\n    Court had before it basic information about the factual predicates underlying the consular officer's decision.\" Dissenting Op. at 980. Din disclosed the fact of Berashk's government job in the complaint that she filed in the district court, and the United States offered no information about the role that the job played-if any-in its decision. And even if it were permissible for us to piece together a test by counting heads in the\n    <em>\n     Din\n    </em>\n    concurrences and dissents, the concurring and dissenting justices had no common ground on this point. The dissenters thought that the process was constitutionally inadequate because \"the State Department's reason did not set forth any factual basis for the Government's decision.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2146 (Breyer, J., dissenting). The concurrence thought that a factual basis was unnecessary.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2141 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\"\n    <em>\n     Mandel\n    </em>\n    instructs us not to 'look behind' the Government's exclusion of Berashk for additional factual details beyond what its express reliance on \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B) encompassed.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Before this court, the government points to a passage in\n    <em>\n     Trump v.

His comment was particular to the terrorism ground for inadmissibility and it relied on the fact that the Court was able to identify relevant factual materials in the record connecting the statutory ground to the decision-for example, the admission that the spouse worked for the Taliban. Here, even if section 1182(a)(6)(E) also identifies potential factual predicates, the record contains no information to see if any of those predicates exists.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
