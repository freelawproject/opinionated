The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   sentenced Carson to 20 years of imprisonment followed by a life term of supervised release. Carson appeals, arguing the district court failed to explain the basis for his life term of supervised release and erred in imposing certain special conditions on his supervision. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2013, an FBI officer downloaded child pornography from two IP addresses assigned to a residence associated with Carson. FBI officers executed a search warrant at the residence, where Carson admitted to using a file sharing program to download and share child pornography. He also admitted to using his cellphone to take pictures of himself and a sixteen-year-old girl having sex. The officers seized Carson's electronics (a laptop, cell phone, and hard drive), on which they discovered 593 still images and 99 videos mostly depicting child bondage and bestiality, including a horrifying image of a female infant being raped by an adult male. Carson also later admitted to exchanging sexually-explicit photos with five girls between the ages of fourteen and seventeen and emailing child pornography to a sixth girl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Carson pled guilty to one count of receiving child pornography and two counts of attempting to distribute child pornography in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), and one count of possessing child pornography in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). The district court imposed the statutory maximum prison term on each count but allowed them to run concurrently, resulting in a total prison term of 20 years - 10 years below Carson's advisory range under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (the \"Guidelines\"). The district court also imposed a life term of supervised release with 13 standard and 17 special conditions. Carson appeals the life term of supervised release and three of the special conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Carson argues the district court committed procedural error by imposing a life term of supervised release without considering the relevant sentencing factors under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and without explaining the basis for so long a term.

Indeed, federal law provides that in determining the length of supervised release, a district court must consider many of the same \u00a7 3553(a) factors underlying a defendant's term of imprisonment, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need to protect the public, and the need to provide the defendant with effective correctional treatment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 3583(c).

The district court referenced the nature and circumstances of Carson's offense, noting his offense conduct included the \"somewhat unique\" aggravating factors of distributing child pornography to a minor and engaging in a pattern of activity involving the sexual exploitation of minors. The district court discussed Carson's history and characteristics, granting a downward variance on the prison term because of Carson's lack of criminal history, the fact he pled guilty, and the fact he received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The district court's sentence mirrored the recommendations it reviewed in the government's sentencing memorandum,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which analyzed five of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At the sentencing hearing, Carson disputed the government's recommended 20 years of imprisonment but chose not to dispute the recommended life term of supervised release. The government made these recommendations in its sentencing memorandum, relying heavily on Carson's deviant sexual interest in child bondage and bestiality and his demonstrated willingness to sexually exploit minors - along with a concomitant likelihood of recidivism. The district court told the parties it had reviewed the government's memorandum, and Carson's counsel acknowledged that Carson might be on supervised release \"perhaps for the rest of his life and he accepts that.\" In light of the entire sentencing record, we cannot say the district court's brief explanation for\n   Carson's sentence (including his term of supervised release) was plainly erroneous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Carson also challenges three special conditions of his supervised release: Special Condition 6, to the extent it prohibits \"possess[ing]\" or \"hav[ing] under his control any matter that is pornographic/erotic\"; Special Condition 14, which prohibits \"possess[ing] or us[ing] any computer or electronic device with access to any 'on-line computer service' without the prior approval of the Probation Office\"; and Special Condition 16, which prohibits \"maintain[ing] or creat[ing] a user account on any social networking site ... that allows access to persons under the age of 18, or allows for the exchange of sexually-explicit material, chat conversations, or instant messaging.\" Special Condition 16 also prohibits \"view[ing] and/or access[ing] any web profile users under the age of 18.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Ordinarily, '[t]erms and conditions of supervised release are reviewed for abuse of discretion.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, since Carson did not object at sentencing to any of the special conditions he now challenges on appeal, we review his claims for plain error.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Carson first argues that all three challenged conditions involve a greater deprivation of liberty than reasonably necessary and that Special Condition 6 is also unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. For example, he argues Special Condition 6 (banning possession of \"any matter that is pornographic/erotic\") reaches depictions of non-obscene nudity and material that merely alludes to sexual activity, in conflict with previous decisions of this court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He argues Special Condition 14 (effectively prohibiting internet access without prior approval from the probation office) cannot be applied for\n   <em>\n    life\n   </em>\n   to a mere possessor of child pornography. Finally, he argues Special Condition 16 (restricting social media access) conflicts with the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Packingham v. North Carolina\n   </em>\n   holding that a North Carolina statute making it a felony for registered sex offenders to access social media web sites violated the First Amendment. --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/\">\n    137 S.

We recently rejected the same overbreadth and vagueness challenges to a condition prohibiting a defendant from, among other things, \"possess[ing]\" or \"us[ing]\" \"any form of erotica or pornographic materials.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We have also previously deemed a condition involving a ban on viewing erotica as distinct from invalid bans on materials containing \"nudity\" (which could reach protected forms of art).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, Carson admitted to exchanging sexually explicit photos with five girls younger than eighteen and emailing child pornography to a sixth girl.

Further, Carson admitted to exchanging sexually-explicit photographs with several girls younger than eighteen - at least one with whom he had a sexual relationship and another of whom he admitted meeting on a social media site.

Here, the district court did not provide any explanation for why it chose to impose a lifetime term of supervised release or any of its seventeen special conditions. Rather than speculate from the district court's silence, I would vacate this portion of Carson's sentence and remand to allow the district court to provide that explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A few particular aspects of the court's opinion give me pause. The first is its conclusion that the district court's evaluation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining the length of Carson's imprisonment also satisfied its obligations under \u00a7 3583(c). Section 3583(c) directs district courts to consider some, but not all, of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when \"determining the length of the term and the conditions of supervised release.\" Under certain circumstances, it may be appropriate for a district court to simply refer back to its previous analysis when explaining its decision to impose a particular supervised release term. But here, the district court's explanation for the incarceration portion of its sentence does not explain its chosen term of supervised release. For the prison term, the court varied downward from the bottom of the Guidelines range by ten years, largely based on Carson's mitigating factors, including that he was a first-time offender and had accepted responsibility for his offenses. The court's explanation for its substantial downward variance does not readily explain its decision to impose the maximum possible term of supervised release. This is simply not a case where \"[o]ne overarching explanation\" adequately explains both aspects of the sentence.\n   <em>\n    Moose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517430\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/893/951/#p960\">\n    893 F.3d at 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court also excuses the district court's plain error in failing to make any of the individualized findings necessary to justify its special conditions of supervised release. \"When crafting a special condition of supervised release, the district court must make an individualized inquiry into the facts and circumstances underlying a case and make sufficient findings on the record so as to ensure that the special condition satisfies the statutory requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Wiedower\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4095121\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/490/#p493\">\n    634 F.3d at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). Such findings are necessary to ensure that the conditions imposed are \"reasonably related to \u00a7 3553(a) factors, involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary, and are consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the United States Sentencing Commission.\"\n   <em>\n    Goettsch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086200\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1169/#p1171\">\n    812 F.3d at 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The court reasons that the need for each of the three challenged special conditions is sufficiently evident from the record. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Special Condition 14, for example, broadly prohibits Carson from possessing or using \"any computer or electronic device with access to any 'on-line computer service' without the prior approval of the Probation Office.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   While we have previously upheld internet restrictions for offenders who distributed child pornography, we have been careful to tailor the restrictions to the offender's particular circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stults\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034096\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/834/#p856\">\n    575 F.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 856 (8th Cir. 2009). Read literally, Carson could violate Special Condition 14 by accessing any number of internet-connected household devices, from thermostats to doorbells. I trust that the U.S. Probation Office will judiciously exercise its discretion in enforcing this prohibition. But the sheer breadth of discretion afforded to the Probation Office only underscores the need for the district court to conduct a careful, individualized inquiry before imposing a condition that some courts have described as \"lifetime cybernetic banishment.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Voelker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3484627\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/139/#p148\">\n    489 F.3d 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148 (3d Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Without any analysis by the district court, it is also hard to conclude that Special Condition 16 is justified. The court distinguishes Packingham, which invalidated a similar restriction on access to social media on First Amendment grounds, by limiting that case to post-custodial restrictions. But even if Special Condition 16 is not unconstitutional, it does not necessarily follow that the condition is justified in Carson's case. The condition specifically prohibits Carson from creating a user account on any \"social networking site\" that minors may access. The term \"social networking site\" is not defined, and in\n   <em>\n    Packingham\n   </em>\n   the Court acknowledged that the term \"commercial social networking site\" could potentially apply \"not only to commonplace social media websites but also to websites as varied as Amazon.com, Washingtonpost.com, and Webmd.com.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/\">\n    137 S. Ct. at 1736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, I have confidence that the Probation Office would not take such an unreasonably broad view of Special Condition 16, but the condition's plain language offers little to circumscribe its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   I do not minimize the seriousness of Carson's crimes. For those he will serve a twenty-year prison term followed by a lengthy term of supervised release. I also recognize the need to monitor Carson's conduct upon release. But Carson was thirty-three at the time of his arrest, and his lifetime term of supervised release could very well last decades. We can only imagine the universe of internet-reliant electronic devices that will pervade everyday life by then. The length and conditions of Carson's supervised release may well be justified, but such punishment deserves, at minimum, some reasoned explanation from the sentencing court. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    This is also not a case where the district court merely provided a \"relatively brief\" explanation for its decision and \"decide[d] simply to apply the Guidelines.\"\n    <em>\n     Roberson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3656995\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/517/990/#p994\">\n     517 F.3d at 994\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (cleaned up).
