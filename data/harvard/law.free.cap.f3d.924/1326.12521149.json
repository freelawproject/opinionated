But this is not an ordinary case. The proposition that the custody of a child does not ultimately involve a matter of public concern is untenable, particularly so given the statutes and precedents of the state of Colorado, which expressly and dispositively announce the public policy of the state as being directly to the contrary. The further proposition that local governments may sanction employees for testifying on such matters in the public courts and tribunals of this circuit is a dangerous and highly corrosive precedent-the adversary system depends on free and open adjudication in which parties have a right to call witnesses to testify on their behalf and witnesses, be\n   they public or private employees, have the right and duty to testify when called in the open courts of our circuit. The precedent announced by this panel, which allows local governments to interfere with both the rights of litigants and witnesses and in which the local government has\n   <em>\n    no concern\n   </em>\n   , must not be allowed to stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   There is an existing circuit split on the extent to which the constitution protects sworn testimony in judicial proceedings.

The present case demonstrates and underlines the consequence of any error in the analysis of the public/private dichotomy because if the speech is declared to be private, as the panel majority has done here, that conclusion is being utilized as the rationale and justification for interference with purely private speech.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The velocity of the present jurisprudential path needs to be corrected.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    These facts are taken from the complaint. Because this case is before the court at the motion-to-dismiss stage, the plausible factual allegations of the complaint are accepted as true, and viewed in the light most favorable to Butler.\n    <em>\n     Straub v.

I disagree that testimony on the suitability of a potential guardian presented by a character witness does not constitute speech on a public concern in light of Colorado's express statements to the contrary regarding the placement of children in custody proceedings. But even accepting the argument of the panel at face value places us at odds with other circuits.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Alpha Energy Savers, Inc. v.
