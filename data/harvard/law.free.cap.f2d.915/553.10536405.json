Gallardo appeals three alleged errors in his jury trial. He argues that Gutierrez was called as a witness in order to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence, that the government introduced evidence of Gutierrez\u2019s guilty plea for illegitimate and highly prejudicial purposes and that the government elicited prejudicial and irrelevant evidence of Gallardo\u2019s drug use. We reverse the conviction and remand for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">On the basis of an investigation by Agent James Baker with the assistance of an informant, \u201cLucky\u201d Vrell, the government alleged that Gallardo, the appellant, and Gutierrez conspired to distribute cocaine between September 23 and 27, 1988. Gutierrez pled guilty to this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The government\u2019s case against Gallardo was based on the testimony of Vrell, Baker and Gutierrez. Vrell testified that he had participated in drug deals with Gallardo and Gutierrez and that they were supposed to complete a deal on the night of September 27, 1988. Vrell also testified that he had used cocaine with Gallardo. On direct examination Vrell stated that he had not talked to Gallardo at all about the September 27 deal, although he recanted that statement on redirect.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Agent Baker testified at the trial that he had overheard a conversation between Vrell and a man who identified himself as Emilio arranging a drug deal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Baker also stated that he had surveyed Vrell\u2019s house on September 27 and that he had seen Gallardo arrive and spend about three hours. When Gallardo left the house Baker arrested him. Gallardo had no drugs in his possession and no cocaine connected to the alleged conspiracy was ever found.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Prior to Gallardo\u2019s trial, the government told the court that it did not expect Gutierrez to agree to testify. On the final day of trial, the government asked to call Gutierrez out of the presence of the jury. Under oath Gutierrez te\u00e1'^ified that he knew Gal-lardo. He admitted participating in one cocaine deal with Vrell but claimed that he had never participated in any cocaine transaction with Gallardo. Gutierrez stated that on September 27 his car was overheating and he had called Gallardo to meet him at Vrell\u2019s house to give him a ride.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the basis of this testimony the government decided to call Gutierrez.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">On the stand in the presence of the jury, Gutierrez first testified that he had pled guilty to a conspiracy with the defendant to distribute cocaine. Gutierrez then repeated his testimony from earlier in the day, including his assertions of Gallardo\u2019s innocence and that Gallardo was at Vrell\u2019s house only because of the overheating car.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">The government had three witnesses impeach Gutierrez\u2019s testimony and character. Agent Perry Skipton testified as to statements made by Gutierrez involving a different proposed sale of cocaine. Agent Bruce Stubbs testified about Gutierrez\u2019s involvement in a scheme to trade machine guns for cocaine. The government never claimed that Gallardo was involved in either of the schemes described by Agent Skipton and Agent Stubbs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally Agent Samuel Soto testified that he had driven the car Gutierrez claimed was overheating and that there was no indication of any mechanical difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">The defense presented no evidence, arguing only that the government had not proven its case. The defense did not object to the government calling Gutierrez as a witness, to the admission of his guilty plea into evidence or to the introduction into evidence of appellant\u2019s use of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">In closing arguments, the government stated that no question existed as to Gutierrez\u2019s guilt. It reviewed all the evidence in the case, closely examining Gutierrez\u2019s testimony and urging the jury to reject it as false. The jury convicted Gallardo. He was sentenced to 97 months imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>to be followed by three years of supervised release. He timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Because none of the issues on appeal was raised before the district court, we employ a plain error standard of review. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>876 F.2d 774, 777 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 179, 107 L.Ed.2d 135 (1989); Fed.R.Evid. 103(d). Under this standard, we notice errors only if they affect substantial rights. <em>United States v. Bustillo, </em>789 F.2d 1364, 1367 (9th Cir.1986). \u201cThus, in the absence of timely objection, only those errors that seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings will be corrected by this court.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>790 F.2d 789, 793 (9th Cir.1986) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">II. Government\u2019s Impeachment of Gutierrez</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">Gallardo claims that the government called Gutierrez as a witness for the sole purpose of impeaching him with otherwise inadmissible evidence. The defendant also argues that this was a highly prejudicial error requiring reversal even under the plain error standard. The government claims it called Gutierrez to \u201cfacilitate[ ] its proof of the elements of the crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">Federal Rule of Evidence 607 permits the government to impeach its own witness. However, \u201cthe government must not knowingly elicit testimony from a witness in order to impeach him with otherwise inadmissible testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitson, </em>587 F.2d 948, 952-53 (9th Cir.1978); <em>Kuhn v. United States, </em>24 F.2d 910, 913 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>278 U.S. 605, 49 S.Ct. 11, 73 L.Ed. 533 (1928). \u201c[T]he maximum legitimate effect of the impeaching testimony can never be more than the cancellation of the adverse answer by which the party is surprised.\u201d <em>United States v. Crouch, </em>731 F.2d 621, 623 (9th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1105, 105 S.Ct. 778, 83 L.Ed.2d 773 (1985) (internal quotations omitted). That is, impeachment is not permitted where it is \u201cemployed as a guise for submitting to the jury substantive evidence that is otherwise unavailable.\u201d <em>United States v. Peterman, </em>841 F.2d 1474, 1479 (10th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 1004, 109 S.Ct. 783, 102 L.Ed.2d 774 (1989) (internal quotations omitted); <em>United States v. Webster, </em>734 F.2d 1191, 1192 (7th Cir.1984) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">In evaluating the reason a witness is called, we determine whether the government examined the witness for the <em>primary </em>purpose of placing before the jury substantive evidence which is not otherwise admissible. <em>United States v. Hogan, </em>763 F.2d 697, 702 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Peterman, </em>841 F.2d at 1479.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">After carefully reviewing the trial transcript, we are convinced that the government did call Gutierrez for the primary purpose of impeaching him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In determining the government\u2019s purpose, we examine its use of the evidence during the trial rather than any post-trial explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-18\">The government argues that Gutierrez\u2019s testimony was intended to corroborate Vrell\u2019s testimony. Although part of Gutierrez\u2019s testimony did so corroborate, a review of the transcript indicates that the government did not use the testimony for corroborative purposes at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-19\">In closing argument the government did not rely on Gutierrez\u2019s testimony in support of its case, but instead urged the jury to consider him a liar. At one point, the prosecutor specifically argued, \u201cif you don\u2019t believe the testimony of Jose Delacruz-Gutierrez ... then you\u2019re entitled to conclude that the defendant was here to do a deal.\u201d Later in closing argument, the government reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-20\">Has the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant conspired to distribute cocaine? Jose Delacruz-Gutierrez says no, that there was no conspiracy. Do you accept his testimony? Does it hang together? Does it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>correspond to common sense or does it sound like he\u2019s just trying to get a buddy out of trouble?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-3\">Moreover, the government cannot claim that it intended to use Gutierrez\u2019s testimony to prove its case but was surprised by his testimony; it knew in advance that Gutierrez would testify falsely.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">In sum, Gutierrez\u2019s testimony that the prosecution now claims was material in its proof of the case was never so argued to the jury. Instead, the government thoroughly discredited his testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On this basis, and in light of the testimony itself, we are compelled to conclude that the government called Gutierrez for the primary purpose of impeaching Gutierrez\u2019s credibility to prove the substance of the charges against Gallardo. This is an illegitimate purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We also find that the government\u2019s actions reached the level of plain error. The government\u2019s case was weak: Gallardo had not been caught with any cocaine; there was evidence he spoke no English and could not have discussed the transaction with Special Agent Baker or understood the conversations with Gutierrez and Vrell; and Vrell had contradicted himself on the stand. The government\u2019s ability to bring in Gutierrez\u2019s testimony, to question him about unrelated crimes and to show that his defense of Gallardo was false was crucial to the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Moreover, the government\u2019s actions directly undermined the judicial process. The government is obligated to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt; the defendant has no concomitant obligation to prove a defense. In the instant case, Gallardo chose to provide no defense theory or witnesses but to argue only that the government had failed to prove its case. The government, however, created a defense theory and alibi for him in order to prove his guilt by refuting it. The adversarial system breaks down when the defendant is prevented from defining and presenting his own case and the prosecution proves guilt by creating and then destroying its own creation. This type of error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity [and] public reputation of judicial proceedings,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>790 F.2d at 193, and thus must be reversed even under a plain error standard of review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">III. Admission of Prior Drug Use</p>\n<p id=\"ATu\">The defendant claims that the government violated Federal Rule of Evidence 403 by eliciting evidence of the defendant smoking cocaine with Gutierrez.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Rule 403 permits the exclusion of relevant evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury\u201d. F.R.Evid. 403. The evidence at issue was elicited during Vrell\u2019s direct examination. Vrell was discussing how drug deals were done and how he would smoke the cocaine during a deal. The government attorney asked Vrell if anybody else smoked it. Vrell answered, \u201cOh yes.\u201d The government attorney asked, \u201cWho?\u201d. Vrell answered, \u201cEmilio and Jose.\u201d The defendant\u2019s drug use was not discussed further.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">In their briefs the government and appellant debate whether the evidence simply \u201csmear[ed] his character\u201d or was probative of motive. We need not resolve whether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>not the evidence was more prejudicial than probative, however, because we find that even if admission of the evidence did violate Rule 403, it was not a \u201chighly prejudicial error affecting substantial rights.\u201d <em>Bustillo, </em>789 F.2d at 1367 (internal quotations omitted). The mention of Gallardo\u2019s drug use was minimal; the government did not refer to it again after Vrell\u2019s statement and it was not an integral part of the government\u2019s case. Defendant has offered no reason to believe that this alleged error resulted in a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we find that the admission of drug use did not reach the level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that calling Gutierrez as a witness constituted plain error. Accordingly, we reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial. We also find that the introduction of evidence of defendant\u2019s drug use was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\">. The conversation took place in English. The evidence indicates that Gallardo spoke only Spanish.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\">. Gutierrez claimed he began having car trouble in Ellensberg, Washington and that he had called Gallardo in Yakima, Washington to request that Gallardo drive to Seattle and wait at Vrell\u2019s house. Apparently the distances between these cities makes this story obviously implausible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-15\">.On the night of September 27, Gutierrez had been arrested in possession of two kilograms of cocaine and charged with conspiracy. This conspiracy involved a trade of cocaine for machine guns. Gutierrez pled guilty to this conspiracy as well as the separate conspiracy allegedly involving the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b651-14\">. Unfortunately, because the defense did not object at trial, Judge Rothstein never had the opportunity to decide whether the government called Gutierrez for an impermissible purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\">.Before testifying at the trial, Gutierrez was brought to the stand and testified under oath outside the presence of the jury. In that testimony he repeatedly stated that he had not agreed with the defendant to distribute cocaine. He also told the same story about his overheating car that he told during the trial. It is undisputed that the government was not surprised by Gutierrez's testimony. Thus, contrary to the principle stated in <em>Crouch, </em>the impeaching testimony went well beyond a \"cancellation of the adverse answer by which the party is surprised.\u201d <em>Crouch, </em>731 F.2d at 623. <em>Cf. Webster, </em>734 F.2d at 1192, 1193 (finding that because prosecutor had no idea what witness would say in advance and judge refused to allow her to examine the witness outside the presence of the jury, the court could not hold that impeachment was mere subterfuge).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b652-13\">. The only portion of Gutierrez\u2019s testimony that the government asked- the jury to believe was that he was guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b652-14\">. Because we find that the government improperly called Gutierrez as a witness, we need not determine whether it was error to introduce the guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
