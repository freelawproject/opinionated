Because we find that the record as a whole supports the denial of benefits, and the Secretary applied the proper legal standards in evaluating the evidence, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-26\">Felix Reyes was 52 years old at the time of his hearing before the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>law judge. He has a fifth grade education, but can read and write in both English and Spanish. He has worked as a painter, brick layer, carpenter, and as a machine operator in a wood workshop where he cut parts for doors and cabinets. Reyes currently lives with his daughter and her family. He helps with household chores, frequently walks fifteen blocks into town, and fishes in a nearby river. At the hearing, he testified that he can walk up to twenty-five blocks, and lift up to sixty pounds with pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Reyes was first admitted to the Shannon West Texas Memorial Hospital on August 8, 1986. He complained of headaches, nausea, imbalance, and slow speech. Doctors noted a history of hypertension, and a cranial CAT scan showed a left hemisphere subdural hematoma. He underwent a bur hole operation to drain the hematoma, and was discharged without headache, speech deficits, or hemiparesis. He was rehospi-talized several days later, and doctors explored the bur hole site to further drain the hematoma. Dr. R. LeGrand saw Reyes for follow up treatments on September 4,1986, and again on November 20, 1986, and reported that Reyes was doing well, that there was no evidence of hemiparesis, and that Reyes did not complain of any headaches. Reyes has not sought any further medical treatment for this head injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Reyes was hospitalized a third time on March 30, 1988 after vomiting some blood. Doctors found a tear at the,esophagogas-tric junction and successfully treated him with medication. Reyes has also not sought further medical treatment for this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Reyes filed an application for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act on November 10, 1987, alleging that he had been disabled since August 14,1986, due to a stroke and hypertension. He also applied for supplemental security income under Title XVI of the Social Security Act with a protective filing date of October 14, 1987. After his claims were denied at the initial and reconsideration levels, Reyes requested a hearing which was held on December 14, 1988. At the hearing, Reyes testified that he suffers from chronic dizziness and headaches. He also testified that he attempted work in 1987 and 1988, but both times became sick and had to be taken home.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The AU also considered the results of consultative physical and psychological examinations which the Social Security Administration requested. Dr. J. Read performed the physical examination, which revealed only a high blood pressure reading of 190/100 and a previous head injury. At the time of the examination, Reyes told Dr. Read that he could not tolerate bright sunlight because it caused headaches and drowsiness and that he had an episode of chest pain a month earlier. Dr. Jarvis Wright and J. Berkshire performed the psychological evaluation; they reported borderline intellectual functioning and no other significant mental impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The Secretary\u2019s regulations set forth a five-step sequential process for evaluating disability claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">(1) Is the claimant working?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">(2) Does the claimant have a severe impairment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-12\">(3) Does the impairment meet or equal an impairment listed in Appendix 1? (If so, disability is automatic.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-13\">(4) Does the impairment prevent the claimant from doing past relevant work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-14\">(5) Does the impairment prevent the claimant from doing any other work?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-15\"><em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520 and 416.920 (1990); and <em>Chaparro v. Bowen, </em>815 F.2d 1008, 1010 (5th Cir.1987). The AU found that Reyes was not disabled at the fourth step because he could perform his previous work as a machine operator, and the Appeals Council declined to review his determination. In reviewing Reyes\u2019 claims, we must decide whether the record contains substantial evidence in support of the AU\u2019s decision, and whether the AU applied the proper legal standards in evaluating the evidence. <em>Moore v. Sullivan, </em>895 F.2d 1065, 1070 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><em>Reyes </em>first claims that the Secretary disregarded his hypertension because it did not result in end organ damage, citing <em>Parker v. Bowen, </em>793 F.2d 1177 (11th Cir.1986), and <em>Martin v. Secretary of Dept. of Health, Ed. &amp; Welf, </em>492 F.2d 905 (4th Cir.1974). In <em>Parker, </em>the hypertension issue arose in the second step of the evaluation process. The Eleventh Circuit held only that hypertension can be a severe impairment even without significant end organ damage. <em>Parker, </em>793 F.2d at 1180-81. Because the AU proceeded to the third step in evaluating Reyes\u2019 claim, we must infer that the AU found a severe impairment. <em>Mays v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1362, 1364 (5th Cir.1988); and <em>Moon v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 472, 473 (5th Cir.1987). Thus, <em>Parker </em>is inapplicable to this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"><em>Martin </em>also does not support Reyes\u2019 claim. In this case, the Fourth Circuit held that the Secretary cannot make end organ damage an exclusive pre-condition to the establishment of a disability due to hypertension under the fourth step. <em>Martin, </em>492 F.2d at 909-910. There is no indication that the AU did so in Reyes\u2019 case\u2014the absence of end organ damage precluded a finding of impairment under the third step, but the AU did not make this fact an exclusive basis for his finding under the fourth step. The AU refers to the absence of end organ damage under the fourth step, but puts more emphasis on the general \u201cpaucity of objective medical evidence.\u201d Unlike in <em>Martin, </em>there is substantial evidence from which the AU could conclude that Reyes\u2019 hypertension does not prevent him from performing his past relevant work. <em>See id. </em>at 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Reyes next claims that the AU\u2019s finding that he could perform his past relevant work as a machine operator is not supported by substantial evidence. He points to his allegations of hypertension, dizziness, lack of concentration, and inability to tolerate heat or sunlight, and emphasizes that the Disability Determination Division (a state agency) made an opposite finding. The findings of a state agency are not binding on the AU. <em>Richardson v. Bowen, </em>807 F.2d 444, 448 (5th Cir.1987). Moreover, the record supports the AU\u2019s conclusions; the AU chose not to credit Reyes\u2019 statements about his functional limitations because the medical record did not substantiate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">In a related argument, Reyes contends that the AU\u2019s conclusion under the fourth step is deficient because the AU did not compare the specific duties and requirements of a machine operator with Reyes\u2019 present impairments and capabilities. He cites <em>Abshire v. Bowen, </em>848 F.2d 638, 641 (5th Cir.1988), where we found that \u201cthe record was devoid of any analysis of Ab-shire\u2019s duties as a route salesman by the AU\u201d and that the AU\u2019s conclusion that Abshire could return to his past relevant work \u201ccould not be supported by substantial evidence in any event ...\u201d In Reyes\u2019 case, by contrast, the record shows that the AU asked Reyes about his past duties as a machine operator and about his present disabilities. In addition, the record supports the AU\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Reyes\u2019 final claim is that the AU improperly considered his performance of household chores, and other daily activities, under the fourth step. He argues that this evidence is irrelevant because it does not reflect his ability \u201cto perform the required physical acts day in and day out in the sometimes stressful conditions in which all people work in the real world.\u201d <em>Wingo v. Bowen, </em>852 F.2d 827, 831 (5th Cir.1988), quoting <em>Allred v. Heckler, </em>729 F.2d 529, 533 (8th Cir.1984). However, in the cases cited by Reyes, the AU relied on the claimant\u2019s demeanor at trial, or the claimant\u2019s daily activities, to form his conclusions despite substantial contrary evidence. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Wingo, </em>852 F.2d at 830-31 and n. 2; <em>Lovelace v. Bowen, </em>813 F.2d 55, 59-60 (5th Cir.1987); and <em>Prince v. Bowen, </em>894 F.2d 283, 286-87 (8th Cir.1990). None of the cases hold that the AU cannot consider evidence of daily activities in conjunction with other evidence. In addition, the inconsistencies between Reyes\u2019 testimony about his limitations and his daily activities were quite relevant in evaluating his credibility. <em>See Hollis v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1378, 1385 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">For the above reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\">. In a related argument, Reyes claims that the AU evaluated his disability under the approach set forth in Social Security Ruling 82-55, which required a finding of nonseverity if the hypertension did not cause significant end organ damage. The Fifth Circuit struck down this approach in <em>Estran v. Heckler, </em>745 F.2d 340 (5th Cir.1984), and <em>Stone v. Heckler, </em>752 F.2d 1099 (5th Cir.1985). SSR 82-55 was subsequently rescinded. <em>See Parker, </em>793 F.2d at 1180. This argument is also without merit because we infer that the ALJ found a severe impairment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
