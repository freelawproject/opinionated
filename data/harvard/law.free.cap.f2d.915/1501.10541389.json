On November 1, 1988, he was sentenced. The court, concluding that the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat.1987 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 18 and 28 U.S.C.), and the sentencing guidelines promulgated thereunder \u2014 which governed the sentence appellant should have received \u2014 were unconstitutional, sentenced appellant under the \u201cold law.\u201d The court suspended the imposition of sentence and placed appellant on probation for a period of three years. Although the court erred in imposing an \u201cold law\u201d sentence, <em>see Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989), neither the appellant nor the Government appealed; accordingly, after the time for taking an appeal expired, <em>see </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(b), appellant\u2019s sentence became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-16\">On October 31, 1989, the district court revoked appellant\u2019s probation and sentenced him to the custody of the Attorney General for a period of three years, a sentence within the sanctions prescribed for the section 371 conspiracy offense. Appellant now appeals, contending that, in fashioning his sentence on October 31,1989, the district court erred in two respects. First, appellant contends that the court erred in sentencing him without the benefit of a presentence investigation report. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(c)(2). Second, appellant argues that the court erred in failing to consider the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-17\">The Sentencing Reform Act and the Commission\u2019s guidelines control our decision. Under that body of law, when a sentencing court revokes a term of probation, the court may impose \u201cany ... sentence that was available [under the Sentencing Reform Act and the guidelines] at the time of the initial sentencing.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2) (1988). In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>907 F.2d 133, 135-36 (11th Cir.1990), which was decided after the district court revoked appellant\u2019s probation, we explained what this language means. Because the district court, in fashioning appellant\u2019s three-year term of incarceration, did not consider the sentences avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>able under the Sentencing Reform Act and the guidelines on November 1, 1988 (when it placed appellant on probation), we vacate appellant\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing. Given this disposition, it is unnecessary for us to consider appellant\u2019s first point, concerning the district court's failure to order its probation office to conduct a presentence investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
