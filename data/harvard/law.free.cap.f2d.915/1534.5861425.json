On cross-appeal, the Yanceys seek a ruling that affirms the Claims Court\u2019s decision but that increases the amount recoverable or, alternatively, a ruling that remands the case for a determination of statutory compensation under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a (1972). We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">This suit was brought by Andrew and Elizabeth Yancey to recover compensation for turkey breeder stock that was sold for slaughter as a result of a quarantine imposed by the USDA to control and eradicate an outbreak of lethal Avian Influenza in 1983-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">In November, 1983, the Yanceys acquired a flock of 3,000 turkey breeder hens and 295 turkey toms for purposes of selling the turkey hatching eggs produced on their farm in Rockingham County, Virginia to customers outside the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">In mid-October, 1983, an outbreak of pathogenic Avian Influenza, a highly contagious viral disease affecting poultry, occurred in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Although a mild form of the disease causes little death loss and a small drop in egg production, the pathogenic form can be very serious. In Lancaster County, more than ninety percent mortality occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">The USDA acted quickly by declaring an extraordinary emergency in Pennsylvania and promulgating regulations, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 134a (1972), that imposed a quarantine in certain areas of the state. Subsequently, outbreaks of the mild form of the disease in Maryland and Virginia were traced to the Pennsylvania outbreak. Though these areas were not declared an emergency, the USDA amended its regulations pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a because of concern that these cases might convert to the pathogenic form.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">As a result, certain counties in Maryland and Virginia (including Rockingham County, Virginia) were quarantined. The quarantine applicable to the Yanceys prohibited interstate shipment of live poultry, manure from poultry, litter used by poultry, carcasses, eggs and certain equipment. 49 Fed.Reg. 3843. The USDA published regulations applicable to areas not under the declaration of an emergency, authorizing payment of up to 100% of the \u201cexpenses of purchase, destruction and disposition of animals and materials required to be destroyed because of being contaminated by or exposed to lethal avian influenza.\u201d 49 Fed.Reg. 3446-3448, amended at 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 53.2(b) (1990). The quarantine remained in effect in Virginia until September 14, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">Testing showed no evidence of the disease in the Yanceys\u2019 flock. Nevertheless, they were not allowed to ship their turkeys or hatching eggs interstate during the quarantine. The Yanceys requested assistance from the Commissioner of Agriculture of Virginia but efforts to locate a market for the breeder stock or eggs proved unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">The Yanceys spent up to $1,800 weekly to maintain the flock. They decided that keeping the flock alive for the indefinite duration of the quarantine would be uneconomical. They decided to sell the stock for meat, although the turkeys had not been \u201craised to be economically viable\u201d for that purpose. The stock was sold for slaughter on February 13, 1984, for $20,887.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-17\">USDA denied the Yanceys\u2019 $63,556 claim for indemnity pursuant to 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 53.2(b) because their stock was healthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">Next, the Yanceys filed suit in the U.S. Claims Court. The Yanceys alleged a taking of their property without compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>cause the quarantine prevented the interstate sale of their stock and thereby destroyed its economic value. They also alleged that defendant violated 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a. The Claims Court dismissed the Yanceys\u2019 statutory claim but, after trial, granted relief on the constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">The Government filed this appeal and the Yanceys cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">This court reviews \u201cClaims Court decisions for errors of law and clearly erroneous findings of fact.\u201d <em>Cooper v. United States, </em>827 F.2d 762, 763 (Fed.Cir.1987); <em>Milmark Services, Inc. v. United States, </em>731 F.2d 855, 857 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Though the Claims Court determined that under the Fifth Amendment the Yanceys were entitled to compensation, reexamination of the Yanceys\u2019 statutory arguments is also warranted at this time. The Supreme Court has developed an elaborate body of devices for avoiding difficult questions. <em>See Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 341, 56 S.Ct. 466, 480, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brand\u00e9is, J. concurring). If a suit may be resolved either by statutory construction or constitutional interpretation, the statutory approach is generally to be preferred. <em>See </em>L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law, </em>at 71-72, 1017, 1032, &amp; 1036-37 (2nd ed. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Thus, we turn first to the issue raised by the Yanceys on cross-appeal: whether the Yanceys may obtain the relief sought based on 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">I. STATUTORY COMPENSATION</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">The central provision granting consent to suit in the Claims Court is the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (Supp.1990). <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 397, 96 S.Ct. 948, 952, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976). This section does not create any substantive right of recovery against the United States for money damages. It merely confers jurisdiction upon the court whenever a substantive right exists. <em>Id. </em>at 398, 96 S.Ct. at 953. A claimant who is not relying upon breach of a contractual obligation, therefore, must look beyond 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 and establish that some substantive provision of law, regulation, or the Constitution can be fairly construed as mandating compensation in order to state a claim within the jurisdiction of the court. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 1351, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">The Yanceys\u2019 turkey breeder flock was quarantined pursuant to the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s authority under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a. This statute allows the Yanceys a claim for compensation if it \u201ccan fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained.\u201d <em>Testan, </em>424 U.S. at 398, 96 S.Ct. at 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">Section 114a of title 21 United States Code provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-15\">The Secretary of Agriculture, either independently or in cooperation with States or political subdivisions ... is authorized to control and eradicate any communicable diseases of livestock or poultry ... which in the opinion of the Secretary constitute an emergency and threaten the livestock industry of the country, including the payment of claims growing out of destruction of animals (including poultry), and of materials, affected by or exposed to any such disease, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">Because the statute appears to give discretion to the Secretary, the Claims Court based its decision on whether the USDA complied with the regulations promulgated pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a. <em>See </em>9 C.F.R. \u00a7 53. The regulations authorize payment of up to 100% of the \u201cexpense of purchase, destruction and disposition of animals and materials required to be destroyed because of being contaminated by or exposed to\u201d lethal Avian Influenza. 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 53.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-17\">The Claims Court ruled that none of the requirements under the regulations were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1538\">*1538</page-number>satisfied. <em>Yancey v. United States, </em>10 Cl.Ct. 311, 316 (1986). The Claims Court concluded that because the turkeys were healthy they could not be \u201ccontaminated by or exposed to\u201d lethal Avian Influenza. Moreover, according to the Claims Court, because the flock was healthy, it was not \u201crequired to be destroyed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">Finally, the Claims Court emphasized that the Yanceys\u2019 turkeys were not destroyed in a manner consistent with the regulations. Section 53.4(a) of 9 C.F.R. requires destruction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-5\">Animals affected by or exposed to disease shall be killed promptly after appraisal and disposed of by burial or burning, unless otherwise specifically provided by the Deputy Administrator, Veterinary Services in extraordinary circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The Yanceys also failed to allege that their flock and materials had been properly appraised as required by regulation to obtain compensation. <em>See </em>9 C.F.R. \u00a7 53.3(a) and \u00a7 53.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Yet, an inconsistency appears to have developed in the way the Government applies its regulations. On cross-appeal, to demonstrate this inconsistency, the Yanceys rely on <em>Loftin v. United States, </em>6 Cl.Ct. 596 (1984), <em>aff'd, </em>765 F.2d 1117 (Fed. Cir.1985), an authority that the Claims Court\u2019s opinion did not address. Though <em>Loftin </em>ultimately turned on other legal considerations, it is still relevant to our analysis because the Government interpreted 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a so as to allow compensation for destruction of non-diseased animals due to their close proximity to infected animals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Similarly, it is clear that the Government quarantined the Yanceys\u2019 breeder flock because of its proximity to the outbreaks of Avian Influenza in Virginia. Under the Government\u2019s prior interpretation of the statute in <em>Loftin, </em>the Yanceys\u2019 flock might have been classified as exposed to the disease and thereby made eligible for indemnities. Thus, according to the Yanceys, insofar as the actions of the Government in refusing to statutorily compensate them for their healthy flock are inconsistent with the approach taken in <em>Loftin, </em>the Government\u2019s actions appear to be arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">If regulations lead to an unreasonable or irrational result that is at odds with the underlying statutory intent, guidance should be sought from the legislative history. <em>Texas State Commission v. United States, </em>796 F.2d 400, 406 (Fed.Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1030, 107 S.Ct. 874, 93 L.Ed.2d 828 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a was amended July 7, 1962; the amendment was intended to fill gaps in the prior legislation. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 582, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1961), <em>reprinted in, </em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1822, 1823-24 (1962). The amendment gave the Government authority to impose quarantines to control Avian Influenza and provide compensation to affected farmers. <em>Id. </em>During the legislative process, Representative Wright, a sponsor of the legislation, made it clear that the individual rights of farmers should be protected under the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s broad new authority. <em>See </em>108 Cong.Rec. H5571-5572 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">The Yanceys argue that the Government\u2019s refusal to classify their turkey breeder flock as exposed to Avian Influenza for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a was contrary to the disease control purposes of the statute. After all, the Government\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1539\">*1539</page-number>interpretation, as well as the Claims Court\u2019s ruling, provide those in the Yanceys\u2019 position with a perverse incentive to allow infection of their flocks in order to receive indemnities.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">We agree with the Yanceys that denying compensation for their healthy flock is contrary to Congress\u2019 clear intent to promote cooperation with quarantine provisions. It is clear from the legislative history that the purpose of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a is to control and prevent the spread of animal diseases and that the indemnity provisions are an integral part of this disease control scheme. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 2811, 84th Cong. 2d Sess. 1 (1956), <em>reprinted in, </em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4366, 4367 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Unfortunately, it is not at all clear from the legislative history whether Congress intended for the indemnity provisions to extend to healthy animals. Without exception, throughout the legislative history, reference to compensation is linked to destruction of diseased animals. The legislative history of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a demonstrates that either Congress neglected to consider the effect a quarantine might have on owners of healthy live stock and poultry or it actually believed that compensation need not be extended to the owners of healthy stock. Neither scenario is helpful to the Yanceys.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Despite the Government\u2019s prior favorable interpretation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a in <em>Loftin, </em>Congress\u2019 failure to explicitly create a right of compensation for healthy animals, precludes us from finding that the USDA\u2019s refusal to compensate the Yanceys was arbitrary or capricious. The Yanceys do not have a right to compensation under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a. Thus, we now turn to the issue of whether the Yanceys are entitled to relief based on the \u201cJust Compensation\u201d Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">II. THE FIFTH AMENDMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">A. <em>Whether a Compensable Taking Occurred</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in part, \u201cnor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d The purpose of this clause is \u201cto bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 40, 49, 80 S.Ct. 1563, 1569, 4 L.Ed.2d 1554 (1960). This court must decide whether the poultry quarantine imposed a burden on the Yanceys which should be borne by the public as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">The resolution of such issues depends largely on the particular circumstances involved in each case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-14\">[W]e have eschewed the development of any set formula for identifying a \u201ctaking\u201d forbidden by the Fifth Amendment, and have relied instead on <em>ad hoc, factual </em>inquiries into the circumstances of each particular case. To aid in this determination, however, we have identified three factors which have \u201cparticular significance\u201d: (1) \u201cthe economic impact of the regulation on the claimant\u201d; (2) \u201cthe extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe character of the governmental action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-15\"><em>Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 2659, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978); <em>see also Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </em>475 U.S. 211, 224-25, 106 S.Ct. 1018, 1026, 89 L.Ed.2d 166 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-16\">The Claims Court reviewed the particular circumstances of this case in light of the <em>Penn Central </em>factors. The Claims Court found that the quarantine had reduced the value of their healthy turkey breeder flock seventy-seven percent from $91,616 to $20,-887, the amount received from the slaughter. <em>Yancey v. U.S., </em>Claims Court No. 413-85C, at 17 (filed December 30, 1988).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-17\">Even considering the receipt of $21,496 from the Commonwealth of Virginia, plaintiffs incurred a substantial loss on their investment. Although plaintiffs were able to mitigate their loss by slaughtering the flock, there was <em>no other alternative, </em>economically viable use for the flock while the quarantine was in effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1540\">*1540</page-number><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Moreover, the Claims Court found the Yanceys learned about the quarantine from the newspaper only the day before it took effect. <em>Id. </em>at 18-19.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-4\">At the time of the acquisition of the turkey breeder flock, plaintiffs had the investment-backed expectation to sell the hatching eggs to customers outside of Virginia. Defendant\u2019s actions in administering the quarantine resulted in an unforeseen and disparate impact upon plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 19. Because the Government has not demonstrated that the Claims Court\u2019s findings of facts were clearly erroneous, we accept these facts as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Relying on <em>Florida Rock Indus. v. United States, </em>791 F.2d 893, 901 (Fed.Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1053, 107 S.Ct. 926, 93 L.Ed.2d 978 (1987), the Claims Court concluded that there is no \u201cfixed formula\u201d for determining when the Fifth Amendment comes into play. \u201c[T]he Fifth Amendment ... does not find a taking in a mere denial of the \u2018highest and best use,\u2019 i.e., most profitable use, that would be available in the absence of regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201ca regulation ... can be a taking if its effect on a landowner\u2019s ability to put his property to productive use is sufficiently severe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Moreover, the Claims Court determined that even if the Government\u2019s regulatory action were presumed to be reasonable, a compensable taking may still occur. In <em>Department of Agriculture v. Mid-Florida Growers, Inc., </em>521 So.2d 101 (Fla.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 870, 109 S.Ct. 180, 102 L.Ed.2d 149 (1988), the court held that Florida\u2019s destruction of citrus trees tested and found not to be infected with citrus canker, a communicable viral disease, was a compensable taking, despite the fact that the action was a valid exercise of police powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">The Government takes issue with the Claims Court\u2019s conclusion that compensation must be provided for deprivation of the economically viable use of property even though the property remains within the use and control of the owner. We acknowledge that where there has been no physical appropriation of the property for public use, but rather merely a regulatory restriction upon use of property, the Supreme Court has generally held that the restriction is constitutionally permissible in the absence of compensation. <em>See Keystone Bituminous Coal Assoc. v. DeBenedictis, </em>480 U.S. 470, 107 S.Ct. 1232, 94 L.Ed.2d 472 (1987) (when the private and public interests are weighed, \u201cthe public interest in preventing activities similar to public nuisances is a substantial one, which in many instances has not required compensation\u201d). Still, <em>Keystone </em>involved a facial challenge to a regulation under the Fifth Amendment; no evidence was offered of the regulation\u2019s economic impact. We favor the Yanceys\u2019 position that the <em>Keystone </em>opinion did not hold that the nature of governmental activity conclusively forecloses all claims for just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">On the contrary, the Government\u2019s proper exercise of regulatory authority does not automatically preclude a finding that such action is a compensable taking. <em>See United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., </em>474 U.S. 121, 126-27, 106 S.Ct. 455, 458-59, 88 L.Ed.2d 419 (1985). There should be no \u201cblanket exception to the Takings Clause whenever Congress exercises its Commerce Clause authority____\u201d <em>Kaiser Aetna v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 164, 172, 100 S.Ct. 383, 389, 62 L.Ed.2d 332 (1979). \u201cThe application of a [regulation] to particular property effects a taking if the [regulation] ... denies an owner economically viable use of his land\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Agins v. City of Tiburon, </em>447 U.S. 255, 260, 100 S.Ct. 2138, 2141, 65 L.Ed.2d 106 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">The Government also attacks the Claims Court\u2019s primary reliance on cases involving ownership of real property. Despite the Government\u2019s attack, the Claims Court\u2019s reasoning is equally applicable to other significant property interests besides land ownership. There is no doubt that other property interests are also protected by the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., </em>467 U.S. 986, 104 S.Ct. 2862, 81 L.Ed.2d 815 (1984) (the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1541\">*1541</page-number>Court determined that Fifth Amendment protection could cover an intangible trade-secret property interest). For Fifth Amendment purposes, the Yanceys\u2019 ownership of their turkey flock deserves just as much protection as if ownership of their farm had been appropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The Claims Court held, based on the specific facts of this case, that compensation should be paid to the Yanceys pursuant to the \u201cJust Compensation\u201d Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Before we can adopt the same conclusion, one case that the Claims Court failed to mention must be addressed. <em>Empire Kosher Poultry, Inc. v. Hallowell, </em>816 F.2d 907 (3rd Cir.1987), is a case that has similar facts and reaches a contrary holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">In <em>Empire, </em>the court considered the imposition of a quarantine in Pennsylvania related to the same outbreak of Avian Influenza as in the instant case and held that there was no compensable taking. In both cases, the sellers of poultry were disadvantaged by Government imposed quarantines. The Yanceys try to distinguish the facts of the <em>Empire </em>case. They emphasize that in <em>Empire, </em>involving healthy chickens raised for slaughter, the birds could be sold within the quarantine area for the purpose for which they were raised. Moreover, in <em>Empire, </em>the seller chose to close his own processing plant after the quarantine was in effect and, in doing so, limited his own investment backed expectation. This leads us to the conclusion that, in the <em>Empire </em>case, the quarantine had less adverse economic impact on the seller than in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Insofar as the <em>Empire </em>case can be distinguished from the instant case we choose not to follow it for that reason. Insofar as the two cases are similar, we choose not to follow <em>Empire </em>because we find it inconsistent with the intent of the Fifth Amendment. \u201cBasic understanding of the Fifth Amendment makes clear that it is designed not to limit governmental interference with property rights <em>per se, </em>but rather to secure compensation in the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking.\u201d <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles, </em>482 U.S. 304, 315, 107 S.Ct. 2378, 2385-86, 96 L.Ed.2d 250 (1987) (a zoning regulation\u2019s temporary denial of a land owner\u2019s use of property amounted to a compensable taking).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">In addition to the <em>Empire </em>case, it should be noted that the Claims Court\u2019s specific findings of fact preclude this court from relying on several other cases cited by the Government. For instance, the Government argues that the percentage diminution in value of the turkeys was too small to amount to a compensable taking. <em>See Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 U.S. 365, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303 (1926) (75% diminution in value caused by zoning law not a taking), and <em>Hadacheck v. Sebastian, </em>239 U.S. 394, 36 S.Ct. 143, 60 L.Ed. 348 (1915) (87V2% diminution in value not a taking). However, we do not read these early precedents as creating an automatic numerical barrier preventing compensation, as a matter of law, in cases involving a smaller percentage diminution in value. The Claims Court properly weighed all the relevant considerations, including percentage diminution in value, under the modern <em>Penn Central </em>approach and found that the Yanceys suffered severe economic impact. In view of the Claims Court\u2019s well supported factual findings, we cannot rule as a matter of law that the flock\u2019s percentage diminution in value was too small to warrant a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">Similarly, the Claims Court\u2019s findings of fact preclude this court from following <em>Galloway Farms, Inc. v. United States, </em>834 F.2d 998, 1003 (Fed.Cir.1987). In <em>Galloway Farms, </em>the court ruled that the grain embargo imposed on the Soviet Union did not amount to a compensable taking under the Fifth Amendment for those farmers allegedly deprived of an economic use of their property because other markets remained open. The <em>Galloway Farms </em>case is distinguishable from the case at hand because in <em>Galloway Farms </em>the property owner had the opportunity to use his property in other economically viable ways. The Claims Court found that the Yanceys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1542\">*1542</page-number>had no choice but to sell their birds for substantially less than their value.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">There is simply no way that the Government can refute the Claims Court\u2019s findings of fact. When adverse economic impact and unanticipated deprivation of an investment backed interest are suffered, as when the poultry quarantine forced the Yanceys to sell their turkey flock, compensation under the Fifth Amendment is appropriate. Even when pursuing the public good, as the USDA was doing when it imposed the poultry quarantine, the Government does not operate in a vacuum. Bluntly stated, the consequences of the Government\u2019s action cannot be ignored. Why should the Yanceys be forced to bear their own losses when their turkeys were not diseased? The Yanceys\u2019 losses came about because of the Government\u2019s action. If the intent of the poultry quarantine was to benefit the public, the public should be responsible for the Yanceys\u2019 losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">B. <em>Just Compensation</em></p>\n<p id=\"AntU\">Having concluded that a compensable taking occurred, the next issue to be addressed is whether the Claims Court\u2019s calculation of compensation was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">1. LOST PROFITS</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The Government argues that, in addition to correctly allowing the Yanceys compensation according to USDA\u2019s indemnity tables, the Claims Court gave the Yanceys an impermissible bonus for lost profits. The Supreme Court has specifically addressed and rejected the availability of lost profits under the Fifth Amendment. \u201c[CJompensation for the interest does not include future loss of profits.\u201d <em>United States v. General Motors Corp., </em>323 U.S. 373, 379, 65 S.Ct. 357, 360, 89 L.Ed. 311 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Instead, fair market value should be used to determine the amount of compensation. Fair market value is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-12\">the price at which property would change hands in a transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under compulsion to buy or sell, and both being reasonably informed as to all relevant facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-13\"><em>Julius Goldman\u2019s Egg City v. United States, </em>697 F.2d 1051, 1054 n. 3 (Fed.Cir. 1983). However, the fair market value of property under the Fifth Amendment can include an assessment of the property\u2019s capacity to produce future income if a reasonable buyer would consider that capacity in negotiating a fair price for the property. <em>See Yachts America v. United States, </em>779 F.2d 656, 660 (Fed.Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 832, 107 S.Ct. 122, 93 L.Ed.2d 68 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">The Government\u2019s suggestion that the Claims Court erred in ascertaining the value of the Yanceys\u2019 healthy flock is really another disguised challenge to a factual finding. The indemnity tables used by USDA to compensate owners of diseased flocks do not include an allowance for the value of such birds as hatching egg producers to a willing buyer. In fact, government documents received into evidence demonstrated conclusively that those tables reflected only the standard costs incurred in maintaining such birds to a given age, with no allowance for their commercial value.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">The Claims Court apparently concluded that the USDA\u2019s cost-based standard was insufficient to determine the value of a healthy breeder flock that has the capacity to produce hatching eggs. Such a finding is sufficiently supported by the facts and, therefore, is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">2. DATE WHEN FAIR MARKET VALUE WAS CALCULATED</p>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">On cross-appeal, the Yanceys argue that the Claims Court erred by not award<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>ing damages based on the fair market value of their breeder flock on the date it was slaughtered.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Fair market value under the Fifth Amendment is normally ascertained at the date the governmental restrictions are imposed, which is the date of the taking. <em>E.g., Kirby Forest Industries v. United States, </em>467 U.S. 1, 14, 104 S.Ct. 2187, 2196, 81 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984). However, the Yanceys say that the goal of just compensation under the Fifth Amendment is to put the owner of property \u201cin as good a position pecuniarily as if his property had not been taken.\u201d <em>Olson v. United States, </em>292 U.S. 246, 255, 54 S.Ct. 704, 708, 78 L.Ed. 1236 (1934). To achieve the goal, the Yanceys advocate flexibility in determining the point at which fair market value is calculated. We are aware of no cases allowing the flexibility that the Yanceys advocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In this case, it is apparent that the trial judge took a variety of factors into consideration to decide the best way to calculate fair market value. Nothing suggests that the trial judge\u2019s calculation of fair market value was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">C. <em>Extra Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The Government also challenges two of the litigation expenses that the Claims Court awarded to the Yanceys.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">1. EXPENSES INCURRED BEFORE FILING COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">While pre-litigation expenses are precluded from reimbursement under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4654(c) (1983). <em>Emeny v. United States, </em>526 F.2d 1121, 1124, 208 Ct.Cl. 522 (1975) <em>(per curiam </em>adopting the decision of the trial judge), \u201cthe significant effort expended\u201d in \u201cthe filing of the petition\u201d may be compensable under the statute if proper documentation were provided. <em>Cloverport Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v. United States, </em>10 Cl.Ct. 121, 124 (1986). Therefore, as long as the parties were given an opportunity to document and challenge the reasonableness of the pre-litigation expenses, we will defer to the trial judge\u2019s discretion concerning the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">2. THE EXPERT TESTIMONY OF THE YANCEYS\u2019 SON</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">The trial court never addressed the Government\u2019s objection to reimbursement of the fees for the expert testimony of the Yanceys\u2019 son, Richard. The only evidence before the Claims Court was that Richard Yancey ordinarily charged $900. However, no evidence was ever presented that the Yanceys actually incurred any expense for their son\u2019s appearance and testimony. <em>See Foster v. United States, </em>3 Cl.Ct. 738 (1983) (fees and costs must be incurred). In the absence of any proffer that the Yanceys actually incurred any expense for the appearance and testimony of their son at trial, the Claims Court erred in allowing the $900 claimed for his appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">In an effort to avoid constitutional difficulties, we first examined the Yanceys\u2019 statutory claim. Only after concluding that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a did not provide the Yanceys with relief did we take up the Yanceys\u2019 Fifth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">We limited our review of the Claims Court ruling on the Yanceys\u2019 Fifth Amendment claim to a consideration of whether the specific facts of this case warrant compensation under the current law. Under <em>Penn Central, </em>the particular circumstances of each case must be considered. In this case, the Claims Court found that the Yanceys suffered severe economic impact and had no way of anticipating the interference with their investment backed interest. Furthermore, the facts demonstrate that the Yanceys\u2019 flock was healthy, that they followed the USDA\u2019s regulations, and that they properly mitigated their damages, by selling their flock, when the poultry quarantine became overly burdensome. Nevertheless, the Yanceys\u2019 turkey business was wiped out through no fault of their own; just compensation is warranted in this case. The Claims Court\u2019s ruling is well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">Only the extra cost issues need be remanded for additional consideration. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>WE AFFIRM IN PART, REVERSE IN PART, AND REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-18\">. The Fifth Amendment \u201cTaking Clause\" is sufficiently self-executing as to mandate compensation by the Federal Government. <em>See Wilfong v. United States, </em>480 F.2d 1326, 202 Ct.Cl. 616 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b893-9\">. The Yanceys apparently conceded that their decision to sell the stock for slaughter as meat was their own, made for economic, not health, reasons. The Government never undertook to have the flock destroyed. <em>See Yancey v. United States, </em>10 Cl.Ct. 311, 316 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b893-10\">. <em>Loftin </em>involved a herd of approximately 900 dairy cattle, 278 of which reacted positively to tests for bovine tuberculosis. The owner was told that the remaining cattle, which tested negative, would have to be quarantined, but the USDA did not require them to be slaughtered. Nevertheless, the owner chose (probably for economic reasons) to have the entire herd slaughtered. Because of the proximity of the infected animals to the rest of the herd, USDA interpreted 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 114a, in accordance with the purpose of the statute, as allowing at least some \"indemnity for each animal so destroyed.\u201d Thus, indemnity was available to the owner of the herd even for non-diseased cattle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b897-9\">. The same distinction can be made concerning another case referred to by the Government\u2014 <em>Andrus v. Allard, </em>444 U.S. 51, 100 S.Ct. 318, 62 L.Ed.2d 210 (1979). In <em>Andrus, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that a complete prohibition on the sale of avian artifacts under the Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act did not constitute a taking. \"The denial of one traditional property right does not always amount to a taking. At least where an owner possesses a full \u2018bundle\u2019 of property rights, the destruction of one \u2018strand\u2019 of the bundle is not a taking, because the aggregate must be viewed in its entirety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65-66, 100 S.Ct. at 327.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
