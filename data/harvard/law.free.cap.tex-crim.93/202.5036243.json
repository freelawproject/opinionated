The State\u2019s case was controverted by the appellant through his testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and that of other witnesses. The verdict of the jury, however, settling the conflict in behalf of the State, is conclusive upon this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In two bills of exceptions complaint is made of the receipt in evidence, over the appellant\u2019s objection, of testimony to the effect that the appellant, at another time, had made vulgar remarks in the presence of a little girl named Josephine Torres, and that he had been guilty of indecent conduct in the presence of another female child by the name of Rachel Lopez. This testimony was also controverted. The appellant\u2019s objection to its introduction should have been sustained. The evidence related to other transactions, was discrediting to the appellant, and was in no way connected with the offense for which he was on trial, nor was it rendered relevant under any of the exceptions to the general rule which excludes evidence of that character. The principle and authorities mentioned in the case of Sine v. State, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 221, should control the disposition of this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u2022 Because of the- error mentioned, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\n<em>Reversed' and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
