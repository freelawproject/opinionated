A statement of facts in qupestion and answer form is not a statement of facts within Article 844c, C. C. P. and cannot be considered on appeal. King v. State, 82 Tex. Crim. Rep., 145; 198 S. W. Rep., 782; Kitchens v. State, 83 Texas Crim. Rep., 324, 203 S. W. Rep., 768; Ferguson v. State, 83 Texas Crim. Rep., 272, 202 S. W. Rep., 733; Roberts v. State, 83 Texas Crim. Rep., 511, 204 S. W.

Rep., 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">The indictment appears to be regular. The statement of facts being in such condition that it may not be considered, and there being no bills of exception in the record, everything must be indulged in favor of the regularity of the judgment, and the same will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
