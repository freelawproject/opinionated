The motion proceeds upon the assumption that the original bond is upon file in this court. It is not now so on file, nor ever has been. We only know the provisions of the bond from the copy we find in the record. It always has been, or should be, on file in the lower court. Upon the order of dismissal appellant should have taken steps to file a new bond, or have corrected and refiled the original bond, and produced a proper record before this court showing that this had been done, in which event we would have been authorized to grant a rehearing and reinstate the appeal. As it is no option is left us but to overrule the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
