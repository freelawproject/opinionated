This court does not try questions like this upon affidavit. The statutory provision regarding the approval of the trial court is plain and apparently mandatory. If appellant was \u2022released following such telephone conversation and before the bond was in terms approved by the trial court, such release was without warrant of law. Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing presents no meritorious reason why same should be granted. It is ordered that said motion be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
