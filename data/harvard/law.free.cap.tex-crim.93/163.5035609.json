This precludes a consideration of the application as an independent ground for reversal. Nelson v. State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 44; Grant v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 2; and other cases listed in Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. Penal Code, Sec. 304. If the action of the court in refusing the continuance be considered in connection with the motion for new trial, it is apparent from the record that the motion to continue was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-21\">The appellant was indicted on the 14th day of May, 1920, and was</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>soon after arrested and released on bail. His case was set for trial on the 13th day of June, 1920, and then re-set for the 30th of that month. He failed to appear for trial, but instead disappeared. He was re-arrested on June 1, 1922. His trial was set for the 15th day of that, month. No process was applied for until the 14th of that month. The absent witness resided in another county. Process was not served. The affidavit of the witness, to the effect that he would not give the testimony set out in the motion to continue, is attached to the State\u2019s contest of the motion for .new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
