This defensive issue was fully submitted and in such satisfactory manner as that there is no exception to the charge of the learned trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-21\">There was no error in permitting the State\u2019s witness to testify to the entire circumstances surrounding the exhibition, display of, and attempted assault made upon him by appellant with, said pistol on the occasion in question. This State witness was in the home of a Mrs. Broussard when appellant came into the house. Appellant did not live <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>.at this place. A conversation ensued between appellant, Mrs. Broussard and witness during which witness got up out of his chair and as he did so appellant jerked out a pistol and engaged in a scuffle with witness over same, during which witness struck appellant and he \u2022thereupon dropped the pistol. The pistol was pulled out of appellant\u2019s \u25a0clothing at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">There was no error in refusing a requested instruction of acquittal, \u25a0 or in permitting the witness to detail the effort at an assault upon him made by appellant. Appellant had a bill of exceptions to the refusal \u25a0of the court to permit him to ask said State witness if he had signed a statement then shown him with reference to the impeachment of the sheriff. There was nothing in said statement reflecting any light upon .any issue involved in this case and the evidence was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Finding no error in the record, an affirmance is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
