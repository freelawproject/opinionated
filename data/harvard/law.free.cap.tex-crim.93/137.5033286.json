There were three barrels of mash. A copper container with a capacity of twelve gal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Ions was on the stove boiling. The. worm leading from the top of this container was disconnected but still hot, and a five gallon keg of whisky was part of the find, also a quart of the, same intoxicant. No one was at the house save the wife of appellant and two small children. The officers had a search warrant. When they got in about three hundred yards of appellant\u2019s house they saw him in the road. They slowed down and one of the parties spoke\" to appellant and said, \u201cGet in Jim.\u201d The officers knew nothing of what they would find at his house. Appellant said, \u201cWell you have got me.\u201d The conversation following, as detailed by the various officers, differed in some particulars. The officer seated next to appellant in the back seat of the car testified that when appellant said, \u201cWeil you have got me,\u201d witness said, \u201cWhy, what are you doing Jim?\u201d and that appellant replied, \u201cWell I am a cooking.\u201d Another officer testified that he asked appellant, \u201cWhat for?\u201d when the latter said they had him, and that appellant replied to him, \u201cWhat for, making whisky ?\u201d The party went to appellant\u2019s house and found therein the outfit, the operation, the product, above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Various exceptions to the court\u2019s charge appear. One was for failure to charge on alibi, and a special charge embodying this phase of the law was presented and refused. There seems to us no need for such charge. Five gallons of the manufactured product were found at appellant\u2019s house. Barrels of mash that must have taken time to prepare, were also found. A complete manufacturing outfit was there also. The process of manufacture was proceeding. Appellant was within a few minutes walk of the scene of operation. It was his house. He was the head of the family. He said, \u201cI am a cooking,\u201d \u201cYou have got me,\u201d \u201cWhat for, making whisky?\u201d The court submitted the law of the circumstantial evidence. The manufacture of intoxicating liquor is not begun or completed in a moment. That appellant was a short distance from his house when seen by the officers that morning, would not suffice to demand an acquittal upon the theory that he was at another and different place when the crime was committed. The fact that he may have been to drive a cow that morning, while the mash was fermenting, or the container cooking, or the worm collecting and dripping its contents, would not demand a charge on alibi. No question seems raised in the record that the factory was his and the manufacture his. Everything that was found bore out his statement to the officers and seem completely to establish his knowl - edge of and identity with the entire transaction. It hardly seems worth arguing that appellant would or could have said to the officers \u201cI am a cooking,\u201d if he had no knowledge of what was going on and if some enemy had slipped into his house in his absence and started the operations upon the customary implements for carrying on the forbidden busines. The statute governing the instant case forbids the direct or indirect manufacture of intoxicants, and we would not think it necessary for the proof to show the personal presence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>accused, as an indispensable element to his guilt. The law deals with substance, not with shadows, and in order to entitle him to demand a charge presenting an issue, he must show facts to the court which substantially support the theory that if his personal presence was not shown, he could not be guilty. Polanka v. State, 33 Texas Crim. Rep., 634; Parker v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 121; Underwood v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 604; Hernandez v. State, 64 Texas Crim. Rep., 73; Myers v. State, 65 Texas Crim. Rep., 448. The trial court submitted this case to the jury on the theory of principals, and we find in the charge the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\u201cYou are charged that if another did in fact commit the offense as alleged in the indictment and the defendant did not know the unlawful intent and did not aid by acts or encourage by words or gestures, he would not be a principal; and in the event you have a reasonable doubt thereof, you will acquit him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">And in another part of said charge is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\u201cBut unless you do so believe from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant either alone or acting with some other person, did in the said State and County on or about the 31st day of October, 1921, either directly or indirectly unlawfully manufacture, intoxicating liquor as alleged in the indictment, and as is hereinbefore defined, and not for medicinal, mechanical, scientific or sacramental purposes, and not for any of said purposes, you will acquit the defendant and so say by your verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">This gave to the appellant the law the issues raised by the evidence as we view same, and obviated the need for any charge presenting the theory that some person other than appellant was the manufacturer, if any, in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Complaint is made of the reception of the statements of appellant as made to the officers, it being urged that he was under arrest and unwarned. We do not think he was under arrest. The officers were going to his house. They had no warrant of arrest for him. They did not know what he had in his home. His statements were entirely voluntary and without inducement or threats. The reception of such evidence might be justified upon the further ground that same amounted to a statement made by him found later to be true and which conduced to\" establish guilt. As stated above, the officers were ignorant of his commision of crime. The fact of manufacture was unknown, likewise the place. Appellant not only said, \u201cYou have got me,\u201d and, \u201cI am a cooking,\u201d but made the further statement that it was at his house. The cooking was at the house of appellant as was later ascertained and verified. We are not at all sure that the conversation would not also be admissible as res gestae. The cooking of the mash was evidently going on, and it was a part of the process of manufacture. The statements were made by appellant a short distance from the scene and while that much of the manufacture was in actual progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>We think the testimony that the private road leading from the public road to the residence of appellant, showed much evidence of recent travel, was admissible for what it was worth as a circumstance supporting the claim of the State that illicit liquor was being manufactured and sold at appellant\u2019s house. This was true of the testimony of witness Sanders that automobiles and other vehicles frequently passed his house in the night-time going in the direction of appellant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We are not impressed that the Dean law as applicable to the manufacture of intoxicating liquor was so changed by the amendment thereto contained in Chapter 61, Acts First Called Session, Thirty-seventh Legislature, p. 233, as to amount to a repeal of the former law and to thereby necessitate the reversal of the conviction of one who manufactured liquor prior to November 15, 1921, same being the date of the taking effect of said amendment. There was no change in the law forbidding the making of intoxicants save the taking out of the definition of the offense the exceptions formerly contained in that section of the statute defining the offense, and the incorporation of such exceptions in a separate section, and the removal of the purchaser of such liquor from the class of those who were made punishable by said Act. This matter was discussed by us in Ex parte Doc Mitchum, 91 Texas Crim. Rep., 62, 237 S. W. Rep., 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\">ON REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">December 20, 1922.</p>\n<author id=\"b165-10\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Asc\">Appellant insists that in upholding the ruling of the trial court in admiting the testimony relating to the conversation between the appellant and the officers who found the still in his house, this court was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">The sheriff testified that he, in company with other officers, went to appellant\u2019s place of residence, and on the way, about three hundred yards from his_ home, they met and overtook him. The officers slacked up their conveyance, which was an automobile, and one of them said to the appellant: \u201cGet in, Jim,\u201d and he got in the car. The sheriff had a warrant to search the premises of the appellant. Immediately after the appellant got into the car, he said: \u201cYou have got me.\u201d One of the officers inquired, \u201cWhere is it,\u201d and the appellant said, \u201cIn the house.\u201d The officer then said: \u201cHow much have you got,\u201d and appellant replied, \u201cNot much.\u201d In connection with appellant\u2019s statement, \u201cWell, you have got me,\u201d the officer testified: \u201cI think I asked him what for\u2014 making whisky ? He said, <em>\u201c1 </em>don\u2019t deny it.\u201d In the same connection with this testimony, one of the parties with the sheriff said to appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>lant: \u201cWhich way are you going?,\u201d that on overtaking the appellant, he said: \u201cGet in the car and ride with us a piece; we are going down your way.\u201d He came.around and got in on the side and said: \u201cCharlie, you come after me?\u201d and the witness said,. \u201cWhy?\u201d Appellant said: \u201cWell, you got me,\u201d and the witness said: \u201cWhat are you doing, Jim?\u201d He said: \u201cWell, I am a cooking; you have got me.\u201d The sheriff and his companions accompanied the appellant in the car to his house, and they there found a still, a keg of whisky and a bottle of whisky, one barrel of mash in the dwelling and two in the smokehouse, a copper boiler containing a capacity of twelve gallons, and a copper worm. The boiler was f ull of mash and was sitting on the stove in the dwellinghouse. There was a fire burning in the stove. The vessel was very hot. The worm was lying on the floor right close to the stove, but not connected. The witness went into further detailed description of the still. No doubt, under the facts revealed by the record, at the time the declarations of the appellant in question were made, he was in custody within the meaning of Art. 810 of the Code of Crim. Proc. relating to confessions. Illustrative cases are Roberts v. State, 83 Texas Crim. Rep., 139; Clark v. State, 84 Texas Crim. Rep., 390; Willoughby v. State, 87 Texas Crim. Rep., 40; Campbell v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 243, 230 S. W. Rep., 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The question arises, was not the testimony admissible under the part of the statute mentioned, reading thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201c. . . unless in connection with said confession, he makes statements of facts or circumstances that are found to be' true, . . . such as the finding of secreted or stolen property, or the instrument with which he states the offense was committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Many cases consruing this article are found. Among them are Davis v. State, 23 S. W. Rep., 687; Patterson v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 402, 231 S. W. Rep., 763; Torrence v. State, 85 Texas Crim. Rep., 310; Washington v. State, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 327; Rippey v. State, 86 Texas Crim. Rep., 599; Singleton v. State, 87 Texas Crim. Rep., 302; Williams v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 334, 225 S. W. Rep., 177; Garcia v. State, 88 Texas Crim. Rep., 605, 228 S. W. Rep., 937; McGoldrick v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 585, 232 S. W. Rep., 851; Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. Penal Code, Sec: 63, and cases therein collated. The record reveals no such previous knowledge of the location of the instruments with which the crime was committed as would render the declarations complained of inadmissible under the statutory rule which requires that the finding of the fruits of the crime or instruments used in its commission <em>shall be because </em>of the information gained from the accused through the confession. See Willoughby v. State, 87 Texas Crim. Rep., 40; Kennon v. State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 356; Nolen v. State, 14 Texas Crim. Rep., 485; Owens v. State, 16 Texas Crim. App., 460. Appellant accompanied the officers to his dwelling after making the statements mentioned, and in his presence the equipment for the manufacture of whisky was found while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>liquor was in the process of making. The officers, if their testimony is to be believed, did not previously know that the still was in the appellant\u2019s house and in operation, though they did entertain a suspicion of its presence there. It is believed that this was not such knowledge as would operate to exclude the testimony mentioned. It is by no means clear that the evidence complained of was not admissible under the rule of res gestae. Declarations of one accused of crime which come within this rule are admissible, either for or againsc him, even though at the time he be under arrest. Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. Penal Code, Secs. 84, 85 and 86. At the time that the declarations were made, the accused, while not immediately within his dwelling-house, was in fact, at his home and was actually engaged in making the whisky. He was, in fact, cooking. Under these circumstances, the declaration that he was doing so would apparently, under the liberal interpretation of the res gestae rule which obtains in this State, be admissible. Wharton\u2019s Crim. Evidence, Sec. 262, note, p. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">There was no error, we think, in refusing to call upon the jury to determine whether appellant\u2019s guilt was that of an accomplice and not a principal. To make him a principal, it was not necessary, under the facts developed from the record, that he be present at all times during the manufacture of the liquor. The apparatus was not assembled in a moment; it was capable of manufacturing whisky; it was in his house, and the circumstances amply justified the finding that it was in his possession, albeit he may have possessed it in conjunction with others. Not only the equipment for making intoxicating liquors but a considerable quantity of intoxicating liquor itself was found upon the premises; also in the possession of the appellant, that is, in the house where he and his family lived, and his own declarations to the officers warrant the finding of the jury that he was cognizant of its presence. To connect him with guilt, it was not necessary that the evidence should show that on the particular day of his arrest, he was present when the fire was lighted or when the coil was connected. The nature of the crime was not one that demanded his continued presence during the manufacture of the liquor in order to make him a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Upon this same reasoning, we think the request for the submission of the issue of alibi was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
