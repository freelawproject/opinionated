From his testimony, however, it appears that he departed from his course for the purpose of going to another part of the town and attending a certain entertainment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Without going into details, the appellant\u2019s evidence is sufficient to show that he was carrying a pistol in violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The record is before us without bills on exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">The judgment must be afnrmed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
