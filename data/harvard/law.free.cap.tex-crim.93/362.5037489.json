The equipment is described in detail in the evidence. The proof shows it was not only sufficient for the manufacture of whisky, but that whisky had in fact been made therewith. One of the witnesses testified that he started to taste some of the whisky when appellant told him not to do so as it was the \u201cfirst run,\u201d and said that he (appellant) had made it. It is not necessary further to state the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Only two bills of exception appear in the record. Our Assistant Attorney General calls attention to the fact that one of the bills is in question and answer form and should therefore not be considered. The bill is directed at a remark made by the trial court, and what appears to be a question and answer statement is more in the nature of an exchange of remarks between counsel and the court. The bill discloses that while the State was examining a witness \u00e1ppellant\u2019s counsel interrupted the examination and asked some question and made some comment relative to the answer, whereupon the trial court admonished counsel to let the witness go on with his testimony, to which counsel replied that he desired \u201cto try the case in his own way; if the State wanted to interpose an objection it was all right, but he did not think the court ought to object,\u201d whereupon the court told counsel that he had no right to interrupt the witness unless there was something making it necessary to do so. Counsel for appellant replied to the court, \u201cYou can\u2019t run it to suit yourself,\u201d and the court replied, \u201cYes, I will,\u201d to which counsel answered, \u201cThe Court of Criminal Appeals won\u2019t let you.\u201d Counsel then stated that he desired to take a bill of exception to the remark of the court that he would run the case to suit himself, whereupon the court remarked, \u201cYes, I said that, and I am going to do it; I am going to run it according to law.\u201d We fail to observe any conduct on the part of the court that is the subject of criticism. In fact, the'forbearance of the court towards counsel was remarkable. If, in the opinion of the court he was improperly interrupting the examination of the witness and interfering with the orderly trial of the case, the court had a right to call his attention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>it, and whatever the trial judge said relative to the matter was brought about by counsel\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\">One officer testified that they went to appellant\u2019s house between daylight and sunup and in response to a knock on the door appellant opened it. The officers told him they had come to search his place for a still, and that in order to save them time and trouble asked appellant to go and show them where it was, to which appellant replied, \u201cIt is down there in that barn,\u201d pointing toward it. Appellant went with the officers and unlocked the barn where they found the equipment heretofore adverted to in the statement of the facts. Appellant interposed objection to the officer stating that appellant had told them the still was in the barn, on the ground that he was under arrest at the time. We do not regard it as necessary to discuss the question from that standpoint. Even though appellant may have been under arrest, he made the statement which led to finding the equipment used by him in the manufacture of whisky. It was clearly admissible under the provisions of Article 810, C. C. P. For authorities collated, see Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., Section 63, page 36, and, also, note 12, under Article 810, Vol. 2, Vernon\u2019s Crim. Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment'is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
