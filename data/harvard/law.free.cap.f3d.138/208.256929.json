JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b281-18\">Utica Lloyd\u2019s of Texas (\u201cUtica\u201d) brought this diversity suit under the Declaratory Judgment Act (the \u201cFederal DJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. '\u00a7\u00a7 2201-02, against Eric Mitchell, The Mitchell Company, Anderson, Wormley, Mitchell &amp; Hunt, Inc. and Wormley, Mitchell &amp; Associates, Inc. (collectively, the \u201cMitchell Defendants\u201d) seeking construction- of a policy issued by Utica, and a determination whether, it had the duty to defend and indemnify the Mitchell Defendants in an underlying state court suit. Following an order by the federal district court determining that Utica had a duty to defend the Mitchell Defendants, the Mitchell Defendants sought attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the Texas version of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (the \u201cTexas DJA\u201d), Tex. Crv. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 37.001, <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The district court denied the request for attorney\u2019s fees, perceiving itself bound by our decision in <em>Bituminous Casualty Corp. v. Vacuum Tanks, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 1130, 1133 (5th Cir.1992), which found that attorney\u2019s fee awards against certain insurers should be denied in Texas declaratory judgment actions. We affirm, but for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-19\">The district court in the instant case relied on a statement in <em>Bituminous </em>that Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 38.006 \u201cexempts certain insurers from payment of attorney\u2019s fees in declaratory judgment actions.\u201d <em>Bituminous, </em>975 F.2d at 1133. The court apparently interpreted <em>Bituminous </em>as a broad holding applying to any declaratory judgment arising under Texas law. <em>Bituminous, </em>however, involved-an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 38.001(8), which provides for such fees for claims on \u201can oral or written contract,\u201d and never addressed the provision for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 87.009 of the Texas Declaratory Judgment Act, while the Mitchell Defendants in the instant case base their claim for fees solely on \u00a7 37.009. Furthermore, \u00a7 38.006 simply provides that Chapter 38 \u201cdoes not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>apply to a contract issued by an insurer that is subject to\u201d one of five provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, <em>Bituminous </em>limits only the availability of attorney\u2019s fees sought under Chapter 38, and is not relevant to the issue before this court \u2014 -whether the Mitchell Defendants are entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 37.009 in a federal declaratory judgment action arising under diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Federal courts follow the American Rule in the absence of fee-shifting congressional legislation. <em>See. Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc\u2019y, </em>421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1616, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975). Section 2202 of the Federal DJA provides that \u201c[f]urther necessary or proper relief based on a declaratory judgment or decree may be granted ... against any adverse party whose rights have been determined by such judgment.\u201d As this court has noted, however, \u00a7 2202 of the Federal DJA \u201cdoes not by itself provide statutory authority to award attorney\u2019s fees that would not otherwise be available under state law in a diversity action.\u201d <em>Mercantile Nat\u2019l Bank v. Bradford Trust Co., </em>850 F.2d 215, 218 (5th Cir.1988). Furthermore, the \u201cotherwise ... available\u201d state law in a diversity case must be substantive, for <em>Mercantile </em>explicitly stated that an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a federal declaratory judgment action \u201cis confined to two situations: (i) where, under the restrictive American rule, attorney\u2019s fees are allowed; and (ii) where <em>controlling substantive law </em>permits recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The Mitchell defendants rely on the \u00a7 37.009 of the Texas DJA to authorize recovery of attorney\u2019s fees. Although the Texas DJA expressly provides for attorney\u2019s fees, it functions solely as a procedural mechanism for resolving substantive (\u2018controversies which ar\u00e9 already within the jurisdiction of the courts.\u201d <em>Housing Authority v. Valdez, </em>841 S.W.2d 860, 864 (Tex.App.\u2014Corpus Christi 1992, writ denied). Unlike substantive law, however, Texas procedure does not govern this diversity action. <em>See Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., </em>518 U.S. 415, -, 116 S.Ct. 2211, 2219, 135 L.Ed.2d 659 (1996) (observing that \u201c[ujnder the <em>Erie </em>doctrine, federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-18\">This court specifically noted in <em>Self-Insurance Institute of America, Inc. v. Korioth, </em>53 F.3d 694 (5th Cir.1995) that although \u201ca party may recover fees in a federal declaratory judgment action where \u2018controlling substantive law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permits such recovery,\u201d \u201c[t]he Texas DJA is neither substantive nor controlling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697 (internal citation omitted). Though jurisdiction in <em>Korioth </em>arose through a federal question claim rather than diversity, the decision\u2019s language clearly indicates, and we now hold, that a party may not rely on the Texas DJA to authorize attorney\u2019s fees in a diversity case because the statute is not substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-19\">The Mitchell Defendants have failed to show they are entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under an applicable fee-shifting statute. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court denying the Mitchell Defendants an award of attorney\u2019s fees is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-16\">. Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code contains the Texas version of the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act. Section 37.009 provides that \"[i]n any proceeding under this chapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney\u2019s fees as are equitable and just.\u201d Tex Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 37.009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-6\">.

Thus, even if the Mitchell Defendants had sought attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 38.001, \u00a7 38.006 expressly excludes them from an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Chapter 38.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
