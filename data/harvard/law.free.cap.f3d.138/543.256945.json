When, their claim was denied for failure to file a Proof of Loss in a timely manner, appellants sued. The district court \u2014 faced with FEMA\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, motion for summary judgment \u2014 entered judgment in favor of FEMA on January 14, 1997. Appellants subsequently filed a motion for a new trial, which the district court denied on the ground that appellants\u2019 filing of the Proof of Loss, even if timely, was inadequate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants contest the judgment of the district court, and we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Appellants contend that the Proof of Loss they proffered on December 5, 1995, was sufficient to allow FEMA an opportunity to evaluate the merits of their claim, and therefore the district court erred in finding the Proof of Loss to be inadequate. Under FEMA regulations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> strict adherence is required to all terms of the SFIP. 44 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 61.13(a), (d), (e). The SFIP, as set forth in the regulations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that within 60 days after the loss (or within any extension authorized by FEMA), the claimant must file a signed and sworn Proof of Loss listing, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) \u201cthe actual cash value ... of each damaged item of insured property ... and the amount of damages sustained,\u201d and (2)\u201cthe amount ... claim[ed][as] due under [the] policy to cover the loss____\u201d <em>Id.) </em>44 C.F.R. Pt. 61 App. A(l), Art. IX, \u00b6 J(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Although we have serious reservations about whether appellants\u2019 filing of- the Proof of Loss was timely under the facts of this case, we do not decide this appeal on that basis. Rather, we uphold the district court\u2019s finding that appellants\u2019 Proof of Loss (assuming it was filed in a timely manner) was inadequate. By writing \u201cTHESE FIGURES ARE UNACCEPTABLE\u201d next to the listed amounts, appellants in effect nullified any representations as to the \u201cactual cash value loss\u201d or \u201cthe net amount claimed\u201d that these figures otherwise would have made.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Rec. 13. Moreover, by failing to provide \u201cacceptable\u201d damage figures of their own, appellants did not provide any sworn information whereby FEMA could evaluate \u201cthe merits of their claim.\u201d Appellants\u2019 presumption that their claim could be processed in these circumstances is simply implausible, if not absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Appellants contend in the alternative that FEMA should be estopped from asserting as a defense their failure to meet the Proof of Loss filing requirement. We disagree. Appellants\u2019 claim ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding, made under the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7, that the judiciary is powerless to uphold an \u201can assertion of es-toppel against the Government by a claimant seeking [money from the Public Treasury contrary to a statutory appropriation].\u201d <em>OPM v. Richmond, </em>496 U.S. 414, 434, 424, 110 S.Ct. 2465, 2476, 2471, 110 L.Ed.2d 387 (1990). The Court recognized that \u2018\u201cnot even the temptations of a hard case\u2019 will provide a basis for ordering recovery contrary to the terms of [a] <em>regulation, </em>for to do so would disregard \u2018the duty of all courts to observe the conditions defined by Congress for charging the public treasury.\u2019\u201d <em>Richmond, </em>496 U.S. at 420, 110 S.Ct. at 2469 (quoting <em>Federal Crop Ins. Corporation v. Merrill, </em>332 U.S. 380, 385-86, 68 S.Ct. 1, 3-4, 92 L.Ed. 10 (1947)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Payments awarded under FEMA-is-sued flood insurance policies are indeed \u201ca direct charge on the public treasury.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Lee, </em>812 F,2d 253, 256 (5th Cir. 1987). FEMA, acting well within its statutory rule-making authority, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4013, has established that a claimant must file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Proof of Loss containing certain specified information before his claim may be considered. 44 C.F.R. Pt. 61 App. A(l), Art. IX, \u00b6 J(3). As established above, appellants failed to satisfy this regulatory requirement in this case. In such circumstances, there can be no estoppel of the Proof of Loss requirement, for we cannot estop \u201cthe conditions defined by Congress for charging the public treasury.\u201d <em>Richmond, </em>496 U.S. at 420, 110 S.Ct. at 2469 (quoting <em>Merrill, </em>332 U.S. at 385-86, 68 S.Ct. at 3-4). Appellants, therefore, have not raised any genuine issues of material fact foreclosing judgment as a matter of law in FEMA\u2019s favor. The judgment of the district court is affirmed accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-11\">. The district court issued its order denying appellants' motion for new trial on April 18, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b616-12\">. Appellants'. Notice of Appeal purports to challenge the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d issued by the district court on April 18, 1997. As discussed above, the district court issued its judgment in favor of FEMA on January 14, 1997, not on April 18, 1997. The only action the district court took on April 18, 1997 was to deny appellants\u2019 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"ABlg\">FEMA contends that appellants\u2019 Notice of Appeal raises for review only the denial of their motion for new trial, and therefore our review of the district court\u2019s action is constrained by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Goldman v. Bosco, </em>120 F.3d 53, 54 (5th Cir. 1997) (\"Generally, we review the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for new trial for an abuse of discre-tion____\u201d). Appellants, however, advocate the de novo standard of review that we reserve for appeals of summary judgment. <em>F.D.I.C. v. Lee, </em>130 F.3d 1139, 1140 (5th Cir.1997) (\"[A] grant of summary judgment [is reviewed] de novo.\u2019\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">We need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute concerning the posture of this appeal and the applicable standard of review. Even if we view this case as an appeal of summary judgment, and apply the more lenient de novo standard of review, the district court\u2019s judgment survives scrutiny. As explained below, appellants fail to establish that there is a \"genuine issue [of] material fact\u201d or that FEMA is not \"entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-14\">.
