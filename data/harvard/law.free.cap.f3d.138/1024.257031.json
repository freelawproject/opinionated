Pryor argues that the jury verdict was against the great weight of the evidence and asserts that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to grant her a new trial. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-17\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"AkI\">Pryor is employed as an assembly line worker at the Trane plant in Tyler, Texas. In, 1992, she was. injured in a nomoccupational automobile accident and later underwent a fusion of the cervical vertebrae in her neck. Pryor unsuccessfully attempted to return to work on several occasions. When she again attempted to return to work in November 1994, Trane requested a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE), which was conducted by David Penn, an independent physical therapist. Based on the FCE, one of Trane\u2019s in-house physicians, Dr. Levin, prescribed a set of restrictions limiting Pryor\u2019s repetitive and constant lifting and prohibiting overhead lifting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-19\">On July 31, 1995, Pryor was recalled to work and placed at the lay-in station on the wiring line, putting tape over unnecessary holes in control boxes. She was laid off two and one-half days later, however, after Dr. Famham of Trane\u2019s medical services department determined that the position she had been given was inconsistent with her medical restrictions because it required the repetitive lifting of a thirteen pound cart. Pryor was allowed to return to work in the same position four months later, however, after the lifting component of the job had been eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-20\">In April 1996, Pryor filed suit in district court under the ADA, alleging that Trane had unlawfully discriminated against her because of her disability by laying her off for the four months from August to November, 1995. The case was tried to a jury, which found that Pryor was not disabled. After the district court denied her motion for a new trial, Pryor timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-23\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ae09\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANT\">The only issue raised by Pryor on appeal is whether the district court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>denying her motion for a new trial. \u201cA trial court should not grant a new trial on eviden-tiary grounds unless the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The decision to grant or deny a motion for new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we will not reverse its ruling without a clear showing that this discretion has' been abused.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, our review is more narrow when a' new trial is denied than when one is granted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In such cases, \u201call the factors that govern our review of [the trial court\u2019s] decision favor affirmance,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and we must affirm the verdict unless the evidence\u2014 viewed in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict \u2014 \u201cpoints \u2018so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary [conclusion].\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">B. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"APi\">The ADA defines \u201cdisability\u201d as:</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual;</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">(B) a record of such an impairment; or</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-15\">(C)being regarded as having such an impairment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-16\">\u201cAlthough the ADA does not define \u2018substantially limits\u2019 and \u2018major life activities,\u2019 the regulations promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC] \u2018provide significant guidance.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These regulations define \u201cmajor life activities\u201d as \u201cfunctions such as earing for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u2019 \u201cOther major life activities could include lifting, reaching, sitting, or standing.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Whether an impairment substantially limits<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a major life activity is determined by considering (1) the nature and severity of the impairment, (2) its duration or expected duration, and (3) its permanent or expected permanent or long-term impact.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[Temporary, non-chronic impairments of short duration, with little or no longer term or permanent impact, are usually not disabilities.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-17\">Pryor contends that she was substantially limited in the major life activities of lifting, pulling and pushing, and working. Examining first whether Pryor\u2019s impairment substantially limited the major activities of lifting, pulling and pushing,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>that there was evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict that she was not disabled. \u201cTo determine whether a person is substantially limited in a major life activity other than working, we look to whether that person can perform the normal activities of daily living.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>' Although Penn noted in the FCE that Pryor\u2019s lifting from shoulder to overhead and her ability to pull and push were below average, he also declared that \u201c[h]er activities of daily living are 100%.\u201d . The FCE specifically stated that the results of her tests regarding sitting, reaching, bending, squatting, walking, climbing a ladder, kneeling, and balance were all normal, and professed that \u201c[s]he denies difficulty with driving.\u201d The jury\u2019s finding that Pryor was not disabled was therefore not against the great weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\">This finding is also consistent with the caselaw regarding lifting as a major life activity under the ADA. In <em>Dutcher, </em>the plaintiff presented evidence that she could \u201cdo lifting and reaching as long as she avoidfed] heavy lifting and repetitive rotational movements.\u201d <footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>She also testified that she \u201c[had] trouble picking up little things from the floor, ... holding things up high or real tight for long periods of time, and ... turning the car\u2019s ignition.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, holding that \u201ca jury could not find that her impairment substantially limits life activities on this basis.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Williams v. Channel Master Satellite Systems, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court held that \u201cas a matter of law, ... a twenty-five pound lifting limitation ... does not constitute a significant restriction on one\u2019s ability to lift, work, or perform any other major life activity.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-15\">With regard to the activity of working:</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-16\">[Substantially limits means significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-17\">Pryor testified that she could perform her job without any accommodation, both before and after the assembly line was changed. Furthermore, no evidence was presented that she could not perform an entire class of jobs; in fact, Penn found Pryor able to perform a medium level of work as defined by the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. She was only prohibited from performing jobs that required constant or overhead lifting. A reasonable juror could have found from this evidence that Pryor was not unable to perform a broad range of jobs and was thus not substantially limited in the major life activity of working.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>Next, Pryor asserts that her injury, surgery, hospitalization, and inability to work for two years establish as a matter of law that she had a record of a disability for purposes of the ADA. We disagree. In <em>Ray v. Glidden</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the plaintiff missed more than a year of work and underwent surgeries to replace his hips and shoulders. We affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, explaining that there must be a record of an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. We held that restrictions indicating an inability to perform continuous, heavy lifting or an inability to perform a particular job do not necessarily constitute a record of disability.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Likewise, in this- case, there was evidence that Pryor was given work restrictions based on her medical history and the FCE. As in <em>Ray, </em>however, the mere fact that Pryor had work restrictions did not require the jury to find that she had a disability that substantially limited a major life activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Finally, Pryor insists that Trane regarded her as having a disability. According to the EEOC regulations, an individual is \u201cregarded as having such an impairment\u201d if she \u201chas a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by a covered entity as constituting such limitation.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We have explained, however, that \u201can employer does not necessarily regard an employee as having a substantially limiting impairment simply because it believes she is incapable of performing a particular job.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Here, evidence was presented that, while Trane considered Pryor to have a neck impairment that limited her ability to perform her particular job, the company did not regard her as disabled. There was no evidence that Trane regarded Pryor\u2019s neck injury as preventing her from performing an entire class of jobs; it merely showed that at the time there were no jobs available which fit Pryor\u2019s restrictions. The jury was entitled to conclude that, even though Trane was aware of Pryor\u2019s medical restrictions and deferred to a doctor\u2019s judgment that her position was incompatible with those restrictions, it did not regard her as disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">As the jury verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence, we perceive no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Pryor\u2019s motion. And as we have frequently noted, \u201c[w]e are \u2018not free to reweigh the evidence and set aside the jury verdict (simply) because the jury could have drawn different inferences or conclusions or because (we) feel that other results are more reasonable.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-13\">Our review of the record and the arguments of counsel leads us to conclude that the jury verdict was supported' by the law and the evidence, and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Pryor\u2019s motion for a new trial. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1097-12\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1097-13\">.
