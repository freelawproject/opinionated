Appellee Pinnacle Brands, Inc. (Pinnacle) brought pursuant to the, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in (1) holding that they had not pled a cognizable injury under RICO, and therefore did not have standing, and (2) refusing to allow them to amend their complaint 'to correct the perceived deficiency. After a review of the record kid the arguments of counsel, we find no reversible error and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-18\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b676-19\">FACTS'AND PROCEEDINGS'</p>\n<p id=\"b676-20\">Pinnacle is a leading manufacturer of sports trading - cards, especially football, baseball, hockey and motor sports cards. These trading cards employ names, likenesses, and other images of athletes and sports teams whose rights are licensed to Pinnacle for use in connection with the cards. Pinnacle sells its cards in packages of six to. twenty cards, one or more of which might be \u201cchase\u201d cards,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rare and valuable collectibles which are randomly inserted in some of the packages. The odds of a chase card'being included are printed on each package.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-21\">Plaintiffs are individuals who have purchased Pinnacle trading cards for themselves or their children, and who purport to represent- a class consisting of \u201c[a]ll original end-use purchasers of sports cards marketed by Pinnacle Brands, Inc.....within the four years prior to the filing of this Complaint.\u201d Plaintiffs assert that they purchase packages of Pinnacle cards in search of chase cards, and allege that Pinnacle\u2019s marketing of its chase cards comprises all the elements of illegal'gambling: (1) consideration (\u201cpersons must purchase card packages in order to try to win a valuable chase card\u201d);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. (2) chance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>(\u201cvaluable chase cards are randomly inserted in the packages\u201d); and (3) a prize (\u201cchase cards have, and are perceived by class members to have, value, and \u25a0 obtaining a chase card in a package is winning a prize\u201d). \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"APC\">Plaintiffs filed suit in district court in July 1996, asserting claims against Pinnacle for violations of \u00a7\u00a7 1962(a)-(d) of RICO.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They \u2018 sought to recover treble damages pursuant to \u00a7 1964(c) and to enjoin Pinnacle from continuing to market its sports cards in ways that violate RICO and state and federal gambling laws.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In August 1996, the court ordered plaintiffs to file a RICO ease statement setting forth in more detail and specificity the facts on which plaintiffs relied in their. RICO complaint. Plaintiffs timely filed this statement. In September 1996, Pinnacle filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), to which plaintiffs responded. In April 1997, the district court granted Pinnacle\u2019s motion, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and entered final judgment in favor of Pinnacle, holding that plaintiffs had failed to allege that they had been injured in their \u201cbusiness or property\u201d as required by \u00a7 1964(c) of RICO, and that they therefore lacked standing to sue. After their motion to vacate the judgment or for reconsideration was denied, plaintiffs timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"A6u\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b677-17\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, accepting as true all well-pleaded facts in the complaint and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s refusal to allow plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint is reviewed for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>B. <em>RICO Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">RICO provides a private civil action to recover treble damages for injury suffered as a result of a violation of its substantive provisions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To state a civil RICO claim under \u00a7 1962, a plaintiff must allege: (1) the conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a preliminary matter, however, a plaintiff must establish that he has standing to sue. \u201cThe standing provision of civil RICO provides that \u2018[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor ... and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, a RICO plaintiff must satisfy two elements \u2014 injury and causation. In dismissing this action, the district court concluded that plaintiffs had not suffered any injury to their business or property.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In their complaint, plaintiffs contend that they spent money to purchase Pinnacle\u2019s trading cards. They also allege that \u201c[a]s a direct and proximate result of Pinnacle\u2019s violations of [18 U.S.\u2019C. \u00a7\u00a7\u25a0 1962(a)-(d) ], members of the plaintiff class have been injured in their business or property.\u201d They insist that these allegations are sufficient to satisfy the RICO standing requirement: \u201c\u2018At the pleading stage, <em>general factual allegations </em>of injury resulting from the defendant\u2019s conduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss- we presume that gener\u00e1l allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">Moreover, plaintiffs insist that, inasmuch as \u201cRICO requires that the gambling activity be \u2018chargeable under state law,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the district court should' have looked to applicable state law to measure Pinnacle\u2019s wrongdoing and plaintiffs\u2019 standing to sue. Specifically, plaintiffs urge that the district court should have followed the methodology employed by the California district court in <em>Schwartz v. Upper Deck, </em>a similar class action against a different card manufacturer, and analyzed the laws of New York and New Jersey, the states where plaintiffs reside and made then-trading card' purchases.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such an analysis, they maintain, would have led the district court in Texas to conclude \u2014 as did' the court in <em>Upper Deck </em>\u2014 that both New York and New Jersey recognize a person\u2019s property interest in money spent on games of chance and authorize civil actions to recover such funds.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">Pinnacle counters \u2014 and we, like the district court, agree \u2014 that plaintiffs\u2019 conclusional allegations, unaccompanied by assertions of even general facts'-to show injury, fail to satisfy the RICO standing requirement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Pinnacle disputes plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that they were injured in the amount spent for trading cards, insisting that the pleadings show no \u201ctangible financial loss\u201d to plaintiffs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To this contention of plaintiffs, Pinnacle responds th\u00e1t plaintiffs received a pack of trading cards for their money; \u201c[t]hey got exactly what they paid for and they do not and cannot allege otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Pinnacle maintains that the district court was not required to apply New York and New Jersey law to determine whether plaintiffs had standing. Pinnacle acknowledges that, if we were deciding whether it had committed a state law predicate act, application of the state gambling laws would be necessary. It argues, however, that this analysis is irrelevant to plaintiffs\u2019 standing under RICO; the fact that a victim of gambling in New York or New Jersey has a state law remedy to recover an amount equal to a multiple of the money spent to gamble does not make plaintiffs\u2019 claim for its consideration a property loss under RICO. Pinnacle notes further that in the event we should conclude that state law is applicable, we should follow <em>Fishman v. Marvel Entertainment </em>Group<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and <em>Sullivan v. The Topps </em>Co.,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> cases identical to this one but against different card manufacturers, in which a federal district court sitting in New York \u2014 one of the states whose law is alleged to control \u2014 determined that the New York and New Jersey statutes did not confer RICO standing on plaintiffs.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Our review of the record and the relevant law convinces us that Pinnacle has the prevailing argument. We agree with the district court that \u201c[p]laintiffs do not allege that they received something different than precisely what they bargained for: six to twenty cards in a pack with a chance that one of those cards may be of Ken Griffey, Jr.\u201d Injury to mere expectancy interests or to an \u201cintangible property interest\u201d is not sufficient to confer RICO standing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Furthermore, as noted by the court, even if a pack does not contain a chase card, \u201c[plaintiffs do not allege that the value of the cards that they did receive is less than the consideration paid.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> And even though courts may look to state law to determine, for RICO purposes, whether a property interest exists,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> it does not follow that any injury for which a plaintiff might assert a state law claim is necessarily sufficient to establish a claim under RICO.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Finally, plaintiffs failed adequately to allege the causation element of RICO standing. Section 1964(c) requires that a compensable injury be \u201cby reason of\u2019 the defendant\u2019s substantive violations \u2014 here, Pinnacle\u2019s alleged illegal gambling. Plaintiffs assert that they paid money for trading cards, but fail to allege in their complaint that this money was paid for a chance at a chase card. Absent such an allegation, they have shown no financial loss \u201cby reason of\u2019 the gambling scheme.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Plaintiffs argue in the alternative that the district court abused its discretion in denying them leave to amend their complaint to correct any deficiency. Whereas FRCP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>15(a) \u201c \u2018evinces a bias in favor of. granting leave, to amend,\u2019 [such leave] is not automatic.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In deciding whether to allow amendment, a district court \u201cmay consider such factors as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory-motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party, and futility of amendment.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The district court. in this case, weighing these factors, concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An6\">Plaintiffs are represented by able counsel and have had three opportunities to articu-l\u00e1te their damage theory \u2014 in the complaint, the RICO case statement, and brief in response of the motion to dismiss. Pinnacle should not be subjected to any further costs of litigation in this lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We perceive no abuse of discretion in this reasoning, and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Although we ultimately decline to reverse the district court, we wish to express here our appreciation of the well-delineated arguments set forth in the excellent appellate briefs of counsel for both parties. As for our affirmance, in addition to the' reasons set forth by the district court, we find comfort in the fact that, of the many suits of this nature that have been filed around the country against trading card manufacturers and their licensors, all but two have been dismissed with prejudice. We also note that many of those suits were decided by courts in New York and New Jersey, the siti of the laws on which plaintiffs base the predicate acts for their RICO claims. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 RICO claims with prejudice is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-15\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-68 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b676-16\">.
