He appeals his 292-month sentence, raising three issues. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-13\">1. <em>Career Offender Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1444-14\">The district court sentenced Gilbert as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. To qualify as a career offender, a defendant must have been convicted of at least two \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d or drug crimes. <em>See id. </em>Gilbert clearly had one \u2014 he was previously convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. But Gilbert contends that the second crime on which the district court relied, carrying a concealed firearm in violation of Florida law, is not a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and that he should therefore not be sentenced as a career offender. This court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>See United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 936, 938 (11th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-16\">Although this court has never reached the precise question whether carrying a concealed firearm is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(1), it has posted the road signs leading the way. There are two ways for a crime to be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(1): either the offense has an element of force or attempted force, or it \u201cis burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(l)(ii)(1995). The elements of a concealed firearm offense do not include any use of force; knowing carrying and concealment suffice. <em>See Smith v. State, </em>687 So.2d 875, 878 (Fla.App.2d Dist.1997). Carrying a concealed firearm, therefore, is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d only if it \u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-17\">The same language concerning a \u201cserious potential risk\u201d appears in the federal armed career criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), where it is an element of a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d Construing that section, this court has held that carrying a concealed weapon is conduct that poses a serious potential risk of injury. <em>See United States v. Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398, 401 (11th Cir.1996). Because the definitions of \u201cviolent felony\u201d and \u201ccrime of violence\u201d are in this respect identical, <em>Hall\u2019s </em>conclusion applies equally to the question at hand here. <em>Cf. United States v. Patton, </em>114 F.3d 174, 176 (11th Cir.1997) (extending <em>Hall\u2019s </em>reasoning to the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 4B1.2(1)). We thus hold that carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Florida law is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(1). Gilbert was properly sentenced as a career off\u00e9nder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-18\">\n<em>2. Refusal to Depart Downward</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-19\">At Gilbert\u2019s sentencing hearing, the court expressed frustration at the sentence it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>was required to impose for Gilbert\u2019s small-scale drug dealing, enhanced by one previous instance of small-scale dealing and a concealed firearm offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1445-4\">The fact that I think the sentence is too high is immaterial. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t say what I think, but Congress has gone too far. For us to pay for this man to be in jail 24 years is ridiculous when it runs $30,000 a year. I can see that money going for other things. How do we curb him? I don\u2019t know. But I hate spending $30,000 a year for the next 24 years for him. He doesn\u2019t deserve it. I\u2019d rather spend that money on some poor child, some poor person, sick person, some deprived person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1445-5\">But I don\u2019t see any authority under the law for me to downwardly depart. So, counsel, I have given you reversible error if you can convince the Eleventh Circuit that I\u2019m wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1445-6\">(R.3 at 4-5.) Gilbert asserts that the district court found that Gilbert\u2019s criminal history was overstated, and that the court accordingly had authority to depart downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Although a discretionary refusal to depart downward is not appealable, we may consider de novo whether the district court had authority to depart if the refusal to depart downward was based on the district court\u2019s perceived lack of authority. <em>United States v. Fossett, </em>881 F.2d 976, 979 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-7\">Gilbert is correct that the district court could have departed downward if it had found Gilbert\u2019s criminal history to be overrepresented. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 (policy statement) (downward departure may be appropriate for defendant with extensive history of petty crime); <em>United States v. Lindia, </em>82 F.3d 1154, 1165 (1st Cir.1996). But the record does not reveal such a finding. The court\u2019s statement followed Gilbert\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument that the court should depart downward because of Gilbert\u2019s overrepresented criminal history. Even so, the district court did not suggest that Gilbert\u2019s criminal history did not accurately reflect the seriousness of his conduct. Rather, the court simply conveyed its discontent with the policy choices that Congress has made in imposing high sentences for relatively minor crimes, thus requiring spending for prisons instead of more constructive programs. Disagreement with the policy choices underlying the Sentencing Guidelines and sentencing statutes is not a ground for downward departure, and the court properly determined that it lacked authority to depart downward. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>911 F.2d 542, 551 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-9\">\n<em>3. Extra Acceptance-of-Responsibility Point</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQL\">The district court awarded Gilbert a two-point reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. Gilbert contends, however, that he is entitled to a three-point reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) either because he timely provided information to the Government concerning his offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b)(1), or because he timely notified the Government of his intention to plead guilty, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b)(2). The timeliness of these acts is an issue of fact, the resolution of which we review for clear error only. <em>See United States v. McConaghy, </em>23 F.3d 351, 353 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-11\">Apart from a bare assertion that he spoke to the DEA, there is no record evidence to suggest that Gilbert provided any information to the Government concerning his offense, and we thus reject his challenge based on that ground. The question of the timeliness of Gilbert\u2019s guilty plea requires a little more discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-12\">Gilbert- was indicted on December 1, 1995. He was arraigned on January 18, 1996. On January 24, trial was set for March 4. On February 13, he moved to suppress evidence. The court denied this motion on March 1, and on March 4 \u2014 the day of trial \u2014 Gilbert pleaded guilty. There is no record evidence of when Gilbert notified the Government of an intent to plead guilty, but the record shows that the Government filed an exhibit list and notice of prior convictions on March 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-13\">As a general rule, pleas on the eve of trial are not timely. <em>See United States v. Kimple, </em>27 F.3d 1409, 1413 (9th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Donovan, </em>996 F.2d 1343, 1345 (1st Cir.1993). Pleas at that time do not help either the Government to avoid, trial preparation or the court to manage its schedule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>efficiently, the two purposes served by the \u00a7 3El.l(b) additional one-point reduction. <em>See McConaghy, </em>23 F.3d at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-4\">Gilbert contends nonetheless that in his case he pleaded guilty very soon after the denial of his motion to suppress, and that the plea was therefore timely; to conclude otherwise, he contends, would penalize him for exercising a right to seek suppression of evidence. Not so. First, this court has declined to consider the Guidelines\u2019 limitations on some offense-level reductions to be improper penalties for exercise of legal rights. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>127 F.3d 987, 989 (11th Cir.1997). Second, looking at the timeliness of the plea <em>solely </em>from the defendant\u2019s perspective (as Gilbert suggests), without taking into account the obvious fact that the Government had to prepare for trial and therefore did not benefit from avoiding trial preparation, defeats the purpose of \u00a7 3El.l(b)\u2019s incentive to plead early. It is after all a rare case when the defendant does not plead as soon as he believes it convenient and appropriate for him to do so. Thus, if the defendant\u2019s trial strategy (such as a choice to file a motion to suppress) is given undue weight, a guilty plea would almost always warrant a three-point reduction regardless of whether \u00a7 3El.l(b)\u2019s purposes have been served. To avoid this result, district courts should give more weight to the state of the Government\u2019s trial preparation than to the defendant\u2019s position or strategy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So considered, the district court\u2019s finding that the plea was not timely is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Gilbert\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1446-10\">. Of course, in the unusual circumstances that the defendant\u2019s delay is caused <em>only </em>by his counsel's proven need to investigate the propriety of pleading guilty, <em>McConaghy </em>requires that the cause for the defendant\u2019s delay figure into the timeliness assessment. <em>See McConaghy, </em>23 F.3d at 354. No such circumstances have been shown here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
