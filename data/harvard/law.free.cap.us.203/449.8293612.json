S. 454; <em>Mexican National Railroad </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>157 U. S. 201; <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Montgomery County, </em>199 U. S. 260, 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>In <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Quincy Mining Company, </em>145 U. S. 444, 446, Mr. Justice Gray, speaking for the court, in disposing of the question whether, under \u00a7 1, \u201ca corporation incorporated in one State of the Union, and having a usual piace of business in another State in which it has not been incorporated, may be sued in a Circuit Court of .the United States held in the -latter State, by a citizen of a different State,\u201d said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u201cThis question, upon which there has been a diversity of opinion in the Circuit Courts, can be best determined by a review of the acts of Congress, and of the decisions of this court, regarding the original jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts of the United States over suits between citizens of different States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">\u201cIn carrying out the provision of the Constitution which declares\u2019 that the- judicial power of the United States shall extend to controversies \u2018between citizens of different States,\u2019 Congress, by the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, \u00a7 11, conferred jurisdiction on the Circuit Court of suits of a civil nature, at 'common law or in equity, \u2018 between a citizen of the State where the suit is brought and a citizen of another State,\u2019 and provided that \u2018jio civil suit shall be brought against an inhabitant of the United States, in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, or in which he shall be found .at the-time of serving the writ.\u2019 1 Stat. 78, 79.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">And, after observations in relation to the use of the word \u201cinhabitant\u201d in that act, and referring to th&lt;3 act of May 4, 1858, 11 Stat. c. 27, p. 272, \u00a7 1, and the act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470, c. 137, \u00a7 1, Mr. Justice Gray thus continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">\u201c The act of 1887, both in its original form, and as corrected in 1888, reenacts the rule- that no .civil suit shall be brought against any person in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant, but omits the clause allowing a defendant to be sued in the district where he is found, and adds this clause: \u2018But where the jurisdiction of either is founded only on the\u2019 fact that the action is between citizens of different States, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>either the plaintiff or the defendant.\u2019 24 Stat. 552; 25 Stat. 434. As has been adjudged by this court, the last clause is by way of proviso to the next preceding clause, which forbids any suit to be brought in any other district than that whereof the defendant is an inhabitant; and the effect is that \u201cwhere thp jurisdiction is founded upon any of the clauses mentioned in this section, except the citizenship of the parties, it must be brought in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded solely upon the fact that the parties are citizens of different States, the suit may be brought in the district in which either the plaintiff or the defendant resides. <em>McCormick Company </em>v. <em>Walthers, </em>134 U. S. 41, 43. And the general object of this act, as appears upon its face, and as has been often declared by this court, is to contract, not to enlarge, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts of the United States. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Lyon, </em>133 U. S. 315, 320; <em>In re Pennsylvania Company, </em>137 U. S. 451, 454; <em>Fisk </em>v. <em>Henarie, </em>142 U. S. 459, 467.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">\u201cAs to natural persons, therefore, it cannot be doubted that the effect of this act, read in the light of earlier acts upon the same subject, and of the judicial c\u00f3nstruction thereof, is that the phrase 'district of the residence of\u2019 a person.is equivalent to \u2018district whereof he is an inhabitant,\u2019 and cannot be construed as giving jurisdiction, by reason of citizenship, to a Circuit Court held in a State of which neither party is a citizen, but, on the contrary, restricts the jurisdiction to the district in which one of the parties resides within the State of which he is a citizen; and that this act, therefore, having taken away the alternative, permitted in the earlier acts, of suing a person in the district \u2018in which he shall be found,\u2019 requires any suit, the jurisdiction of which is founded only on its being between citizens of different States, to be brought in the State of which one is a citizen, and in the district therein of which he is an inhabitant and resident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In short, the acts of 1887-1888 restored the rule of 1789, as we stated in <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Montgomery County, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>In the present case neither of the parti\u00e9s was a citizen of. the State of Missouri, in which State the suit was brought, and, therefore, it could not have been brought in the Circuit Cpurt in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Wisner did not, of choice, select the state court as the forum, since he could not have sued in the Circuit Court under the act, because neither he nor Beardsley was a citizen of Missouri. And the question of jurisdiction relates to the time of commencing the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">But it is contended that Beardsley was entitled to remove the case to the Circuit Court, and as by Ms petition for removal he waived the objection so far as he was personally concerned that he was not sued in Ms district, hence that the Circmt Court obtained jurisdiction over the suit. This does not follow, inasmuch as in view of the intention of Congress by the act of 1887 to contract the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts, and of the limitations imposed thereby,, jurisdiction of the suit could not have obtained, even with the consent of both parties. As we have heretofore remarked: \u201cJurisdiction as to the subject matter may be limited in various ways as to civil and criminal cases; cases at common law or in equity or-in admiralty; probate. cases, or cases under special statutes; to particular classes of persons; to proceedings in particular modes; and so on.\u201d <em>Louisville Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Comingor, </em>184 U. S. 18, 25. In <em>Central Trust Company </em>v. <em>McGeorge, </em>151 U. S. 129, it was assumed, however, that the requirement that no suit should be brought in any other district than that of the plaintiff or of the defendant might be waived, where neither resided therein, because in that case the non-resident plaintiff had sued in the Circmt Court and the non-resident defendant had answered on the merits, which showed the consent of both parties and not unnaturally led to the result announced, wMle in tMs case there was no such consent. As was stated by Mr. Justice Brewer, in <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association, </em>191 U. S. 78, 82: \u201cA petition and bond for removal are in the nature of process.. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>constitute the process by which the case is transferred from the state to the Federal court.\u201d When, then, Beardsley filed his petition for removal, he sought affirmative relief in another district than his own. But plaintiff, in resisting the application and moving to remand, denied the- jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. In <em>St. Louis &amp;c. Railway Co. </em>v. <em>McBride, </em>141 U. S. 127, where the plaintiffs were ci\u00fc\u00bb-.._&gt; <em>\u00bf </em>,.u residents of the Western District of Arkansas, and cor.-m- \u25a0 \u25a0''-lAhebr in the Circuit Court of the United States for the district, and. the defendant was a corporation and citizen of the State of Missouri, it was held that, as the defendant appeared and pleaded to the merits, he thereby waived his right to challenge thereafter the jurisdiction of the court over him, on the ground that the suit had been brought in the wrong district. And there are many other cases to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Our conclusion is that the case should have been remanded, and as the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to proceed, that mandamus is the proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\n<em>Mandamus awarded; petition for prohibition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b493-7\">Mr. Justice Brewer concurred in the result.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
