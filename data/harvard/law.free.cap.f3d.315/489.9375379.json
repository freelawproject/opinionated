Moreno contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from his vehicle at the Sarita immigration checkpoint. Citing <em>City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, </em>531 U.S. 32, 121 S.Ct. 447, 148 L.Ed.2d 333 (2000), Moreno contends that his detention at the checkpoint was illegal at its inception because the checkpoint has a secondary programmatic purpose of drug interdiction, as evidenced by the permanent presence of dogs cross-trained to detect drugs as well as humans (the alert of the dogs being the same on detection of either). This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Moreno does not dispute that, as the district court found (on the basis of ample, and virtually undisputed, evidence), the Sarita checkpoint has as its <em>primary </em>programmatic purpose the enforcement of the immigration laws. <em>Edmond </em>requires no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><em>Edmond </em>states \u201c[o]ur holding also does not impair the ability of police officers to act appropriately upon information that they properly learn during a checkpoint stop justified by a lawful <em>primary </em>purpose, even where such action may result in the arrest of a motorist for an offense unrelated to that purpose.\u201d <em>Id., </em>121 S.Ct. at 457 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Machuca-Barrera, </em>261 F.3d 425 (5th Cir.2001), we held that \u201ccheckpoints with the <em>primary </em>purpose of identifying illegal immigrants are constitutional,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 431 (emphasis added), that in such a case \u201c[i]t is the length of the detention, not the questions asked, that makes a specific stop unreasonable,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 432, and that where \u201cthe <em>primary </em>purpose of the ... checkpoint is to investigate immigration status ... we face <em>only </em>the question of whether the suspicionless [checkpoint] stop ... was sufficiently limited in duration to pass constitutional muster.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434-35 (emphasis added). In that case, we upheld the search despite the fact that the . Border Patrol Agent at the checkpoint had asked the defendant about drugs, because the questioning was \u201cwithin the permissible duration of an immigration checkpoint stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435. We are aware that in its footnote 2 <em>Edmond </em>states \u201cwe need not decide whether the State may establish a checkpoint program with the primary purpose of checking licenses or driver sobriety and a secondary purpose of interdicting cocaine.\u201d <em>Id., </em>121 S.Ct. at 457 n. 2. However, we agree with the D.C. Circuit that this \u201cfootnote seems divorced from the rest of the opinion\u201d and that, as indicated in other passages of <em>Edmond </em>above cited, a checkpoint is constitutional if its <em>primary </em>purpose is lawful. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>270 F.3d 977, 979 (D.C.Cir.2001). That is likewise the necessary inference of our <em>Machucar-Barrera </em>holding discussed above. Further, we cited <em>Davis </em>with approval in <em>United States v. Green, </em>293 F.3d 855, 859 (5th Cir.2002), in respect to determining \u201cthe primary purpose of a checkpoint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The Sarita checkpoint, where Moreno was stopped, is and has been for over twenty-five years an established fixed immigration checkpoint operated by the Border Patrol, the validity of which was sustained in <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 3079, 3087, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976), affirming <em>United States v. Sifuentes, </em>517 F.2d 1402 (5th Cir.1975) (table). We have long sustained such stops at this checkpoint, including those where drugs were discovered (within the scope of the immigration inquiry). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rojas, 538 </em>F.2d 670 (5th Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Medina, </em>543 F.2d 553 (5th Cir.1976). Moreno does not argue, and did not argue below, that the Sarita checkpoint would not be maintained were it not for the fact that the immigration stops there often result in interdiction of drugs, nor would the evidence support any such finding, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>district court implicitly found to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">We accordingly hold that Moreno\u2019s immigration stop at the Sarita checkpoint was valid because the checkpoint has as its primary programmatic purpose the enforcement of the immigration laws, regardless of whether or not it could also be said to have a secondary programmatic purpose of drug interdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In the instant case, a dog alerted to Moreno\u2019s vehicle at the primary inspection area, while a border patrol agent was questioning Moreno about his citizenship (the dog was then outside of the vehicle and no entry into it had been made). Thus, the agent had a reasonable suspicion before she had finished verifying Moreno\u2019s citizenship and the presence of the dog did not affect the duration of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-5\">. <em>See also id.., </em>121 S.Ct. at 456 n. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\"... our judgment turns on the fact that <em>the primary </em>purpose of the Indianapolis checkpoints is to advance the, general interest in crime control. THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019S dissent also erroneously characterizes our opinion as holding that the 'use of a drug-sniffing dog ... annuls what is otherwise plainly constitutional under our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.\u2019 <em>Post, </em>at 458. Again, the constitutional defect of the program is that its <em>primary </em>purpose is to advance the general interest in crime control.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-20\">.
