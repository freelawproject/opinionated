Upon petitions filed pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.1-572,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial court, by order of October 30, 1968, ordered the number of such districts increased from four to five. By the same order, the court, at the request of the appellants and pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.1-577, appointed seven commissioners to lay off and designate the five districts according to certain guidelines set forth in the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-17\">The commissioners proceeded to execute the order and on March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>7, 1969, returned their report to the office of the clerk of the court pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.1-578. The report and a map annexed thereto showing the new magisterial districts were admitted to record in the clerk\u2019s office as required by Code \u00a7 15.1-579.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Forrest C. Bailey, III, and other intervening petitioners, the appellants here, then filed with the court a motion to vacate the commissioners\u2019 report. The court ruled that it was without jurisdiction to entertain the motion, and the motion was denied. It is this ruling which presents the sole question for decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Under Code \u00a7 15.1-576, the circuit court itself is vested with authority under certain conditions to rearrange or to increase or diminish the number of magisterial districts in a county. However, under Code \u00a7 15.1-577, if the court is \u201cunable safely and properly to determine the matter\u201d or if a \u201cparty ask it,\u201d the court is required to appoint commissioners to \u201cexecute the order of the court\u201d and to \u201clay off and designate\u201d the districts. And under Code \u00a7 15.1-579, when the report of the commissioners\u2019 redistricting action is recorded by the clerk of court, the \u201cmagisterial districts so designated and laid off . . . shall thereafter be the magisterial districts of such county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">We will assume, without deciding, that the appellants are correct in their argument that if the court itself accomplishes a redistricting, it would have jurisdiction to reconsider and vacate its action while the matter is still within the breast of the court. And we might agree with the appellants that an anomaly is presented if the court can review its own redistricting action but cannot review the action of commissioners it has appointed to redistrict a county.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">But whether or not an anomaly exists, the simple fact remains that in the statutes under consideration there is no provision for review by the appointing court of the commissioners\u2019 redistricting action. We are dealing with a purely statutory proceeding, and the jurisdiction of the court must be found within the framework of the legislation establishing the proceeding, or not at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">The legislation before us, rather than providing for review by the appointing court of commissioner redistricting, expresses the intention that there should be no such review. That intention is expressed in the provision of Code \u00a7 15.1-579 that the districts laid off and designated by the commissioners <em>shall, </em>upon the recording of their report, \u201cthereafter be the magisterial districts of the county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">It follows that the trial court properly denied the appellants\u2019 motion to vacate. Its action in doing so will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-18\"> Provisions for the rearrangement, increase, diminution, or change of name of magisterial districts are found in Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-572 to 15.1-581.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
