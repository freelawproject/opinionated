He was searched when he was arrested but no evidence was found on his person as a result of this search.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">The record shows that the items introduced in evidence, which resulted in defendant\u2019s conviction, were seized pursuant to three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>search warrants. Two of these search warrants were for dwellings remote from the place where defendant was arrested. The other search warrant was for the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger at the time of his arrest. Defendant does not now challenge the validity of these search warrants or of the supporting affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The evidence introduced was seized under what are now conceded to be valid search warrants and is clearly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Whether the arrest of defendant for vagrancy was a valid arrest becomes moot as there is no showing that he was in any way prejudiced in his trial for breaking and entering by reason of his arrest for vagrancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
