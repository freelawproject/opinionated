Haywood and Stephen N. Haywood, United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company sought to have declared void a fire insurance binder issued in the name of Stephen N. Haywood, trading as Covington Vending Service. The basis of the claim for relief was that Fred W. Haywood, in order to obtain insurance on vending machines owned by him, had wilfully misrepresented to USF&amp;G\u2019s agent that he was Stephen N. Haywood. It was alleged that the misrepresentation was not discovered by USF&amp;G until after the vending machines were destroyed by fire, and it was then learned that Stephen was Fred\u2019s minor son and that Fred had more than twenty unsatisfied judgments against him. It was further alleged that the insurance binder would not have been issued if the agent had known the true facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Fred and Stephen filed an answer denying the allegations of misrepresentation. Thereafter, there was submitted to a jury the question whether a misrepresentation was made by Fred. The jury found that Fred \u201cdid wilfully misrepresent his identity\u201d for the purpose of obtaining insurance. However, the trial court held that the misrepresentation \u201cwas not material to the risks assumed\u201d by USF&amp;G and ruled that the binder issued in the name of Stephen constituted valid and subsisting insurance. Fred was dismissed as a party defendant. We granted USF&amp;G a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In the summer of 1967, Fred W. Haywood, then 42 years old and a resident of the Richmond area, decided to move to Covington and to establish there a vending machine business. While looking for a home in Covington, he met Robert B. McCaleb, a local real estate broker. He introduced himself to McCaleb as Stephen N. Haywood. McCaleb showed Haywood a house that was for sale and eventually secured a contract from him. Throughout the transaction, Haywood represented himself to McCaleb as Stephen N. Haywood. Even the contract on the house was signed in that name.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">During discussions concerning the house, Haywood advised McCaleb of his plans to establish a vending machine business in Covington. McCaleb, who was USF&amp;G\u2019s agent, told Haywood that he was in the insurance business and would like to be considered when Haywood \u201cgot his operation going.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Haywood rented a warehouse in Covington and moved in a quantity of vending machines. He then requested McCaleb to insure the machines. On September 14, 1967, McCaleb issued the binder in question providing fire insurance protection in the sum of $20,000 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>thirty days on vending machines in storage in the warehouse. The binder was issued in the name of \u201cStephen N. Haywood T/A Cov- . ington Vending Service\u201d according to instructions given McCaleb by Haywood.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Upon issuance of the binder, McCaleb, following his usual practice, requested the credit bureau of Covington to furnish him a report on Stephen Haywood\u2019s background in Richmond. After some time, the bureau advised McCaleb that it \u201ccouldn\u2019t find anything on this man.\u201d McCaleb insisted that \u201cthere\u2019s bound to be something\u201d and asked the bureau to make a second check.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">On September 22, 1967, eight days after issuance of the binder, an accidental fire occurred at the warehouse where the vending machines were stored. The machines were destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Following the fire, McCaleb received the credit bureau\u2019s report on Stephen. The report showed the subject to be single. This was contrary to McCaleb\u2019s understanding that the person with whom he had been dealing was \u201ca married man with three children.\u201d The discrepancy in the report led McCaleb to investigate further. His investigation revealed that the person to whom he had issued the binder was not Stephen N. Haywood but was Fred W. Haywood. McCaleb also found that Stephen was Fred\u2019s minor son, 19 years of age, and that Fred had more'than twenty unsatisfied judgments against him in the Richmond area.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">When claim was made against USF&amp;G for loss of the vending machines, it refused to pay, relying upon the misrepresentation perpetrated by Fred. The present litigation ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">To be entitled to the relief it sought\u2014the voidance of the binder\u2014USF&amp;G had the burden of clearly proving that Fred Haywood falsely represented his identity and that the representation was material to the risk when assumed. Code \u00a7 38.1-336; <em>Mutual of Omaha </em>v. <em>Echols' Adm'rs, </em>207 Va. 949, 952, 154 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1967). In a case like this, whether a representation is made and the terms on which it is made are questions of fact for the jury; but when a misrepresentation is proved, its materiality is a question of law for the court. <em>Chitwood </em>v. <em>Prudential, </em>206 Va. 314, 318, 143 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The jury\u2019s verdict in this case established that Fred Haywood wilfully misrepresented his identity to McCaleb for the purpose of obtaining insurance. The verdict was approved by the trial court, but the court concluded that the misrepresentation was immaterial because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Fred Haywood \u201cdid not own the property to be insured and there was no misrepresentation on the part of Stephen Haywood the lawful owner.\u201d Crucial to the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling on materiality is its finding that Stephen alone owned the vending machines, for if Fred owned the machines in whole or in part, a different result necessarily would follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We are of opinion that the evidence does not support a finding that Stephen alone owned the vending machines. To the contrary, the only conclusion that can be fairly reached from the evidence is that Fred, if not the sole owner, had a substantial interest in the machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The evidence showed that Fred had been in the vending machine business in the Richmond area for a number of years operating under different fictitious names. It was as a result of the operation of one of his earlier businesses that more than twenty judgments were entered against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Stephen, although a full-time student, was claimed to be actively involved in the conduct of the vending machine business. He was portrayed as a partner with his father in a Richmond company which was sold just prior to the formulation of Fred\u2019s plan to move to Covington.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The vending machines here in dispute were purchased specifically for use in the Covington venture. That venture, according to Stephen, was set up pursuant to \u201ca verbal agreement\u201d that he \u201cworked out\u201d with Fred whereby the latter \u201cwould operate [the business] and get everything going smoothly\u201d while he, Stephen, was in college. Fred, amplifying what the arrangement was between Stephen and him with respect to the Covington business, testified that it was a \u201cpartnership.\u201d When asked \u201cwho was the owner\u201d of the business, Fred said, \u201cmy son and myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">It is true that both Fred and Stephen testified that the machines were purchased in Stephen\u2019s name. But whatever that may have proved, it did not show sole ownership in Stephen. To the contrary, the undisputed testimony that the Covington venture was a \u201cpartnership\u201d owned by Fred and Stephen was conclusive evidence of Fred\u2019s substantial interest in the machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Thus, the misrepresentation of identity by Fred concealed the fact that he had an interest in the machines and prevented inquiry into his background, an inquiry which would have disclosed the presence of the unsatisfied judgments against him. That this misrepresentation was material was clearly shown by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>McCaleb, USF&amp;G\u2019s agent, testified that if he had known that the man with whom he was dealing was Fred Haywood and had known of the judgments against Fred, he would not have issued the binder. In the case of fire insurance, McCaleb said, the fact that an individual has judgments against him presents a \u201cmoral hazard\u201d because there is a \u201ctemptation to commit arson\u201d to collect the insurance. This uncontradicted testimony meets the established test that a \u201cfact is material to the risk to be assumed by an insurance company if the fact would reasonably influence the company\u2019s decision whether or not to issue a policy. . . .\u201d <em>Mutual of Omaha </em>v. <em>Echols\u2019 Adm\u2019rs, supra, </em>207 Va. at 953-54, 154 S.E.2d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In their brief, the Haywoods suggested that USF&amp;G did not bear its burden of proof because it did not call one of its underwriters to testify on the materiality question, but relied instead on McCaleb\u2019s testimony alone. However, McCaleb had the authority to issue and did issue the binder in question, and he was, therefore, a competent witness to testify that he would have rejected the risk had he known the true facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We conclude that the deception practiced by Fred was the false representation of a fact material to the risk when assumed. We find it unnecessary, therefore, to consider USF&amp;G\u2019s further contention that the concealment of Stephen\u2019s age was also material.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Having clearly proved that Fred Haywood falsely represented his identity and that the representation was material, USF&amp;G was entitled to have the insurance binder issued by it declared void. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and the case remanded with directions to reinstate Fred Haywood as a party defendant and to enter judgment declaring the binder to be void.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
