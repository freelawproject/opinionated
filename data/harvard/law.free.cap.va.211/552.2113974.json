There we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-14\">\u201cCode, \u00a7 8-24 has been consistently construed to provide for survival where the damage to property for which recovery is sought is the direct result of the wrong. Where such damage is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>indirect result of the wrong, the action does not survive. If the action would survive, the limitation is five years; but if it would not survive, the limitation is one year. In determining the question whether the action survives, the real nature of the injury or the claim must be regarded and not the form or method by which it is sought to be redressed or enforced. A claim for indirect and accidental damage to plaintiff\u2019s estate arising from an injury, merely personal in its nature, does not survive. <em>Mumpower </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>94 Va. 737, 27 S.E. 581; <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>115 Va. 899, 80 S.E. 756; <em>Cover </em>v. <em>Critcher, </em>143 Va. 357, 130 S.E. 238; <em>Vance </em>v. <em>Maytag Sales Corp., </em>159 Va. 373, 165 S.E. 393; <em>Westover Corp. </em>v. <em>Eley, </em>185 Va. 718, 40 S.E.2d 177; 1 Mich. Jur., Abatement, Survival and Revival, \u00a7 30, page 29.\u201d 202 Va. at p. 546, 118 S.E.2d at p. 667.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">As we pointed out in <em>Corva, </em>the real nature of the injury or claim must be regarded and not the form or method by which it is sought to be redressed or enforced. That the pleadings allege a breach of contract is immaterial where, as here, the basis of this proceeding was that Turner was guilty of negligence or constructive fraud in failing to effect a liability insurance policy on Harter\u2019s automobile which would cover the risks contemplated by the parties beginning at the time agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The damage to Harter did not occur when the insurance policy was not issued effecting coverage on the date agreed upon. The damage occurred at a subsequent time because of an intervening event, Harter\u2019s negligence in the operation of his car, which might never have occurred. In these circumstances we hold that the action was on a claim of a personal nature for indirect and consequential damages to Harter\u2019s estate and was not assignable.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
