Coleman and James W. Strother appeal from an order convicting each of them of attempted grand larceny as charged in separate indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The evidence showed that Strother was arrested while in the act of prying open the trunk of a car that contained a money bag, which Strother knew was in the trunk and which he thought contained money, but which was in fact empty. The trunk also contained a camera, a movie projector and a tire having a total value of more than $200.00. The indictment returned against Strother charged him with attempted grand larceny of those three articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Strother contends that he could not be convicted of attempted grand larceny because the article he intended to steal, the money bag, was worth less than $100.00. Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.1-100; 18.1-17. We reject that contention. The natural inference to be drawn from Strother\u2019s actions was that he intended to steal whatever he found in the trunk. <em>See Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 291, 163 S.E.2d 570 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Coleman was convicted of the same offense as principal in the second degree. The evidence also supports that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
