J. B. Vaughan and various other landowners affected by the proposed construction intervened in protest against the project. After a hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ing, the Commission granted the license. The protesting intervenors are here on an appeal of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The evidence before the Commission showed, so far as is pertinent here, that VEPCO proposed to construct an electric generating station on the south shore of the reservoir to be created by the dam in question. The station would employ nuclear fuel to create steam and thereby supply the energy to rotate turbines for the production of electricity. Water from the reservoir would be used to cool the closed service system furnishing steam to the turbines. The water, which becomes heated in such a process, would then be diverted to lagoons to be cooled before being returned to the reservoir. Thus, the impounded water would be used not to rotate turbines for the production of electricity, as is true in a conventional hydroelectric plant, but for cooling purposes in the nuclear plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\"> VEPCO contends that the Commission had authority to grant it a license under the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-83 and 62.1-85. Those sections provide that a license is required from the Commission before any dam may be constructed \u201cacross or in the waters of the State\u201d or \u201cin any rivers or streams within the State when such dam is for the purpose of generating hydroelectric energy for use or sale in public service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The protesting intervenors contend that under the foregoing statutory language, the Commission, in this type of case, has authority to license dams for hydroelectric purposes <em>only </em>and that since VEPCO\u2019s proposal is for a project employing nuclear energy, the Commission\u2019s action in issuing the license was void. This contention, however, disregards the distinction between the terms \u201cwaters of the State\u201d and \u201cwaters within the State\u201d in the statutory scheme fixing the authority of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The term \u201cwaters of the State\u201d is defined in Code \u00a7 62.1-81 to include navigable streams and \u201cany stream or part thereof ... in which the construction of any dam or works as authorized by this chapter would affect the interests of interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d While the term \u201cwaters within the State\u201d is not defined, it is obviously meant to include all streams not described as \u201cwaters of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Thus, with respect to the licensing of dam projects, the legislature in the above cited Code sections has recognized two classes of waters: those \u201cwithin the State\u201d and those \u201cof the State.\u201d As to \u201cwaters within the State,\u201d the authority of the Commission is limited to the licens<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ing of a dam for hydroelectric purposes only.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But as to \u201cwaters of the State,\u201d the authority of the Commission extends to the licensing of <em>any </em>dam proposed to be constructed in or across such waters regardless of the purpose for which the dam is to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Therefore, since the project proposed by VEPCO would not be for hydroelectric purposes, the crucial inquiry becomes: Is it a \u201cwater of the State\u201d that VEPCO proposes to dam in the development of its project?</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The evidence before the Commission showed that the electric energy to be generated at the proposed project would flow through VEPCO\u2019s interstate transmission network. The rule is that projects generating energy for the interstate transmission of electricity affect commerce among the states. <em>Federal Power Commission </em>v. <em>Union Electric Co., </em>381 U.S. 90, 94 (1965). It follows that construction of the dam in and across the North Anna River would \u201caffect the interests of interstate or foreign commerce\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 62.1-81 and constitute that stream a water \u201cof the State\u201d under Code \u00a7 62.1-83. These circumstances required licensing of the project pursuant to Code \u00a7 62.1-85, thus vesting authority in the Commission to grant the license in question to VEPCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The protesting intervenors also contend that in granting the license, the Commission should have limited what land VEPCO may take in fee in eminent domain proceedings for use in the project. It is argued that the \u201carea around the plant site and the dam site\u201d is all that should be taken in fee and that only an easement should be acquired \u201cfor the reservoir and the flood area and the maintenance area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">When this point was raised below, the Commission ruled that the question of the extent and nature of the interests to be acquired for the proposed project was not a proper one for its consideration. We agree. The only issue before the Commission was whether VEPCO should be licensed to construct the dam. The Commission\u2019s action in granting the license did not determine how much land and what interest therein VEPCO might acquire. Those are matters properly left for determination by the appropriate court in eminent domain proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The final order of the Commission will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-11\"> In the view we take of the case, we need not consider VEPCO\u2019s alternative contention that the Commission has permissive authority under Code \u00a7 62.1-99 to license dams in \u201cwaters within the State\u201d for other than hydroelectric purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
