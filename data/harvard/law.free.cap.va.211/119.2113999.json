It follows that where a prisoner is being detained under a valid sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tence he is not entitled to credit for time served on a void sentence fully served before the proceeding for writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is instituted____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Code \u00a7 8-596 was amended in 1968 to extend the jurisdiction of our courts in <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings to permit a sentence to be challenged \u201c . . . although the sentence imposed for such conviction ... is to be served <em>subsequently </em>to the sentence currently being served by the petitioner.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">While this amendment extends jurisdiction to permit a petitioner to challenge the validity of a sentence to be served <em>subsequently, </em>it does not extend jurisdiction to the courts of Virginia to permit a determination of the validity of a sentence fully served before the proceeding for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\"><em>Peyton </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>208 Va. 105, 155 S.E.2d 335 (1967), relied upon by the petitioners, is not applicable here as it presented an entirely different factual situation from the cases now before us. In <em>Christian </em>there had been a final judicial determination in another earlier proceeding that a sentence imposed on November 10, 1944, was void. The only question to be decided by the court was the date petitioner commenced to serve a valid sentence imposed on March 25, 1945. We determined this to be from March 25, 1945, the date of the final judgment, as is provided by Code \u00a7 53-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\n<em>Writs denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
