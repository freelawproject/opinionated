Leonard contended he was forced off the road by an unknown motorist. Judgment on a jury verdict was entered for John Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">The only question presented in this appeal is whether the trial court correctly ruled that payment of a forfeiture by Leonard on a traffic charge growing out of the accident could be admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-17\">Counsel for John Doe said in his opening statement to the jury that Leonard had been charged with \u201cimproper equipment\u201d and had \u201cpaid a fine\u201d. Leonard\u2019s counsel objected to these statements and the trial court instructed the jury to disregard them. No motion for a mistrial was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Later, the court, in the absence of the jury, ruled that \u201ca forfeiture is tantamount to a plea of guilty\u201d and that evidence of the forfeiture would, therefore, be admissible. Leonard\u2019s counsel excepted to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">However, on direct examination Leonard testified that he was charged with \u201cimproper equipment\u201d and had a friend \u201cpay it\u201d because he was in the hospital. The defendant offered no evidence concerning the charge against Leonard. Although the court erred in ruling that evidence of a forfeiture could be admitted, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>New Dixie Lines, </em>201 Va. 466, 472, 111 S.E.2d 434, 438 (1959), Leonard cannot be heard to complain since it was he who introduced the objectionable evidence before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
