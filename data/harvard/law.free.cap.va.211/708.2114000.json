From the judgment order entered thereon we granted Langton a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-17\">There was ample evidence to support the verdict and we therefore find no merit in the assignments of error relating to sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-18\">Two questions concern us on this appeal\u2014whether Langton put his character in issue and whether he stated proper grounds for objection to the introduction of evidence by the Commonwealth showing that he had been convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>We are of opinion that the trial court was correct in ruling that the testimony elicited on cross-examination from the Commonwealth\u2019s witness Duval, who was Langton\u2019s supervisor, put Langton\u2019s character in issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Land </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 223, 225, 176 S.E. 2d 586, 588 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Relying upon this ruling, the Commonwealth stated its intention to establish through one of its witnesses that Langton had previously been convicted of a felony. The court permitted the Commonwealth to introduce such evidence over defense counsel\u2019s objection on the ground that Langton had not put his character in issue. Whether or not that evidence was admissible no valid ground for objection was asserted or preserved. We will not now consider other grounds which, though sufficient, were not raised in the trial court. Rule 1:8, Rules of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\"> \u201cQ.
