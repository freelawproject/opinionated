Robbs, the defendant, was convicted by the trial court, sitting without a jury, of possession of heroin, a narcotic drug. (Code \u00a7 54-488, a part of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act.) She was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 and to serve five years in the penitentiary, with two years suspended. She was granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-19\">The question for decision is whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The evidence shows that on June 25, 1968, two detectives of the Richmond Police Department, armed with a search warrant, entered the apartment of the defendant at 535% North Second Street in Richmond. The search warrant authorized a search of the premises for \u201cNarcotics: Heroin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In the defendant\u2019s small apartment was a combination living room-bedroom, containing one bed. Present in the apartment when the police officers entered were the defendant and \u201cthree other females,\u201d one of whom was the defendant\u2019s seventeen-year-old sister, Sandra Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In their search of the premises, the officers found a \u201cplastic syringe\u201d and a \u201cneedle cover\u201d under the mattress of the bed. In the pocket of a housecoat lying on the bed, the officers found a \u201cbottle cap cooker,\u201d consisting of a \u201cwine bottle cap\u201d used for \u201ccooking . . . capsules of heroin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The \u201cthree other females\u201d were questioned by the detectives and released. The defendant was arrested. The officers \u201cadvised her of her rights.\u201d They observed that she had \u201ctracks\u201d or \u201cneedle marks\u201d on her arms, and she admitted to them that \u201cshe was using narcotics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Upon analysis, the syringe and needle cover \u201cgave a negative test\u201d for heroin. The \u201cbottle cap cooker\u201d was found to contain a \u201cresidue\u201d which \u201cresponded positive to the qualitative test for heroin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The defendant first contends that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain her conviction because \u201cthe quantity of heroin found in the bottle cap cooker was merely a trace and therefore does not come within the meaning\u201d of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. The defendant urges us to adopt the rule that there must be a usable amount of narcotic drug possessed to warrant conviction under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">The rule urged upon us by the defendant is the minority rule in this country. In those states that have adopted the Uniform Act, that rule is followed in only Texas and Arizona. <em>Pelham </em>v. <em>State, </em>164 Tex. Crim. 226, 298 S.W.2d 171 (1957); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moreno, 92 </em>Ariz. 116, 374 P.2d 872 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The majority rule is that possession of a modicum of an illegal drug is sufficient to sustain a conviction under the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. The rule was enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>28 Wis.2d 643, 137 N.W.2d 465 (1965), where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">\u201cA modicum means a little or a small quantity and this is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>understood in relationship to the nature of the drug. The amount need not be a usable amount and . . . the quantity of the drug possessed is not material. . . . This view is taken because the statute does not prescribe any minimum amount which must exist. . . .\u201d 28 Wis.2d at 651, 137 N.W.2d at 469.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Here, the evidence showed that there was \u201ca thin layer of heroin\u201d in the bottom of the \u201cbottle cap cooker.\u201d The amount was sufficient for the state chemist, to whom it was delivered by the police, to conduct \u201cthe qualitative test for heroin.\u201d The \u201cresidue\u201d of heroin in the \u201ccooker\u201d was a discernible amount constituting a modicum and not just a microscopic quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We adopt the majority rule and hold that the modicum of heroin in the bottom of the \u201cbottle cap cooker,\u201d if possessed by the defendant, was sufficient to support her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">This brings us to the defendant\u2019s other contention\u2014that there was \u201cno showing that the defendant had any actual or constructive possession or control of the alleged heroin found in the apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AMC\">In this connection, the defendant relies on testimony presented at the trial that her sister, Sandra Johnson, a known and admitted user of drugs, lived in the apartment with her. The defendant then asserts that \u201cthere was no showing\u201d that she owned the housecoat in which was found the \u201cbottle cap cooker.\u201d From this, the defendant says, it follows that the \u201ccooker actually belonged to\u201d her sister and not to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">However, the trial court was not bound to reach that conclusion. The Commonwealth presented direct evidence that the apartment was the residence of the defendant. The only witness to testify for the defense was the defendant\u2019s mother, Doris Cheatham. Mrs. Cheatham, who resided at another location, stated that Sandra Johnson lived in the apartment with the defendant and that \u201cthey,\u201d meaning Sandra and the defendant, rented the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">But the mother was discredited in material parts of her testimony, and her statements were obviously and justifiably rejected by the trial court. So we are left only with proof that the apartment was the residence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">And although there was no direct evidence that the defendant owned the housecoat in question, it was found on her bed and when Sandra Johnson and the two \u201cother females\u201d present were questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>by the detectives, all three denied ownership of the garment. So the inference is warranted that the housecoat belonged to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 732, 173 S.E.2d 799 (1970), we detailed the elements necessary to constitute possession in a case such as this. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">\u201cIn order to convict a defendant of \u2018possession\u2019 of a narcotic drug, within the meaning of Virginia\u2019s Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, it generally is necessary to show that defendant was aware of the presence and character of the particular substance and was intentionally and consciously in possession of it. Physical possession giving the defendant \u2018immediate and exclusive control\u2019 is sufficient. However, the possession need not always be exclusive. The defendant may share it with one or more. The duration of the possession is immaterial and need not always be actual possession. The defendant may be shown to have had constructive possession by establishing that the drugs involved were subject to his dominion or control. . . .\u201d 210 Va. at 741, 173 S.E.2d at 805-806.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Here, the narcotic drug in question was in the pocket of a housecoat belonging to the defendant. The housecoat was on her bed in her apartment. Under her mattress were the instruments for injection of such a drug. She was present when the drug was found, she - bore on her arms the outward evidence of her indulgence, and she admitted that she was a drug user.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">These circumstances were sufficient to establish that the defendant knowingly possessed a narcotic drug in violation of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hansen, </em>283 Minn. 502, 505, 169 N.W.2d 48, 50 <em>(1969); Spataro </em>v. <em>State, </em>179 So.2d 873, 876-877 (Fla. 1965); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>28 Wis.2d 643, 649-650, 137 N.W.2d 465, 468-469 (1965); <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>People, </em>128 Colo. 522, 525-528, 264 P.2d 508, 509-510 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The case of <em>Crisman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>197 Va. 17, 87 S.E.2d 796 (1955), relied upon by the defendant, differs in its factual situation from the case at bar and is not applicable here. In that case, there were five occupants of an automobile which was stopped by the police. On \u201cthe floor in front of the rear seat ... a small quantity of white powder\u201d was discovered. The powder turned out to be heroin. The two occupants of the rear seat were charged with and convicted of possession of the drug. In reversing, we said: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>conclusion that the defendants, or either of them, possessed the drug is speculation rather than proof.\u201d 197 Va. at 20, 87 S.E.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In the case now before us, the conclusion that the defendant possessed the drug is based upon proof and not speculation. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
