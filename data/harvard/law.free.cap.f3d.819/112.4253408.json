Harry, an attorney, appeals the district court\u2019s judgment denying his Fifth Amendment due process claims (\u201ctakings claims\u201d) against the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d). Before the district court, Harry alleged two separate takings of his property by the SSA without due process of law. First, Harry alleged a taking by the SSA through its request that he return overpaid attorney\u2019s fees. Next, Harry all\u00e9ged a taking by the SSA of his livelihood by disqualifying him from representing clients before the SSA. The district court held that Harry was given adequate opportunities to contest the SSA\u2019s alleged takings, both at a hearing before an Administrative \u2022 Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) and an appeal of the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Appeals Council (\u201cAC\u201d). Finding no error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">\u25a0 I.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">Martin A. Harry is licensed in the State of Texas and has represented social security claimants for over 17 years. Harry entered into fee arrangements to represent three clients, \u201cB.F.\u201d, \u201cA.B.\u201d, and \u201cJ.B.\u201d. Each arrangement satisfied the pertinent requirements of the Social Security Act. Harry won favorable decisions for all three clients before the SSA for which he was compensated by the SSA. After the SSA remitted, payment, it discovered that through its own fault or omission each of Harry\u2019s clients had been overpaid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. Based on its overpayment, the SSA also determined that it had overpaid Harry. The SSA issued separate letters to Harry requesting reimbursement of. the overages corresponding to each, of the clients\u2019 cases; and, each letter ended with the \u25a0 same warning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-15\">Failure to comply in a timely manner will require us to refer the matter to the .Office of General Counsel\u2019s Representative Conduct and Civil Rights Division for consideration of a potential fee collecting violation under 20 C.F.R. 404.1740(c), which may warrant proceedings of suspension or disqualification under 20 C.F.R. 404.1745.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-16\">After years of attempting to collect the alleged overpayments to Harry, the SSA followed through on its warnings, and referred the three cases to the SSA\u2019s Office of General Counsel (\u201cOGC\u201d). The OGC, in turn, sent Harry separate letters that corresponded to each of the clients\u2019, cases, the gist of which allowed Harry four options: 1) return the excess payment; 2) provide the SSA with evidence of a prior repayment of the excess payment; 3) provide documentation that the SSA\u2019s records were incorrect; or 4) remain in violation of SSA regulations and face administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>sanctions \u2014 including disqualification from representing clients before the SSA. When Harry did not remit payment, the OGC instituted sanctions proceedings .against Harry.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">At a sanctions hearing, the ALJ determined that the SSA had proved that Harry \u201cwas in violation of the fee retention provisions of the regulations,\u201d and that \u201cdisqualification\u201d was the \u201conly available sanction for each count.\u201d Therefore, \u201cpursuant to. 20 CFR 404.1745(b), 404.1770(a)(3)(iii), 416.1545(b), and 416.1570(a)(3)(iii),\u201d Harry was \u201cDISQUALIFIED from acting as \u00e1 representative of claimants in dealing with the Social Security Administration.\u201d Harry appealed, and the Appeals Council affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision to disqualify him from representing clients before the SSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Harry then appealed the AC\u2019s decision to the district court. Recognizing the exclusive jurisdiction of the SSA to review administrative actions regarding both claimant-representative fees and disciplinary hearings, the district court reviewed only Harry\u2019s constitutional due process claims. The district court held that because Harry had received \u201cadequate due process throughout .[his], disputes regarding fees for representing J.B., B.F., and A.B., [as well as] his sanctions hearing and appeal\u201d, his'due process rights were constitutionally satisfied. Harry appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We review a district court\u2019s \u201cbench trial conclusions of law de novo, and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Williams v. Kaufman Cty., </em>352 F.3d 994, 1001 (5th Cir.2003). Furthermore, because the Social Security Act precludes judicial review of administrative actions regarding: 1) claimant-representative fees, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g) and (h); and, 2) whether an attorney may represent clients before the SSA, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406, we, like the district court, will review only Harry\u2019s due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">As earlier noted, Harry contends that the SSA violated his due process rights by taking his property interest in his attorney's fees and livelihood- without providing him an adequate hearing for either. Each of these claims will be addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">First, Harry asserts that because the SSA did not provide an adequate hearing before requesting the return of the fees, his due process rights were violated <em>at the time </em>the SSA requested that he remit payment. Thus, Harry contends that the opportunity to contest the amount of those fees at a later time before the OGC was defective because: 1) the OGC lacked any authority to recalculate the fees; and 2) the hearing provided by the OGC would -occur after the SSA had reached its final determination of those fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">The record is clear, however, that Harry did not respond to the SSA\u2019s requests that he return the overpayment. The SSA\u2019s request that he return the overpaid attorney\u2019s fees certainly did not rise to a deprivation of that interest or a violation of Harry\u2019s due process rights. The SSA\u2019s only action against Harry, or his alleged property interest in the unreturned attorneys\u2019 fees at the time, was that the SSA might turn Harry\u2019s case over to the OGC for further proceedings. There was certainly no formal order, nor was there any lien created on Harry\u2019s property because he failed to remit his fee. In fact, Harry went years without acknowledging, much less satisfying, the SSA\u2019s requests for repayment. Therefore, the SSA did not violate Harry\u2019s due process rights by failing to provide an adequate hearing at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of the request for the.overpaid .attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Next, Harry asserts that because the SSA disqualified him from representing clients before the SSA, it deprived him of his livelihood without providing him an adequate hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We have recognized that a plaintiff has a property interest in qualifications that are \u201cessential in the pursuit of a livelihood.\u201d <em>Bell v. Burson, </em>402 U.S. 535, 539, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971). We have not, however, recognized a property interest in the specific qualification that Harry alleges in this case \u2014 the right to represent clients before the SSA. Nevertheless, we will assume that Harry has a viable property interest in the right that he alleges.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">No one disputes, however, that the SSA \u201cmay, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, suspend or prohibit from further practice before the [SSA] any such person, agent, or attorney who refuses to comply with the [SSA]\u2019s rules and regulations or who violates any provision of this section for which a penalty is prescribed.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406. Furthermore, when the SSA turns a case over to the OGC, and the OGC seeks to disqualify an attorney from representing clients before \"the SSA, the attorney is entitled to a hearing before an ALJ on the merits of the disqualification. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1765 and 416.1550. The attorney is also afforded an appeal to the AC, which reviews the ALJ\u2019s determinations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1775 and 416.1575. Additionally, and most importantly, the attorney \u201cmay continue to represent claimants until a final decision [by the AC] is issued.\u201d <em>HALLEX 1-1-1-55, </em>2013 WL 1280291, at *1 (March 29, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Moreover, neither party contests that the adequacy of the SSA\u2019s hearings is governed by balancing .the factors outlined in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>which include: \u201c(1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and probable value, if any, of additional procedural safeguards; and (3) the Government\u2019s interest, including the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedures would entail.\u201d <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 321, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Only assuming that Harry had a pro-tectable interest in representing clients before the SSA, this interest would certainly be \u201caffected- by the official action\u201d if he was disqualified to do so by the SSA. The first <em>Mathews </em>factor, thus, favors Harry. Considering the extent of the judicial procedures that the SSA invokes when reviewing whether an attorney should be disqualified, however, the other two <em>Mathews </em>factors cut in the SSA\u2019s favor. Specifically, Harry was afforded a hearing before an ALJ on the -merits of his disqualification; furthermore, the right to appeal before the AC was also provided. Furthermore, the disqualification proceedings occurred <em>before </em>the alleged \u201ctaking\u201d. In short, the due process provided by the SSA was adequate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\">. Although each client\u2019s case provided a unique circumstance for the SSA\u2019s miscalculation and overpayment of benefits, those details'are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\">. For.the first time on appeal, Harry raises an additional due process claim. Harry contends that because \"deprivation of authorization of fees ... rendered the retention of those fees unlawful\u201d, Hariy was exposed to \"civil fines, criminal punishment, [ ] administrative sanctions ... [and] claims by his clients t\u00f3 thos\u00e9 fees he retained because the alleged excess fees had been paid by clients through the SSA from their past-due benefits.\u201d But, we \u201cwill not allow a party to raise an issue for the first time on appeal merely because a party believes that he might prevail if given the opportunity to try a case again on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>a different theory.\u201d <em>Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
