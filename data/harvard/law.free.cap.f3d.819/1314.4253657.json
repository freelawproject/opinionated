He took explicit photographs of her on several occasions, and he asked her to send him explicit photographs of herself. That led to his being charged with, and a jury finding him guilty of, three counts of produc: ing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a), and of one count of committing those crimes while under obligation to register as- a sex offender, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2260A. The district court sentenced him to 420 months in prison. Miller appeals, his conviction and sentence on the three counts of producing child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-19\">Miller contends that the district court erred by refusing to' give one of his proposed jury instructions and by giving an instruction that misstated the law instead. He asked the district court to instruct the jury that the government had to prove that producing' child pornography was \u201cone of [his] dominant motives\u201d for causing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct. And he objected to the court\u2019s instruction, which said that the government had. to prove that making child pornography was \u201ca purpose\u201d for doing so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>Miller , argues on appeal that the district court should have given the pattern jury instruction, which provides that the government must prove that creating a visual depiction was <em>\u201cthe </em>purpose\u201d for the defendant\u2019s actions. <em>See </em>Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) 82 (2010) (emphasis added). According to Miller, the court\u2019s use of the indefinite article reduced the government\u2019s burden of proof and limited his ability to present an effective defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">A district court \u201cenjoys broad discretion to formulate jury instructions provided those instructions are correct statements of the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Lebowitz, </em>676 F.3d 1000, 1014 (11th Cir. 2012). We will reverse the rejection of a party\u2019s proposed instruction \u201conly if (1) the requested instruction was substantively correct, (2) the court\u2019s charge to the jury did not cover the gist of the instruction, a!nd (3) the failure to give the instruction substantially impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). And we defer to the district court \u201con questions of phrasing,\u201d <em>United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted), reversing \u201conly if we are left with a substantial and eradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations,\u201d <em>United States v. Browne, </em>505 F.3d 1229, 1276 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">We have no such doubts here. The district court\u2019s instruction was a correct statement of the law: \u201c[W]e have held that dual purposes are sufficient for a conviction\u201d under \u00a7 2251(a), and that \u201cwe need not concern ourselves with whether the illegal purpose was dominant over other purposes.\u201d <em>Lebowitz, </em>676 F.3d at 1014-15 (quotation marks omitted). And that instruction did not impair Miller\u2019s ability to present an effective defense. Miller says that the instruction prevented him from arguing that the photographs were a \u201cmere incident\u201d of his consensual romantic relationship with the minor, but that is not a viable defense to the charge against him. The government was not required to prove that making explicit photographs was Miller\u2019s sole or primary purpose for enticing the minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct. It was enough to show that it was \u201ca purpose\u201d for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-9\">Miller next contends that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e), which imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years on any defendant convicted of violating \u00a7 2251 who has one prior conviction \u201cunder the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward, or sex trafficking of children.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e). The district court sentenced Miller under that provision because he was convicted of sexual battery in Florida.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that a prior conviction triggers a statutory sentencing enhancement. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334, 1341 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-10\">Miller argues that his prior conviction for sexual battery does not qualify under \u00a7 2251(e) because it did not require proof that his victim was a minor. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011(5) (1999) (making it a second degree felony to \u201ccommit[ ] sexual battery upon a person 12 years of age or older, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>without that person\u2019s consent\u201d and without \u201cus[ing] physical force and violence likely to cause serious personal injury\u201d). According to Miller, only crimes involving minors can trigger an enhanced sentence because the phrase \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d in \u00a7 2251(e) modifies each of the crimes listed before it (i.e., \u201caggravated sexual abuse,\u201d \u201csexual abuse,\u201d and \u201cabusive sexual contact\u201d), instead of only the one crime immediately preceding it (\u201cabusive sexual contact\u201d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">In <em>Lockhart v. United States, </em>577 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 958, 194 L.Ed.2d 48 (2016), the Supreme Court considered closely analogous question in the context of materially indistinguishable statutory language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2), which provides that a defendant convicted of possessing child pornography under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4) is subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence if he has a prior conviction \u201cunder the law of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d <em>Lockhart, </em>136 S.Ct. at 961 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2)). The only difference in the releyant statutory texts is that \u00a7 2252(b)(2) refers to \u201cabusive sexual conduct\u201d and \u00a7 2251(e) refers to \u201cabusive sexual contact.\u201d That distinction obviously is not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-8\">The <em>Lockhart </em>Court held that the phrase \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d modified only the crime immediately preceding it in the statute and did not modify the other listed crimes. <em>Id. </em>There is no reasonable justification for treating the same phrase differently where it appears in \u00a7 2251(e). We therefore conclude that the 25-year statutory mandatory minimum in \u00a7 2251 applies to any defendant with a prior conviction relating to \u201cabusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward,\u201d as well as to any defendant with a prior conviction relating to \u201caggravated sexual abuse\u201d or \u201csexual abuse,\u201d whether or not that conviction involved a minor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-12\">Miller finally contends that, even under that interpretation of \u00a7 2251(e), his sexual battery conviction does not trigger the sentencing enhancement because it is not equivalent to a conviction for a crime that would constitute sexual abuse under federal law. That argument ignores the plain text of the statute, which provides that the enhancement applies to any defendant who has a prior state conviction <em>relating to </em>sexual abuse. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e). \u201cWe have interpreted the phrase \u2018relating to\u2019 broadly in the context of child exploitation offenses\u201d like \u00a7 2251. <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>767 F.3d 1264, 1284 (11th Cir.2014); <em>see also United States v. McGarity, </em>669 F.3d 1218, 1262 (11th Cir.2012) (explaining that an identical provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A \u201cdoes not simply mandate a sentencing enhancement for individuals convicted of state offenses <em>equivalent </em>to sexual abuse,\u201d but \u201cfor any state offense that stands in some relation, bears upon, or is associated with\u201d sexual abuse) (citing <em>United States v. Sinerius, </em>504 F.3d 737, 743 (9th Cir.2007)). Miller\u2019s conviction for sexual battery clearly relates to \u201csexual abuse\u201d as that term is generally understood. <em>See Sinerius, </em>504 F.3d at 740-43. The district court did not err in enhancing Miller\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2251(e) based on that prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">. Miller\u2019s presentence investigation report says that he was convicted of sexual battery in 1999. The parties stipulated at trial, however, that he was convicted of that offense in 2002. Whether Miller was convicted in 1999 or in 2002 has no bearing on his conviction qualifying for a sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2251(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1341-9\">. We reject Miller's rule of lenity argument for the same reasons the Supreme Court re-iected Lockhart\u2019s. <em>See Lockhart, </em>136 S.Ct. at 968.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
