HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">Joel Hernandez-De La Cruz, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of the denial of his applications for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and protection under the Convention Against Torture. These applications were based on Petitioner\u2019s claims that he was kidnapped and assaulted by members of the Zetas, a Mexican criminal syndicate, who released him only after he agreed to pay $15,000 \u2014 and that after he reported that ineid\u00e9nt. to the police in defiance of the Zetas\u2019 instructions, corrupt police officers threatened and beat him. As explained below, we lack jurisdiction over many of Petitioner\u2019s challenges and find the remainder meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-18\">In considering a petition for review, we look only'to the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), unless the decision of the Immigration Judge (IJ) \u201chas some impact on the BIA\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>its legal conclusions de novo. <em>Sharma v. Holder, </em>729 F.3d 407, 411 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Petitioner argues that the BIA erred in denying him withholding of removal by rejecting his claim that, because of his reporting of the criminal activity of which he was a victim, he would be threatened with persecution in Mexico based on his \u201cmembership in a particular social group[ ] or political opinion.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). We first clarify the scope of our jurisdiction. We have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, including the reinstatement of a removal order. <em>Garcia v. Holder, </em>756 F.3d 885, 890 (5th Cir.2014). But \u201c[jjudicial review of a final removal order is available only if the applicant has exhausted all administrative remedies as of right\u201d by presenting each issue to the BIA. <em>Dale v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 294, 298 (5th Cir.2010) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Carranza-De Salinas v. Gonzales, </em>477 F.3d 200, 206 (5th Cir.2007)). Regarding his purported \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d activity, Petitioner argued to the IJ and BIA only that he was persecuted on account of his political opinion. Accordingly, to the extent he now argues that whistle-blowers constitute a particular social group, we lack jurisdiction to review such a claim. <em>See id. </em>at 298-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Further, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) limits our jurisdiction to review final removal orders against aliens who are removable by reason of having committed certain criminal offenses, including those \u201cinvolving moral turpitude\u201d under' \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). Petitioner does not dispute that he falls into this category. We thus lack jurisdiction over the reinstatement of his removal order, except to the extent he raises legal or constitutional questions. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Accordingly, we have no authority to consider Petitioner\u2019s arguments that the, IJ and the BIA erroneously found that he was mistreated by people driven by economic motives \u2014 not Petitioner\u2019s political opinion as expressed through whistleblow-ing activity. <em>See Medina v. Holder, </em>544 Fed.Appx. 301, 302 (5th Cir.2013) (per cu-riam) (holding that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) barred jurisdiction over claims that the BIA incorrectly concluded a petitioner was ineligible for withholding of removal); <em>Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 791 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (holding that whether an alien was persecuted on account of her political opinion was a question of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">In contrast, Petitioner\u2019s challenge to' the determination that \u201cformer informants\u201d do not constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d is a legal question that we have jurisdiction to review. <em>See Hongyok v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir.2007). To establish that he was persecuted based on his membership in a particular group, Petitioner must show he is a member \u201cof a group of persons that share a common immutable characteristic that they either cannot change or should not be required to change because it is \u2018fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u2019\u201d <em>Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 518 (5th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 414-15 (5th Cir.2006)). We have agreed with the BIA\u2019s framework for determining whether a particular social group exists:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq-\">(1) \u201cwhether the group\u2019s shared characteristic -gives the members -the requisite <em>social visibility </em>to make them readily identifiabl\u00e9 in society\u201d and (2) \u201cwhether the group can be defined with sufficient <em>particularity </em>to delimit its membership.\u201d Social visibility is determined by \u201cthe extent to which members of a society perceive those with the characteristic in question as members of a social group.\u201d Particularity is determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>\u201cwhether the proposed group can accurately be described in a manner sufficiently distinct that the group would be recognized, in the society in question, as a discrete class of persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 519-20 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In unpublished cases \u2014 which are persuasive authority, <em>id. </em>at 519 \u2014 we have rejected similar proposed social groups. <em>See Soriano-Dominguez v. Holder, </em>354 Fed.Appx. 886, 888 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cSoriano-Dominguez has not established that \u2018noncriminal witnesses who have reported crimes\u2019 are readily identifiable or have immutable characteristics that they should not be asked to change.\u201d); <em>Calel-Chitic v. Holder, </em>333 Fed.Appx. 845, 847-48 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cPetitioner has shown only that a gang of local criminals has threatened him because they do not want to be caught and convicted. Petitioner has not shown that he is identifiable as a member of a determinable group of government witnesses who suffer persecution in Guatemala. ...\u201d), We have likewise held that an alien\u2019s refusal to pay bribes to local gangs did not make her a member of a protected social group. <em>See Sorto-De Portillo v. Holder, </em>358 Fed.Appx. 606, 608 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (\u201cNumerous other cases ... have held that one\u2019s personal anti-gang values or antagonistic relationship with gangs does not amount to a common immutable characteristic establishing a particular social group.\u201d). Similar logic leads us to reject Petitioner\u2019s proposed particular social group here.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Although a local journalist reported that Petitioner had been beaten, it does not follow that his proposed group of former informants has \u201csocial distinction\u201d or would be perceived as a particular group, because \u2014 according to factual findings that we lack jurisdiction to reconsider \u2014 the members of Petitioner\u2019s proposed group are not substantially different from anyone else in the general population who resists ttie Zetas or othenvise threatens their interests. Given this 'finding regarding the broad group of people who may be subjected to similar treatment from the Zetas, Petitioner\u2019s proposed particular social group is not sufficiently particular. Thus, there is no indication that an incorrect legal standard was applied or that it was legally erroneous to conclude that former informants do not constitute a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">Finally, Petitioner challenges the rejection of his claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture. We lack jurisdiction to consider Petitioner\u2019s arguments that, contrary to the factual findings below, he faces a probability of torture upon return to Mexico based on his reporting of his mistreatment and not economic reasons. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Escudero-Arciniega v. Holder, </em>702 F.3d 781, 785 (5th Cir.2012). Likewise, we lack jurisdiction over his factual arguments\u2019 regarding the reach and power of the Zetas in Mexico and his ability to safely relocate. We do have jurisdiction to the extent Petitioner argues that the IJ and BIA applied the wrong legal standard in determining that he could not relocate to a part of Mexico where he is unlikely to be tortured, but that argument fails on its merits. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) &amp; (c)(3)(h) (placing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>the burden of proof on the applicant and directing consideration of \u201c[e]vidence that the applicant could relocate to a part of the country of removal where he or she is not likely to be tortured\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In accordance with the foregoing, the petition for review is DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\">. While adhering to its prior interpretations of \"particular social group,\u201d the BIA recently renamed the first element of this test \"social distinction\u201d to \"emphasize that literal or \u2018ocular\u2019 visibility is not required.\u201d <em>Matter of M-E-V-G-, </em>26 I &amp; N. Dec. 227, 228 (BIA 2014); see <em>Villalobos-Ramirez v. Lynch, </em>608 Fed.Appx. 261, 262 (5th Cir.2015) (per curiam) (explaining that <em>Matter of M-E-V-G- </em>clarified but did not \u201cdepart[] from the principles established in its prior cases\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
