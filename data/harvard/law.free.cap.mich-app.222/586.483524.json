We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">Defendants were employees of the Loving Touch massage parlor in the City of Femdale. The parlor was suspected by the police to be a front for prostitution. In October 1991, an undercover officer patronized the parlor as part of an investigation. The officer was quoted a price for a massage with two women of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>his choice. The officer paid the quoted price and selected defendants. Defendants took the officer into another room, which they entered through a door or curtain. Once defendants and the officer entered the room, the door or curtain was closed. In the room, defendants indicated to the officer that they would perform oral sex on each other for an additional fee. The officer gave defendants more money and witnessed defendant Stewart perform cunnilingus on defendant Brown for approximately five seconds. Defendants then left the room, and the officer left the parlor. Twenty to thirty minutes later, the officer returned to the parlor with uniformed officers. Defendants were arrested and charged with gross indecency between female persons, MCL 750.338a; MSA 28.570(1), and soliciting and accosting, MCL 750.448; MSA 28.703.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Defendants moved in the trial court to quash the information with regard to the gross indecency charges, arguing that the act occurred in a private place and could therefore not be grossly indecent. The trial court agreed, relying on <em>People v Lino, </em>190 Mich App 715; 476 NW2d 654 (1991), and dismissed the charges. The prosecutor sought leave to appeal in this Court, but leave was denied. The prosecutor then appealed to the Supreme Court, which remanded the case to this Court for consideration as on leave granted. 440 Mich 914 (1992). In a March 11, 1993, memorandum opinion, this Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal, holding that because the standard set forth in <em>Lino, supra, </em>had been rejected by a conflict resolution panel of this Court in <em>People v Brashier, </em>197 Mich App 672; 496 NW2d 385 (1992), the trial court applied the incorrect standard. Unpub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>lished memorandum opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued March 11, 1993 (Docket No. 156323). Defendants then sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. While defendants\u2019 application was pending, the Supreme Court decided <em>People v Lino, </em>447 Mich 567; 527 NW2d 434 (1994), discussed earlier, which consolidated this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Lino </em>and <em>Brashier.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Following that decision, the Supreme Court vacated this Court\u2019s judgment in defendants\u2019 case and remanded the matter to the trial court for proceedings consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lino. </em>448 Mich 930 (1995). On remand, the trial court once again dismissed the gross indecency charges against defendants. Subsequently, this Court granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to hear the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The issue we must address is whether defendants\u2019 conduct violated MCL 750.338a; MSA 28.570(1), which prohibits acts of gross indecency between female persons. The trial court\u2019s quashing of the gross indecency charge on the legal ground asserted in this case is subject to review for error. See <em>People v Thomas, </em>438 Mich 448, 452; 475 NW2d 288 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">MCL 750.338a; MSA 28.570(1) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">Any female person who, in public or in private, commits or is a party to the commission of, or any person who procures or attempts to procure the commission by any female <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>person of any act of gross indecency with another female person shall be guilty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">There is no statutory definition of \u201can act of gross indecency.\u201d However, in Lino, 447 Mich 571, a majority of the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]rai sexual conduct committed in a public place is grossly indecent under MCL 750.338; MSA 28.570.\u201d MCL 750.338; MSA 28.570 prohibits acts of gross indecency between male persons and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">Any male person who, in public or in private, commits or is party to the commission of or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of any act of gross indecency with another male person shall be guilty of a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Because the statutes are nearly identical, except for the fact that the statute at issue in <em>Lino </em>applies to acts of gross indecency between males, we are comfortable in applying the <em>Lino </em>holding to the case at bar and concluding that oral sexual conduct between females committed in a public place is also grossly indecent under MCL 750.338a; MSA 28.570(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Defendants\u2019 argument is not that they did not perform an act of oral sexual conduct, but that because the act did not occur in a public place, they cannot be guilty of gross indecency under the statute. Therefore, the precise issue we must address is whether defendants\u2019 act of oral sexual conduct was committed in a public place for purposes of the gross indecency statute. Neither the statute nor a majority of the Supreme Court in <em>Lino </em>specifically defines \u201cpublic place.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>However, on the basis of the facts and holdings of <em>Lino, </em>and the implications they create, we can derive a definition consistent with the precedent set by <em>Lino.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">We do not read <em>Lino </em>to hold that oral sexual conduct in and of itself is grossly indecent under the statute, but that an act of oral sexual conduct performed <em>in a public place </em>violates the statute. See <em>People v Jones, </em>222 Mich App 595; 563 NW2d 719 (1997), issued this same day. We consider the distinction between oral sexual conduct committed in a public place and oral sexual conduct committed in private to be of significance in applying the statute. Also, we have determined, on the basis of the facts of <em>Lino, </em>that the key issue in determining whether an act of oral sexual conduct was performed in a \u201cpublic place\u201d is not so much the exact location of the act, but whether there is the possibility that the unsuspecting public could be exposed to or view the act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The logical implication from this is that, according to <em>Lino, </em>the gross indecency statute seeks to protect the public from the possibility of being exposed to or viewing such acts of oral sexual conduct. As a result, oral sexual conduct performed in a manner that may violate this protection is grossly indecent. Therefore, an act of oral sexual conduct is grossly indecent, i.e., committed in a public place, when an unsuspecting member of the public, who is in a place the public is generally invited or allowed to be, could have been exposed to or viewed the act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Generally, the simple fact that an act of oral sexual conduct was performed in a place where the public is generally invited or allowed to be is strong evidence of gross indecency because, generally speaking, in such places there is at least the possibility that an unsuspecting member of the public could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>exposed to or viewed the act. However, the circumstances of each particular case control. In the case at bar, the fact that defendants\u2019 act of oral sexual conduct was performed in a commercial establishment that, by way of general invitation, sought patronage from the public is strong evidence in favor of a finding of gross indecency. However, a conclusive finding is dependent on the specific. facts of this case, i.e., whether defendants\u2019 act was performed in a location where an unsuspecting member of the public who accepted the parlor\u2019s general invitation to do business could have been exposed to or viewed the conduct. At this point in the proceedings, the factual record consists of only the transcript of the preliminary examination, and that transcript contains only brief descriptions of the massage parlor and the room where the act took place. On the basis of this undeveloped record, we are of the opinion that a conclusive finding is premature. The issue must be decided on a more complete record.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b607-6\">McDonald P.J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-10\"> For a more detailed history of the gross indecency statute and the judicial standards applied to the crime, see <em>People v </em>Jones, 222 Mich App 595; 563 NW2d 719 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\"> In his separate opinion in <em>Lino, </em>Justice Levin opined that in order to establish the \u201cpublic place\u201d element of gross indecency, the \u201cprosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>must prove that when the sexual act was committed, the objective circumstances indicated that the conduct could have been seen, and was likely to have been seen, by members of the public.\u201d 447 Mich 600. On the basis of this definition, Justice Levin opined that Lino\u2019s conviction should be reversed because \u201c[n]o member of the public inadvertently witnessed the sexual act. Nor does it appear that it was likely that a member of the public would have inadvertently witnessed the act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, n 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In our opinion, any definition of \u201cpublic place\u201d must be consistent with the holding of a majority of the Supreme Court that Lino\u2019s conduct occurred in a public place and his conviction should be affirmed. We do not think it would be proper to adopt a definition that, according to its originator, would have led to a result different than the one we are constrained to follow. Therefore, contrary to the position taken in the concurring opinion, we consider Justice Levin\u2019s definition to be unworkable, if not implicitly rejected by a majority of the Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\"> The defendant in <em>Lino </em>was a male prostitute who performed an act of fellatio on the driver of a pickup truck while the pickup truck was parked in the overflow parking lot of a restaurant, at 12:30 a.m. The restaurant was open for business, but there were no other vehicles in the parking lot. The lot was enclosed by a six- to eight-foot fence on the north and east <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>sides. The south side of the lot was open to the street, and there was an opening on the north side of the fence that allowed pedestrian traffic. One officer testified that, although he could see the driver of the truck in the parking lot, it was not until the officer climbed up three feet on the fence that he witnessed Lino performing oral sex on the driver of the truck. Another officer testified that he did not see Lino performing oral sex on the driver until he approached the truck. Because the exact location of Lino\u2019s act of oral sexual conduct was in a private vehicle, other circumstances surrounding the location of the act must have been determinative. We consider the fact that, because of where the truck was parked, there was the possibility that Lino\u2019s act could have been viewed by unsuspecting members of the public to have been the determinative factor in the majority\u2019s holding that Lino\u2019s act of oral sexual conduct occurred in a public place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b606-10\"> Because this holding is derived specifically from the facts and holdings of <em>Lino, </em>and the implications they create, we limit its application to acts of oral sexual conduct. We also limit this holding to acts committed between adults. One implication from <em>Lino, </em>447 Mich 572, is that the involvement of minors in the commission of the acts is of significance in applying the statutes and, if there is involvement of minors, that may lead to a result different than one reached if only adults had been involved. Therefore, we are not addressing how to analyze a factual situation involving minors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b607-7\">J. D. Payant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay_\"><em>(concurring). </em>I concur. I write separately only because I disagree with the reasoning of the majority in defining a \u201cpublic place\u201d as being a place where there is a possibility that the unsuspecting public could be exposed to or view the act. I believe that definition is too broad. If a jury was instructed using that definition of a \u201cpublic place,\u201d there would be very few areas that the jury could not find to be a public place. The only \u201cnonpublic places\u201d would be those places that are completely locked and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>have no windows. Certainly a room on the 25th floor of a building, with a window, would be a \u201cpublic place\u201d because there would be a \u201cpossibility\u201d that a member of the unsuspecting public could be exposed to or view the act from another building, by use of telescope, or from an aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">I espouse the view of Justice Levin in <em>People v Lino, </em>447 Mich 571, 599-601; 527 NW2d 434 (1994), in which he urged the Michigan Supreme Court to follow the lead of the highest courts of New York, Massachusetts, and California and hold that to establish the \u201cpublic place\u201d element of gross indecency, the proofs must show that when the sexual act was committed the objective circumstances indicated that the conduct could have been seen, and was likely to have been seen, by members of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Following this more objective \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d test, a factfinder would have much greater latitude in deciding what constitutes a \u201cpublic place\u201d than is given by the single option of determining whether there was any possibility whatsoever that the conduct could have been observed by members of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">I agree with the majority opinion in all other respects, including the order of remand to obtain a more complete record concerning whether the massage parlor was a private place or a public place as a matter of law, or if a jury question has been presented with respect to that issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
