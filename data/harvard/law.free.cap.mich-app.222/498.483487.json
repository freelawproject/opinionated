The trial court sentenced defendant to terms of twelve to thirty years\u2019 and two years\u2019 imprisonment for the respective convictions. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Initially, this Court affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions in a divided panel. <em>People v Young, </em>212 Mich App 630; 538 NW2d 456 (1995). However, the Michigan Supreme Court, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, remanded to this Court \u201cfor reconsideration in light of <em>People v Bender, </em>452 Mich 594 [551 NW2d 71] (1996), and for a determination whether that decision should be applied retroactively to this case.\u201d 453 Mich 973 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The facts of this case are set out in full in our initial opinion. 212 Mich App 631-635. Briefly, defendant was arrested on the evening of September 9, 1991, and placed in a holding cell for the night. On the morning of September 10, Sergeant Lee Caudill questioned defendant for approximately one hour. Defendant denied all involvement in the killing of the decedent. Later, defendant was taken to the police crime laboratory for the administration of a polygraph examination. During the examination, Sergeant Caudill received a telephone call indicating that defendant\u2019s family had retained an attorney who was at the police station requesting an opportunity to meet his client. Sergeant Caudill did not notify defendant of this fact. Following the polygraph examination, Sergeant Caudill questioned defendant and elicited several admissions damaging to defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting these statements because the police failed to inform defendant that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>family had retained counsel and that counsel had attempted to contact him. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">This case is on all fours with <em>Bender, supra. </em>In <em>Bender, </em>a parent of each of the two defendants retained an attorney to represent their respective sons after their sons were arrested. <em>Id. </em>at 598, 600. As instructed by the attorney retained to represent defendant Ziegler, Ziegler\u2019s mother went to the police station, asked to see her son, and stated that she had a message for Ziegler from his attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 598. In the case of defendant Bender, it was the attorney herself who contacted the police station and asked to speak with Bender. <em>Id. </em>at 600. In both situations, the police refused to inform the defendants that an attorney was trying to contact them. <em>Id. </em>at 599-600. Meanwhile, both defendants were interrogated after signing <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>-warmngs </em>forms. 452 Mich 600-601. The trial court refused to admit the statements made during these interrogations. <em>Id. </em>at 601-602. This Court affirmed. 208 Mich App 221; 527 NW2d 66 (1994). On appeal to the Supreme Court, a majority of the Supreme Court established a prophylactic rule that stated that law enforcement investigators may not conceal from suspects the fact that counsel has been made available to them and is at their disposal. 452 Mich 620-621.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">This case is indistinguishable from <em>Bender. </em>In all the cases (this case and both situations presented in Bender), counsel was retained for each of the defendants by the defendant\u2019s family. In all the cases, either counsel contacted the police station or the family contacted the police on the instructions of counsel. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>all the cases, following the refusal of the police to inform the defendants of the attempted contact, the police initiated an interrogation that resulted in incriminating statements. Accordingly, if <em>Bender </em>is applicable to this case, then it requires that we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction. 452 Mich 620, 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In this Court\u2019s initial opinion in this case, the majority opinion stated that the facts of <em>Bender </em>were distinguishable from this case because here defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights before any attempted contact by an attorney retained on his behalf. 212 Mich App 641. This is a distinction without a difference. In <em>Bender, supra, </em>452 Mich 622, Chief Justice Brickley\u2019s majority opinion reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">[W]e invite much mischief if we afford police officers \u201cengaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime\u201d the discretion to decide when a suspect can and cannot see an attorney who has been retained for a suspect\u2019s benefit. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In this case, it was Sergeant Caudill who received a telephone call indicating defendant\u2019s family had retained an attorney who was at the police station requesting an opportunity to meet defendant. 212 Mich App 633. It was Sergeant Caudill who did not notify defendant of this fact while the polygraph examination was being conducted. <em>Id. </em>at 633-634. Following the conclusion of the polygraph examination, it was Sergeant Caudill who initiated a new interrogation of defendant and elicited the admissions now in question. <em>Id. </em>at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">This case does not require us to decide whether a police officer must, upon being contacted by counsel retained for a defendant, actively seek out the loca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>tion of a defendant\u2019s detention or interrupt an ongoing interrogation. Rather, this case simply asks whether the same police officer who has been told that retained counsel is at the police station attempting to meet a defendant may subsequently initiate an interrogation of that defendant without informing him that he has counsel. <em>Bender </em>answers this question in the negative. 452 Mich 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">There remains the question whether <em>Bender </em>should be applied retroactively. Generally, judicial decisions are to be given complete retroactive effect. <em>People v Doyle, </em>451 Mich 93, 104; 545 NW2d 627 (1996). Complete prospective application generally has been limited to decisions that overrule clear and uncontradicted case law. <em>Id. </em>If a judicial decision is \u201cunexpected\u201d and \u201cindefensible\u201d in light of the law existing at the time of the conduct, retroactive application of such a decision is problematic. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Here, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bender </em>was not unexpected. The Supreme Court addressed this same issue in <em>People v Wright, </em>441 Mich 140; 490 NW2d 351 (1992). In that case, Justices Mallett and Levin and Chief Justice Cavanagh supported the prophylactic rule announced in <em>Bender. </em>Although he chose to write separately, Justice Brickley saw the police concealment as a critical factor in determining the. voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements. Accordingly, Justice Brickley cast the deciding fourth vote to reverse that defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>In light of <em>Wright, </em>it can hardly be said that <em>Bender </em>overruled clear and uncontradicted case law. Neither can it be said that <em>Bender </em>was \u201cunexpected\u201d or \u201cindefensible\u201d in light of <em>Wright. </em>Therefore, <em>Bender </em>is to be given complete retroactive effect. <em>Doyle, supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>at 104; see also <em>Chow v O\u2019Keefe, </em>217 Mich App 102, 104-105; 550 NW2d 833 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The final question is whether the trial court\u2019s error can be considered harmless. The trial court\u2019s error implicates both the right against self-incrimination and the right to counsel. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 20; <em>Bender, </em>452 Mich 620. A constitutional error that occurs during the presentation of the case to the jury is assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>People v Anderson (After Remand), </em>446 Mich 392, 405-406; 521 NW2d 538 (1994). This requires the beneficiary of the error to prove, and the court to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt that there, is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 406. Here, in light of the sketchy visual identifications of the perpetrator, and the fact that witnesses to the crime initially thought someone other than defendant had committed the crime, the admission of this evidence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>id. </em>at 407. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s convictions must be reversed and the matter must be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b518-7\">Mackenzie, J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-6\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b518-8\">O\u2019Connell, RJ.</author>\n<p id=\"APi\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I agree with the majority that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>People v Bender, </em>452 Mich 594; 551 NW2d 71 (1996), would require suppression of the present defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements were <em>Bender </em>to be applied retrospectively. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>pursuant to <em>Johnson v New Jersey, </em>384 US 719, 729-734; 86 S Ct 1772; 16 L Ed 2d 882 (1966), I do not believe that <em>Bender </em>should be afforded retrospective application. Accordingly, I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Initially, I would note that <em>Bender </em>is a very unusual decision. The issues in <em>Bender </em>were framed in terms of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20) and right against compelled self-inciimination (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17). However, the issues were resolved on a strictly extraconstitutional basis. The majority opinion in Bender<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> concedes as much, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">This case rather clearly implicates both the right to counsel (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20) and the right against self-incrimination (Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17). I conclude that <em>rather than interpreting these provisions, it would be more appropriate to approach the law enforcement practices that are at the core of this case </em>.... <em>[Bender, supra </em>p 620 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The opinion then proceeds to speak without great specificity of \u201cconstitutional civil liberties,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 621, \u201cclosely guarded legal traditions,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 623, and our \u201caccusatorial\u201d as opposed to \u201cinquisitional\u201d system of criminal justice. <em>Id. </em>The dissent characterized this approach as being \u201cgrounded solely on policy concerns, not constitutional mandates.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The \u201cpolicy concern\u201d lying at the heart of the <em>Bender </em>decision may be found in the following sentence of the majority opinion: \u201c[W]e invite much mischief if we afford police officers \u2018engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime\u2019 the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>cretion to decide when a suspect can and cannot see an attorney who has been retained for a suspect\u2019s benefit.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 622 (citation omitted). This may be true, but, to paraphrase the dissent in <em>Bender, </em>one\u2019s personal desire to avoid \u201cmuch mischief,\u201d no matter how sincere and heartfelt, does not translate that belief into a constitutional right. However, regardless of any shortcomings in the <em>Bender </em>decision, it is now the law in Michigan. <em>Boyd v W G Wade Shows, </em>443 Mich 515, 523; 505 NW2d 544 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">However, it is only <em>now </em>the law in Michigan. As discussed by the majority in the present case, our Supreme Court, in <em>Bender, </em>adopted a new prophylactic rule of law arguably foreshadowed by the Court\u2019s previous, fractured decision in <em>People v Wright, </em>441 Mich 140; 490 NW2d 351 (1992). This histoiy is remarkably similar to that of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a decision that reified a new principle of law first adumbrated several years before <em>Miranda </em>in <em>Escobedo v Illinois, </em>378 US 478; 84 S Ct 1758; 12 L Ed 2d 977 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The United States Supreme Court declined to afford <em>Miranda </em>retrospective application despite its prior decision in <em>Escobedo. Johnson, supra, </em>pp 729-734. The Court limited its application of the <em>Miranda </em>decision, though a clear majority of the Court previously had embraced the reasoning of <em>Escobedo. </em>In contrast, there was no majority decision in <em>Wright. </em>Thus, where the United States Supreme Court refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>to enforce <em>Miranda </em>retrospectively even where that decision had been foreshadowed by a clear majority of the Court in <em>Escobedo, </em>surely retrospective application of <em>Bender </em>is unwarranted where our Supreme Court could not muster a majority decision in <em>Wright, </em>the decision alleged by the majority in the present case to mandate retrospective application of <em>Bender.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Therefore, I would decline to enforce <em>Bender </em>retrospectively and would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\"> The majority opinion in <em>Bender </em>is the concurring opinion written by Chief Justice Brickley, not the lead opinion written by Justice Cavanagh.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\"> In fact, the <em>Bender </em>decision itself calls attention to its parallels with <em>Miranda. Bender, supra, </em>p 621.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
