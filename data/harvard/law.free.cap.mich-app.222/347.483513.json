Ansell, Jr., appeals as on leave granted the circuit court\u2019s order affirming an order of respondent, Department of Commerce, Board of Examiners of Mortuary Science, revoking his license to practice mortuary science. We affirm and hold that the board correctly construed MCL 339.1808(3); MSA 18.425(1808)(3) to require prospective morticians to embalm or participate in embalming twenty-five dead human bodies during the prescribed resident training period.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">After obtaining the requisite accreditation, completing a resident training program under the tutelage of his father, Harold Ansell, Sr., and passing required national and state examinations, petitioner obtained a license to practice mortuary science in March 1988.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In qualifying for licensure, petitioner was obliged to complete the resident training prescribed in \u00a7 1808 of the Occupational Code, MCL 339.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 18.425(101) <em>et seq. </em>Section 1808(3), MCL 339.1808(3); MSA 18.425(1808)(3), requires prospective licensees to either embalm-or assist a licensed mortician \u201cin supervising the preparation of 25 dead human bodies for burial or transportation during the period of resident training.\u201d In proving compliance with \u00a7 1808, petitioner submitted twenty-five \u201cembalming report\u201d forms to the former Department of Licensing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Regulation (mdlr).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In completing each report, petitioner identified the subject corpse, detailed the body\u2019s preembalming condition, described the embalming procedure, and listed various other administrative details to which he attended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By signing each report, petitioner attested to having \u201cpersonally embalmed or assisted in the preparation of this case.\u201d Additionally, either his father or trade embalmer James Lucius signed the embalming reports in the space provided for the \u201c[e]mbalmers signature, if other than the sponsor.\u201d Each form states: \u201cNo credit will be given for any case where embalming was not performed, i.e., ship-ins<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, immediate cremations or burials, or body donations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In March 1988, the mdlr received a complaint that the Truesdale Funeral Home was conducting funerals without the supervision of a licensed mortician.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A subsequent investigation disclosed that petitioner had neither embalmed nor participated in embalming several of the cases for which he claimed credit as a resident trainee. This investigation also revealed discrep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>andes in the petitioner\u2019s embalming reports, induding several instances where the person attesting to embalming the case was. not the actual embalmer. Thereafter, on August 2, 1989, the MDLR prepared a formal complaint charging petitioner with several violations of the Occupational Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\">At a settlement/compliance conference held on September 20, 1989, the parties tentatively agreed to settle the case. However, petitioner\u2019s attorney requested some amendments of the written settlement agreement, and the MDLR redrafted and remailed the proposed agreement in October 1989. Because petitioner\u2019s attorney requested three weeks to review the revised proposal, the board could not review the proposed settlement at its November 28, 1989, meeting. Accordingly, the board did not consider the proposed agreement until its next meeting. At its meeting held on February 8, 1990, the board rejected the proposed settlement. Thereafter, on December 17, 1991, the MDLR scheduled a formal hearing for January 8, 1992. Upon petitioner\u2019s request, the hearing was adjourned until February 11, 1992. On that date, the Administrative Law Examiner (ale) rejected petitioner\u2019s multiground motion to dismiss and scheduled a contested case hearing for May 1, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Testifying during the state\u2019s case in chief, petitioner admitted that his father had not embalmed any of the bodies identified on petitioner\u2019s embalming reports. Additionally, Mr. Lucius testified that he was mistaken in signing six of petitioner\u2019s embalming reports because he never embalmed the identified bodies. Petitioner explained, however, that he was unaware that embalming reports required an embalmer\u2019s signature because an MDLR staffer told him that his spon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>sor\u2019s name could be used in place of the embalmer. Moreover, petitioner agreed , that he did not participate in embalming at least seventeen of the twenty-five bodies identified in the submitted embalming reports.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, petitioner testified that he thought he had \u201cpersonally . ., assisted in the preparation of [each] caseQ\u201d by performing administrative and funeral-related tasks. such as procuring clergy, arranging flowers, ushering mourners, preparing obituaries, cosmetically modifying embalmed corpses, selling funeral merchandise, and positioning bodies in caskets.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The state countered petitioner\u2019s interpretation with testimony from several licensed morticians, who each explained that \u201cpreparation for burial\u201d is a term of art that mortuary scientists \u00fase synonymously with the phrase \u201cact of embalming.\u201d Each testifying licensee concluded that body preparation means services performed on dead bodies, not tasks connected with funerals. Additionally, two MDLR/commerce department staffers testified that the board has historically construed the resident training requirement in \u00a7 1808(3) to mandate twenty-five embalmings and that applications for mortuary science licenses would be rejected if they knew the applicant had not participated in any embalmings. ..</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In a comprehensive, writteh opinion, the ale construed \u00a7 1808 to-require resident trainees to person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ally embalm or assist in embalming twenty-five dead human bodies. The ale thus concluded that petitioner misled the mdlr by submitting embalming reports on bodies he did not help to embalm.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, the ale found that petitioner violated MCL 339.604(a) and (d); MSA 18.425(604)(a) and (d) by obtaining his mortician\u2019s license through fraud or deceit and by demonstrating a lack of good moral character.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the basis of these findings, the board voted to revoke petitioner\u2019s license to practice mortuary science. The board served petitioner a final order revoking his mortician\u2019s license on December 29, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">Petitioner appealed the board\u2019s decision to the circuit court, which affirmed. This Court denied petitioner\u2019s application for leave to appeal in Docket No. 177001. In lieu of granting leave to appeal, our Supreme Court remanded this matter to this Court for consideration as on leave granted. <em>Ansell v Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>449 Mich 893 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On appeal, petitioner contends that the circuit court erred in affirming the board\u2019s order that revoked his license to practice mortuary science. We disagree. We review the factual findings of administrative agencies to determine whether they are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28; <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1564, AFL-CIO v Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority, </em>437 Mich 441, 450; 473 NW2d 249 (1991); <em>Employment Relations Comm v Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Inc, </em>393 Mich 116, 124; 223 NW2d 283 (1974). We will set aside an administrative agency\u2019s legal ruling only if it violates the constitution or a statute or is affected by a \u201csubstantial and material error of law.\u201d MCL 24.306(1)(a), (f); MSA 3.560(206)(1)(a),(f); <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, supra </em>at 450; <em>Southfield Police Officers Ass\u2019n v Southfield, </em>433 Mich 168, 175-176; 445 NW2d 98 (1989). Although administrative agencies may not eschew the plain meaning of a statute, we afford considerable weight to the statutory construction made by the agency charged with the execution of a statute. <em>Ludington Service Corp v Acting Comm\u2019r of Ins, </em>444 Mich 481, 490; 511 NW2d 661 (1994), amended 444 Mich 1240 (1994); <em>Magreta v Ambassador Steel Co, </em>380 Mich 513, 519; 158 NW2d 473 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The dispositive issue presented is whether \u00a7 1808(3) mandates prospective mortuaiy scientists to embalm or participate in embalming twenty-five dead human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>bodies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addressing this issue, we are mindful that \u201c \u2018[t]he fundamental purpose of any rule of statutory construction, of course, is to assist the court in discovering and giving effect to the intent of the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Terzano v Wayne Co, </em>216 Mich App 522, 526-527; 549 NW2d 606 (1996), quoting <em>In re Certified Question, </em>433 Mich 710, 722; 449 NW2d 660 (1989). Once discovered, the Legislature\u2019s intent must prevail, any existing rule of construction to the contrary notwithstanding. <em>In re Certified Question, supra </em>at 722; <em>Terzano, supra </em>at 527. Where reasonable minds may differ about the meaning of the statute, we look to the objective of the statute and the harm it is designed to remedy and apply a reasonable construction that best accomplishes the Legislature\u2019s purpose. <em>Terzano, supra </em>at 527; <em>People v Ward, </em>211 Mich App 489, 492; 536 NW2d 270 (1995). In discovering legislative purpose, statutes relating to the same subject or sharing a common purpose are in pari materia and must be read together. <em>Jennings v Southwood, </em>446 Mich 125, 136; 521 NW2d 230 (1994); <em>State Treasurer v Schuster, </em>215 Mich App 347, 352; 547 NW2d 332 (1996); <em>Feld v Robert &amp; Charles Beauty Salon, </em>174 Mich App 309, 317; 435 NW2d 474 (1989), rev\u2019d on other grounds 435 Mich 352; 459 NW2d 279 (1990). Finally, we avoid any construction that renders any statutory language surplusage, nugatory, absurd, or illogical. <em>Marquis v Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity (After Remand), </em>444 Mich 638, 644; 513 NW2d 799 (1994); <em>Altman v Meridian Twp, </em>439 Mich 623, 635; 487 NW2d 155 (1992); <em>Ward, supra </em>at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Recognizing' the important public safety issues involved in properly treating human remains, the portion of the Occupational Code pertaining to mortuary science (mortuary science act), MCL 339.1801; MSA 18.425(1801) through MCL 339.1812; MSA 18.425(1812), carefully precludes unlicensed individuals from funeral directing, embalming, or otherwise preparing human corpses for burial and transportation. MCL 339.1804(1); MSA 18.425(1804)(1), MCL 339.1803; MSA 18.425(1803). To ensure the competence of those practicing these critical tasks, \u00a7\u00a7 1801(b) and 1806(1) establish a \u201cresident training\u201d period as a prerequisite to procuring a license to practice mortuary science. To complete resident training, prospective licensees are required by \u00a7 1808(3) to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A88\">present, in connection with the other evidence required by this article, a statement from each holder of a license to practice mortuary science under whom the trainee has trained, showing that the trainee <em>has embalmed for burial or shipment at least 25 dead human bodies, or has assisted the holder of a license for the practice of mortuary science in supervising the preparation of 25 dead human bodies for burial or transportation during the period of resident training. </em>A resident trainee shall meet <em>other training or requirements as may be required by rules of the department and the board. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Petitioner contends that because the phrase \u201cpreparation of 25 dead human bodies for burial or transportation\u201d is separated from the term \u201cembalm\u201d with the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d resident trainees can satisfy \u00a7 1808(3) without participating in any embalmings. Petitioner adds that \u00a7 1801(e) defines the \u201cpractice of mortuary science\u201d as encompassing either \u201cembalming\u201d or \u201cfuneral directing,\u201d and he argues that morti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>cians without embalming aspirations can satisfy \u00a7 1808(3) by performing tasks appurtenant to funerals, such as ushering funeral guests, preparing obituaries, and positioning and grooming embalmed bodies. We axe not persuaded by petitioner\u2019s isolated, non-contextual construction of the mortuary science act. In our view, a reading of the act in pari materia reveals a legislative emphasis bn the safe, sanitary treatment of human remains, not the ability to competently perform tasks related to an orderly, ceremonious burial.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">As we observed in <em>Espinoza v Bowerman-Halifax Funeral Home, </em>121 Mich App 432, 437; 328 NW2d 657 (1982), the mortuary science act focuses on \u201cwhat is to be done or not done with a dead human body.\u201d The act is replete with references to embalming and chemically treating human corpses and devoid of stipulations concerning ceremonial memorial proceedings. Therefore, we conclude that the Legislature enacted the mortuary science act to regulate the science of treating human remains. In this context, the language in \u00a7 1808(3) regarding \u201cthe preparation of . . . dead human bodies for burial\u201d is properly construed as pertaining to the scientific process by which human bodies are embalmed and treated for safe disposal, not the unscientific tasks involved in administering funeral services. In other words, to remain consistent with the treatment-oriented character of the mortuary science act, we construe the term \u201cpreparation\u201d in \u00a7 1808(3) as synonymous with the word \u201ctreat\u201d in the standard definition of \u201cembalm,\u201d which is \u201cto <em>treat </em>(a dead body) so as to preserve it, as with chemicals, drugs, or balsams.\u201d <em>Random House Web</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>ster\u2019s College </em>Dictionary, <em>Revised Edition </em>(1991) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Moreover, petitioner\u2019s attempt to obtain a mortuary science license without demonstrating embalming proficiency is inconsistent with \u00a7 1805, which affords licensed mortuary scientists authority to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">disinfect or preserve a dead human body, entirely or in part, by the use of a chemical substance, fluid, or gas in the body of by the introduction of a chemical, substance, fluid, or gas into the body by a .vascular or hypodermic injection, or .by direct application into an organ or cavity in preparation for burial or disposal. The person may direct the burial or disposal of a dead human body and may maintain a funeral establishment for the preparation and disposition, or for the care of a dead human body ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Because licensees have authority to embalm, logic dictates that resident training must entail practical embalming experience. Granting embalming authority to licensees who attempt to achieve licensure by seating and ushering funeral guests, positioning and grooming bodies in a casket, selling funeral merchandise, or summarizing death certificates would not further the Legislature\u2019s goal of protecting public health. Thus, although \u00a7 1801(e) defines the practice of mortuary science as involving \u201cthe practice of embalming, or the practice of funeral directing, or both,\u201d the .absence of any means for obtaining a license exclusive to funeral directing implies a legislative requirement that all funeral directors possess embalming experience. Otherwise, the potential exists that unwitting funeral directors will supervise burials of improperly embalmed bodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Further, even if the embalming requirements were not apparent to petitioner from his reading of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>statute, petitioner was placed on notice of the necessity of this experience by the mdlr reports that he submitted. Each required embalming report stated that petitioner would receive no credit unless the identified body was embalmed where petitioner was undergoing resident training. In completing each report, petitioner had to provide significant information about the body and the embalming process. Further, petitioner was required to identify the embalmer and certify that petitioner \u201cpersonally embalmed or assisted in the preparation of this case.\u201d These embalming-related requirements would be unnecessary and illogical unless applicants were required to participate in embalming the body identified in the report. Thus, even if \u00a7 1808(3) were ambiguous, the embalming reports submitted by petitioner clearly bound him to the embalming requirement because \u00a7 1808(3) requires applicants to fulfill \u201cother training requirements as' may be required by rules of the department and the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\">Accordingly, consistent with the purpose of the mortuary science act, the board\u2019s express requirements, and the board\u2019s reasonable construction of the statute that it administers, we hold that petitioner was obligated to personally embalm or assist in embalming twenty-five bodies as a condition of his licensure. Because the record is clear that petitioner thwarted this requirement and misidentified the true embalmer of some of the bodies at issue, we find competent, material, and substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s determination that petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>obtained his license by fraud or deceit and demonstrated a lack of good moral character.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Petitioner also claims that the almost four-year gap between the issuance of the formal complaint and the contested case hearing denied him due process of law. We disagree. Only in postrevocation hearings is it required that contested case hearings be \u201cpromptly commenced and determined.\u201d MCL 24.292; MSA 3.560(192); see, generally, <em>Cleveland Bd of Ed v Loudermill, </em>470 US 532; 105 S Ct 1487; 84 L Ed 2d 494 (1985). Where, as here, the subject of the proceedings retains his license, MCL 24.271(1); MSA 3.560(171)(1) provides: \u201cThe parties to a contested case shall be given an opportunity for a hearing without undue delay.\u201d In determining \u201cundue delay,\u201d we use a balancing test to discern whether plaintiff was denied procedural due process. In <em>Dobrzenski v Dobrzenski, </em>208 Mich App 514, 515; 528 NW2d 827 (1995), this Court summarized this standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\u201c \u2018Due process applies to any adjudication of important rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Brock, </em>442 Mich 101, 110; 499 NW2d 752 (1993), quoting <em>In re LaFlure, </em>48 Mich App 377, 385; 210 NW2d 482 (1973). It is a flexible concept calling for \u201c \u2018such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brock, </em>p 111, quoting <em>Mathews v Eldridge, </em>424 US 319, 334; 96 S Ct 893; 47 L Ed 2d 18 (1976). Due process requires fundamental fairness, which involves consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>of the private interest at stake, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, the probable value of additional or substitute procedures, and the state or governmental interest, including the function involved and the fiscal or administrative burdens imposed by substitute procedures. <em>Brock, </em>p 111, citing <em>Mathews, </em>p 335.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">See also <em>People v Sierb, </em>219 Mich App 127, 134; 555 NW2d 728 (1996); <em>Jordan v Jarvis, </em>200 Mich App 445, 448-449; 505 NW2d 279 (1993); <em>In re Konke Estate, </em>98 Mich App 249, 253; 296 NW2d 226 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The proceedings in this case were not fundamentally unfair. Petitioner makes no claim that the delay between the issuance of the complaint and the evidentiary hearing was the result of dilatory conduct on the part of the board. To the contrary, petitioner is partially responsible for any delay because he requested adjournments and spent so much time reviewing the proposed settlement that the board was unable to consider it at its next scheduled meeting. Additionally, petitioner made no attempt to expedite the resolution of the case, never complained about the delay, and actually benefited therefrom by retaining his unrestricted license until his hearing. Compare <em>Cleveland Bd of Ed, supra. </em>We reject petitioner\u2019s unsupported claim that he was prejudiced by his ailing father\u2019s inability to testify. Assuming that petitioner\u2019s father would have been able to testify at an earlier hearing, petitioner fails to establish how such testimony would have benefited his case. It appears clear that petitioner\u2019s father\u2019s testimony would not change the result in light of the fact that petitioner conceded the facts that ultimately led to the revocation of his license. Nonetheless, petitioner could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>preserved his father\u2019s testimony under MCL 24.280(1)(b) and (c); MSA 3.560(180)(1)(b) and (c). Given these circumstances, we find no error arising from the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Finally, we reject petitioner\u2019s claim that the circuit court committed error requiring reversal by allowing respondent to expand the agency record on appeal. Assuming arguendo that the record was improperly expanded, petitioner was not prejudiced. The court stated that it did not rely on the new information and, instead, that \u201cthe Court relied on the analysis of the case law and general experience in both legal and administrative proceedings in reaching the conclusions set forth in the decision.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Jordan, supra. </em>Therefore, the error, if any, in the expansion of the record before the circuit court was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-5\"> Petitioner began working and performing various funeral-related tasks for the Truesdale Funeral Home in 1970.
