S. Comp. St. Supp. 1909, p. 1187). The offense charged was the shipment from New York City to Newark, N.

The section declared on (section 2) imposes a penalty on \u201cany person who shall ship or deliver for shipment from any state * * * to any other state * * * any article of food or drug so * * * misbranded.\u201d It was proved that the words \u201cOlio per Insalata\u201d mean \u201coil for salad\u201d or \u201csalad oil\u201d and the trial judge held, and so charged the jury, that \u201cas a notorious fact salad oil prima facie means olive oil,\u201d but allowed the defendant to show if he could that \u201cit means something else because of recent events which have perhaps rendered olive oil more difficult to obtain, or that other food elements have come to be known as salad oil.\u201d No such proof was introduced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>and the ruling is assigned as error. The Century Dictionary, Worcester\u2019s, Stormont\u2019s, Imperial, and the Encyclopedia all define \u201csalad oil\u201d as \u201colive oil.\u201d Webster\u2019s does not give any definition. We are satisfied that the trial judge quite properly charged, in the absence of any testimony of the sort suggested, that \u201csalad oil prima facie imports olive oil; that is what the world has been accustomed to regard as salad oil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The evidence showed that the articles complained of were sold and shipped by the \u201cStandard Trading Co.\u201d of which defendant was an employ\u00e9 \u2014 its \u201cmanager.\u201d He negotiated the sale. It did not appear whether the concern was a corporation, or a firm, or an individual trading under this corporate name; nor whether the defendant had any interest in the concern other than as employ\u00e9. It is contended that the Circuit Court should have directed a verdict of not guilty at the close of the case on the ground that there was not sufficient proof to sustain a finding that he personally shipped the goods or caused them to be shipped. The plaintiff in error is in no position to make such contention in this court. At the close of the government\u2019s case motion was made to dismiss the information upon several grounds; one of which was \u201cthat it has not been shown that the defendant Brina shipped these goods to any place out of the state'.\u201d The motion was denied and exception reserved. Testimony was thereafter introduced by the defendant on the various issues in the case, part of it being directed to the matter of shipment. At the close of the case defendant renewed his motion to dismiss the information, - but only \u201con the ground that it had not been shown by any evidence that the can which was used \u2022in this case deceived any of the public.\u201d This motion was denied, the court stating that it was \u201cthe only question for the jury.\u201d No objection was taken on the ground that shipment was not proved, nor was-there'any request to go to the jury on that question. There is, therefore, no exception in the case which raises the point now relied upon.'</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The judgment' is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
