The-process claimed is the use in the extraction of oil from <em>cotton </em>seed of the mixture of cotton seed bran with the cotton seed meats in proportion of <em>2y2 </em>per cent, to' 30 per cent. The proof shows that prior to the alleged invention a mixture of cotton seed hulls with the meats occurred in the process of preparing seed before compressing the oil, because the machinery used for preparing the seed for the press was inefficient to separate entirely the hulls from the meats, and the hulls in part went into the same mass with the meats.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">It seems to make no difference whether the hulls go into the mass necessarily from the inability to prevent them or purposely by being placed there. We do not think there is such difference between cotton seed hulls and cotton seed bran as to make patentee\u2019s process new or patentable. Both cotton seed hulls and cotton seed bran are from the outside covering or husk of the cotton seed. The claim that the \u201ccotton seed bran\u201d is the hull of the cotton seed with all the fiber removed is a distinction too fine to give validity to the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"AWO\">The decree of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
