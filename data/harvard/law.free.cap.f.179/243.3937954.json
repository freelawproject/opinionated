S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3154]), or its amendments (Act June 29, 1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 584 [U. S. Comp. St. Supp. 1909, p. 1149]), should apply to, and they are of the opinion that they do not apply to such street railway companies, that no power has been delegated thereby to the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate or affect the rates of transportation of such companies, and that the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission was beyond its powers, and ought not to be enforced during the pendency of this suit.
