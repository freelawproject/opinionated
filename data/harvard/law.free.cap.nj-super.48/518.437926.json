J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aux\">This action was brought in the Superior Court, Chancery Division, to recover real estate brokerage commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">On January 14, 1955 plaintiff, a real estate broker, entered into a contract with the defendant Gerson Bacher, the president and principal stockholder of the two corporate defendants, Torrid K-9, Inc. and B &amp; M Holding Co., which were the owners of certain property. By this contract Bacher gave plaintiff during the ensuing three months the exclusive right to procure a purchaser for the property, agreeing (as we read the contract) that if the same were sold either through plaintiff <em>or by </em>Bacher, plaintiff was to receive a commission of 10% of the sales price.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">The ease was tried before Judge Conford. He found that during the three-month period Bacher entered into a tentative agreement with Thomas A. Sessa and Erank G. Montalto to sell them the property, and that then, in order to avoid paying commissions, he fraudulently induced plaintiff, in consideration of the sum of $500, to rescind the brokerage contract. Thereafter, and still within the stated period, namely, on April 5, 1955, Sessa and Montalto acquired the property from the defendant corporations, paying $160,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>for it. Judge Conford reinstated the brokerage contract, which he had found to have been fraudulently rescinded, and awarded plaintiff damages thereon in the sum of $15,500, 10% of $160,000, less the $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Defendants appeal, contending first that the proof of fraud was inadequate. They claim that to establish fraud the proof must be clear and convincing. Many cases may be cited for such a proposition. See for example <em>Fivey v. Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>67 <em>N. J. L. </em>627, 634 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1902) (\u201cclearly and distinctly proved\u201d); <em>Summerill v. Summerill, </em>83 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>3, 5 <em>(Ch. </em>1913) (an inference of fraud must be clearly established), affirmed 83 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>at <em>page </em>350 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914); <em>Pahy v. Pahy, </em>107 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>538, 540 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1931) (\u201cclearly and convincingly proved\u201d); <em>Ebert v. Givas, </em>109 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>495, 498 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932) (\u201cclearly proved\u201d); <em>Security Acceptance Corp. v. Donegani, </em>113 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>281, 284 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933) (\u201cclearly proved\u201d); <em>Fortunel v. Martin, </em>114 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>235, 241 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933) (\u201cstrictly proved by clear, concise, and unequivocal evidence\u201d); <em>Connelly v. Weisfeld, </em>142 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>406, 410 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948) (\u201cclearly and convincingly proved\u201d); 9 <em>Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.), </em>\u00a7 2498 <em>p. </em>329; <em>McCormick, Evidence, </em>680 (1954); 3 <em>Black, Rescission and Cancellation (2d ed.), </em>\u00a7 683. But see <em>Fischetto Paper Mill Supply v. Quigley Co., </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>149, 155, 156 (1949) (\u201cgreater weight of the evidence\u201d); <em>Newark Live Poultry Co. v. Fauer, </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>556, 560 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1937) (no \u201cstricter rule than in the ordinary civil case\u201d), affirmed on other grounds 120 <em>N. J. L. </em>187 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1938); <em>Kane v. Hibernia Insurance Co., </em>39 <em>N. J. L. </em>697, 704 <em>(E. </em>ic\u00a7 <em>A. </em>1877) (to like effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The standard \u201cclear and convincing proof,\u201d or some variant of it, seems to have had its origin in the practice of the English Court of Chancery in connection with suits for the reformation or rescission of a written instrument because of mistake or fraud. A sterner standard may indeed be justified when dealing with written instruments. Nevertheless, that same standard is now applied to other situations of fraud, being imposed there, apparently not because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>tlie offensive character of the charge <em>(Kane v. Hibernia Insurance Co., supra; Blackmore v. Ellis, </em>70 <em>N. J. L. </em>264, 266 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1904)), bnt perhaps because of an assumed unlikelihood o\u00a3 fraudulent conduct. One may question, with McCormick, the soundness of a rule which places so heavy a burden upon one who claims to be the victim of fraud. <em>McCormick, supra, </em>680, <em>n. </em>11.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">But we need not resolve that matter here. In this case we will assume that plaintiff\u2019s proof must be <em>clear and convincing. </em>What, however, does this very common term mean? It has been said that \u201cthe line of demarcation between what is \u2018clear, satisfactory and convincing\u2019 and that which removes \u2018all reasonable doubt\u2019 is more fanciful than real.\u201d <em>In re Calef's Will, </em>109 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>181, 185 <em>(Prerog. </em>1931), affirmed 111 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>355 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932). This, indeed may be the import of the word \u201cclear,\u201d if we bear down upon it, and perhaps also of the word \u201cconvincing.\u201d <em>State v. Leo, </em>80 <em>N. J. L. </em>21, 25 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1910). However, certain writers on the law of evidence indicate that the term \u201cclear and convincing\u201d is not to be taken literally, but rather as the enunciation of a standard of proof, falling between the standards usually obtaining with respect to criminal and civil issues. <em>Cf. </em>9 <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>329; <em>Uniform Rules of Evidence, Rule </em>1 (4). Applying such a standard to a matter of fraud (we have assumed, above, that the standard is applicable to such a matter generally), the trier of the fact is bound to conclude that fraud has not been made out unless the proofs demonstrate a high probability <em>(McCormick, supra, </em>679), or a strong probability, or that it is <em>much </em>more probable than not, that there was fraud. 1 <em>Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence </em>23, 24 (1954) ; <em>Morgan, \u201cInstructing the Jury Upon Presumptions and Burden of Proof,\u201d </em>47 <em>Harv. L. Rev. </em>59, 65-67 (1933); 5 <em>N. J. Practice </em>116 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">However, in the instant matter \u2014 whatever may be the true interpretation of the standard \u201cclear and convincing proof\u201d \u2014 we may assume that it calls for proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Eor here, the evidence is of such a nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>that we may say, without stopping to discuss it, that even under such a standard, the finding of fraud should not he disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The second point raised by defendants on the appeal goes to the question of damages. Defendants point out that Bacher, not the plaintiff, procured the buyers here, and they make the contention that plaintiff is not entitled to commissions since there is no evidence that during the stated period he could or would have produced a buyer ready, willing and able to sell. But this overlooks the provision of the brokerage contract rendering Bacher liable for commissions in the event he himself sold the property during that period. In the face of that provision Bacher\u2019s liability for commissions cannot be denied. <em>Dresser v. Gilbert, </em>81 <em>N. J. L. </em>358 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1911); <em>Stevenson Co. v. Oppenheimer, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>479 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1918); <em>Lambert v. Cahill, </em>2 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>826 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1924); <em>Jones v. Hollander, </em>3 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>973, 974 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1925); <em>cf. Kruse v. Ferber, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>470, 472 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1918); <em>Ettinger v. Loux, </em>96 <em>N. J. L. </em>522, 525 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1921); <em>Klie v. Hollstein, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>473, 476 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1923); <em>Martin Realty Co. v. Fletcher, </em>103 <em>N. J. L. </em>294, 295 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1927); <em>Maxwell v. Staulcup, </em>103 <em>N. J. L. </em>509, 511 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1927); <em>Rose v. Minis, </em>41 <em>N. J. Super. </em>538, 544 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956). Por a case quite similar on its facts, see <em>Walter v. Libby, </em>72 <em>Cal. App. 2d </em>138, 164 <em>P. 2d </em>21 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945). As Judge Conford said in his opinion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\u201c* * * defendants, as perpetrators of a fraud will not be beard * * * to say that they would not have made the sale, which, in fact, they made, if their fraudulent scheme had not been successfully consummated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Judge Conford properly awarded plaintiff damages in the sum of $15,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
