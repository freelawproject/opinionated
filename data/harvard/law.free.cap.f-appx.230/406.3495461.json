After pursuing state avenues of relief, Brooks filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, which the district court dismissed on a motion for summary judgment by the respondent. A judge of this court granted Brooks a certificate of appealability on one issue: whether Brooks\u2019s counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate and pursue an insanity defense. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) provides a scheme of deference to be used in reviewing claims in a state prisoner\u2019s habeas corpus petition that were adjudicated on the merits in state-court proceedings. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see also Hill v. Johnson, </em>210 F.3d 481, 484-85 (5th Cir.2000). A federal court must defer to a state court\u2019s resolution of both pure questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact unless the state court\u2019s determination was \u201ccontrary to\u201d or an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>Hill, </em>210 F.3d at 485; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-17\">To obtain relief on grounds of ineffective legal assistance, a petitioner must show both \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To demonstrate deficiency, a defendant must show that \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201c[C]ounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-18\">Applying these standards, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that federal habeas relief was not warranted. Under Texas law, an insanity defense is available if, \u201cat the time of the conduct charged, the actor, as a result of severe mental disease or defect, did not know that his conduct was wrong.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01 (Vernon 2003); <em>see also Ward v. State, </em>787 S.W.2d 116, 117 (Tex.App.1990). Brooks\u2019s counsel sought and obtained psychological evaluations for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Brooks. The first evaluation resulted in Brooks being sent to a hospital for psychiatric treatment. A subsequent evaluation resulted in a finding that Brooks knew that his conduct was wrong at the time he committed the offense, i.e., that he was sane.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">A reasonable attorney could have made a strategic choice not to pursue a defense that was contradicted by a court-appointed psychologist. Thus, the state court\u2019s determination that counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
