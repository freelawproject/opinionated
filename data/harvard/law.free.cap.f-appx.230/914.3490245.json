After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">Haynes, who was 47 years old at the time, contacted and participated in online chats with \u201ckaci \u2014 fl\u2014gurl,\u201d an undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation agent posing online as a 14-year-old girl. Haynes discussed with \u201cKaci,\u201d among others, his desire to teach her about sex and to perform various sexual activities with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-18\">A jury convicted Haynes of one count of knowingly attempting to entice a minor to engage in a sexual act by using a facility of interstate commerce. At his first sentencing, Haynes objected to various sentencing enhancements under the Sentencing Guidelines recommended in his presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), including a 2-point enhancement for unduly influencing a minor, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B) (2003). The district court overruled his objections. With a total offense level of 27 and a criminal history category of I, Haynes\u2019s guidelines range was 70 to 87 months. The district court sentenced Haynes to a 78-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-19\">Haynes appealed his sentence and conviction. This Court affirmed his conviction, but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In so doing, the Court noted that there was sufficient evidence for the district court to apply the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B) enhancement, but that by applying the enhancement under a mandatory regime, the district court had committed constitutional <em>Booker </em>error. The Court concluded, therefore, that \u201c[t]he district court correctly calculated Haynes\u2019s guidelines range as 70 to 87 months and need not revisit the guidelines calculations ____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AxG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>On remand, Haynes contested the 2-point enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B) on grounds that Haynes had not actually intended to unduly influence a minor. The district court reminded Haynes that it would not reconsider the guidelines calculations. Haynes explained that his argument was directed toward consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposing a reasonable sentence. Haynes requested the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The district court stated that, after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it was inclined, if anything, to impose a sentence above the advisory guidelines range. The district court noted that it had specifically considered: (1) Haynes\u2019s history; (2) the seriousness of the offense; and (3) the need to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment. The district court re-imposed a 78-month sentence. Haynes filed this second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">On appeal, Haynes argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain the reasons for the sentence it imposed or acknowledge Haynes\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">After <em>Booker, </em>a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider the correctly calculated advisory guidelines range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Although the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">We review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006). This \u201c[r]eview for reasonableness is deferential,\u201d and \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">Here, Haynes has not shown that his 78-month sentence was unreasonable. The district court explicitly noted that it had considered the \u00a7 3553 factors and specifically addressed Haynes\u2019s history, the nature and circumstances of his offense and the need to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2). The district court did not, and was not required to, discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor or address every argument urged by Haynes in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-8\">. Haynes also argues that the district court improperly applied the 2-point undue influence of a minor enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B). However, this issue is foreclosed by the law-of-the-case doctrine. <em>See United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996). This issue was raised in Haynes\u2019s first appeal. This Court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B) enhancement and that the guidelines range had been calculated correctly. Moreover, our limited remand was solely for the district court to consider that correctly calculated advisory guidelines range and the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining a reasonable sentence <em>post-Booker.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
