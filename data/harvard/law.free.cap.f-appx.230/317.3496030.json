Best seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his \u201cpetition for clarification determination\u201d of the court\u2019s prior order denying in part and granting in part his motion for reduction of sentence under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3582 (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007). In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>see United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 3582 proceeding is criminal in nature and ten-day appeal period applies). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The district court entered its order denying Best\u2019s petition for clarification on August 17, 2006. The notice of appeal was filed on February 9, 2006.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Best failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> <em>See </em>Fed.
