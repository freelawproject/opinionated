Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005), and its progeny, which have outlined this court\u2019s methodology for reviewing sentences for reasonableness. Beltran also raises arguments that are foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision and not a separate criminal offense. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
