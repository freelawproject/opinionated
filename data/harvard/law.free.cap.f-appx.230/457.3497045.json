Chavez-Castro argues that his two prior Texas sentences for indecency with a child should have been considered \u201crelated cases\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). His prior Texas convictions involved joint hearings for re-arraignment and sentencing, and he was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for those convictions. However, the convictions also had separate docket numbers, separate indictments, different victims, separate sentences, and separate judgments. Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that Chavez-Castro\u2019s prior Texas sentences were not related for guidelines purposes. <em>See United States v. Moreno-Arredondo, </em>255 F.3d 198, 203 n. 10 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Velazquez-Overa, </em>100 F.3d 418, 423-24 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Chavez-Castro also argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 87-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">Chavez-Castro\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Chavez-Castro properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
