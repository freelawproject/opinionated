Jackson appeals from his conviction of assaulting a fellow prisoner and causing serious bodily harm. He contends that the Government engaged in misconduct during closing arguments by relying on his codefendants\u2019 guilty pleas as evidence of his own guilt and that the district court\u2019s instructions did not cure the Government\u2019s misconduct. Jackson did not object to the arguments or instructions in the district court; our review thus is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-17\">Defense counsel elicited the testimony of Jackson\u2019s codefendants that they had pleaded guilty. Counsel presented a theory of the case implicating the codefendants and not Jackson. Moreover, the testimony of one codefendant suggested that the victim initiated physical contact. Because Jackson relied on his codefendants\u2019 guilty pleas as part of his own case, the Government was allowed to use them as substantive evidence of Jackson\u2019s guilt. <em>See United States v. Samak, </em>7 F.3d 1196, 1198-99 (5th Cir.1993). Moreover, Jackson has not demonstrated that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were prejudicial. <em>See United States v. Rocha, </em>916 F.2d 219, 234 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-18\">The district court\u2019s instruction regarding the codefendants\u2019 guilty pleas was sufficient to mitigate any suggestion by the Government that Jackson should be convicted because his codefendants pleaded guilty. <em>See United States v. Mattoni </em>698 F.2d 691, 694 (5th Cir.1983). Finally, the timing of the instruction in Jackson\u2019s case does not diminish its curative effect. <em>See United States v. Robins, </em>978 F.2d 881, 888 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
