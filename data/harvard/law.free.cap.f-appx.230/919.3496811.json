Kerley appeals his conviction and sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 100 or more marijuana plants, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">Kerley pled guilty pursuant to an oral plea agreement. During the plea hearing, the parties entered the terms of the oral plea agreement into the record. Under the terms, Kerley agreed to plead guilty to the drug conspiracy count in exchange for the government dismissing a drug possession count and not objecting to Kerley\u2019s receiving a guidelines adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">During the plea hearing, Kerley\u2019s counsel summarized the substance of the plea negotiations, stating, among other things, that the government had agreed not to object to Kerley\u2019s request for safety-valve relief pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-16\">[Kerley\u2019s Counsel]: ... [H]e is pleading to one count of conspiracy, ... and I also understand based on the terms of our \u2014 either they are going to agree or not object to the fact by coming forward he is entitled to acceptance of responsibility. The Government is not going to object or possibly agree, depending on the term of art, the guideline safety valve would probably apply if he has the one point that we think that he has as far as prior conviction, and I think the Government would also probably agree or not object, actually, probably affirmatively agree that he is still in the posture of based upon his debriefings and infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>mation he is still in a posture of reaping that information into a possible 5K1 or Rule 35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">The district court stated that it had reservations about the parties\u2019 decision to enter into an oral plea agreement and directed the parties to put every term of the plea agreement in the record. In response, the government clarified that it was making no promises with regard to whether Kerley was eligible for safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-6\">[Government]: If I may, Your Honor, the only thing the Government is agreeing to with respect to Frank Eugene Kerley is two level acceptance for coming forward if the court does accept and adjudicate guilty and the dismissal of Count 2. All of the other things are pending concerning criminal history. I cannot make agreements or obligate the Government with respect to whether he is eligible for safety valve. There are only two agreements to recommend two levels for acceptance, as well as, dismissal of Count 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">When the district court asked Kerley\u2019s counsel if this was his understanding of the plea agreement, Kerley\u2019s counsel replied that it was, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-8\">THE COURT: Mr. Gelety, is that your understanding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-9\">[Kerley\u2019s counsel]: It is. She can\u2019t agree \u2014 I hate to say anything nice about her, she can\u2019t agree because, in fairness, we need to firm up that one point on the criminal history. I am comfortable saying if it is one point as I anticipate I am comfortable she will not object or she will agree the safety valve applies, is that fair enough?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">The district court then asked Kerley directly whether that was his understanding of the plea agreement, and Kerley responded that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Kerley\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) stated that Kerley, along with his codefendant father and brother, had operated five marijuana grow houses with more than 200 plants. The PSI characterized Kerley as involved in the entire operation, responsible for establishing the houses, recruiting his family members and distributing the marijuana while receiving the majority of the profits. Consequently, the PSI recommended a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) as an organizer. Additionally, because Kerley was an organizer/manager of the offense, the PSI concluded that Kerley was ineligible for safety-valve relief, despite the fact that Kerley had provided a truthful safety-valve statement to the government. With a total offense level of 17 and a criminal history category of I, the PSI calculated Kerley\u2019s advisory guidelines range as 24 to 30 months. However, the PSI noted that, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), the statutory mandatory-minimum sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment applied and became the guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">Kerley objected to the organizer enhancement and the safety-valve disqualification. Kerley argued that the government had breached the plea agreement by providing information to the probation office and the sentencing court that resulted in the PSI\u2019s recommendation for the organizer enhancement and the denial of safety-valve relief. Kerley also objected to various factual allegations in the PSI relating to Kerley\u2019s role in the offense, including the assertions that he was responsible for establishing the marijuana-growing operation, that he supplied equipment and provided instruction on the operation of the grow houses, that he recruited others and that he had profited significantly from the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>At the sentencing hearing, the government called Drug Enforcement Agency special agent Dean Wolpert. Wolpert testified that during interviews with Kerley\u2019s codefendants, Wolpert learned that Kerley had approached them to participate in the marijuana-growing scheme, provided them with materials and plant \u201cclones,\u201d checked on plant growth, processed the product, sold the product to a distributor and received a percentage of the profits from the marijuana grown in their residences. To counter the government\u2019s evidence, Kerley called his father, who testified that the operation was \u201ca family thing\u201d with \u201cno boss\u201d and \u201ceverybody in charge of their own operation.\u201d However, Kerley\u2019s father admitted on cross-examination that Kerley provided plant \u201cclones\u201d and equipment, assisted in each harvest, distributed the product and was the only defendant involved in all five grow houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">After hearing arguments from counsel, the district court found that the plea agreement did not include any terms relating to an organizer/manager enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) or a safety-valve reduction under \u00a7 5C1.2. In addition, the district court concluded that Kerley\u2019s actions in recruiting, providing plants and equipment, monitoring the plants\u2019 growth, harvesting, processing and distributing the product, and sharing in his codefendants\u2019 profits categorized Kerley as an organizer/manager under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) and thus rendered him ineligible for safety-valve relief. The district court sentenced Kerley to the statutory mandatory-minimum 60-month sentence. Kerley filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Anu\">A. Breach of the Plea Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">On appeal, Kerley argues that the government breached the oral plea agreement by presenting evidence to support a finding that he was an organizer/manager of the conspiracy pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) and thus ineligible for safety-valve relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">The government is bound by promises it makes to a defendant in order to induce the defendant to plead guilty. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>132 F.3d 628, 630 (11th Cir.1998). In determining whether the government breached the plea agreement, we first determine the scope of the government\u2019s promises. <em>Raulerson v. United States, </em>901 F.2d 1009, 1011 (11th Cir.1990). Whether the government violated the promises of the plea agreement is judged according to the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding at the time that he entered his plea. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>77 F.3d 368, 370 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">Here, the record shows that the oral plea agreement consisted of three unambiguous terms: (1) Kerley would plead guilty to one count of conspiracy; (2) the government would dismiss the count of possession; and (3) the government would not object to Kerley receiving a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The plea agreement contained no restrictions on the government with regard to a role enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) or safety-valve relief. Furthermore, Kerley concurred with the government\u2019s statement during the plea hearing that the government was making no promise with regard to Kerley\u2019s eligibility for a safety-valve reduction. All references to the possibility of Kerley receiving a safety-valve reduction at sentencing were couched in conditional language and clearly did not constitute a promise by the government not to object should Kerley seek safety-valve relief. Therefore, the government did not breach the plea agreement by pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>senting evidence regarding Kerley\u2019s organizer role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">B. Organizer Role Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Kerley also argues that the district court erred in finding that he was an organizer pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(e) and that Kerley, therefore, did not meet the criteria for a safety-valve reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">The safety-valve provision of \u00a7 5C1.2 implements 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), and allows a court to sentence a defendant without regard to the statutory mandatory-minimum sentence if the defendant meets five criteria. <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is no dispute that Kerley met four of the five criteria. The only issue in this appeal is whether Kerley was an \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a). If he was, then the two-point enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) was proper, and Kerley was ineligible for safety-valve relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Section 3Bl.l(c) provides for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level if he was \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity____\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). \u201c[T]he assertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 2 (\u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d). Factors to consider in determining whether the defendant qualifies for the \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) role enhancement include: (1) the exercise of decision-making authority; (2) the nature of participation; (3) the recruitment of accomplices; (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime; (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense; (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity; and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">Here, the record shows that the district court did not clearly err in concluding that Kerley was an organizer/manager under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). The government presented evidence that Kerley had great influence over his codefendants and played a significant role in organizing and maintaining the marijuana-growing operation. Kerley initiated the scheme to grow marijuana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>plants at the five houses; recruited his codefendants to join in the scheme; provided his codefendants with equipment and plants; checked on their operations; harvested and processed the marijuana from their plants and took it to a distributor; and took a significant share of his codefendants\u2019 profits from the sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Because Kerley was an organizer/manager, the district court also did not clearly err in finding that Kerley was ineligible for safety-valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>whether the government has breached a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b951-9\">.

We also review for clear error the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense. <em>United States v. Mesa, </em>247 F.3d 1165, 1168 (2001). However, the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to its factual findings is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v.
