He argues that his sentence is unreasonable and, additionally, a denial of due process and equal protection because it is longer than similarly situated defendants who are sentenced in districts with \u201cfast-track\u201d sentencing programs. His contention that sentencing disparities created by fast-track programs rendered his sentence unreasonable is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 682 (5th Cir.2006), <em>pet. for cert. filed </em>(Nov. 13, 2006) (No. 06-7792). Moreover, he has not established under plain error review that restricting the fast-track program to only certain geographic locations results in due process and equal protection violations. <em>See United States v. Marcial-Santiago, </em>447 F.3d 715, 719 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 309, 166 L.Ed.2d 232 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Navarro challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. That constitutional issue is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Navarro contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). <em>See Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006). Navarro properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">Navarro contends that the district court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1) by failing to inform him of the \u201caggravated felony\u201d provision of 1326(b)(2). He concedes that this issue is also foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
