(\u201cAramark\u201d), the food service provider at APCI, based on defendants\u2019 alleged failure to provide him with a nutritionally adequate vegan diet. After considering Bowers\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to dismiss the complaint, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>dismissed the action as to Aramark, for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because Bowers\u2019s \u201crespondeat superior\u201d theory of liability was not cognizable under \u00a7 1988, and dismissed the action as to Scouten, without prejudice, for failure to timely serve process on Scouten. On appeal, Bowers argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for reconsideration because his due process and equal protection rights were violated when the district court closed his case without providing notice or opportunity to be heard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Bowers\u2019s \u201cMotion to Reconsider,\u201d in which he asserted that the dismissal order was <em>void </em>for lack of notice, is best characterized as a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. <em>See Nisson v. Lundy, </em>975 F.2d 802, 806-07 (11th Cir.1992) (stating that we may treat a motion as having been filed under Rule 60(b) as long as the motion states grounds that would be the basis for relief under Rule 60(b)). We generally review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001). However, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling upon a Rule 60(b)(4) motion to set aside a judgment as void. <em>Id. </em>(internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">A Rule 60(b)(6) motion is intended \u201conly for extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Toole v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>235 F.3d 1307, 1316 (11th Cir.2000) (citation and quotations omitted). And \u201c[a]n appeal of a ruling on a Rule 60(b) motion ... is narrow in scope, addressing only the propriety of the denial or grant of relief and does not raise issues in the underlying judgment for review.\u201d <em>Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla. v. Northwestern Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>198 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">Rule 60(b) provides that \u201cthe court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment, order, or proceeding ... (4) [if] the judgment is void; ... or (6) [for] any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4), (6). A judgment is void \u201cif the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.\u201d <em>Burke, </em>252 F.3d at 1263 (citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Here, the record belies Bowers\u2019s contention that he was not afforded the opportunity to be \u201cheard\u201d \u2014 he filed an amended complaint, two objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s reports, and a supplement to his amended complaint. In short, Bowers has not shown that the district court\u2019s order was void nor that it presented an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d that would relief under Rule 60(b)(4). Put simply, from our <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-7\">. He also contends that the dismissal of his case as to Scouten, due to the lack of service, was error because he mailed a copy of the complaint to Scouten\u2019s last known address, citing Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That rule, however, concerns the service of pleadings subsequent to the complaint. Fed.R.Civ.P. 5(a). As the plaintiff, Bowers was responsible for serving the summons and complaint on the defendant. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c)(1). Our review of the record reveals that he was unsuccessful in serving Scouten over the course of <em>10 months. </em>The district court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Bowers\u2019s case without prejudice due to his inability to serve the defendant. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m) (providing 120-day time limit for plaintiff's perfection of service of the summons and complaint).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
