Cortez claims the district court reversibly erred by imposing a Guidelines sentence without considering his troubled and violent youth in the light of the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-31\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>sentences are reviewed only for unreasonableness; nevertheless, a district court has a duty to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as a duty to correctly determine the applicable Guidelines range. <em>E.g., United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 828, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). If, in the exercise of discretion, the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated Guidelines range, little explanation is required, and this court will infer that the district court considered all of the factors for a fair sentence set for in the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 519. Given the deference due the district court\u2019s discretion under the <em>Booker </em>regime, \u201cit will be rare for a reviewing court to say such a sentence is \u2018unreasonable\u2019 \u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The record reflects that the district court considered the relevant statutory sentencing factors. Cortez has not shown that the sentence was unreasonable or that this court should not defer to the district court\u2019s determinations at sentencing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
