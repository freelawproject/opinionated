Specifically, he alleges that the State Department of Personnel acted improperly by rejecting his appeal due to his failure to attend a hearing that was held ten months before he had filed that appeal. He sought to have the District Court waive the time limitation on his appeal, overturn the underlying employment decision, and award money damages. The District Court denied his motion to file an amended complaint adding as defendants various State officers acting in their official capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-27\">We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and undertake plenary review of the District Court\u2019s ruling on immunity. <em>See United States v. Gov\u2019t of V.I., </em>363 F.3d 276, 284 (3d Cir.2004). States may not be sued by private parties in federal court unless Congress has exercised its limited power to authorize such suits or the state waives its sovereign im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>munity by consenting to suit. <em>See Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., </em>527 U.S. 666, 669-70, 119 S.Ct. 2219, 144 L.Ed.2d 605 (1999). Here, the State of New Jersey is the only defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As sovereign immunity has neither been abrogated by Congress nor waived by the state in this case, we conclude that the complaint was properly dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the order of the district court. Appellant\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-17\">. The proposed amendment to the complaint would have been futile. Suits against state officers acting in their official capacities are treated the same as suits against the state itself, <em>Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), except in limited circumstances not present here. <em>See, e.g., Verizon Md., Inc. v. Public Servs. Comm\u2019n, </em>535 U.S. 635, 645, 122 S.Ct. 1753, 152 L.Ed.2d 871 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ax\">. On December 7, 2006, we requested that appellant submit a two-page brief addressing the sovereign immunity issue. Appellant\u2019s motion to increase the page limit of his brief in response to court order from two to four pages is granted. We have given full consideration to all arguments contained in the submitted brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
