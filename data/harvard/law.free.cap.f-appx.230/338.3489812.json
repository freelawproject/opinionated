On appeal, Slade contends (1) that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to investigate the suggestion that jurors were unable to hear trial proceedings; (2) that the district court erred in counting his 1981 Virginia robbery conviction as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of the federal \u201cthree strikes\u201d statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c); and (3) that the district court imposed an unreasonable variance sentence for his brandishment conviction when it increased a recommended guideline sentence of seven years to life imprisonment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b368-17\">On the snowy morning of December 5, 2002, Slade walked into the Chenoweth Creek Branch of the Mountain Valley Bank located on the outskirts of Elkins, West Virginia, wearing a camouflage army jacket, sunglasses, a hood, and carrying two flower-print pillow cases and a small caliber pistol. He approached two bank tellers, giving each an empty pillow case, and pointed the pistol at them saying, \u201cPut the money in the bag.\u201d Slade walked out of the bank with $12,020.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-18\">A week later, police apprehended Slade. He was indicted on two counts \u2014 one charging him with armed bank robbery and the other charging him with brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence \u2014 and tried before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-19\">During voir dire, two members of the venire informed the court that they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>difficulties hearing. In response, the court adopted procedures during the trial to assure itself that the jury were hearing the proceedings. At the close of the government\u2019s case, Slade\u2019s counsel told the district court that he had been informed by a court clerk that \u201cthe jury has stated that it\u2019s having trouble hearing the lawyers, and perhaps, the witnesses and the Court.\u201d When the district court asked Slade\u2019s counsel which court clerk had told them this, he could not remember. After the court recalled to counsel the instructions it had given to the jury directing them to raise their hands if they could not hear and noted that none had done so, the court refused to investigate counsel\u2019s suggestion further. The jury convicted Slade on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">During sentencing, the district court applied the three-strikes law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c), which imposes a mandatory life sentence for those convicted of three \u201cserious violent felonies,\u201d to the bank robbery count. Slade challenged one of the predicate offenses \u2014 a 1981 robbery conviction in Virginia \u2014 as not being a serious violent felony as defined by the statute. After an extended hearing, during which the district court received evidence, the court concluded that the prior Virginia conviction satisfied the statute because Slade had used a pocketknife in the course of robbing a hitchhiker. With respect to the brandishing count, the district court understood that the Sentencing Guidelines recommended a seven-year sentence and increased that sentence to life imprisonment because brandishing was at the heart of the bank robbery and therefore was an essentially equivalent violation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Slade contends first that the district court committed structural error in refusing to investigate whether the jurors had heard all of the trial proceedings. The district court, concluding that it had communicated sufficiently with the jury to be assured that the jury heard the proceedings, rejected Slade\u2019s motion. We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Slade\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The issue first arose during voir dire when a member of the venire complained of having hearing difficulties. The district court responded that \u201cit is important that you hear all the questions and it\u2019s very important once we start this, that you hear the answers from the witnesses.\u201d The court told the juror to \u201cconsider this issue while I am finishing up the voir dire this morning, and then I\u2019m going to call you up and ask ... how much of it you think you heard and how much you may have missed.\u201d As promised, the district court revisited the prospective juror\u2019s hearing issue as voir dire drew to a close, and the juror said that he \u201cmight\u201d have trouble hearing some things. At this point, a second juror spoke up, stating that he too had a \u201chearing problem.\u201d When asked if he had heard \u201ceverything this morning,\u201d he replied, \u201cMost of it, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">During the jury selection process, when counsel were given the opportunity to strike prospective members of the jury, the district court brought the hearing difficulties of the two prospective jurors to the attention of both the prosecution and the defense. Neither, however, wished to strike the two jurors, either for cause or with their peremptory strikes. As a result, the two members of the venire who had complained of having hearing problems were impaneled as jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Throughout the trial, the district court took steps to ensure that the jury heard the proceedings. It repeatedly instructed the jury to inform the court if they had any difficulty in hearing the proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>For example, the court told the jurors, \u201cif you have any problems hearing raise your hand. I need to know about it as soon as the problem starts.\u201d The court also repeatedly instructed witnesses and counsel throughout the trial to speak clearly and into the microphone, reminding them that the jurors needed to hear them. For example, the court instructed one witness to speak \u201cin a nice loud voice so all the jurors can hear you\u201d; another to \u201cspeak directly into the microphone ... so everyone can hear you\u201d; and yet another to speak \u201cout loud, so we can hear.\u201d These warnings were given to each witness and lawyer, sometimes more than once.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">At the close of the government\u2019s case, Slade\u2019s counsel requested that the court conduct an investigation as to whether the jury were hearing the proceedings, inasmuch as counsel had heard something from a clerk to the effect that the jury was having trouble hearing the lawyers, perhaps the witnesses, and perhaps the court. The court responded, \u201cThis jury was instructed by me, that if any member of the jury could not hear, they were to raise their hand as soon as they could not hear. I have been carefully scrutinizing this jury during the entire two days of trial. No one has raised their hand.\u201d Slade\u2019s counsel conceded that fact, and the court refused to investigate the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">At the end of the trial, prior to charging the jury, the court told the jury that \u201c[i]f at any time during the delivery of this charge, any juror does not hear what I am saying, I want you to raise your hand and I will repeat what I\u2019ve said.\u201d No juror ever raised his hand then, just as none had during the course of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">We agree with the district court that there is nothing in the record to indicate that the jury was not in fact hearing trial proceedings. The court had repeatedly advised the jury to raise their hand if they could not hear, and none had done so. The court also repeatedly instructed witnesses and lawyers to speak loudly and clearly into the microphone. Finally, the court indicated that it had observed the jury throughout the course of the trial and had no reason to conclude that the jury was not hearing the proceedings. In these circumstances, we readily conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Slade\u2019s motion. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>542 F.2d 186, 194 (4th Cir.1976) (stating that we \u201caccord deference to the [district court\u2019s] informed discretion\u201d whether to investigate a claim of jury infection).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Slade next contends that the district court erred in sentencing him under the federal three-strikes law on the armed bank robbery conviction, arguing that his 1981 Virginia robbery conviction was not a \u201cserious violent felony,\u201d as required by the three-strikes law. He maintains that there is no evidence that he used a firearm or other dangerous weapon during the course of the 1981 Virginia robbery, to which he had pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">The three-strikes law mandates a life sentence for \u201ca person who is convicted ... of a serious violent felony ... if the person has been convicted on separate prior occasions ... of 2 or more serious violent felonies.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(1)(A)(i). While the term \u201cserious violent felony\u201d includes robbery, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3559(c)(2)(F)(i), the statute gives the defendant an opportunity to disqualify a robbery offense as a predicate offense \u201cif the defendant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that no firearm or other dangerous weapon was used [or was threatened to be used] in the offense and the offense did not result in death or seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>ous bodily injury ... to any person,\u201d <em>id, </em>\u00a7 3559(c)(3)(A)(i), (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Slade contends that in connection with his 1981 conviction, no weapon was involved. Alternatively, he argues that if a weapon was involved, it was a pocketknife that did not constitute a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">After the government offered evidence that a pocketknife was used in accomplishing the robbery, Slade offered the testimony of his co-defendant in that case who testified that Slade neither used a dangerous weapon, nor committed the robbery at all. In somewhat extended findings of fact, the district court found Slade\u2019s codefendant incredible. The court stated that the witness testified in a manner \u201cthat this court views to be false ... in many material respects.\u201d The court also noted that the 1981 conviction was based on Slade\u2019s plea of guilty to violating Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-58, which imposes special penalties for committing robbery \u201cby partial strangulation, or suffocation, or by striking or beating, or by other violence to the person, or by assault ..., or <em>by the threat or presenting of firearms, or other deadly weapon or instrumentality whatsoever.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). In the circumstances where Slade\u2019s only evidence was discredited by the district court and was patently inconsistent with the government\u2019s evidence and Slade\u2019s guilty plea, we conclude that Slade did not carry his burden of proving by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that no \u201cdangerous weapon was involved in the offense.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(e)(3)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Slade argues that even if a pocketknife was involved in the robbery, it did not qualify as a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d We reject his contention by applying the definition of dangerousness adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>McLaughlin v. United States, </em>476 U.S. 16, 106 S.Ct. 1677, 90 L.Ed.2d 15 (1986). In concluding that an unloaded gun was a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d within the meaning of the federal bank robbery statute, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">First, a gun is an article that is typically and characteristically dangerous; the use for which it is manufactured and sold is a dangerous one, and the law reasonably may presume that such an article is always dangerous even though it may not be armed at a particular time or place. In addition, the display of a gun instills fear in the average citizen; as a consequence, it creates an immediate danger that a violent response will ensue. Finally, a gun can cause harm when used as a bludgeon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 17-18,106 S.Ct. 1677.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Each reason given by the Court in <em>McLaughlin </em>for regarding an unloaded handgun as a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d applies with equal force to a pocketknife. First, a pocketknife is typically and characteristically dangerous; its blade serves no other purpose but to cut and wound. Second, the display of a pocketknife in a threatening situation, such as a robbery, will certainly instill fear in the average citizen, raising the possibility of a violent response. Finally, just as a gun \u201ccan cause harm when used as a bludgeon,\u201d a pocketknife can cause even more harm when so used because of its sharp blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">At bottom, the district court did not err in concluding that the 1981 Virginia robbery conviction was a serious violent felony, as that term is used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">Finally, Slade contends that the district court\u2019s upward variance sentence on Count 2 (the brandishing count) from seven years\u2019 imprisonment to life imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>ment was unreasonable. The district court assumed that the Sentencing Guidelines recommended a sentence of seven years for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), and acting under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), it enhanced the sentence because, as the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">[W]hen one thinks about this at a deeper level, the point here is that the use of weapons in the count of conviction is probably the most horrifying fact of the case. The defendant brandished this\u2014 this gun with the \u2014 before the tellers, striking them with a tremendous amount of fear and I am disinclined to believe that the sentence for the \u2014 on the weapons charge should be any less than the sentence for the bank robbery, because the need to protect the public from further crimes is still the same. The need to afford adequate deterrence is still the same, and the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment for the offense, is still the same for both of these counts. The fact that we have cleared up what the applicable maximum is [life imprisonment], leads this Court to conclude that from a legal perspective the maximum sentence is available to it, if I make a determination that such a sentence is sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2). And I believe that it is and I, therefore, believe that the sentence of life on the felony weapons conviction is a reasonable sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">If we were to conduct an analysis of so great an enhancement, we would likely find the variance unreasonable. But because the district court erred in concluding that the Sentencing Guidelines recommended a seven-year sentence, rather than life imprisonment, we need not examine the reasonableness of the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Section 2K2.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that the recommended guideline sentence for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) is the minimum term of imprisonment required by statute. Section 5Gl.l(b), in turn, provides that when the statutory minimum exceeds the maximum applicable guideline range, the statutory minimum is the recommended guideline sentence. In this case, the statutory minimum for a violation of \u00a7 924(c) is life imprisonment, and therefore the recommended Guidelines sentence is life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Section 924(c) provides a term of imprisonment for brandishing a firearm of not less than seven years \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that a <em>greater minimum sentence </em>is otherwise provided by ... any other provision of law.\u201d (Emphasis added). Section 3559(c) is such \u201cother provision.\u201d It states that \u201c[Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who is convicted ... of a serious violent felony shall be sentenced to life imprisonment\u201d if the person was previously convicted of two or more \u201cserious violent felonies.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8559(c)(1)(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In this case, Slade fulfills the conditions of \u00a7 3559(c). He was convicted under \u00a7 924(c) of brandishing a firearm in connection with a bank robbery, and for purposes of \u00a7 3559(c), that offense is defined to be a \u201cserious violent felony.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(2)(F)(1). Because Slade was previously convicted of two serious violent felonies, his sentence for the brandishing offense must be life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Because the Sentencing Guidelines thus recommend the same sentence that the district court imposed by an imperfect application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), any error attributed to the district court\u2019s process in arriving at the life sentence is harmless. The life sentence itself that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>district court imposed on Count 2 was not erroneous; indeed, it was mandated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
