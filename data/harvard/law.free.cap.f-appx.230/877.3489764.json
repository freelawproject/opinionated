U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cIn this particular area, the BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). In denying the motion, the BIA must not have acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-24\">A party may only file one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B). Amotion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The 90-day time limit does not apply, however, if the motion to reopen is filed on the basis of changed circumstances in the country of the movant\u2019s nationality. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h). To meet this exception, a movant must show material evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">On June 20, 2006, Saldarriaga filed a motion to reopen proceedings \u2014 more than 90 days after the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s order of removal on January 9, 2006. Saldarriaga argues that his motion falls under the \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d exception to the 90-day rule. The BIA determined that he failed to present sufficient evidence that the political conditions in Colombia have materially changed since his original asylum hearing. In light of the evidence presented with his motion to reopen, the BIA\u2019s finding was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Specifically, the news articles and letters submitted showing the conditions in Colombia did not meaningfully alter Saldarriaga\u2019s previous claims. They offered general information about Colombian politics, but much of that information was available at the time of the initial merit hearing and did not provide evidence of any material change in country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Accordingly, none of the proffered evidence established the requisite changed circumstances in Colombia after Saldarriaga\u2019s asylum hearing, and Saldarriaga failed to satisfy the exception to the timely filing requirement. We thus cannot say that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
