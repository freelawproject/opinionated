The district court determined that \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d was not available to allow him to file under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">We review the availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 <em>de novo. Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005). Typically, a collateral attack on a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Under limited circumstances, however, a provision of \u00a7 2255, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 after the limitation period if a petition under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255 \u00b6 5. We have held that the savings clause only applies when the petitioner shows</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9k\">1) that the claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; 2) the holding of the Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, 3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8r\"><em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Here, Lavender is precluded from seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d does not apply. He has failed to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test because his claim is not based on a retroactive Supreme Court decision, and we need not address the remaining prongs. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244-45. After careful review of the record and the briefs of both parties, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
