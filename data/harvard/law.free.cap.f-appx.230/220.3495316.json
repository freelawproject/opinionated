We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-25\">In his habeas petition, Woodruff stated that the matter concerned his 1998 conviction in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, (\u201cNorthern District of California\u201d) criminal docket number CR-93-00438-VRW, for which he was sentenced to 235 months of imprisonment. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the conviction and sentence on September 29, 1999. <em>United States v. Woodruff, </em>198 F.3d 256 (9th Cir.1999) (TABLE). Woodruff then unsuccessfully pursued a motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, raising a jurisdictional claim and other claims. The sentencing court denied relief in July 2003. Woodruff then filed his section 2241 habeas petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-26\">In his habeas petition, Woodruff argued that the Northern District of California was without proper jurisdiction over his criminal ease because the state of Califor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>nia has not ceded criminal legislative jurisdiction to the United States. Woodruff thus argued that he is actually and legally innocent of the federal crimes underlying his conviction. By order entered February 9, 2007, the District Court dismissed Woodruff\u2019s section 2241 habeas petition. The District Court concluded that Wood-ruff had failed to demonstrate that section 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention such that he should be allowed to proceed under section 2241, noting that Woodruff had already raised a jurisdictional challenge in the section 2255 motion filed in the Northern District of California. The District Court denied Woodruffs motion for reconsideration. Woodruff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">A section 2255 motion filed in the sentencing court is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge the validity of a conviction or sentence. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974); <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249 (3d Cir.1997). A habeas petitioner can seek relief under section 2241 only if the remedy provided by section 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 249-51. A section 2255 motion is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the petitioner cannot meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of section 2255, <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002), or because the sentencing court does not grant relief, <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). We agree with the District Court\u2019s determination that Woodruffs situation does not render section 2255 inadequate or ineffective. That he has already unsuccessfully pursued a section 2255 motion does not show the inadequacy of that remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">We add that Woodruffs claim of innocence is one of legal innocence, not factual innocence; nowhere on the record before us did he assert that he did not commit the offenses underlying his conviction. Also, we note that Woodruff contended in his motion for reconsideration that the District Court\u2019s analysis was incorrect because by challenging the \u201cunconstitutional statutory procedure use[d] in carrying out the jurisdictional process,\u201d Woodruff was not actually challenging the validity of his conviction or sentence. To the extent that Woodruff relies on this basis and on his theory of legal innocence to argue that he should be allowed to proceed under section 2241, we are unpersuaded and conclude that the District Court correctly dismissed Woodruffs section 2241 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-17\">. Woodruff originally filed his section 2241 habeas petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. When he filed his petition in December 2006, Woodruff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>was an inmate of the United States Prison at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Because the proper respondent in a habeas action is the prison warden holding the petitioner in custody, <em>see Rumsfeld, v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 434\u201435, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004), the matter was transferred to the District Court for the district of Woodruffs incarceration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
