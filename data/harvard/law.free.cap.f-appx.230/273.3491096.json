He was sentenced to 240 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issue: whether the district court erred by enhancing Scippio\u2019s criminal history by adding two criminal history points under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 </em>4A1.1 (e) (2005) because the instant offense was committed within two years after his release from incarceration. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to increase Scippio\u2019s criminal history under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(e). <em>United States v. McManus, </em>23 F.3d 878, 882 (4th Cir.1994) (stating review standard for calculation of criminal history). The record is uncontroverted that Scippio was released from prison on September 28, 2003, and committed the instant offense on September 8, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">We have examined the entire record in this case, including the issue raised in Scippio\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
