The BIA further concluded that Kolami was unable to show a nexus between the collective negative conduct he alleged and any protected ground. In his appellate brief, Kolami argues only that the IJ and BIA erred in finding that the conduct was not sufficiently severe as to constitute persecution. Thus, Kolami has abandoned the issue of whether he left Albania due to persecution on account of his political opinion, as opposed to having left for economic reasons. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Because Kolami has abandoned this issue on appeal, we do not review it, and accordingly must deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-16\">. Kolami also claimed Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\u201d) relief before the IJ, but did not appeal the denial of CAT relief to the BIA and, accordingly, does not raise the issue now.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
