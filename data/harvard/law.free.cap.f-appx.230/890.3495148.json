Carson received a certif\u00edcate of appealability on whether his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective. Carson, who rejected a pre-trial plea offer of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment with actually serving 15 years, argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for (1) not informing Carson that, by proceeding to trial, Carson faced a mandatory life sentence without parole under Georgia\u2019s recidivist statute and (2) not fully informing Carson of the strength of the evidence against him. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">An ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Baldwin v. Johnson, </em>152 F.3d 1304, 1311 (11th Cir.1998). To obtain habeas relief, Carson must demonstrate that the state court\u2019s ruling \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court ... or ... was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2). This standard requires the application of federal law \u201cto be not only erroneous, but objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 124 S.Ct. 1, 4, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Here, the Georgia courts correctly identified <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), as the Supreme Court decision providing controlling legal authority for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. To prevail on such a claim, \u201cpetitioner must prove both incompetence and prejudice by showing that (1) \u2018counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u2019 and (2) \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zakrzewski v. McDonough, </em>455 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1312-13 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en </em>banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">In determining whether a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different, \u201c[i]t is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2067. Instead, \u201c[a] reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2068. If we are convinced that this element cannot be established, we do not have to discuss whether counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 2069; <em>see also Waters v. Thomas, </em>46 F.3d 1506, 1510 (11th Cir.1995) <em>(en </em>banc) (explaining that we may decline to address whether counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonable when the prejudice element of <em>Strickland </em>cannot be satisfied).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">We first address Carson\u2019s assertion that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to tell Carson that, by rejecting the State\u2019s plea offer and proceeding to trial, Carson was subject to a mandatory life sentence without parole.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a careful consideration of the record, we conclude that Carson has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that, but for his trial counsel\u2019s error, he would have accepted the State\u2019s offer to plead guilty. <em>See Coulter v. Herring, </em>60 F.3d 1499, 1504 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Carson was charged with threatening to cut Thomas Curry with a knife, striking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>him repeatedly with a piece of metal, and robbing Curry of his shoes, wallet, and money. The record shows that Carson was aware \u2014 before the expiration of the State\u2019s plea offer \u2014 that the State was having trouble locating Curry (for Curry to testify against Carson) and that Carson believed that the State had \u201cno case\u201d without Curry\u2019s testimony. The record also contains evidence that Carson believed that, even if Curry could be located, he did not want to testify against Carson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, in the light of Carson\u2019s awareness that Curry may not testify at trial, Carson has not demonstrated that a reasonable probability existed that, but for Carson\u2019s lawyer\u2019s failure to inform Carson of the mandatory sentence Carson faced if found guilty after trial, Carson would have accepted the plea offer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">We turn to Carson\u2019s claim that, but for his lawyer\u2019s failure to advise Carson of the State\u2019s evidence against him, Carson would have accepted the plea offer. Carson specifically notes that his lawyer failed to discuss with him the State\u2019s DNA evidence \u2014 that blood found on Carson\u2019s clothing worn the day that Curry was attacked contained Curry\u2019s DNA \u2014 and failed to play for Carson the recording of Carson\u2019s statement to police.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Carson had told police that the blood on his clothing was his own; and when Carson rejected the State\u2019s plea offer, he was aware that police had seized his blood-spattered clothing to perform DNA testing. In addition, Carson has not shown that he was prejudiced by his lawyer\u2019s failure to play for him the recording of Carson\u2019s own statement to the police. We agree with the district court that, even if Carson\u2019s lawyer had discussed all this evidence with Carson before the plea offer expired, the record does not show a reasonable probability that Carson would have accepted the plea offer because the availability of Curry\u2019s testimony \u2014 the strongest evidence against Carson \u2014 was still uncertain at that time. Therefore, Carson has not shown a reasonable probability that, but for his lawyer\u2019s alleged error, he would have accepted the plea offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">The evidence in the record does not support a finding that the state court\u2019s decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland </em>or that the state court\u2019s conclusions were based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. We affirm the denial of Carson\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-7\">. Because Carson had several prior felony convictions, including a conviction for armed robbery, he was subject to recidivist punishment of a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole pursuant to Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 17-10-6.1; 17-10-7. Carson\u2019s lawyer advised Carson of the possibility of receiving a life sentence; but he did not tell Carson that a life sentence was mandatory or that Carson would be ineligible for parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b920-6\">. Carson had received a letter from his nephew, who knew Curry, indicating that Curry did not want to participate in the case against Carson. Curry eventually did testify at Carson's trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b920-7\">. Carson asserts that, because he attempted to accept the State\u2019s plea offer at the start of his trial, the evidence shows that Carson would have timely accepted the plea offer if he had known earlier about the mandatory sentence. But \u2014 significantly\u2014Curry was located before the start of Carson\u2019s trial; and Carson learned about the mandatory sentence that he faced <em>after </em>he announced to the trial court that he wanted to accept the State\u2019s earlier plea offer. And we are not persuaded, based on this record, by Carson\u2019s assertions that a reasonable probability existed that he would have accepted the plea offer based on (1) the disparity between the plea offer and Carson\u2019s sentence and (2) Carson\u2019s purported awareness, as a recidivist, of the length of time\u2014 between his rejection of the plea offer and the start of his trial \u2014 for the State to locate Curry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A1AK\">.
