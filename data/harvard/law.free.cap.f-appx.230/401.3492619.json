Harris timely moved for a reduction or correction of sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a) on the basis that the applicable advisory Sentencing Guidelines range was 12-to-18 months, rather than the 24-to-30 months cited by the district court at sentencing. The district court denied the Rule 35(a) motion, citing specific reasons for its selection of a 24-month sentence. Harris appealed both the initial revocation sentence and the district court\u2019s denial of Rule 35(a) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Long after briefing was completed in this case, counsel moved to withdraw and Harris moved to proceed pro se on appeal based on Harris\u2019s desire to raise additional arguments not addressed in counsel\u2019s briefs. Harris\u2019s assertion of his right of self-representation is untimely. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902 (5th Cir.1998). Consequently, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, Harris\u2019s motion to appeal pro se, and Harris\u2019s motion to file a supplemental appellate brief are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">Harris has abandoned his appeal of the denial of his Rule 35(a) motion by failing to brief the issue. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Harris argues that the district court plainly erred by not specifically addressing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors during the sentencing hearing and that his sentence is plain error because it was based on incorrectly calculated advisory guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-16\">To establish reversible plain error, Harris must identify a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even if Harris establishes these factors, we retain the discretion whether to correct the error and will generally do so only if the error \u201caffects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>386 F.3d 632, 636 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1029, 125 S.Ct. 675, 160 L.Ed.2d 510 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-17\">The Government concedes that Harris\u2019s sentence is the result of a misapplication of the Sentencing Guidelines, but it contends that the error did not affect his substantial rights. Harris\u2019s revocation sentence was within the three-year statutory maximum sentence authorized upon revocation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1344, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>3559(a)(2), 3583(e)(3). The district court\u2019s stated reasons for denying Harris\u2019s Rule 35(a) motion make it clear that the court would not have imposed a lesser sentence but for the Guidelines miscalculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Therefore, Harris has failed to demonstrate that his revocation sentence constitutes reversible plain error. Moreover, because the 24-month sentence is within the statutory maximum, it was not unreasonable. <em>United States v. Boykin, </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. -, 2006 WL 616031 at *1 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 153, 166 L.Ed.2d 112 (2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Counsel\u2019s arguments concerning Harris\u2019s original 1997 sentence are irrelevant to the instant appeal and are therefore not addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">AFFIRMED. MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
