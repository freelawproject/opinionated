He does not challenge the calculation of his sentencing guideline range but argues that the seventy-seven-month sentence should not be afforded a presumption of reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>ableness merely because it is within the properly-calculated range. He raises the .argument to preserve it for further review in light of the granting of writs of <em>certiorari </em>in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006), and <em>Claiborne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (U.S.2006). Because an intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling prior easelaw is required to alter this court\u2019s precedent, the grant of <em>certiorari </em>in <em>Rita </em>has no impact on this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Relying on <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>429 F.3d 673, 679 (7th Cir.2005), Cruz-Jaimes contends that even if a presumption of reasonableness applies to his sentence, the presumption is overcome and the sentence is unreasonable where, as here, the district court \u201cis presented with nonfrivolous grounds for a below-Guidelines sentence that the court simply passed over in silence.\u201d This argument is unpersuasive and unsupported by the record. Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). When the district court imposes a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, we \u201cwill give great deference to that sentence\u201d and \u201cwill infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519-20 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, little explanation is needed when a court imposes a sentence within the advisory range. <em>United States v. Reinhart, </em>442 F.3d 857, 861 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 131, 166 L.Ed.2d 96 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Our review of the record reveals that the district court considered Cruz-Jaimes\u2019s mitigation arguments, even though the sentencing guidelines discourage the consideration of family responsibilities in deciding whether a departure is warranted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.6 and the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Cruz-Jaimes has therefore failed to demonstrate that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">Cruz-Jaimes challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2). His argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in which the Court held that treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors in \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) is constitutional. Although Cruz-Jaimes suggests that a majority of the Supreme Court would now consider <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to be incorrectly decided in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), \u201c[t]his court has repeatedly rejected arguments like the one made by [Vasquez] and has held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding despite <em>Apprendi.\u201d United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). <em>See Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006). Cruz-Jaimes acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed, but he raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
