Based on an offense level of 10 and a criminal history category of I, Gonzalez\u2019s guideline range of imprisonment was 6 to 12 months. The district court determined that the Guidelines did not adequately reflect the nature of Gonzalez\u2019s crime or her prior criminal activity. Using an offense level of 10 and a criminal history category of VI, the district court sentenced Gonzalez to 30 months of imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that it was imposing an upward departure. In its statement of reasons, however, the district court characterized the sentence as a non-guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">Gonzalez contends that the sentence is unreasonable. She argues that the district court failed to follow the appropriate methodology for upwardly departing. She also argues that the district court erred by failing to properly consider the objective of avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparity-</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">Gonzalez did not make these arguments in the district court. Her arguments may therefore be subject to plain error review, <em>see United States v. Castillo, </em>430 F.3d 230, 241-42 (5th Cir.2005), rather than the reasonableness standard that governs sentences post-United <em>States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). We need not decide which standard applies, however, because we conclude that Gonzalez\u2019s sentence was proper under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">The district court relied upon 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), and (a)(2)(B) at the sentencing hearing and in the statement of reasons. At the sentencing hearing, where the district court stated that it was imposing an upward departure, the district court determined that the Guidelines did not adequately reflect the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. The district court analyzed the facts, the nature and circumstances of the offense, Gonzalez\u2019s history and characteristics, and an inability of the system to deter Gonzalez\u2019s criminal conduct. The district court stated that it was considering the other criminal categories and provided explicit reasons for using category VI rather than category I. Although in a \u201cvery narrow class of cases\u201d more detail may be required, <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d 658, 663 (5th Cir.1993) (en banc), this court has affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>significant departures in other cases where explicit consideration was not given to each criminal history category. <em>See United States v. Ashburn, </em>38 F.3d 803, 809 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc); <em>United States v. McKenzie, </em>991 F.2d 203, 204-06 (5th Cir.1993). Because the basis for the district court\u2019s ruling is thoroughly stated in the record, Gonzalez\u2019s case does not fall into the narrow range of cases where explicit detail is required regarding the district court\u2019s rejection of the intervening criminal history categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Gonzalez also argues in her attack on the upward departure that the district court failed properly to consider the objective of avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparity. As Gonzalez fails to explain why her sentence is disparate from others with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6), she has failed to establish that the district court erred in its consideration of this sentencing factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The district court\u2019s reasons for departing advance the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and are justified by the facts of this case. The departure therefore resulted in a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">To the extent Gonzalez\u2019s sentence is considered a non-guideline sentence as indicated by the statement of reasons, the district court adequately complied with the procedure set forth in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, the district court\u2019s rationale was explicit enough for this court to determine that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the sentence and that the district court adequately balanced the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See id. </em>at 707-08. Because \u201cthe court\u2019s findings in support of the upward variance sufficiently demonstrate that the substance of the sentence is reasonable under \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 710, the district court did not err in the imposition of a non-guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Because Gonzalez\u2019s sentence was reasonable either as a Guideline sentence with an upward departure or as a non-Guideline sentence, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
