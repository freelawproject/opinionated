The IJ denied their application, finding that Petitioners were statutorily ineligible to apply for asylum because their application was untimely, and that Martin\u2019s testimony was not credible. On May 31, 2006, the BIA adopted and affirmed the decision of the IJ. Petitioners filed a motion to reconsider and reopen with the BIA, which the BIA denied. Martin and his wife now petition us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-16\">Reviewing the record, we cannot conclude that the BIA abused its discretion when it denied Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider, because the motion merely reiterated the evidence and arguments previously presented to the BIA. 8 C.F.R \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6). We also cannot conclude that the BIA abused its discretion when it denied Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen because the motion failed to include evidence that was \u201cmaterial and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-13\">. Petitioners also argue within their petition that the BIA erred in its May 31, 2006 order affirming the IJ\u2019s order denying asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims. Because Petitioners did not file an appeal of the BIA\u2019s May 31, 2006 Order within the requisite time, we have no jurisdiction to consider these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
