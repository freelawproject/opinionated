On appeal, Killian contends the district court erred in its admission of certain evidence. Decisions regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence are left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>United States v. Russell, </em>971 F.2d 1098, 1104 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Police apprehended Killian after encountering him at a car dealership where he was in the process of removing the wheels and tires from a car on the lot. Killian\u2019s girlfriend testified at trial that she assisted Killian\u2019s attempt to steal the tires, that the couple had already twice unsuccessfully attempted to steal tires earlier in the evening, including once at the dealership, because they possessed the wrong tools, and had returned to his sister\u2019s trailer to get the correct tools. While at the trailer, Killian obtained a gun and stated that \u201cif it didn\u2019t work this time that he was going to kick in people\u2019s doors.\u201d The couple then returned to the car dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Killian contends that admission of evidence that he was attempting to steal tires, as well as the testimony that he \u201cwas going to kick in people\u2019s doors,\u201d constituted error under Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b). Rule 403 excludes relevant evidence whose probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Rule 404(b) encompasses this same restriction while also excluding evidence of prior bad acts offered to prove a defendant\u2019s character. Evidence of prior bad acts may be admitted under the rule, however, if offered to prove \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Rule 404(b) also does not exclude evidence of prior bad acts that are intrinsic to the criminal act charged. \u201cOther criminal acts are intrinsic when they are inextricably intertwined or both acts are part of a single criminal episode or the other acts were necessary preliminaries to the crime charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Chin, </em>83 F.3d 83, 88 (4th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>995 F.2d 1006, 1007 (10th Cir.1993)) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s admission of the evidence at issue. The evidence of Killian\u2019s actions in preparation to steal tires was intrinsic to the crime of possession of a firearm. Clearly, Killian retrieved the firearm for the purpose of facilitating his plan to steal tires. Moreover, the evidence was not overly prejudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>cial as the evidence that Killian attempted to steal tires did not \u201cinvolve conduct any more sensational or disturbing than the crimes with which he was charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>53 F.3d 631, 637 (4th Cir.1995). Finally, we find the evidence at issue to be relevant, necessary, rehable, and probative in accordance with the four-part test for admissibility of 404(b) evidence set forth in <em>United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 997 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately expressed in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
