On appeal, Singh argues that the BIA erred by presuming effective service of the hearing notice without providing Singh with the opportunity to rebut the presumption. He also contends that the IJ erred by applying the standard for service by certified mail, which requires a showing of substantial and probative evidence to rebut the presumption of delivery, rather than the lower standard for service by regular mail, which Singh says his proffered evidence, including his own affidavit, satisfied. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s rulings, so we review the BIA\u2019s order. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). Our review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of the exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">In removal proceedings, \u201cwritten notice ... shall be given in person to the alien (or, if personal service is not practicable, through service by mail to the alien ...).\u201d INA \u00a7 239(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1). The notice must specify, among other things, the following: (1) the alien\u2019s responsibility to provide a valid address and immediately notify the government of any changes, (2) the consequences of failing to appear at removal proceedings, and (3) the time and place at which the proceeding will be held. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1229(a)(l)(F)(i)-(iii), (G)(i)-(ii). If there is a change in the time or place of the removal proceedings, then written notice must be provided to the alien specifying the new time and place of the proceedings and the consequences of failing to attend. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">If, after written notice has been provided as required under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1) and (2), an alien fails to appear as directed, then he \u201cshall be ordered removed in absentia if [the government] establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(b)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). \u201cThe written notice by the Attorney General shall be considered sufficient ... if provided at the most recent address provided under section 1229(a)(1)(F) of this title.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The INA further provides that \u201c[s]ervice by mail ... shall be sufficient if there is proof of attempted delivery to the last address provided by the alien.\u201d INA \u00a7 239(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(c). We have found due process satisfied if the method of notice is conducted \u201cin a manner <em>reasonably calculated </em>to ensure that notice reaches the alien.\u201d <em>Dominguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>284 F.3d 1258, 1259 (11th Cir.2002) (emphasis added). Notice sent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>the alien at his most recent address provided is sufficient notice. <em>Id. </em>at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">According to well-settled administrative law, a removal hearing can proceed without the alien\u2019s attendance, despite that written notice was not delivered, if delivery was attempted at the last address provided by the alien under INA \u00a7 239(a)(1)(F). <em>In re G-Y-R-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 181, 186-87 (BIA 2001)(en banc). The BIA has held that an address qualifies as an INA \u00a7 239(a)(1)(F) address only if the alien has been informed of his statutory address obligations and the consequences of failing to provide a current address. <em>Id. </em>at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen. Our review of the record reveals that Singh received personal service of his Notice to Appear and the original hearing notice. The Notice to Appear explained both Singh\u2019s responsibilities and the consequences of failing to attend his hearing. Moreover, the date and time of Singh\u2019s hearing and the consequences of failing to attend were explained in both English and Punjabi. The details of Singh\u2019s hearing changed and written notice was sent to the most recent address that Singh had supplied. Quite simply, the written notice sent to the address Singh last provided under INA \u00a7 239(a)(1)(F) constituted sufficient notice. We are unpersuaded by Singh\u2019s arguments that the IJ used an improper standard to evaluate his evidence, and that the BIA failed to address the IJ\u2019s error. Our review concerns the BIA decision and, on this record, it is clear that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by finding that proper notice was sent because it was sent to the last address provided by Singh after he had been advised of his address obligations. There is no indication that the BIA applied an erroneous presumption as to the service on Singh.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-6\">. We are unpersuaded by Singh\u2019s additional suggestion that he <em>never </em>provided immigration officials with an address. If he never provided an address, despite having notice of his obligations to do so, our conclusion would be the same because notice may be presumed and a removal hearing may proceed without the alien\u2019s presence where he has not complied with his address-filing requirements. Notably, <em>no </em>written notice is required if the alien fails to provide the address required under \u00a7 239(a)(1)(F) of the INA. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(b)(5)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
