For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">On January 5, 2006, Castleberry, proceeding pro se, filed a complaint in federal district court against various CitiFinancial entities (\u201cCitiFinancial\u201d). Castleberry\u2019s complaint concerned the pending foreclosure by CitiFinancial on some property owned by Castleberry. The complaint itself was thirty-five pages long, referenced cases from Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Texas, and various bankruptcy courts, cited to statutes out of Florida and Texas, and appeared to seek relief under the common law, as well a variety of federal statutes and regulations. On the same day he filed his complaint, Castleberry requested a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) to prevent the foreclosure of his property and his subsequent eviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Later that day, the district court held a telephone conference to consider the TRO. As a result of the conference, the district court denied Castleberry\u2019s request for a TRO, dismissed all CitiFinancial defendants except for CitiFinancial Mortgage Company, Inc. and CitiFinancial, Inc., and gave CitiFinancial twenty days to move for summary judgment. By separate order on January 6, 2006, the district court also ordered Castleberry to file an amended complaint in keeping with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The order stated that this was to enable the district court to understand the precise nature of Castleberry\u2019s claims. The order also cautioned Castleberry under Rule 11 to refrain from making frivolous claims and to limit his claims to the two remaining defendants. Relevant to this appeal, the order stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-13\">The court ORDERS that by 2:00 p.m. on January 17, 2006, [Castleberry] file with the clerk an amended complaint</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-14\">The court cautions [Castleberry] that if he fails to strictly comply with the directives of this order he is at risk that his complaint will be dismissed without further notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">Castleberry did not file an amended complaint on January 17, 2006, so on January 18, 2006, the district court dismissed Castleberry\u2019s claims without prejudice for failing to comply with the district court\u2019s January 6 order. The district court also entered a final judgment to that effect. Castleberry contends that he mailed his amended complaint on January 17, 2006, \u201cpostmarked January 18, 2006,\u201d and that it was received by the clerk\u2019s office on January 20, 2006. The record reflects that the clerk\u2019s office did receive the amended complaint on January 20, but refused to file it, citing the district court\u2019s earlier order, and returned it to Castleberry.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-16\">On February 16, 2006, Castleberry filed a motion for reconsideration based on Rules 59 and 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court denied Castleberry\u2019s motion on February 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>2006. Castleberry then filed his appeal on March 16, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">CitiFinancial contends that, while this court has jurisdiction to consider the district court\u2019s February 17 order on Castleberry\u2019s motion for reconsideration, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s January 18 order and judgment because they were not timely appealed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Rule 4(a)(1)(A) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure states that a notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered. This time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>See Smith v. Smith, </em>145 F.3d 335, 339 (5th Cir.1998). The thirty-day period may be extended, however, by a timely motion to alter or amend judgment under Rule 59 or a motion for relief under Rule 60 filed within ten days of the judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Here, Castleberry filed a motion for reconsideration on February 16, 2006, premised on Rules 59 and 60. However, because this motion was not filed within ten days of the district court\u2019s judgment on January 18, it was untimely under Rule 59(e). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) (requiring motions to alter or amend judgment to be filed within ten days of the judgment). Similarly, treating Castleberry\u2019s motion for reconsideration as a motion under Rule 60 affords him no relief, since a Rule 60 motion must also be filed within ten days of the judgment in order to extend the time to appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi). Therefore, Castleberry\u2019s time to appeal the January 18 order and judgment was not extended, and his appeal on March 16, 2006, was untimely as to those actions by the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">Castleberry\u2019s appeal was timely, however, with respect to the district court\u2019s order of February 17 denying Castleberry\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and the court will now consider the merits of Castleberry\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">A <em>Rule 59</em></p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">Castleberry\u2019s motion for reconsideration was premised, in part, on Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which permits a party to file a motion to alter or amend a judgment. A party has ten days from the entry of judgment to file post-trial motions under Rule 59. Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e); <em>U.S. Leather, Inc. v. H &amp; </em>W <em>P\u2019ship, </em>60 F.3d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1995). This ten-day period is jurisdictional and may not be extended by agreement of the parties or a rule of the district court. <em>U.S. Leather, </em>60 F.3d at 225. Here, Castleberry filed his motion for reconsideration under Rule 59 on February 16, 2006, twenty-nine days after the district court\u2019s entry of judgment and well outside the ten-day period specified in Rule 59. Therefore, the district court lacked jurisdiction to grant relief under Rule 59 and did not err in denying Castleberry the relief he requested under Rule 59. <em>See Vincent v. Consol. Operating Co., </em>17 F.3d 782, 785 (5th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (\u201cThe district court is powerless to rule on an untimely Rule 59(e) motion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">\n<em>B. Rule 60</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">Castleberry\u2019s motion for reconsideration also claimed relief by way of Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>review the denial of a motion for relief under Rule 60(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Patterson v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>335 F.3d 476, 486 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">1. Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u201cThe purpose of Rule 60(b) is to balance the principle of finality of a judgment with the interest of the court in seeing that justice is done in light of all the facts.\u201d <em>Hesling v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>396 F.3d 632, 638 (5th Cir.2005). While this rule is to be liberally construed to do substantial justice, a court should not lightly reopen a final judgment. <em>See Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi </em>635 F.2d 396, 401 (5th Cir.1981). Pursuant to Rule 60, a court may relieve a party from a final judgment for mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1). Rule 60(b)(6) also permits relief for \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d Although Castleberry\u2019s motion for reconsideration did not specify clauses (1) and (6) of Rule 60(b), these are the only two clauses in Rule 60(b) that possibly pertain to Castleberry\u2019s arguments. Therefore, we consider Castleberry\u2019s arguments under Rule 60(b)(1) and 60(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">With respect to Rule 60(b)(1), this court has held that it is not an abuse of discretion to deny relief when the proffered justification is the \u201cinadvertent mistake\u201d of counsel. <em>Edward H. Bohlin Co. v. Banning Co., </em>6 F.3d 350, 356-57 (5th Cir.1993). Indeed, \u201c[g]ross carelessness, ignorance of the rules, or ignorance of the law\u201d are insufficient bases for Rule 60(b)(1) relief. <em>Id. </em>at 357. Further, we have stated that it would be an abuse of discretion for a district court to grant relief on the sole basis of counsel\u2019s carelessness with or misapprehension of the laws. <em>Id. </em>To the extent the \u201cmistake\u201d is one by the court, we have held that a plaintiffs claim of \u201cmere legal error\u201d does not warrant Rule 60(b)(1) relief. <em>McMillan v. MBank Fort Worth, N.A., </em>4 F.3d 362, 367 (5th Cir.1993). In such a situation, a plaintiff is to pursue an appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Rule 60(b)(6) authorizes relief for any reason other than those listed in clauses (b)(1) through (b)(5). <em>U.S. ex rel. Garibaldi v. Orleans Parish Sch. Bd., </em>397 F.3d 334, 337 (5th Cir.2005). Relief, however, is appropriate only in an \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d or when \u201cextraordinary circumstances are present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). With these standards in mind, we turn to Castleberry\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Castleberry\u2019s main argument on appeal is that the district court should have applied Rule 6(e) to extend his time for filing his amended complaint to January 20, 2006. Rule 6(e) states that \u201c[w]henever a party must or may act within a prescribed period after service\u201d and service is made by mailing, \u201c3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire ....\u201d It is unclear whether Castle-berry believes that three days should be added because the district court\u2019s January 6 order was mailed to him or because he mailed his amended complaint to the district court. Either argument misconstrues the effect of Rule 6(e) in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">First, the fact that the district court\u2019s January 6 order was mailed to Castleberry does not entitle him to an extra three days to respond. A distinction must be made between orders that require actions within a certain time after service \u2014 for example \u201cwithin thirty days after service\u201d \u2014 and orders that set specific deadlines \u2014 such as \u201cJanuary 17, 2006.\u201d In the case of the first example, three days would be added by Rule 6(e) because action was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201cwithin a prescribed time after service.\u201d In the second example, three days are not added because there is a set deadline with a specific date. Here, Castleberry\u2019s amended complaint was not due a period of days \u201cafter service\u201d of the district court\u2019s order. Rather, the amended complaint was explicitly due on January 17, 2006. Consequently, Rule 6(e) does not make Castleberry\u2019s amended complaint timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Second, to the extent that Castleberry contends that Rule 6(e) applies because he mailed his amended complaint to the court, his argument is also without merit. The specific wording of the January 6 order required Castleberry to <em>file </em>his complaint by January 17\u2014not mail it. Rule 5(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure defines \u201cfiling\u201d as actually filing the papers with the clerk of the court. Castleberry failed to file his amended complaint with the clerk by January 17, 2006, and, as a result, did not meet the district court\u2019s deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Given the requirements for relief under Rule 60(b)(1) and (b)(6), Castleberry\u2019s misunderstanding of the effect of Rule 6(e) does not provide a sufficient basis for relief. <em>See Midwest Employers Cas. Co. v. Williams, </em>161 F.3d 877, 880 (5th Cir.1998) (stating counsel\u2019s confusion regarding Rule 6(e) did not constitute \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d). Although Castleberry is proceeding pro se, the district court\u2019s order could not have been clearer as to when he was required to file his amended complaint with the clerk\u2019s office. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Castleberry\u2019s motion for reconsideration on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Castleberry\u2019s other argument is essentially an appeal to the comb\u2019s sense of justice based on Castleberry\u2019s good faith in attempting to comply with the district court\u2019s order. This is insufficient to entitle Castleberry to Rule 60(b) relief. As a result, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Castle-berry\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">For the reasons above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\">. This untimeliness precludes us from considering Castleberry's arguments that the district court's January 6 order (which formed the basis of the January 18 order) was unwarranted and that the order did not give him a sufficient amount of time to respond.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
