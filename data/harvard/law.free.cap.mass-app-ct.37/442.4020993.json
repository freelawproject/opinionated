(Formerly there were additional parties plaintiff and defendant, but they have dropped out of the litigation.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b474-14\">Kaplan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8c\">The plaintiffs, Credit Data of Central Massachusetts, Inc. (CDCM), and Credit Data of Rhode Island, Inc. (CDRI), sued the defendant, TRW, Inc. (TRW), alleging breach of contract and related wrongs. The action was bifurcated and was tried, nonjury, on the issue of liability alone. The judge found for the defendant. We reverse and remit the case for trial on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">The plaintiffs were local credit reporting agencies which collected credit information about consumers and sold the information to any who requested it. They were affiliated with the defendant TRW, a national credit reporting agency. Like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>other national organizations, TRW attempts to offer comprehensive national credit information to inquirers and obtains it through its affiliation by contract with local agencies in all parts of the country and through its own direct efforts of acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">When in 1988 TRW was consummating a merger with Chilton Corporation, a competing national credit organization, the United States Justice Department raised questions about the merged company\u2019s capacity to stifle competition in stated areas. Accordingly, TRW entered a consent decree agreeing to sever its ties with certain affiliates. CDCM and CDRI were among the affiliates to be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The termination was governed by the following language in their contracts with TRW (the text is from the CDCM agreement which parallels that in the CDRI agreement):</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\n<em>\u201cRight to the Data Base</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201c(a) <em>Ownership-. </em>CDCM\u2019s Data Base shall be the property of CDCM subject to the rights of TRW set forth in this Agreement. CDCM may, at its request, upon any termination of this Agreement . . . secure possession of CDCM\u2019s Data Base as then stored with TRW, either printed out in credit report form or in a computer-readable form as may be mutually agreed by the parties .... Following such transfer of CDCM\u2019s Data Base to CDCM, TRW shall have no further right, title, claim or interest in or to any of the information obtained in CDCM\u2019s Data Base, and TRW shall not make any further direct or indirect use of such information. However, nothing shall prevent TRW from obtaining such information directly from the public record or third parties, including CDCM subscribers.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Earlier in the agreement, CDCM\u2019s \u201cdatabase\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\"><em>\u201cCDCM\u2019s Data </em>Base: All credit information and records stored in the TRW System, no matter how or by whom collected, having a current address within CDCM\u2019s Zip Code Area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">When the plaintiffs received notice of termination, they decided to go out of business: they exercised their right to secure possession of their databases by asking TRW to transfer them to the Credit Bureau, Inc. of Georgia (CBI), another national credit reporting organization. The plaintiffs had agreed to sell their databases to CBI, the sale price to be a multiple \u2014 250% \u2014 of the revenues (as defined) generated by the databases in CBI\u2019s hands over the course of a year. The plaintiffs also requested that TRW temporarily maintain the capacity to recall the databases so that, if there were any problems in the transfer to CBI, a back-up copy would be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">On August 16, 1989, Richard Downing, Sr., president of CDCM, wrote to Robert Petrowski of TRW: \u201cNotwithstanding your keeping a record of the information on site until we notify you to delete it,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> all of the records and information should, per our contracts with you, be removed from access in the TRW system as of the shutdown Saturday night 8/19/89 and all subscriber numbers for these records and information are to be invalidated at the same time. We would appreciate a confirmatory memorandum for our files from you to that effect.\u201d Responding for Petrowski, Phillip Hagedorn of TRW wrote the next day: \u201cThe shutdown will be Sunday Night 8/20/89 and as of that date your Framingham [i.e., CDCM] and Rhode Island [CDRI] information will no longer be available to TRW users.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">It is agreed that TRW followed its contractual obligation to give possession of the plaintiffs\u2019 databases to the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>(i.e., their designee, CBI). TRW transferred a computer tape containing the plaintiffs\u2019 databases to CBI, as instructed, and no problems were reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">But regarding TRW\u2019s other post-termination obligation, namely, to delete and make no further use of the plaintiff\u2019s databases, directly or indirectly,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is clear that TRW was noncompliant: it did not delete the databases from its system; rather, large portions of these databases remained in the system, and TRW continued to use them.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">It is needless for purposes of the present appeal to go into the full technological detail of what TRW did. It will suffice to say, in more general terms: First, TRW retained in its system and used the portions of the plaintiffs\u2019 databases containing information that TRW claims it could secure with ease from other sources. The claimed availability of this material to TRW followed from the fact that various companies (\u201cgrantors\u201d or \u201csubscribers\u201d) that rendered credit information about consumers to the plaintiffs also rendered the like information to other credit agencies as well (\u201cjoint preamble\u201d cases), and TRW claimed it had ready access to those agencies or some of them through affiliation or other relationship.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, TRW deleted the portions of the plaintiffs\u2019 databases with information not thus obtainable by TRW from other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The portions of the plaintiffs\u2019 databases that TRW did not delete but rather retained in its system were certainly substantial, although one\u2019s perception of the matter may be colored by the unit of measurement applied. TRW would say that the information from 850 of the approximately 1,017 subscribers to the plaintiffs\u2019 agencies was deleted. By contrast, the plaintiffs would say that many subscribers counted among the 850 contributed little information, so that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>bulk, perhaps only 10% of the total information on the plaintiffs\u2019 databases was deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">On October 4, 1989, the plaintiffs commenced the present action in Middlesex Superior Court against TRW alleging breach of contract as the principal count.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The action was tried, nonjury, on the issue of liability. The judge held for TRW, filing findings of fact, rulings of law, and order for judgment that tracked almost word for word the findings, etc., prepared by TRW. We reverse, holding that liability and breach have been sufficiently shown, with damages remaining to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">As already noted, the quoted language of the controlling agreement is plain enough in requiring that the plaintiffs\u2019 databases be wholly deleted. There has been some effort by TRW, reflected, unsurprisingly, in the judge\u2019s findings, to argue that the agreement really meant that only the information exclusively owned by the plaintiffs should be deleted, and the \u201cjoint preamble\u201d materials were not so owned. \u201cOwnership\u201d as applied to credit information in the present context is a slippery conception to begin with; in any event, the agreement was not written in such terms, as is obvious from the very definition of what constituted the plaintiffs\u2019 databases, quoted above. And compare note 5 above.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">TRW attempts to justify its failure to delete so much of the databases on the ground that it would be senseless for TRW to delete when it could replace or restore the information from other databases and then use it. It is not established by actual practice just how readily or effectively or completely TRW could accomplish the replacement, and one can surmise that there must have been an advantage to TRW in retaining those portions of the plaintiffs\u2019 databases rather than relying on a process of replacement. But quite apart from such considerations, the agreement required the deletion of the whole of the plaintiffs\u2019 databases and forbade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>TRW to retain and use any part of them \u2014 provisions emphasized by the specific permission accorded TRW, if it wanted information from any of the plaintiffs\u2019 past subscribers, to go to them and collect from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">TRW makes a labored argument under the title of estoppel \u2014that it was at the plaintiffs\u2019 instance that it kept information from the plaintiffs\u2019 databases on line. This refers to the safeguard requested by the plaintiffs to deal with a possibility that the transfer to CBI might misfire. The transfer was achieved successfully, and full deletion was then required. There was no room for anything resembling an estoppel against the plaintiffs\u2019 asserting their contractual rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Lastly, TRW says the damages accruing in any event to the plaintiffs would be insignificant. Therefore, TRW contends, any breach must be held \u201cnot material\u201d and hence not actionable. Further, TRW says a suit bound to result in no more than nominal damages should be dismissed, at least according to California law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The answer to all this is that the present action was purposely bifurcated, and only liability has been tried. It would be foolhardy and quite wrong to make any attempt to forecast on the present record what damages could be shown to follow from the breach. By way of example, we do not know the bearing of the breach on the business done by CBI which would be reflected in revenues earned by CBI and thus in the calculation of payments due by CBI to the plaintiffs; we do not know the value of the benefit that TRW may have conferred on itself by its retention and use of the undeleted information. (We add, incidentally, that the \u201cmateriality\u201d of a breach affects the counter-contracting party\u2019s right to refuse its own performance; it does not itself affect the latter\u2019s right to maintain an action for damages. See <em>Superior Motels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rinn Motor Hotels, Inc., </em>195 Cal. App. 3d 1032, 1051 [1987]; Restatement [Second] of Contracts \u00a7 346[1] &amp; comment a [1981].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\"><em>Other counts. </em>Added to the count for breach of contract were counts that sounded in conversion of trade secrets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of G. L. c. 93A. Trade secrets were not shown to be involved; any claim as to good faith, etc., was engrossed by the claim of breach of contract; and we think there was not enough \u201crascality\u201d (as distinguished from poor advice or judgment) on the part of TRW, see <em>Levings </em>v. <em>Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 498, 504 (1979), to base a recovery under c. 93A, \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">We treat with some details in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"><em>Regarding the judge\u2019s findings. </em>We believe a California court would say with us that the agreement calls unambiguously, as matter of law, for the deletion of the plaintiffs\u2019 databases without an exception for \u201cjoint preamble\u201d cases. It is not apparent whether the judge\u2019s findings dispute this as a textual reading; to the extent that they may do so they are erroneous in point of law and deserve no deference. <em>Simon </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>Weymouth Agric. &amp; Industrial Soc., </em>389 Mass. 146, 148-149 (1983); <em>PJNR, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Real Estate, </em>230 Cal. App. 3d 1176, 1179 (1991). The findings for the most part try to suggest extraneous excuses for TRW\u2019s disregard of the contract terms: \u201csenselessness,\u201d lack of actual damages. These purported excuses either are negated by the contract terms themselves or attempt erroneously to anticipate the hearing on damages. As to estoppel, the facts needed for such a defense are absent, so it may be said that the judge\u2019s findings (express or implicit) are clearly erroneous. See <em>Turnpike Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Newbury Group, Inc., </em>413 Mass. 119, 123 (1992); <em>Highland </em>v. <em>San Bernardino, 4 </em>Cal. App. 4th 1174, 1193 (1992).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (We need not add the usual strictures against wholesale adoption of a party\u2019s proposed findings, see <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>391 Mass. 517, 524 [1984], or mention the lesser weight or deference attaching to those findings on appellate review. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawkesworth, </em>405 Mass. 664, 670 [1989], citing <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>381 Mass. 234, 237 [1980].)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the action is remanded for trial on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\">While the text speaks of CDCM\u2019s database being the property of CDCM \u201csubject to the rights of TRW set forth in this Agreement,\u201d we are not referred to any pertinent language of the Agreement besides that in the present quotation and that which follows.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\">This introductory language referred to the temporary retention of databases until the transfer to CBI was accomplished satisfactorily.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Although the contract speaks in terms of TRW\u2019s no longer making use of the plaintiffs\u2019 credit information, the parties equate this requirement with the deletion of the information from TRW\u2019s computer system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Some other subscribers signed \u201creleases\u201d to TRW or an affiliate purporting to give permission to TRW to retain their information on TRW\u2019s system, but this could not absolve TRW from its contractual obligation to the plaintiffs to delete the databases in their entirety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Initially the plaintiffs brought suit in Federal court, but this was abandoned when it appeared that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking. TRW (and other then defendants) sought to remove the present action to Federal court, but this failed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The agreement with TRW provided that it be construed according to California law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Also note the question whether alleged misdeeds \u201coccurred primarily and substantially\u201d in Massachusetts, a requirement for recovery under \u00a7 11. See <em>Makino, U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Metlife Capital Credit Corp., 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 302, 308-309 &amp; n.4 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\">(1) Copying from a comment by TRW, the judge wrote confusingly that \u201c[tjhe plaintiffs\u2019 database simply did not exist as defined in the contract.\u201d All this can mean is that the information from the plaintiffs\u2019 databases, when taken into TRW\u2019s system, was not organized geographically. But it is not claimed that this disabled TRW from deleting the information as called for by the agreement, and in fact TRW did delete part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">(2) To make up for the fact that on TRW\u2019s system credit information is not organized by individual consumer, TRW uses an \u201cident\u201d device \u2014 a kind of index \u2014 by which it can locate all the information pertaining to any individual. TRW argued that the agreement did not require it to delete the idents because they are not credit information and so not part of the plaintiffs\u2019 databases. Idents were created automatically when particular information went into the TRW system and, it seems, would disappear when this information was deleted \u2014 like the withdrawal of an entry in an index when the referenced material is withdrawn. Thus the problem resolves itself as the basic question of the extent of the required deletion of information is resolved. At all events idents are a detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">(3) TRW contends that it was not required to delete \u201cconsumer dispute statements.\u201d These are statements that individuals are entitled by law to have entered in relation to items in their credit history when they dispute the items. TRW has deleted the consumer dispute statement when it has deleted the particular item. So again the problem is connected to the basic problem and is no more than a detail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">As to the weight to be given findings on appellate review, it may be that Massachusetts standards should apply.
