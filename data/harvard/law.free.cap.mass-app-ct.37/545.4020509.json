Her sudden disappearance sparked an extensive police investigation, including questioning of the defendant, the last person known to have seen her alive. Articles in mystery magazines provoked national speculation; offers of rewards yielded no concrete leads. In spite of all the interest, no one ever deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>mined what happened. Etta Riel was never seen or heard from again.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Nearly sixty years later, her daughter renewed the issue of paternity by filing an action against the defendant, in the Probate and Family Court, this time under G. L. c. 209C.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a hearing, a judge dismissed the action with prejudice, and the plaintiff has appealed from the judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The judge read the statute as a prophylactic measure designed to protect minor children born out of wedlock and to provide them with some means of support and not primarily as an apparatus for a declaration of paternity. He found the lengthy prorogation of proceedings prejudiced the defendant because witnesses were in all likelihood unavailable. The judge factored into the equation the defendant\u2019s precarious health and the general uncertainty of defending a case concerning events that had receded over the years. In the end, he ruled that no sound policy reason would permit the plaintiffs action to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">For their part, the parties focus their debate on the meaning of the word \u201cchild\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 1 of the statute. The plaintiff holds that the Legislature intended \u201cchild\u201d to mean \u201cson or daughter of any age.\u201d As support, she cites the absence of a statute of limitations for actions brought under G. L. c. 209C. The plaintiff also contends that the precatory language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, declaiming \u201cthe purpose of this chapter [is] ... for such children . . . to have an adjudication of their paternity,\u201d and that, according to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 720 (1984), the \u201cstatutory language is the principal source of insight into Legislative purpose.\u201d The defendant, on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>hand, argues that the ordinary dictionary definition of the word child means being under legal age.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Section 1 of c. 209C, inserted by St. 1986, c. 310, \u00a7 16, provides in relevant part: \u201cIt is the purpose of this chapter to establish a means for . . . children either to be acknowledged by their parents voluntarily or, <em>on complaint by one or the other of their parents or by such other person or agency as is authorized to file a </em>complaint... to have an adjudication of their paternity, to have an order for their support and to have a declaration relative to their custody or visitation rights ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Where the literal text of a statute is plain and does not lead to an absurd result, we need not divine legislative intent. See <em>Salem Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 323, 324 (1988). Contrast <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562, 570 (1979). The clarity of the quoted portion of \u00a7 1 is, however, cast in doubt by the immediately following \u00a7 2 which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">\u201cPaternity may be established by the registration of an acknowledgment of parentage executed by both parents and filed with the court pursuant to section eleven or <em>pursuant to an action to establish paternity filed pursuant to this chapter. </em>Actions to establish support obligations or for custody or visitation rights may also be filed pursuant to this chapter\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">From the language of \u00a7 2, and its context, it seems to permit a separate action to establish paternity not associated with support obligations or custody. That construction would support the plaintiffs position. \u201c [O] rdinarily the qualification of a later clause upon an earlier one is to be expected.\u201d 1A Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 20.7, at 89 (5th ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>1993). But in the instant case, as we have observed, \u00a7 1 delineates those persons entitled to bring a complaint on behalf of a child \u2014 the parents or a court appointed representative. From the language of c. 209C and its context, it appears that the authority so conferred is exclusive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Chapter 310 of the Acts of 1986, itself, was entitled \u201cAn Act Improving the Collection of Child Support in the Commonwealth.\u201d That act made a variety of changes relating to child support guidelines and authorized a host of collection procedures to insure that support orders were enforced. The title to a statute may be considered in its construction. <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 352-353 (1973). <em>Trustees of Boston Univ. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Brookline, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 325, 329 n.6 (1981). We may conclude from the child support and revenue contexts that the scope of c. 209C does not encompass the paternity claim of an emancipated adult born out of wedlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Even if we conclude the Probate Court could decide the issues under its general equity jurisdiction (G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6), see <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 590, 592-593 (1987), and cases cited, the plaintiffs claim would be barred by the defense of laches. See <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Finkelstone, </em>206 Mass. 28, 36 (1910); <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Chioda, </em>317 Mass. 446, 452 (1945). The judge\u2019s findings indicated that after the passage of so many years, the evidence is \u201cstale\u201d and the defendant physically infirm. Nothing in the record contradicts those findings. See <em>Hanrihan </em>v. <em>Hanrihan, </em>342 Mass. 559, 567 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>(1961), and cases cited. In view of these circumstances, we need not consider whether and to what extent the interest of an unemancipated adult born out of wedlock who seeks to establish paternity might be protected under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We note that the plaintiff is not without remedy. She may seek a declaratory judgment to establish the defendant\u2019s paternity for purposes of asserting inheritance rights, a proposition not raised in her appeal. As suggested by the court in <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663, 670 (1980), the Legislature, by St. 1980, c. 396, \u00a7 7, amended G. L. c. 190, \u00a7 7, to permit a person to establish paternity by bringing an action \u201cagainst executors and administrators\u201d of the putative father.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-15\">Trior to its repeal by St. 1977, c. 848, \u00a7 7, G.
