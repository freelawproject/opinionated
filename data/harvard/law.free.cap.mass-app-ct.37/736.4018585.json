As the defendant\u2019s trial counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not object to the introduction of the testimony now challenged, we must consider whether the testimony, if erroneously admitted, created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Freeman, 352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 10, 21 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">1. <em>The events surrounding the incident. </em>The Commonwealth presented evidence that the complainant (whom we shall call Sara<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>), six years old at the time of trial, and four years old at the time of the alleged incident, while visiting at the house of a friend (Trisha) of her older sister (Cathy), in July, 1990, was sexually abused by the defendant, Trisha\u2019s father. The incident allegedly occurred while Sara\u2019s sister Cathy and her friend Trisha went downstairs to get a drink, leaving the complainant alone in Trisha\u2019s bedroom upstairs. Sara testified that the defendant came out of the bathroom, pulled her pants down to her knees, and \u201cput his finger in my privates. . . [and] wiggled it.\u201d He had put baby oil, which he got from the bathroom, on his finger for lubrication. She said he then \u201ckissed my private\u201d with \u201chis lips\u201d and then \u201cmade me kiss his private.\u201d Finally, she said he \u201cpeed on the bed\u201d and that some of it went on her. He cleaned everything up, told her not to tell anybody, or he \u201cwould cut my private.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">When Cathy and Trisha came back upstairs, the complainant, according to Cathy, was \u201cjust acting like she was when me and [Trisha] was up there, sitting there and playing with dolls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">It was not until September, 1990, that Sara disclosed to her mother what had occurred. She was with her mother at a babysitting job when she ran to her mother and said, \u201cMommy, mommy, the police just arrested a naked lady.\u201d Her mother became concerned and asked her why the lady was naked. The complainant then said \u201cshe was naked because she was sucking. . . . sucking a boy.\u201d According to the mother, this statement suggested that her daughter had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>molested. The mother told Sara, \u201cI want to know if someone touched you,\u201d and repeatedly asked Sara, \u201cwho touched you?\u201d Sara first identified \u201cMichael,\u201d then \u201cGod.\u201d Eventually she identified Trisha\u2019s \u201cdaddy.\u201d The allegations were promptly reported to the police who met with Sara\u2019s parents the next day. The police recommended a physical examination of Sara.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The following day Sara was examined by her regular pediatrician. He found \u201ca deep cleft inside the hymen, indicating a discontinuity in the hymen .... [This] was consistent with the penetration of an object in the vagina that was healed,\u201d but it was also consistent with an \u201cirregular shaped hymen.\u201d The physician also related Sara\u2019s statements to him about the episode of alleged sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Sara met with Detective Collias the next day. Collias testified to Sara\u2019s statements of sexual abuse and that Sara, from an array of thirty-six photographs, identified the defendant as \u201cthe man that touched me on my private parts.\u201d Collias also interviewed the defendant; he denied the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The complainant\u2019s mother was called as a fresh complaint witness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The following testimony was elicited on direct examination without objection or motion to strike by the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">(1) : Q. \u201cDid you ever ask her if anything, or put any words in her mouth?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">A. \u201cNo, that I never did, that I never told her, I would never do that, especially to a four year old girl. <em>The stuff she came up with on her own and stuff she came up with certainly wasn't </em>fabricated.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">(2) : Q. \u201cDid she keep talking about it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>A. \u201cYes. As I said, it was a few days, as time went on, a little more, she would reveal. As I said, it was very hard for her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">Q. \u201cDid you find out she had been left in the room alone?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">A. \u201cYes, because I had asked [Cathy] about that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">Q. \u201cAfter?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">A. \u201cYeah. Then, of course, as I said, the way she was behaving and such, <em>everything just jit.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">(3) Q. \u201cAnd she related who, in fact, had done this to her?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-10\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-11\">Q. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-12\">A. \u201c[Trisha\u2019s] daddy. <em>She was always clear. In the year and a half gone by, almost two years, she was always clear on who is the man who did it to her, she never once strayed from anybody else but that man.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cEvaluations of credibility are, of course, within the exclusive province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. 197, 202 (1987), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90, 94 (1978). Thus, \u201c[i]t is improper to ask a witness to comment on the credibility of another witness.\u201d Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 6.5, at 265 (6th ed. 1994). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>398 Mass. 561, 567 (1986). The Commonwealth argues that the complainant\u2019s mother was merely responding to defense counsel\u2019s accusations \u201cthat the complaint stemmed from [the mother\u2019s] constant, suggestive questioning of her daughter,\u201d and that the mother\u2019s testimony \u201csimply described her own actions \u2014 i.e. the daughter\u2019s testimony \u2018certainly wasn\u2019t fabricated\u2019 by . . . [the mother].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">While this is not a case involving a direct affirmation of the credibility of one witness by another, compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 65, 68-71 (1994) (witness asked whether there was \u201cany doubt in [her] mind [the complainant] is telling the truth\u201d; the witness replied, \u201cShe\u2019s telling the truth\u201d), testimony supporting the credibility of a witness need not be so direct. The question is whether the witness\u2019s testimony <em>\u201chad the same effect </em>as if [the witness] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>had directed his comments specifically to [another witness\u2019s] credibility\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 504 (1991). The difficulty, as we have recently written, is \u201cthat the line between proper testimony as to patterns of disclosure of child sexual abuse victims and improper testimony constituting endorsement of the credibility of a victim-witness is indeed a narrow one.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rather, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 140, 148 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">It is clear to us that the mother\u2019s testimony is much more than a denial that the mother suggested the accusation to Sara. In each of the quoted instances, the mother\u2019s answer went well beyond the question. Further, the gratuitous portions of her answers \u2014 the statements that Sara\u2019s testimony \u201cwasn\u2019t fabricated,\u201d or that \u201ceverything just fit,\u201d or that \u201cshe never once strayed\u201d \u2014 is in effect an affirmation that Sara\u2019s testimony was entirely truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Moreover, the complainant was the Commonwealth\u2019s key witness. As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. at 504-505, her \u201ccredibility was a crucial issue.\u201d Even if we view the mother\u2019s testimony as falling short of a direct affirmation of the credibility of the complainant, \u201cwe see little difference in the final result. It would be unrealistic to allow this type of . . . testimony and then expect the jurors to ignore it when evaluating the credibility of the complaining [witness].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. at 202. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colin C., </em>419 Mass. 54, 61 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The more difficult issue is whether the improper testimony created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The question calls for a review of the trial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">3. <em>The substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. </em>There are a number of factors to be weighed in the balance. On the Commonwealth\u2019s side is Sara\u2019s testimony. She displayed a familiarity with details of sexual conduct not likely known to a six year old child. While she initially wavered in her description of the person who assaulted her, once she identified the defendant from a photographic array, she adhered to that accusation. And even though the physical examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>of Sara did not yield definitive answers, the examining physician did leave it that \u201c[b]ased on the history as well as the physical exam, I am fairly certain there was some vaginal penetration\u201d \u2014 but without the history, \u201cI can say this is either a healed laceration or a tulip hymen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">On the defendant\u2019s side is the testimony of Sara\u2019s sister, Cathy, that when she returned to her friend\u2019s bedroom, Sara was playing with the dolls and seemed entirely undisturbed, exactly as when Cathy left her. There was also the testimony of the defendant\u2019s wife and daughter, each of whom testified that Sara had already left the house when the defendant returned at noon for lunch \u2014 the time the alleged abuse occurred. Finally, there was the unequivocal denial of the charge by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">However, the compelling feature on the defendant\u2019s side is not the direct evidence \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 of the alleged crime, but the extent of the unfairness in the conduct of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The judge failed to give a timely instruction to the jury regarding the limitations on the fresh complaint testimony of the mother. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>Thus the jury likely understood, when the mother testified, that her testimony was admitted as substantive evidence of the alleged crime,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>and </em>as an affirmation of the truthfulness of Sara\u2019s testimony. Because the mother\u2019s testimony was doubly defective, and because Sara\u2019s credibility was a critical issue, the result was \u201cespecially pernicious,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 70, and the resulting prejudice to the defendant doubly harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>In addition to the prejudicial errors just described, we add the following. The mother \u2014 a fresh complaint witness \u2014 was asked on direct examination, \u201cWhat was your reaction [to your daughter\u2019s disclosures]?\u201d To which she replied, \u201cI was shocked, I was hurt, I was crying. I couldn\u2019t believe this had happened to her, I felt guilty.\u201d Sara\u2019s father, over the defendant\u2019s objection, was allowed to testify to his reactions to the episode. The prosecutor explained, \u201cthe jury should know he is here to support his family. . . .\u201d The father then testified, \u201cI cried, this whole thing has ruined my life.\u201d The defendant\u2019s motion to strike was denied. The testimony should have been struck. \u201c[W]hen the question is <em>whether </em>the defendant committed the crime, luxuriating in the ghastliness of the crime and the suffering of the [victim\u2019s family] does not help to answer the question\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 536, 538-539 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The prosecutor picked up this impermissible thread in his closing argument: \u201cYou saw, and I am sure most of you felt the pain of what it was like to be the parents of a child that was molested. You saw [the father], how difficult it was . . . You saw [the mother] try to explain what had occurred on those days. That sick feeling that hit her stomach.\u201d Later in his argument, the prosecutor continued in this vein: \u201c[Sara\u2019s family] came and <em>told you what was a nightmare of their life. What was the nightmare for their child for the rest of her life. A nightmare that will not go away.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The remarks of the prosecutor in this case (not objected to by the defendant) are strikingly similar to the closing argument of the prosecutor in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>405 Mass. 369, 375 (1989). There the prosecutor urged the jury to convict the defendant in order to end the victims\u2019 nightmares. The court ruled that the remarks went beyond the limit of permissible advocacy, <em>ibid., </em>but held that the remarks of the prosecutor, standing alone, did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice because it was \u201cquite unlikely that it would have made a material difference if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>prosecution had hewn to a discussion of the evidence. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 283, 287 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">In this case, the closing argument of the prosecutor did not stand alone. First, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 594 (1983), the Commonwealth\u2019s case was far from overwhelming. The critical choice was between the credibility of Sara and the credibility of the defendant, and it was precisely on that point that the prosecutor gained an advantage to which he was not entitled. The mother\u2019s testimony was erroneously allowed to support Sara\u2019s credibility and, at least initially, to add the force of her own testimony on a substantive, not simply corroborative, level. In addition to these plain errors was the prosecutor\u2019s unabashed appeal to the emotions of the jury by soliciting the emotional reactions of Sara\u2019s parents. The jury heard the details of the mother\u2019s extreme distress, as well as the father\u2019s declaration that his life had been ruined.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">It is in this highly emotional context that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u2014 appealing to the jury to respond appropriately to the family\u2019s \u201cnightmares\u201d \u2014 must be judged. The standard is set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, 374 </em>Mass. 466, 472 (1978) (the prosecutor is the representative of the sovereign whose interest in a criminal prosecution \u201cis not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done,\u201d quoting from <em>Berger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 516-520 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">We are persuaded that justice in this case was not done, and that the combined effect of the errors was sufficiently prejudicial to create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. at 594. The judgment must be reversed and the verdict set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Appellate counsel was not trial counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-9\">The names of the children are fictitious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b770-11\">The jury were not informed \u2014 at the time the mother testified \u2014 that she was testifying as a fresh complaint witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 660 (1992) (\u201cThe trial judge should instruct the jury as the [fresh complaint] evidence is admitted and again during the jury instructions that fresh complaint testimony does not serve as substantive evidence that the crime in fact occurred\u201d). The judge did not instruct on the limited purpose of fresh complaint testimony until his final charge. See note 4, <em>infra, </em>for the judge\u2019s instructions during his final charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The judge merely gave a standard fresh complaint instruction during his final jury instructions without specific reference to the mother\u2019s testimony. He said, \u201cStatements of fresh complaint by the victim of a sexual crime made reasonably promptly under all of the circumstances are admissible for the limited purpose of corroboration of the victim\u2019s testimony. Of course, it is not positive evidence or direct proof that the events occurred. It is admitted solely for your consideration or for whatever light you feel it provides on your assessment of the truthfulness of [the complainant] on the witness stand in the trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
