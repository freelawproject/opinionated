The controversy arose out of the June, 1990, grant by VMark Software, Inc. (VMark), of a license to EMC Corporation (EMC) to use VMark\u2019s software product, a relational database management system called \u201cuniVerse.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> EMC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>looked upon uniVerse as a vital product for its expanding business. According to VMark\u2019s representations, uniVerse would enable EMC to replace existing computer hardware that no longer had the capacity to meet its computing needs, while allowing it to retain its valuable application software, which uniVerse would render compatible with many different types of more efficient or versatile hardware.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">When uniVerse failed to function as VMark had represented and EMC had anticipated, despite at least twenty remedial efforts by VMark, EMC unilaterally declared the license agreement terminated and refused to pay the license fee. VMark\u2019s suit to recover that fee provoked a counterclaim by EMC seeking damages for VMark\u2019s failure to deliver a functional product, founded upon counts for breach of contract, breach of warranty, promissory estoppel, misrepresentation, and violation of G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Following a ten-day bench trial, a judge of the Superior Court \u2014 in a fifty-five page opinion containing 144 separate findings of fact that are unchallenged by the parties \u2014 ruled against VMark on its claim for payment, against EMC on its breach of warranty, misrepresentation, and c. 93A counts, but for EMC on its breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims. The judge awarded EMC $316,901 in what he termed \u201creliance damages.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That figure essentially reflected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>the net cost to EMC of certain Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) computer hardware EMC had purchased in reliance on VMark\u2019s supplying it with a software product that would be fully functional in conjunction with that hardware.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Neither party was satisfied with the judge\u2019s determinations, and both appealed. VMark challenges the judge\u2019s award of reliance damages on either of EMC\u2019s theories. VMark argues that the license agreement contained damage limitation provisions restricting EMC\u2019s damages to those attributable to VMark\u2019s negligence and that promissory estoppel recovery is inappropriate when the parties\u2019 relationship is governed by a valid, fully integrated contract. EMC\u2019s principal cross-appeal argument is that the judge\u2019s adverse rulings on its misrepresentation and c. 93A charges are inconsistent with his undisputed subsidiary findings which establish the requisite elements of those claims in EMC\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Our analysis persuades us that the judge properly ruled in EMC\u2019s favor but should have done so on the basis of EMC\u2019s misrepresentation and c. 93A claims. Our conclusion makes it unnecessary to expound upon VMark\u2019s arguments against the judgment entered in favor of EMC on its breach of contract and promissory estoppel counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\"><em>Background Facts. </em>The following narrative is based upon the judge\u2019s findings. In early 1990, EMC foresaw its imminent need for expanded computing capability. A manufacturer of add-on computer products known as \u201cperipherals,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>EMC sought an improved software product for managing its financial reporting, order management, production, and inventory tracking. At that time, EMC used a Prime computer system for those needs, but that system had become \u201csaturated,\u201d forcing EMC to investigate various alternative systems to handle its expanding business data more quickly and efficiently. EMC required a system that would support both dynamic files<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and alternate indices,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> standard features of EMC\u2019s original Prime system. After a preliminary exploration of alternatives, EMC became interested in the possibility of replacing its Prime system with a \u201cDEC Ultrix\u201d system. EMC, however, used and wanted to continue to use a business applications software called \u201cMadic\u201d for its accounting, inventory, manufacturing, and financial needs, which was incompatible with the DEC Ultrix system.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">EMC consequently sought a product that would enable it to retain the Madic software while using it on the DEC Ultrix hardware. VMark had developed and was licensing such a product, uniVerse, which it marketed to users, like EMC, who sought to move their applications software designed for a Prime system to other, more flexible or capacious systems. One advertised feature of the uniVerse software was its supposed ability to convert existing data files that run in a Prime environment to files that run in a uniVerse environment. UniVerse also was designed to support alternate indices and dynamic files, functions required by EMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">In the spring of 1990, EMC approached VMark as a potential licensee of uniVerse. EMC gathered information about uniVerse and its capabilities through product demonstrations, reference checks, and a thorough review of universe\u2019s operating manuals. During this process, EMC told VMark that its primary concerns in using uniVerse to replace its Prime system with a DEC system were processing its business data more quickly and efficiently, being able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>continue to use dynamic files and alternate indices in its database, and being able to convert to the DEC system by October, 1990, because of the limitations of its Prime system.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">VMark officials assured EMC that the uniVerse product supported the use of both dynamic files and alternate indices, that the conversion from Prime to uniVerse would be straightforward and nonproblematic, and that the conversion process could be completed before the end of the summer. At one of the demonstrations, the VMark sales representative additionally assured EMC that, if uniVerse did not function as promised, VMark would be responsible for the cost of the DEC hardware. By late June, 1990, EMC, relying on VMark\u2019s several representations as to universe\u2019s performance and capabilities, had decided to obtain a license for uniVerse and to purchase the DEC Ultrix computer system. EMC would not have purchased the DEC hardware had it not also acquired what it perceived to be fully functional uniVerse software.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">At the time VMark personnel made their several representations regarding uniVerse, they were confident of EMC\u2019s successful application of the software but knew that there had been some prior problems with the performance of uniVerse when used with a DEC Ultrix system. They were also aware that such a combined system had thus far operated more slowly than it was designed to do; that there had been relatively little experience with universe\u2019s ability to support the alternate indices function, which even the developer of uniVerse was concerned might not work as represented to EMC; that VMark had not actually attempted to use uniVerse to achieve compatibility between Madic application software and DEC hardware; and that difficulties had been encountered with the ability of uniVerse operationally to convert dynamic files to the DEC/uniVerse system. The necessary conversion process required, at the then-current stage of development, an extra, time-consuming step that both VMark\u2019s creator and its engineering vice president recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>nized would make it difficult to meet EMC\u2019s initially desired timetable.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">None of these problems was explicitly communicated by VMark to EMC during the demonstration and negotiation period. Instead, in keeping with VMark\u2019s apparent general policy of not mentioning or minimizing negative factors regarding universe\u2019s capabilities to prospective customers, VMark personnel assured EMC that there would be no serious performance or conversion problems. Nor did the manuals and technical documents supplied by VMark to EMC highlight any of these problems relating to the use of uniVerse.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Unaware of these difficulties, and encouraged to act quickly by VMark\u2019s June 26, 1990, offer to give a twenty percent discount on the license fee if EMC signed up before the end of June, EMC soon thereafter executed a license agreement for the uniVerse software. This agreement contained various provisions limiting VMark\u2019s warranties and damage liability, which VMark asserts preclude any recovery by EMC.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Despite VMark\u2019s assurance that the conversion and transfer of EMC\u2019s data stored in its Prime system to the DEC system via uniVerse would occur uneventfully, difficulties in using uniVerse to load and convert EMC\u2019s data were encountered almost immediately. When EMC performed test functions in uniVerse on the few files that were successfully converted, the results were not uniformly complete or accurate. The DEC/uniVerse system turned out to operate much more slowly than the Prime system. None of VMark\u2019s repeated efforts to solve the various performance problems over the summer and fall of 1990 succeeded in overcoming them. By December, 1990, EMC concluded that uniVerse was too unreliable to permit EMC to conduct business activities on it. By that time VMark, after failing to correct the defects in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the software despite delivering over twenty different but equally unsatisfactory versions of uniVerse to EMC, also conceded that uniVerse was not yet a fully functional product for EMC\u2019s purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">\u2022 VMark told EMC at that point that its future efforts had to be directed to correcting fundamental problems with the software and that it would be unable to address EMC\u2019s specific performance issues until sometime thereafter. Immediately following that concession by VMark of universe\u2019s inability to perform as represented, EMC halted the uniVerse conversion effort and purchased a larger Prime system to address its computing needs. EMC communicated this action to VMark and demanded reimbursement for the cost of the DEC hardware and for the time EMC employees had spent on the failed conversion effort. VMark refused EMC\u2019s claim, demanded payment under the license agreement, and the instant litigation ensued as described earlier.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The parties and the judge devoted most of their trial and appellate energies to the question of the extent to which the license agreement, particularly its liability limitation provisions, restricts EMC\u2019s ability to recover damages for VMark\u2019s undisputed breach of its limited contractual warranty obligations to deliver a functional product conforming to specifications and to repair any defects so that the product would work as promised. Discussion of those contractual and quasi-contractual issues is not necessary in view of our determination that the judge\u2019s damage award in favor of EMC was correct because of VMark\u2019s actionable misrepresentations regarding uniVerse. The damage award did not, however, go far enough, and EMC is entitled to additional recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">1. <em>Misrepresentation. </em>Although the judge entered judgment for VMark on count IV (intentional misrepresentation) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>of EMC\u2019s counterclaim, he did not treat that count separately in his extensive memorandum. His dismissal of the misrepresentation claim appears to have emanated from his brief discussion and rejection of EMC\u2019s c. 93A claim, count VI. Without any amplification, he ruled that \u201cVMark\u2019s representations [regarding universe\u2019s capabilities] were neither intentional nor negligent, and its conduct did not \u2018attain a level of rascality that [would constitute a c. 93A violation]. . . .\u201d This conclusory observation clashes discordantly with the judge\u2019s detailed factual findings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Those unchallenged subsidiary facts demonstrate that VMark did make material misstatements during its negotiations with EMC, which relied on them to its detriment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The judge found, on undisputed evidence (much of it from VMark\u2019s own witnesses) that prior to execution of the license agreement: (a) VMark made glowing representations (at sales presentations, product demonstrations, and in product manuals) regarding the capabilities of the uniVerse software, particularly its supposed ability to make EMC\u2019s Madic applications software compatible with the DEC Ultrix hardware system, to convert EMC\u2019s data from Prime to a DEC system easily in a few weeks, and to support computer functions (including dynamic files and alternate indices) essential to EMC\u2019s business operations; (b) EMC considered those representations to be material to its decision to license universe, purchase the DEC computer, and undertake the substantial conversion process; (c) VMark knew that EMC con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>sidered those representations material and that EMC needed to replace its Prime computer system with a DEC system, while retaining its Madic software, within a relatively short period of time; (d) the uniVerse software did not at the time work as represented by VMark; (e) VMark knew (or should have known) when it made the unqualified representations to EMC regarding universe\u2019s capabilities that the software still had defects and shortcomings which created doubt that it would function as successfully as had been represented, particularly with respect to (i) universe\u2019s performance on DEC Ultrix systems, (ii) its ability to convert dynamic files, and (iii) its ability to support the alternate indices function; (f) VMark in good faith expected uniVerse eventually, when fine-tuned, to function as represented; (g) VMark did not disclose universe\u2019s known problems to EMC so as to modify its unqualifiedly positive statements about uniVerse; (h) VMark feared that if EMC were told about universe\u2019s current performance problems, EMC might not license the software; (i) as further inducement to EMC\u2019s entering into the license transaction and attempted corroboration of VMark\u2019s positive representations regarding universe\u2019s capabilities, VMark promised that it would buy back from EMC the DEC hardware if uniVerse did not perform as represented; and (j) EMC reasonably relied on VMark\u2019s representations, promises, assurances, and product specifications regarding uniVerse, which were material influences on its decision to license the uniVerse software and purchase the DEC computer equipment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">These specific findings by the judge satisfy EMC\u2019s burden in sustaining its claim of actionable misrepresentation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>VMark.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> EMC was accordingly entitled to all damages it had suffered as a proximate result of VMark\u2019s misleading representations, <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Price, </em>340 Mass. 502, 510-511 (1960), including all \u201cout of pocket\u201d expenses incurred in connection with the transaction, so as to restore the status quo ante, as if the transaction had never occurred. <em>Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 72, 82 (1991). Under this standard, the judge correctly awarded EMC $316,901, representing the remaining value of the DEC computer equipment which it would not have purchased but for VMark\u2019s misleading representations regarding universe, and which it was unable to sell in mitigation of its damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The judge should have applied the same measure of recovery with respect to the value of the lost time of EMC\u2019s employees in the failed conversion process. He found that EMC had reasonably committed these employee resources in July, 1990, in reliance upon VMark\u2019s assurances as to the ease of implementation of conversion and had discontinued that commitment only in December, 1990, when universe\u2019s inability to perform as represented was acknowledged by VMark. Just as the DEC computer hardware had no value to EMC in the circumstances, the time of those EMC employees dedicated to the futile attempt to convert to the DEC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>system was wasted and had no value to EMC because of universe\u2019s ongoing inability to function as promised. Damages for misrepresentation should have included the costs of the hours fruitlessly spent by EMC employees trying to make the defective computer system work. See, e.g., <em>Convoy Co. </em>v. <em>Sperry Rand Corp., </em>672 F.2d 781, 785 (9th Cir. 1982); <em>Clements Auto Co. </em>v. <em>Service Bureau Corp., </em>298 F. Supp. 115, 134 (D. Minn. 1969), affd. in relevant part, 444 F.2d 169 (8th Cir. 1971); <em>Stahl Mgmt. Corp. </em>v. <em>Conceptions Unlimited, </em>554 F. Supp. 890, 895 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). EMC\u2019s evidence that it incurred costs of $65,208 for employees diverted to the unsuccessful conversion effort and that the time spent by such employees produced no benefit to EMC was undisputed and should have been accepted as the basis for the additional award.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">2. <em>Chapter 93A. </em>As noted, the judge viewed VMark\u2019s representations to EMC about universe as insufficiently rascally to be deemed unfair or deceptive as between parties experienced in the computer industry and sophisticated in business matters, under the \u201craised eyebrow\u201d test of <em>Levings </em>v. <em>Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 498, 504 (1979). Possibly because of his truncation of EMC\u2019s misrepresentation count, the judge appears to have overlooked the additional teachings of <em>Levings. </em>To be held unfair or deceptive under c. 93A, practices involving even worldly-wise business people do not have to attain the antiheroic proportions of immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous conduct, but need only be within any recognized or established common law or statutory concept of unfairness. <em>Id. </em>at 502, 504. More pertinently, <em>Levings </em>recognized that \u201c[a] misrepresentation in the common law sense would ... be the basis for a c. 93A claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504. Subsequent Massachusetts decisions have confirmed the validity of that observation. See <em>Datacomm Interface, Inc. </em>v. <em>Computerworld, Inc., </em>396 Mass. 760, 779-780 (1986); <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 714 (1990); <em>Glickman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 229, 235 (1985); <em>Sheehy </em>v. <em>Lipton Indus., Inc., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 188, 194-195 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>The damages that EMC claims were the result of VMark\u2019s unfair and deceptive acts are the cost of the DEC equipment and lost employee time devoted to the conversion effort \u2014 precisely the same damages as those proximately flowing from the tortious misrepresentations. Since cumulative recovery is not available in such a situation, see <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, </em>386 Mass. 74, 84-85 (1982); <em>Calimlim </em>v. <em>Foreign Car Center, Inc., </em>392 Mass. 228, 235-236 (1984),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> there would be no independent legal significance to EMC\u2019s separate c. 93A count, but for EMC\u2019s demand that its damages be multiplied. EMC relies on the provision of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, par. 5, that authorizes doubling or trebling of actual damages for a \u201cknowing\u201d 93A violation, and on the scienter requirement for the tort of misrepresentation (see note 9, <em>supra). </em>The existence of that element, EMC asserts, automatically triggers \u00a7 ll\u2019s mandatory doubling of damages for a \u201cknowing\u201d violation of the statute\u2019s prohibition against deceptive acts and practices.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree. Although VMark\u2019s misstatements were made with sufficient awareness of the facts regarding universe\u2019s less-than-perfect capabilities to be actionable under the traditional tort formula, they were not made so \u201cknowingly\u201d as to warrant the punitive sanctions of double damages under c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Central to our conclusions are the special circumstances involved in this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Most important are the judge\u2019s findings that VMark acted in good faith in its dealings with EMC, that it fully expected that uniVerse would function as represented, and that it was persistently ready and willing, though ultimately unable, to correct the software\u2019s shortcomings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As a seasoned user of computer systems \u2014 so the judge found \u2014 EMC had to have realized that such complex, customized technology typically requires a period of adjustment and \u201cdebugging\u201d after delivery to perfect. Cf. <em>Carl Beasley Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burroughs Corp., </em>361 F. Supp. 325, 330 (E.D. Pa. 1973), affd., 493 F.2d 1400 (3d Cir. 1974); <em>Pezzillo </em>v. <em>General Tel. &amp; Electronics Info. Sys., Inc., </em>414 F. Supp. 1257, 1259-1260 (M.D. Tenn. 1976), affd., 572 F.2d 1189 (6th Cir. 1978); <em>Logan Equip. Corp. </em>v. <em>Simon Aerials, Inc., </em>736 F. Supp. 1188, 1204 (D. Mass. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">VMark\u2019s earnest efforts to make good on its contractual obligation by overcoming its product\u2019s recognized problems and making it perform to expectations do not, of course, create a defense to the tort claim. Establishing liability for misrepresentation does not require a showing that the defendant even knew that the statements made were false, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>let alone that the defendant actually intended to deceive the plaintiff. See <em>Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. at 77, 81-82; Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 526 comment (e); Prosser &amp; Keeton, The Law of Torts \u00a7 107 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>ed. 1984).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The inept blend of hopeful dissembling and dogged bumbling displayed by VMark does not, however, reflect the \u201cculpable state of mind\u201d required for imposition of \u00a7 11\u2019s extraordinary damage penalty. Cf. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Rodman Ford Truck Center, Inc., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 709, 712 (1985), quoting from <em>Computer Sys. Engr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Qantel Corp., </em>571 F. Supp. 1365, 1375 (D. Mass. 1983), affd., 740 F.2d 59 (1st Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">We do not read the c. 93A cases as mandating that the multiple damages bonus be automatically imposed for any and all forms of misrepresentation. Rather, it is only when the acts of misrepresentation amount to \u201cintentional fraud\u201d that the severe sanction is appropriate. See <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. at 714. See also <em>Datacomm Interface, Inc. </em>v. <em>Computerworld, Inc., </em>396 Mass. at 779-780. The Supreme Judicial Court has recognized that only \u201ccallous and intentional violations\u201d of c. 93A merit multiple damages, <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., </em>376 Mass. 621, 627 (1978), and has emphasized the need to place a limit on punitive liability under c. 93A for \u201crelatively innocent violations.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 854 (1983). As we have previously observed, a c. 93A offense may even be \u201cgrievous\u201d without being knowing or wilful. <em>Shawmut Community Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Zagami, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 371, 376 (1991), <em>S.C., </em>411 Mass. 807 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Delivery of a defective product without revealing the defects, to the extent they are known and material, is surely market disruptive to the same extent whether the promisor is genuinely hopeful of eventually fulfilling his contract, cf. <em>Logan Equip. Corp. </em>v. <em>Simon Aerials, Inc., </em>736 F. Supp. at 1204, or is deliberately deceptive and entirely disdainful of his commitments. Cf. <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. at 708-709, 711; <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number><em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 474-476 (1991). Nonetheless, the fault of the former \u2014 which smacks more (the trial judge\u2019s off-hand conclusion notwithstanding) of gross negligence<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> than of intentional fraud, see <em>Glickman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. at 234-235 \u2014 is markedly less damnable than that of the latter. It is insufficiently egregious to bring the offending party within the statutory objective of punishing truly inequitable marketplace behavior, <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>388 Mass. 8, 12 (1983), which unmistakably reeks of callousness, <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., </em>376 Mass. at 627, of bad faith, <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobilhome Sales, Inc., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 701, 706 (1983), and of meretriciousness, <em>Bachman </em>v. <em>Parkin, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 908, 910 (1984). Cf. <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. at 855, 856-857 (\u201cThe Massachusetts Legislature consciously enacted a rule whereby the defendant\u2019s [c. 93A] liability is measured by the degree of his culpability\u201d); <em>Computer Sys. Engr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Qantel Corp., </em>571 F. Supp. at 1375-1376.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Accordingly, we hold that EMC did not make out a case for multiple damages on these facts. VMark was misguidedly insincere but fundamentally well-intentioned in its inducement of EMC to purchase software of dubious reliability for the intended purpose, in misplaced reliance on its ability to perfect a product whose defects were either insolubly inherent or of such intractability as to confound VMark\u2019s inadequate curative efforts. Such undesirable, but not reprehensible, conduct can be sufficiently deterred by the mandatory imposition on VMark of the significant c. 93A penalty of paying EMC\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, as well as its actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>As previously noted, it is unnecessary to address the merits of VMark\u2019s appellate challenges to the judge\u2019s award of reliance damages to EMC on the ground of either breach of contract or promissory estoppel. Even if the judge was wrong, EMC would remain entitled to recover the same damages under its successful misrepresentation count \u2014 its actual losses causally arising from VMark\u2019s conduct. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Were the judge correct, EMC could not recover duplicative or cumulative damages under multiple legal theories based on the same core of fact. See <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, </em>386 Mass. at 83-84. <em>Calimlim </em>v. <em>Foreign Car Center, Inc., </em>392 Mass. at 235-236.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Accordingly, the judgment dated September 28, 1992, is to be modified by striking the second and third paragraphs and inserting the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">\u201cThat judgment enter for the defendant EMC Corporation on counts IV and VI of its counterclaim against VMark Software, Inc., in the total amount of $382,109 plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">\u201cThat judgment enter for the plaintiff VMark Software, Inc., on counts I, II, III &amp; V of EMC\u2019s counterclaim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">As modified, the judgment is affirmed. The case is. remanded to the Superior Court for the determination of EMC\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-16\">The parties and the trial judge assumed, without discussion, that the parties\u2019 computer software license agreement is governed by art. 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 2-101 et seq. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>issue has not been definitively decided in Massachusetts, we accept the assumption, particularly since the applicability and provisions of the U.C.C. are not critical to our analysis. See <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>First State Ins. Co., ante </em>471, 477-479 (1994). See generally Note, Computer Programs as Goods Under the U.C.C., 77 Mich. L. Rev. 1149 (1979); Note, Computer Software as a Good Under the Uniform Commercial Code: Taking a Byte Out of the Intangibility Myth, 65 B.U.L. Rev. 129 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The long-established general rule for breach of contract recovery in Massachusetts is that the wronged party should receive the benefit of his bargain, i.e., be placed in the same position as if the contract had been performed. <em>John Hetherington &amp; Sons, Ltd. </em>v. <em>William Firth Co., </em>210 Mass. 8, 21 (1911). However, in an appropriate case, Massachusetts law permits, as an alternative to such \u201cexpectation\u201d damages, the recovery of \u201creliance\u201d damages, i.e., expenditures made in reliance upon a contractual obligation that was not performed. See <em>Albre Marble &amp; Tile Co. </em>v. <em>John Bowen Co., </em>338 Mass. 394, 398-399 (1959); <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Carvel Corp., </em>929 F.2d 801, 810-811 (1st Cir. 1991); Restatement (Second) of Contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>\u00a7 349 (1981). Such a measure of damages, which is designed to place a plaintiff- \u201cin as good a position as he would have been in had the contract not been made,\u201d <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 27, 35 n.6 (1980), is essentially similar to the tort standard of actual, or out-of-pocket, loss proximately suffered. See Nolan &amp; Sartorio, Tort Law \u00a7 146 (1989). Cf. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>O'Connor, </em>363 Mass. 579, 583-586 &amp; n.5 (1973). In this case, EMC expressly sought only reliance, rather than expectation, damages for VMark\u2019s claimed breach of contract, requesting only its costs incurred in reliance on VMark\u2019s promise to supply a functional product.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b644-10\">EMC also contends that the judge\u2019s award of contractual reliance damages should have included the value of the time spent by its employees in their vain struggles to convert data to the DEC/uniVerse system and otherwise utilize the defective universe product. We agree, as discussed below, although by way of a different legal analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Dynamic files enable the system to run continually, continuously twenty-four hours a day, every day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Alternate indices allow users to sort information by multiple criteria, such as name, purchase order number, or part number.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The parties addressed most of their analytical efforts here, as below, to the interaction and implications of these restrictive provisions, but they do not occupy our attention on our view of the case.

This case may be cited as an illustration of the soundness of that advice.\u201d <em>Alcan Aluminum Corp. </em>v. <em>Carlton Aluminum of New England, Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 161, 162 n.4 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\">An appellate court may reach its own ultimate conclusions based on a trial judge\u2019s findings and may set aside a trial judge\u2019s ultimate ruling that is inconsistent with the judge\u2019s own subsidiary factual findings. <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Weymouth Agric. &amp; Industrial Soc., </em>389 Mass. 146, 148-149, 151-152 (1983); <em>Delano Growers\u2019 Coop. Winery </em>v. <em>Supreme Wine Co., </em>393 Mass. 666, 684 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The familiar elements of an action for misrepresentation are that the defendant made a false representation of a material fact for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to rely upon it, and that the plaintiff did rely upon the representation as true, to his damage. See <em>Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 72, 77 (1991). The party making the representation need not know that the statement is false if the fact represented is susceptible of actual knowledge. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The judge expressly found that EMC performed reasonable investigations, prior to entering the license agreement, in an effort to determine the ability of uniVerse to function in conjunction with a DEC system as represented. The judge\u2019s holding that EMC failed to establish that the withholding by VMark of material information, disclosure of which might have dissuaded it from licensing the defective uniVerse product, is logically inconsistent with his finding that EMC reasonably relied on VMark\u2019s unqualified representations to the effect that uniVerse suffered no functional drawbacks and would satisfy EMC\u2019s time-constrained needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b651-6\">VMark\u2019s contentions that any misrepresentations do not aid EMC because they either contradict or are identical to an express provision of the license agreement, or amount only to a breach of contract, are not only unsupported by citation to Massachusetts authorities, but are also contrary to long-standing Massachusetts law and policy. See <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Southgate, </em>308 Mass. 170, 182 (1941); <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>368 Mass. 433, 446 (1975); <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 712-714 (1990). VMark\u2019s reliance on the damage limitation and integration clauses of the agreement to bar EMC\u2019s recovery for misrepresentation is misplaced. The Massachusetts authority just cited, particularly <em>Bates, </em>establishes that a party may not escape liability for misrepresentation by resort to such provisions. See <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Southgate, </em>308 Mass. at 179-180, 182, 183. See also <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. at 711 n.5; <em>Sheehy </em>v. <em>Lipton Indus., Inc., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 188, 193-194 (1987); <em>V.S.H. Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Texaco, Inc., </em>757 F.2d 411, 417-418 (1st Cir. 1985). In any event, it is the law of Massachusetts that even sophisticated businessmen must deal with each other honestly and may not induce contractual relations by material misrepresentations. <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. at 712-713.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b653-5\">For the same reason, we need not separately address EMC\u2019s arguments that VMark\u2019s conduct gives rise to independent c. 93A liability for material nondisclosure. We recognize, of course, that EMC is in any event entitled, under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, par. 6, to an award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in the action, in addition to the amount of its actual damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\">General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 11, par. 5, inserted by St. 1972, c. 614, \u00a7 2, states: \u201cIf the court finds for the petitioner, recovery shall be in the amount of actual damages; or up to three, but not less than two, times such amount if the court finds that the use or employment of the method of competition or the act or practice was a willful or knowing violation of said section two.\u201d The fact that the trial judge does not make an express finding that a defendant\u2019s violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, was either wilful or knowing is irrelevant if the evidence warrants such a finding. <em>Service Publications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Goverman, </em>396 Mass. 567, 578 n.13 (1986); <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 475 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Whether particular conduct merits c. 93A condemnation always depends on the unique facts of each case.

Super. 260 (1986), where the seller of a software system, falsely represented as able to satisfy the buyer\u2019s needs, did nothing to attempt to fix the system after problems developed. We put great stock in the findings of the trial judge on issues such as intent and motivation, since he was in a superior position to assess the weight and credibility of the witnesses, and there is no showing that his findings were clearly erroneous.

Although the tort of negligent misrepresentation is recognized in Massachusetts, <em>Glickman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. at 234-235, EMC has failed to develop this theory in any coherent manner, and the record does not provide a basis for determining the scope of the requisite duty of care in ascertaining and communicating the truth in circumstances such as those here presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
