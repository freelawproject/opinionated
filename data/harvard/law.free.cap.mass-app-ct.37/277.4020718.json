Towler, a firefighter for the city of Lawrence, complained of chest pains while performing his duties at a fire scene and died within minutes of returning to his fire station. His death certificate lists the cause of death as coronary thrombosis. Within a month, an attorney forwarded to the defendant Lawrence retirement board (board) the signed application of Mrs. Towler, the firefighter\u2019s widow, \u201cfor a pension under the provisions of [G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 9 &amp; 94].\u201d Shortly thereafter, the board awarded a pension to Mrs. Towler pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9, essentially comprising two-thirds of her hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>band\u2019s annual salary at the time of his death, together with an additional annual pension of $312 for each of her three sons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In 1977, Mrs. Towler filed an application with the board for benefits under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 100, which in pertinent part (as appearing in St. 1969, c. 123) provides to the surviving spouse of a firefighter who is killed or suffers fatal injuries \u201cwhile at the scene of a fire\u201d annual pension benefits essentially in the full amount of the firefighter\u2019s salary. That same year and prior to the board taking any action, Mrs. Towler, through an attorney, filed a withdrawal of that application. In 1989, she again applied to the board for pension benefits under \u00a7 100. The record contains no explanation for the delay between applications. When the board denied her 1989 application, Mrs. Towler appealed to the defendant Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB), which assigned the matter to the Division of Administrative Law Appeals. An administrative magistrate, after a hearing, ordered that she be awarded benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 100, retroactive to the date of her husband\u2019s death. Upon review, CRAB rejected that award and affirmed the board\u2019s denial of the application. Mrs. Towler\u2019s subsequent appeal to the Superior Court was unavailing and she now appeals to this court. We affirm the Superior Court judgment and the denial of the application for \u00a7 100 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The magistrate, relying principally on a 1989 physician\u2019s opinion letter, concluded that Mrs. Towler was eligible to receive benefits under \u00a7 100 and that she was not estopped from applying for those benefits. In her decision, the magistrate found that the board had not informed Mrs. Towler \u201cof her potential rights pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 100,\u201d and stated also that Mrs. Towler \u201cwas told she qualified for [\u00a7 9] accidental death benefits which she subsequently applied for and received.\u201d She also found the board \u201cfailed to demonstrate that [Mrs. Towler] in any way acted in bad faith.\u201d Upon review of the magistrate\u2019s decision, CRAB adopted her factual findings, but concluded that the board had not erred in denying Mrs. Towler\u2019s application. In so deciding, CRAB determined that Mrs. Towler had been receiving \u00a7 9 benefits since 1967 and had made an election at that time. CRAB further supported its decision by noting that Mrs. Towler had filed and withdrawn a \u00a7 100 application in 1977 and had therefore been aware of her possible rights under \u00a7 100, \u201csince at least 1977.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The Superior Court judge concluded that \u201c[t]he administrative record . . . indicates that CRAB\u2019s decision was based on substantial evidence and on existing law.\u201d He noted that \u00a7100 states that its benefits are in the alternative to any other benefits under c. 32 and that \u201cMrs. Towler cannot now make an application\u201d for \u00a7 100 benefits when she had been aware of her possible entitlement under \u00a7 100 \u201cat least since 1977 when she withdrew her application\u201d and \u201cchose to continue to receive . . . benefits under. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 94.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">There is no merit to Mrs. Towler\u2019s argument that \u00a7 100 does not allow for an election from among pension alternatives. That argument, based upon the direction in \u00a7 100 that benefits \u201cshall be paid,\u201d not only ignores similar language in \u00a7 9, but also fails to recognize the significant differences in benefits and application burdens in the two sections, especially in 1967, when Mrs. Towler first applied. The general presumption of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 94, relating a fatal heart attack suffered by a firefighter to his official duties, is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>unavailable to an applicant for \u00a7 100 benefits by the express provisions of that section. See <em>Buteau </em>v. <em>Norfolk County Retirement Bd., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 391, 394 (1979). Moreover, the 1967 version of \u00a7 100 did not contain any provisions for the continuance of the annual pension based upon the firefighter\u2019s salary in the event of a widow\u2019s death or remarriage (see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 100, as inserted by St. 1964, c. 268),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> while a widow\u2019s annual benefits under \u00a7 9 continued to be paid to her children during their minority or incapacity in the event of her death or remarriage. Accordingly, in 1967, there were significant reasons for an applicant to elect to receive benefits under \u00a7 9 rather than \u00a7 100 and, in some circumstances, a mandatory imposition of \u00a7 100 benefits would not have been in the best interests of the firefighter\u2019s family. Moreover, the reliance of the magistrate on the failure of the board to inform Mrs. Towler of her rights under \u00a7100 and upon her good faith is misplaced. At least until 1987, nothing in c. 32 required such notification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, a finding that Mrs. Towler was not informed of her potential rights under \u00a7 100 does not compel the conclusion that she was unaware of those rights, especially in view of the fact that her original application for benefits, in 1967, was filed through an attorney. In any event, the outcome of this appeal need not rely upon the notion of an election made in 1967. Even if Mrs. Towler\u2019s 1967 application for \u00a7 9 benefits was based on her good faith belief that she was entitled to no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>other benefits, her application for \u00a7 100 benefits in 1977 establishes her awareness, at that time, of the provisions of that statute, which includes the statement that its \u201cbenefits . . . shall be in the alternative to the benefits provided by any other section of this chapter . . . .\u201d See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 100, as appearing in St. 1973, \u00a7 685. By withdrawing her application, Mrs. Towler made an election to continue receiving benefits under \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While nothing in c. 32 expressly makes an election irrevocable or imposes a time limit on reapplication, that same absence of statutory direction or relevant regulation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> leaves it to CRAB, acting under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4), to strike a reasonable balance between the rights of claimants and the interests of retirement boards in fair and orderly administration of the pension laws.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3, under which judicial review of CRAB decisions is conducted, directs that a reviewing court \u201cshall give due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d CRAB\u2019s refusal to permit Mrs. Towler to seek and receive, in 1989, a retroactive pension under \u00a7 100, twenty-two years after her husband\u2019s death and at least twelve years after she withdrew her first \u00a7 100 application, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>not unfair, incorrect as matter of law, see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Whatever may have been Mrs. Towler\u2019s right to approval of her 1977 application based on her good faith ignorance of the law in 1967 and notwithstanding her prior receipt of benefits under \u00a7 9, which for at least a four-year period afforded her children potential benefits which were unavailable under \u00a7 100, CRAB did not commit error in concluding that her withdrawal of her 1977 application and her failure to press it for the next twelve years barred her 1989 application. By so ruling, it implicitly was applying long established principles of election and waiver, grounded in pragmatic considerations of certainty and finality. \u201cElection exists when a party has two alternative and inconsistent rights, and it is determined by a manifestation of choice.\u201d <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Alley, </em>156 Mass. 193, 195 (1892). Even if her 1977 election is not construed as irreversibly binding, certainly any residual rights were waived when Mrs. Towler did not exercise them for twelve years. \u201c[A] party may waive rights merely by failing to assert them.\u201d <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Reeder, </em>382 Mass. 398, 411 (1981). \u201c[A] waiver, partaking of the principle of an election, like an election needs no consideration, and cannot be retracted.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>395 Mass. 159, 162 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 9(1), as appearing in St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1, provides, in pertinent part, for the payment of a pension upon the receipt by a retirement board of \u201cproper proof\u2019 that an employee in an eligible category of governmental service \u201cdied as the natural and proximate result of a personal injury sustained or a hazard undergone as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties . . . .\u201d The amount of the allowance, in 1967, to the designated beneficiary of such employee, consisted \u201cof a yearly amount of pension equal to two thirds of the annual rate of regular compensation of such [employee] on the date such injury was sustained or such hazard was undergone, or equal to two thirds of the average annual rate of his regular compensation for the twelve-month period for which he last received regular compensation immediately preceding the date of his death, whichever is greater.\u201d G.
