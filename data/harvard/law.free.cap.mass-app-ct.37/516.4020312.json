Shepard, filed a multicount complaint against the defendant, Stop &amp; Shop Companies, Inc. (Stop &amp; Shop). The relevant counts are: Count I, which alleged that Stop &amp; Shop had tortiously interfered with the pharmacy\u2019s business relations; Count III, which alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Stop &amp; Shop had violated G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB (invasion of privacy); Count V, which alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress upon Shepard; Count VIII, which alleged violations of G. L. c. 93A; and Count X, which alleged violation of Shepard\u2019s civil rights pursuant to G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">At the close of the trial, the judge submitted special questions to the jury on Counts I and V. He reserved decisions on Counts III, VIII, and X to himself. On Count I, the jury found that Stop &amp; Shop had tortiously interfered with the business relations between the pharmacy and its customers and assessed $750 in damages; it also found that Stop &amp; Shop did not tortiously interfere with any advantageous business relations between Shepard and Maxi Drug, a prospective buyer of Shepard\u2019s business. On Count V, the jury found in favor of Stop &amp; Shop. On Count III the judge ruled that Stop &amp; Shop had violated Shepard\u2019s rights to privacy and awarded $75,000 in damages. On Count VIII the judge ruled that Stop and Shop had violated G. L. c. 93A in that it had committed an unfair and deceptive act and awarded $75,000 in damages. The judge further ruled that the violation was wilful and knowing and awarded double damages for total damages of $150,000 plus $58,662.05 in attorney\u2019s fees. On Count X the judge found that the conduct of Stop &amp; Shop did not violate Shepard\u2019s civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">On appeal, Stop &amp; Shop challenges the judge\u2019s rulings of violations of G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. It argues that the evidence did not support either of the judge\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">1. <em>The G. L. c. 93A claim. </em>The judge filed a memorandum of decision containing his findings of fact and rulings of law. We summarize the facts, some of which are in dispute on appeal. In March, 1990, a representative of Stop &amp; Shop approached Shepard and inquired if Shepard would be interested in selling his pharmacy, located in West Springfield, to Stop &amp; Shop and becoming a staff pharmacist at the Stop &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Shop supermarket in West Springfield.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shepard indicated his interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">During the course of the negotiations, Stop &amp; Shop offered to pay Shepard the sum of $25,000 for the prescription portion of his business, to purchase his inventory except certain items, and to employ Shepard for two years as a staff pharmacist at its West Springfield supermarket at a salary of $47,000 to $48,000 per year. Shepard responded that he was willing to sell to Stop &amp; Shop but wanted enough money from the sale of the inventory to pay all his debts and \u201cto come out whole.\u201d The judge found that Shepard never disagreed with the offer of $25,000, and there was no real disagreement as to the salary he would receive.</p>\n<p id=\"pASe\">Negotiations reached the point where on August 15, 1990, the parties discussed a September 27, 1990, closing date for the transaction. Also around August 15, Shepard notified his attorney that he had been negotiating with Stop &amp; Shop. On September 17, 1990, Shepard\u2019s attorney received a purchase and sale agreement from Stop &amp; Shop. The agreement included a clause providing that Shepard would not compete within a ten-mile radius of the West Springfield Stop &amp; Shop for a period of three years from the date of the closing of the transaction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">On September 18, 1990, a representative from another company, Maxi Drug, met with Shepard and discussed the possibility of purchasing Shepard\u2019s pharmacy for $125,000 plus his inventory and hiring him as a pharmacist on terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>comparable to those offered by Stop &amp; Shop. Maxi Drug knew nothing of Shepard\u2019s negotiations with Stop &amp; Shop until September 18, 1990, when Shepard told Maxi Drug that he had met with other people about a possible sale.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">On or about September 24, 1990, Shepard learned that Stop &amp; Shop intended to announce in a circular to be included in the September 30 edition of the Sunday Republican that it had purchased the pharmacy and to invite Shepard\u2019s customers to shop at its pharmacy located in its supermarket in West Springfield where Shepard would be employed. Shepard\u2019s photograph was to accompany the announcement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On September 26, Shepard indicated to Stop &amp; Shop that their deal was off.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Shepard and his attorney met with representatives of Stop &amp; Shop on September 28 in an attempt to have Stop &amp; Shop withdraw its circular from the Sunday newspaper. Stop &amp; Shop stated it would be too expensive and refused, but it increased its offer for the prescription portion of the business from $25,000 to $50,000. A representative of Stop &amp; Shop acknowledged that it had \u201cbotched\u201d the transaction. Shepard refused the increased offer and insisted that Stop &amp; Shop withdraw its circular. Stop &amp; Shop did not do so but did print a quarter-page statement in the same edition of the newspaper, stating that the circular was in error regarding the purchase of Shepard\u2019s pharmacy. Sometime after the circular was published, Maxi Drug withdrew from its negotiations with Shepard, claiming it was doing so because the negotiations had become public knowledge and because it had the impression that Shepard and Stop &amp; Shop \u201cwere sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>stantially further along in . . . conversations than was represented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The judge concluded that Stop &amp; Shop was \u201cguilty of an unfair and deceptive business practice in that [it] applied economic coercion beyond what would be proper in the market place, [was] unethical, overbearing and unscrupulous and [its] conduct was a substantial departure from the fair dealing of the market place.\u201d In reaching his conclusion, the judge considered \u201cthe extreme competition the evidence disclosed in the supermarket industry and the need for a drug department, the way Stop &amp; Shop handled this purchase with no written agreement until one week before the closing, the introduction of a one-sided non-compete employment clause, the less than credible statement the photographer could only come to the Riverdale store once a year, the use of his [Shephard\u2019s] picture without permission, [and] the admission by the defendant\u2019s official [that] they botched the purchase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11, makes unlawful, among other things, \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices . . . .\u201d \u201cCourts have deliberately avoided setting down a clear definition of conduct constituting a violation of G. L. c. 93A.\u201d <em>Spence </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>390 Mass. 604, 616 (1983). We have noted, however, that \u201c[t]he statute \u2018does not contemplate an overly precious standard of ethical or moral behavior. It is the standard of the commercial market place.\u2019 \u201d <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Arthur D. Little Sys., Inc., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 108, 124 (1989), quoting from <em>Wasserman </em>v. <em>Agnastopoulos, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 672, 679 (1986). \u201cAlthough whether a particular set of acts, in their factual setting, is unfair or deceptive is a question of fact, ... the boundaries of what may qualify for consideration as a c. 93A violation is a question of law\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Schwanbeck </em>v. <em>Federal-Mogul Corp., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 390, 414 (1991), <em>S.C., </em>412 Mass. 703 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Stop &amp; Shop attacks the judge\u2019s findings of fact \u2014 in particular, the judge\u2019s findings concerning the circumstances surrounding the taking of Shepard\u2019s photograph. It also con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>tends that the other findings of the judge do not amount to a violation of G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The judge made the following findings of fact concerning the taking of Shepard\u2019s photograph. \u201cIn late August Stop &amp; Shop was pressing Shepard to have his picture taken for any advertisement relative to the opening of the new acquisition which Stop &amp; Shop was hoping would be September 27, 1990. Mr. Shepard was not agreeable as he told them they did not have a deal. The Stop &amp; Shop representatives told him the lack of a firm deal would not matter as the photographer was coming to the Riverdale store on a certain date and would not be back for a long time.\u201d The judge then stated, \u201cI believe this was just a ruse to get his picture for the circular they were planning to print up as his picture certainly could have been taken on short notice once the agreement was finalized.\u201d As noted, in his ultimate finding on this point, the judge stated that Stop &amp; Shop made \u201cthe less than credible statement the photographer could only come to the Riverdale store once a year . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">There is simply no evidence that supports the judge\u2019s findings concerning the circumstances surrounding the taking of Shepard\u2019s photograph or, specifically, that conduct by Stop &amp; Shop constituted a \u201cruse.\u201d Shepard testified that a representative of Stop &amp; Shop told him that Stop &amp; Shop \u201ctypically takes pictures of employees which they display proudly, that on a particular occasion or date, arrangements had been made with a photographer out of Connecticut to come to West Springfield to take pictures of Stop &amp; Shop employees and could I possibly be there for that photograph.\u201d Shepard testified that he agreed to having his photograph taken but told Stop &amp; Shop that it could not be used unless both parties agreed to the sale of the pharmacy. There was no evidence whatsoever that Stop &amp; Shop told Shepard that the photographer had to take the photograph on a particular date because, as the judge found, he \u201cwould not be back for a long time\u201d or that Stop &amp; Shop told Shepard that \u201cthe photographer could only come to the Riverdale store once a year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The other findings of the judge do not amount to a c. 93A violation. The judge\u2019s conclusion that the purchase and sale agreement contained a \u201cone-sided non-compete employment clause\u201d was based on an erroneous interpretation of the agreement (see note 3, <em>supra). </em>Moreover, the purchase and sale agreement was never executed. That Stop &amp; Shop did not send the purchase and sale agreement to Shepard\u2019s lawyer until one week before the scheduled closing may have been \u201csloppy\u201d but did not amount to a violation of c. 93A. An admission that the transaction was \u201cbotched\u201d is not the same as admitting that Stop &amp; Shop engaged in an unfair or coercive practice. Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s behavior in offering an additional $25,000 to Shepard during the course of the September 28 meeting certainly did not have \u201can extortionate quality that gives [the increased offer] the rancid flavor of unfairness.\u201d <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 219, 226 (1992). In sum, nothing in Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s conduct \u201cat-tainted] a level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.\u201d <em>Levings </em>v. <em>Forbes &amp; Wallace, Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 498, 504 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Further, even if there existed an unfair or deceptive act, \u201c[t]o prevail on a claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, the plaintiff must show a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s unfair and deceptive act and the alleged loss of money or property and that such loss was reasonably foreseeable as a result.\u201d <em>International Totalizing Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>PepsiCo, Inc., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 436 n.18 (1990), citing <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>Silver Lake Motors, Inc., </em>369 Mass. 795, 800-801 (1976). \u201c[I]n the absence of a causal relationship between the alleged unfair acts and the claimed loss, there can be no recovery.\u201d <em>PDM Mechanical Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Suffolk Constr. Co., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 228, 237 (1993). The loss of any deal with Maxi Drug was not reasonably foreseeable by Stop &amp; Shop; it never learned about Shepard\u2019s negotiations with Maxi Drug until the September 28 meeting (see note 4, <em>supra), </em>at which point Stop &amp; Shop had already decided to run the circular.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>2. <em>The invasion of privacy claim. </em>General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 IB, as inserted by St. 1974, c. 193, \u00a7 1, states, in relevant part, \u201cA person shall have a right against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy . . . .\u201d The judge found that \u201cStop &amp; Shop never had permission, oral or written, to announce the purchase and sale or to print Shepard\u2019s picture with the announcement he had joined Stop &amp; Shop and all his customers should now get their prescriptions filled at Stop &amp; Shop.\u201d The judge concluded that Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s action was \u201can unreasonable, substantial and serious interference with [Shepard\u2019s] privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Information about the negotiations, and what Stop &amp; Shop thought was the state of the transaction, was in the common possession of both Shepard and Stop &amp; Shop. Shepard did not produce any evidence that there was an agreement with Stop &amp; Shop to keep the negotiations confidential. In fact, Shepard testified that he told Maxi Drug that he had met with other people about a sale of his pharmacy. Further, Shepard admitted that he was agreeable to the publication of his photograph, in the event the sale was consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In these circumstances, Shepard cannot claim invasion of his interest in seclusion or in being free from unreasonable publicity about his private life. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652A(2)(1977), which recognizes protection of one\u2019s seclusion and private life as two of four privacy interests. Rather, it appears that the judge concluded that Stop &amp; Shop invaded Shepard\u2019s privacy by misappropriating Shepard\u2019s name or likeness. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652C. According to comment b of \u00a7 652C, \u201c[t]he common form\u201d that a violation of this interest takes \u201cis the appropriation and use of the plaintiffs name or likeness to advertise the defendant\u2019s business or product, or for some similar commercial purpose.\u201d Here, there was sufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that by means of its circular Stop &amp; Shop unreasonably, substantially, and seriously misappropriated Shepard\u2019s name and likeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">While the finding of an invasion of privacy was warranted, we are not able to conclude that the separate damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>awarded by the judge for that tort were supported by the evidence. As to damages, the judge found that Shepard \u201csuffer [ed] some loss of business, embarrassment and humiliation in the view of his customers and friends. He lost the benefit of the potential sale to Maxi Drug which terminated because of the publicity as [Maxi Drug\u2019s representative] did not want others in the industry to think he was being unscrupulous and getting in their affairs.\u201d The judge awarded $75,000 for the violation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. This finding was inconsistent with the judge\u2019s announcement in his memorandum of decision that he \u201caccepted [the jury\u2019s] findings.\u201d The jury found that: (1) the pharmacy incurred only $750 in damages for Stop &amp; Shop\u2019s conduct in tortiously interfering with the business relations between the pharmacy and its customers, (2) Stop &amp; Shop did not tortiously interfere with any advantageous business relations between Shepard and Maxi Drug, and (3) Stop &amp; Shop did not intentionally inflict emotional distress on Shepard.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Shepard has not pointed (below or in his brief on appeal) to any additional bases for recovery of damages other than those relied on by the judge, and those that have been relied upon are duplicative of or inconsistent with the jury\u2019s damage findings. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Property \u00a7 652A comment d (where privacy is invaded in more than one way, the plaintiff may have only one recovery of his damages upon one or all of the different grounds). Cf. also <em>Canal Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>406 Mass. 369, 378-379 &amp; n.10 (1990) (where breach of warranty claim is duplicative of c. 93A claim, no recovery of damages under both theories, citing <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388 [1979]). Neither does it appear that Stop &amp; Shop obtained any benefit through the use of Shepard\u2019s photograph, so restitution of profits is not an option. Cf. Restatement of Restitution \u00a7 136 (1937). In these circumstances, a separate award of damages for the tort of invasion of privacy was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The judgment against Stop &amp; Shop on Count VIII is vacated. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>a new judgment shall issue dismissing that count and vacating the separate award of damages on Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">In 1987, the Legislature had enacted a statute permitting supermarkets to have retail pharmacies located within their premises. See St. 1987, c. 465, \u00a7 22, amending G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 38, 39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Two clearly erroneous findings by the judge must be noted here. The judge\u2019s finding that the purchase and sale agreement was not sent to Shepard and his lawyer until around September 19 or 20 is at odds with the undisputed evidence that Shepard\u2019s attorney received it on September 17. The judge also concluded that the noncompetition clause stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">\u201cShepard would not compete for a period of three years after any termination whether by Stop &amp; Shop or Shepard but [his employment with Stop &amp; Shop] was for only two years.\u201d The judge misread the clause. The period of time is from the date of the closing of the transaction, not the date of Shepard\u2019s termination.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The judge did not make any finding as to when Stop &amp; Shop discovered that Maxi Drug was interested in purchasing the pharmacy, but Shepard testified he did not tell Stop &amp; Shop about Maxi Drug\u2019s interest until September 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Shepard\u2019s photograph had been taken in August by a photographer hired by Stop &amp; Shop. The circumstances surrounding the taking of the photograph loomed large in the judge\u2019s determination that Stop &amp; Shop violated c. 93A. The judge\u2019s findings on that point are challenged by Stop &amp; Shop. We discuss the controversy later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
