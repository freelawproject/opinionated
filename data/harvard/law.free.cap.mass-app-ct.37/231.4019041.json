L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3. Confining the analysis to the plaintiffs assertion that its claim arose out of the business transacted by the defendant with P.F. O\u2019Connor, Inc. (O\u2019Connor), see <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass. 1, 10 n.17 (1979), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>conclude that the Superior Court has jurisdiction of this controversy, and the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), should have been denied. Accordingly we reverse and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The material facts, which are drawn from the written submissions of the parties, are not in dispute. In exchange for a loan made to O\u2019Connor,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a Massachusetts company in the wholesale and retail lumber business in Massachusetts, the plaintiff (the bank), which has a principal place of business in Boston,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> acquired a perfected security interest in O\u2019Connor\u2019s existing and after-acquired inventory. The underlying security agreement prohibited O\u2019Connor from disposing of its inventory other than in the ordinary course of its business.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The defendant (Hoover), a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Atlanta, Georgia, ships wood products to retailers and distributors in Massachusetts and elsewhere; among its customers was O\u2019Connor. O\u2019Connor, in financial difficulty, telephoned Hoover in the fall of 1990 to arrange the delivery of certain lumber in exchange for credit against an antecedent debt O\u2019Connor owed Hoover. After a series of phone calls and correspondence between Hoover and O\u2019Connor, it was agreed that the lumber would be delivered to Hoover in exchange for a credit memo to O\u2019Connor in the amount of $45,766.12. The inventory was transported to Hoover in early November, 1990 \u2014 a disposition of O\u2019Connor\u2019s inventory that the bank claims violated the se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>curity agreement. The bank demanded the return of the lumber; Hoover refused.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The bank responded by bringing suit in the Superior Court setting up the claim that Hoover was a converter of goods rightly belonging to the bank.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant is proper only when (i) the terms of the Massachusetts long-arm statute, G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3, are met and (ii) the constitutional requirements of due process are satisfied. See <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass. at 5-6. It is the plaintiff who has the burden of proving that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant. See, e.g., <em>Droukas </em>v. <em>Divers Training Academy, Inc., </em>375 Mass. 149, 151 (1978); <em>Kleinerman </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 819, 820 (1989). We accept as true the uncontroverted facts that appear in the materials presented to the Superior Court. See, e.g., <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Wilhelm Loh Wetzlar Optical Mach. GmbH Co. KG, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 14, 16 (1988); <em>Maker </em>v. <em>Bermingham, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 971, 972 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We turn to the question whether Hoover was transacting business in Massachusetts. Section 3 <em>(a) </em>of G. L. c. 223A, as amended by St. 1969, c. 623, grants jurisdiction \u201cover a person ... as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person\u2019s . . . transacting any business in this commonwealth.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The Supreme Judicial Court has read the \u201ctransacting any business\u201d language of \u00a7 3(a) broadly, \u201cin keeping with our view that the Massachusetts long-arm statute \u2018functions as \u201can assertion of jurisdiction over the person to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the United States.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Tatro </em>v. <em>Manor Care, Inc., </em>416 Mass. 763, 771 (1994), quoting from <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass. at 6. \u201cAlthough an isolated (and minor) transaction with a Massachusetts resident may be insufficient, generally the purposeful and successful solicitation of business from residents of the Commonwealth . . . will suffice to satisfy [the \u201ctransacting any business\u201d] requirement.\u201d <em>Tatro </em>v. <em>Manor Care, Inc., supra </em>at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Hoover emphasizes that it has no office, agents, or assets in Massachusetts, and there is no allegation or evidence it advertised here. What Hoover overlooks is the substantial volume of business it did with O\u2019Connor in Massachusetts. The exhibits filed by the bank in opposition to the motion to dismiss show that, from April through August of 1990, Hoover, in more than thirty separate transactions, shipped lumber to O\u2019Connor in Massachusetts. The aggregate sales price of those shipments was more than $375,000. Hoover\u2019s business with O\u2019Connor was hardly an \u201cisolated transaction.\u201d Contrast <em>Droukas </em>v. <em>Divers Training Academy, Inc., </em>375 Mass. at 154. To the contrary, this volume of business reveals a \u201cpurposeful and successful solicitation of business from residents of the Commonwealth . . . ,\u201d <em>Tatro </em>v. <em>Manor Care, Inc., supra </em>at 767, and, contrary to the judge\u2019s ruling, satisfies the \u201ctransacting any business\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">We turn to the \u201carising from\u201d clause in \u00a7 3(a): whether the alleged conversion <em>arose from </em>Hoover\u2019s transaction of business in the Commonwealth. In <em>Tatro </em>v. <em>Manor Care, Inc., </em>416 Mass. at 770-771, the Supreme Judicial Court held that the \u201carising from\u201d language in G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3 \u201cshould be interpreted as creating a \u2018but for\u2019 test.\u201d Rejecting the analysis in <em>Marino </em>v. <em>Hyatt Corp., </em>793 F.2d 427, 428-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>430 (1st Cir. 1986), and <em>Pizarro </em>v. <em>Hoteles Concorde Intl., C.A., </em>907 F.2d 1256 (1st Cir. 1990) (the issue is whether the business transacted \u201ccan be said to be the legal, or proximate cause of the injuries suffered by a plaintiff\u2019), the court followed the cases decided in the Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Adopting the language of <em>Lanier </em>v. <em>American Bd. of Endodontics, </em>843 F.2d 901, 909 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 926 (1988), the court said \u201ca claim arises from a defendant\u2019s transaction of business in the forum State if the claim was made possible by, or lies in the wake of, the transaction of business in the forum State.\u201d <em>Tatro </em>v. <em>Manor Care, Inc., supra </em>at 771. The fact that the claim sounds in tort and that the business transacted is contractual in character is not determinative, for \u201cthe contractual contact is a \u2018but for\u2019 causative factor for the tort since it brought the parties within tortious \u2018striking distance\u2019 of each other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770, quoting from <em>Prejean </em>v. <em>Sonatrach, Inc., </em>652 F.2d 1260, 1270 n.21 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Here, the return of the lumber by O\u2019Connor, and the subsequent alleged conversion by Hoover, would not have occurred but for Hoover\u2019s substantial volume of sales of lumber to O\u2019Connor in Massachusetts. Thus, it can fairly be said that the bank\u2019s claim against Hoover for conversion was \u201cmade possible by, or lies in the wake of,\u201d Hoover\u2019s transacting business in Massachusetts. Asserting jurisdiction in this case, as we do, is consistent with the well established view that the long-arm statute is an assertion of jurisdiction to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the United States. <em>Tatro </em>v. <em>Manor Care, Inc., supra </em>at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The fact that the bank was not a party to Hoover\u2019s lumber sales in Massachusetts is of no consequence; what matters is that Hoover regularly sold and delivered substantial quantities of lumber to O\u2019Connor in Massachusetts, and but for the ongoing contractual arrangements between Hoover and O\u2019Connor and the ensuing transfer of lumber from O\u2019Connor\u2019s inventory the bank would not have suffered any injury. Further, the bank\u2019s filed financing statements dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>closed to any interested party the bank\u2019s interest in O\u2019Connor\u2019s inventory.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The fact that Hoover was aware of O\u2019Connor\u2019s pressing financial difficulties only emphasizes the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Finally, we consider whether requiring Hoover to defend itself in Massachusetts comports with due process. The issue is \u201cwhether there was some minimum contact with the Commonwealth which resulted from an affirmative, intentional act of the defendant, such that it is fair and reasonable to require the defendant to come into the State to defend the action.\u201d <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass. at 7. We conclude that Hoover\u2019s due process rights will not be offended by requiring it to defend itself in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">As we have previously noted, Hoover\u2019s contacts with Massachusetts were not isolated or random events. Cf. <em>\u201cAutomatic\" Sprinkler Corp. of America </em>v. <em>Seneca Foods Corp., </em>361 Mass. 441 (1972) (purchase of single item from Massachusetts company, accompanied by partial payment, held insufficient to confer long-arm jurisdiction where it had little impact on Massachusetts commerce); <em>Droukas </em>v. <em>Divers Training Academy, Inc., </em>375 Mass. at 153-154 (isolated transaction where defendant\u2019s only business within Commonwealth was the single sale and shipment of two engines). Like the defendant in <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass. at 9, the defendant here had \u201cengaged in an enterprise of substantial dimension and duration with a party whose business headquarters . . . were ... in Massachusetts.\u201d As noted, its regular shipments of lumber to O\u2019Connor alone<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> amounted to more than $375,000 in a four-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>month period. \u201cHad . . . [Hoover] not desired to expose itself to a claim of Massachusetts jurisdiction, it was within its power to refuse to deal\u201d with O\u2019Connor. <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In view of the result we reach, we need not consider the bank\u2019s appeal from the denial of its second motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\">O\u2019Connor filed for bankruptcy on February 13, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">This fact is admitted in the answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The security agreement provided in relevant part as follows. \u201c[O\u2019Connor] shall not sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of [its inventory], other than the sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business, without the express written authorization of [the bank].

Workers </em>v. <em>163 Pleasant St. Corp., </em>960 F.2d 1080, 1088-1089 (1st Cir. 1992), appeal after remand, 987 F.2d 39 (1st Cir. 1993). See generally Hel<em>icopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>466 U.S. 408, 414-416 &amp; n.9 (1984). General jurisdiction, on the other hand, \u201cexists when the litigation is not directly founded on the defendant\u2019s forum-based contacts, but the defendant has nevertheless engaged in continuous and systematic activity, unrelated to the suit, in the forum state.\u201d <em>United Elec. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>Workers </em>v. <em>163 Pleasant Street Corp., supra </em>at 1088.
