The case proceeded to trial in three phases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The instant appeal pertains to the manufacturers of surface treatment products, the so-called phase I. Four and one-half years after the initial complaint was filed, the phase I trial began in October, 1990. When the case went to the jury, only two of fifty-five original defendants remained, United States Gypsum Company (USG) and United States Mineral Products Company (USM).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The city based USG\u2019s liability on breach of implied warranty of merchantability and negligence; USM\u2019s liability was based on negligence, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, and nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The trial consumed forty-five days and produced a transcript in excess of 10,000 pages. The city offered thirty-eight witnesses and introduced hundreds of exhibits, which comprise almost 2,000 of the 14,000 pages in the record appendix. After allowing USM\u2019s motion for directed verdicts on the city\u2019s express warranty and nuisance claims, the case against both USG and USM went to the jury on the issues of product identification, liability, and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Following a day and a half of deliberation, the jury found, in the form of answers to special questions, in favor of USG on the threshold issue of product identification with respect to all the city\u2019s buildings except the Egleston Square Branch Library Building (Egleston Square), and in favor of USG on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the issue of liability with respect to Egleston Square.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury, after determining that USM\u2019s product had been installed in City Hall but not in the Boston City Hospital Administration Building, found in favor of USM on all claims of liability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The city presses a number of issues on appeal: (1) that the judge demonstrated bias against the city by making prejudicial comments, striking documents, and restricting the scope of the city\u2019s expert testimony and (2) that the judge committed several errors in his jury instructions on the defendants\u2019 postsale duty to warn, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, and other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">After careful review of the transcript, exhibits, and other material comprising this voluminous record, we conclude that no error was committed as would cause us to reverse the judgment entered below.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Before we address the merits of each issue, a short preface is imperative. It cannot be gainsaid that \u201c[tjrial judges should refrain as far as reasonably possible from making critical comments before the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>380 Mass. 840, 847 (1980). The patience, skill, and temperament exemplified by trial judges like Justices Francis J. Quirico and Henry T. Lummus were conspicuously absent here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With that said, we now can confidently say that the city\u2019s ship sank not by the judge\u2019s torpedo but from the lack of sufficient evidentiary proof to keep it afloat.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>1. <em>Allegations of bias of trial judge. </em>As is evident from the number of exhibits, witnesses, and days of trial, this was a mammoth case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial judge managed the case for four and a half years, supervising an extensive discovery schedule and ruling on scores of motions. The city complains primarily that the trial judge\u2019s comments during trial prejudiced the jury and deprived it of a fair and unbiased trial. In making this argument, the city painstakingly cites numerous comments made by the judge during the course of the trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Appropriate participation by the trial judge is crucial to ensuring a fair trial for both parties. \u201c \u2018[A] first-rate trial judge will find and tread the narrow path that lies between meddlesomeness on the one hand and ineffectiveness and impotence on the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>363 Mass. 513, 519 (1973), quoting from Lummus, The Trial Judge 19-21 (1937). See also <em>Adoption of Seth, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 343, 350 (1990). A close reading of the transcript in the instant case does not demonstrate that the judge impermissibly \u201cplayed a partisan or overzealous role or expressed his opinion on the facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>389 Mass. 411, 423 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The comments cited by the city as evidence of bias fall into essentially two categories. First, there are comments that were made out of the presence of the jury, either at sidebar, during a bench conference, or during posttrial hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ings. These range from the merely innocuous<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to the arguably tactless.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The city argues that we should infer from such comments not only that the judge was in fact biased but that he would not hesitate to make such comments in front of the jury. This theory not only would obviate the need for sidebar and bench conferences but misperceives the basis for the appeal, i.e., that the judge\u2019s behavior prejudiced the jury. More to the point, the city presents an endless recitation of judicial comment that constitutes, at best, \u201ca show of evanescent irritation \u2014 a modicum of quick temper that must be allowed even judges.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meadows, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 534, 536 (1992), quoting from <em>Offutt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>348 U.S. 11, 17 (1954). Ultimately, no fatal prejudice could have resulted from such comments since they were made outside the presence of the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>389 Mass. at 423; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cresta, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 560, 564 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Second, the city cites a number of comments made before the jury by the trial judge that it claims manifests a prejudicial bias against it. For example, during the testimony of the city\u2019s expert Victor Hagan, the judge repeatedly used the phrase \u201coff the top of [his] head\u201d in his references to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the witness was relying on as his basis of damages for asbestos removal costs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The city asserts that the use of this phrase fatally undermined Hagan\u2019s credibility before the jury. We disagree. On the contrary, the transcript reveals that the judge\u2019s overriding concern was to facilitate the presentation of damages evidence to the jury, not to indicate his views on the evidence. Contrast <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Corp., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 931 (1981). We think, in these circumstances, any resultant harm due to the repetition of the phrase was insufficient to taint the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The city also claims that prejudice resulted when the judge told the city\u2019s witness Laurence Venezia to step down from the stand because he was not prepared to testify.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As with the comments on the Hagan testimony, the transcript does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>not bear out the city\u2019s claim that this dealt a mortal wound to the city\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Finally, in what might be read to be the most acute example of improper judicial comment, the city claims that the judge\u2019s comments regarding an expert witness, one Steven Lindsey, an acoustical engineer, served to undermine his credibility in the eyes of the jury.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The city\u2019s characterization of these and other comments as prejudicial is, for the most part, overdrawn. Indeed, many of the comments challenged on appeal could be interpreted several ways, especially since \u201c[t]he transcript. . . does not disclose the manner or tone of counsel or judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>363 Mass. at 521. It bears repeating that this was an inordinately lengthy trial, with the concomitant multitudinous exhibits and witnesses, and that a certain degree of \u201cjudicial displeasure\u201d may have arisen, perhaps out of concern by the judge that the jury be presented with evidence clearly and efficiently.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meadows, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. at 535. While the judge may have made an occasional gratuitous or improper remark in front of the jury, we do not think that, in the context of these lengthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>proceedings, a sufficient basis appears to support the city\u2019s claim that it was deprived of a fair and impartial trial. Cf. <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Weckstein, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 944, 945 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">As to the cumulative impact of the \u201cbiased\u201d comments catalogued by the city in its appeal, the instructions given cured any adverse inferences the jury might have drawn. See <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Source Perrier, S.A., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 561, 572 (1990), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">2. <em>Evidentiary rulings. </em>The city argues that the judge improperly struck documents and restricted testimony offered by it, thereby eviscerating its case and further demonstrating his bias. For example, the city sought to introduce eighty-three separate documents on the issue of USG\u2019s knowledge of the hazards of asbestos; the court permitted only twenty-one to be admitted in evidence. On the issue of USM\u2019s knowledge of the hazards of asbestos, the court excluded eighteen documents and admitted forty-one. Many of the documents ultimately excluded had already been received in evidence. It is well-settled, however, that a judge may reconsider the admission of incompetent evidence and \u201cstrike it out, provided no hardship befalls the party introducing it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>363 Mass. at 518. The city cannot point to, nor do we discern, any hardship resulting from the exclusion of the contested documents that was not compensated for by the documents that <em>were </em>admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The city also complains that the judge precluded a nonexpert witness, James L. Hubbard, from testifying as to the results of an \u201casbestos abrasion test\u201d he had conducted in several city buildings. The city takes issue with a host of other evidentiary rulings relating to documents and testimony that, it asserts, collectively minimized the jury\u2019s perception of the serious nature of the case and were erroneous as matter of law. There was no reversible error committed by the judge in his evidentiary rulings, a commendable feat in a trial this long.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The trial judge has both the discretion and the responsibility to exclude irrelevant, cumulative, or repetitive evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durning, </em>406 Mass. 485, 495 (1990); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 482 (1991). Moreover, the determination as to the relevancy and competency of evidence is \u201ca matter on which the opinion of the trial judge will be accepted on review except for palpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>386 Mass. 466, 470 (1982), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 463 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In the context of such a leviathan case, the judge was reasonable in limiting the admission of what can only be deemed cumulative evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Both parties were repeatedly reminded of the need to present relevant evidence in a manner that would expedite the already lengthy proceedings and not unnecessarily burden or confuse the jury. Comments by the judge to the jury throughout the trial reflect the judge\u2019s desire to facilitate the presentation, in particular, of damages evidence. Contrary to the city\u2019s assertions that public policy disfavors the exclusion of evidence, a trial judge may permissibly exclude irrelevant or redundant evidence, either upon objection or sua sponte. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 4.3, at 130-133 (6th ed. 1994). See Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 403.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>363 Mass. at 516-519.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">3. <em>Jury instructions. </em>As a final matter, the city contends that the judge erred in his instructions to the jury with respect to (1) implied warranty, (2) duty of care, and (3) post-sale duty to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The city takes issue with an aspect of the judge\u2019s charge on implied warranty. That charge was as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">\u201cThe duty to warn extends only to such dangers or defects about which the manufacturer either actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>knew about [or] which it reasonably should have known. The term \u2018should have known\u2019 means that the manufacturer is held to that level of knowledge which the expert in the particular industry had or in view of the state of the medical and scientific knowledge in general should have had at that particular point in time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In the circumstances of this case that instruction was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The city claims that this instruction set out the wrong standard for the defendants\u2019 conduct in that it allowed the jury to consider evidence of state of the art, i.e., state of medical and scientific knowledge available at the time of the sale.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>391 Mass. 407, 413 (1984); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Monarch Mach. Tool Co., </em>413 Mass. 205 (1992). The city maintains that case law and the nature of the tort preclude consideration of state of the art and that, if the product is defective, conduct is irrelevant. See <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342, 355 (1983) (focus is on \u201cwhether the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous and not on the conduct of . . . the seller\u201d). The city relies principally on language in <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., supra </em>at 413, that states that \u201c[t]he vendor is presumed to have been fully informed at the time of the sale of all risks. <em>The state of the art is irrelevant, as is the culpability of the </em>defendant\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">It is not necessary, however, for us to decide whether the <em>Hayes </em>dicta, repeated in a footnote in <em>Simmons </em>(413 Mass. at 207-208 n.3), means that, regardless of what an ordinarily prudent vendor-manufacturer actually knows, should have known, or could have reasonably foreseen, liability attaches for all risks associated with the product, whether undiscov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ered or undiscoverable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It may well be that consistent with that Supreme Judicial Court language that \u201cstate of the art is irrelevant,\u201d the adequacy of the warning is based on whether the dangers were scientifically discoverable, even though such discovery had not been made at the time the product was put on the market.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In any event, at trial, the city never took the position that evidence of state of the art is irrelevant. The instruction as given was not inappropriate in these circumstances.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The city also claims that the judge erred in preliminarily informing the jury on the sixth day of trial that the principal liability issue in a negligence case is what a reasonable person in the position of the defendants knew about the foreseeable hazards of their asbestos-containing products. The judge cured any potential error when he gave his complete charge immediately prior to deliberations. The judge stated that the duty of care is what the ordinary, reasonably prudent manufacturer knew or reasonably \u201cwould or should have known\u201d about the risks inherent in its product. <em>Back </em>v. <em>Wickes Corp., </em>375 Mass. 633, 643 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The city\u2019s final contention is that the judge erred by refusing to instruct the jury that the defendants had a continuing postsale duty to warn under a negligence theory. The city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>maintains that this duty was reaffirmed in <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., supra. </em>We disagree. The <em>Hayes </em>court stated clearly that it has <em>never </em>suggested \u201cthat a manufacturer has a duty to advise purchasers about post-sale safety improvements that have been made to a [product] that was reasonably safe at the time of sale.\u201d 391 Mass. at 411. Cf. <em>doCanto </em>v. <em>Amtek, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 776, 784-785 &amp; n.9 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Phases II and III, involving manufacturers of pipe and boiler insulation and floor tiles, respectively, either have been settled or dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The city alleged that USG\u2019s acoustical ceiling materials were installed in four city buildings (Egleston Square Branch Library, Charles Taylor School, West End Branch Library, and North End Branch Library) and that these products contained asbestos, rendering them unreasonably dangerous for use.

See Mass.R.Civ.P. 46, 365 Mass. 811 (1974). The absence of a request for a mistrial or of a clear challenge to the totality of the judge\u2019s conduct or comments might also indicate that the comments were not perceived to be significantly prejudicial when they were made. See in this regard <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>380 Mass. 840, 846, 848 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\">See in this regard Lummus, The Trial Judge (1937).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The size of the record appendix (twenty-nine volumes) and supplemental appendix (five volumes) merits comment. While we recognize that an appeal based on judicial bias typically requires a review of the record in toto, we question whether the appendix in the instant case includes extraneous material. Mass.R.A.P. 18(b), par. 2, as amended, 378 Mass. 941 (1979). Indeed, this case invites comparison with a series of cases in the First Circuit that have attempted to discourage by way of assessing double costs the filing of unnecessarily lengthy briefs. See <em>In re M.S.V., Inc., </em>892 F.2d 5 (1st Cir. 1989), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The city\u2019s brief and reply brief, together with its postargument correspondence, allege several hundred examples of allegedly biased comments and rulings made by the judge during the course of the trial. We reprint selections of the transcript in an effort to provide some guidance as to what might be construed as evidence of bias. See <em>Gauntlett </em>v. <em>Medical Parameters, Inc., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 90 n.2 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The city claims that the judge manifested his bias by unfairly criticizing the city\u2019s attorneys who were from New York.

And I am going to stop either examination or cross-examination when I feel that we are wasting time . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\">For example, a portion of the evidence the city sought to introduce through the excluded USM documents was actually conceded by USM\u2019s president during his testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 403 provides as follows: \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Pretermitting whether the city\u2019s objection in this regard satisfied the requirements of Mass.R.Civ.P. 51(b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974), we note that the thrust of its objection to the charge actually went to the <em>scope </em>of the standard of state of the art evidence, not that state of the art is irrelevant, as now argued by the city on appeal.
