Western moved to dismiss the count against it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This is an appeal by Quincy from the allowance of Western\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appeal before us is interlocutory as it does not appear that the judge entered an order under Mass.R.Civ.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974). We therefore dismiss Quincy\u2019s appeal but, by way of dictum, indicate our views since there appear to be no recent appellate cases involving actions on fiduciaries\u2019 bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">1. <em>Action in the Superior Court. </em>The bond of a conservator is payable to a judge of the Probate Court on certain conditions. G. L. c. 205, \u00a7 1. The conditions of the bond here relevant are contained in G. L. c. 205, \u00a7 1, par. 6, cl. 2: \u201cTo manage and dispose of all such property according to law and for the best interests of the ward, and faithfully to perform his trust in relation to such property . . . .\u201d An action on the bond is the proper way to obtain redress for improper conduct of a conservator. G. L. c. 205, \u00a7 29 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See 2 Newhall, Settlement of Estates \u00a7 262 (1958); <em>Long </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>182 Mass. 332, 333-334 (1902).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">There are two routes to an action on a fiduciary bond. Section 7A of G. L. c. 205 permits a direct action by a petition in equity in the Probate Court \u201cby any party interested in his own name.\u201d An alternate route, which \u201cshall be brought in the [Sjuperior [Cjourt\u201d under \u00a7 30 of G. L. c. 205, is more complicated. To understand the procedure, a close examination of the statutory provisions set forth in G. L. c. 205 is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Under certain conditions, set forth in three sections, \u00a7\u00a7 20-22,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> none of which here applies, actions on bonds of executors or administrators may be brought in the Superior Court without authorization of a probate judge. Where none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>of the three sections is applicable, \u00a7 23 provides: \u201cIf the probate court, upon representation of a person interested in an estate, finds that the executor or administrator has failed in any manner not specified in the three preceding sections to perform the conditions of his bond, it may authorize any . . . person aggrieved by such maladministration to bring an action on the bond.\u201d Failure to obtain such authorization is a good defense, <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Rogers, 2 </em>Gray 175, 177 (1854), but objection must be taken at the first stage of the proceedings; otherwise, authorization is presumed to have been duly given unless the contrary appears from the pleadings. <em>McCoole </em>v. <em>Mackintosh, </em>288 Mass. 115, 124 (1934). 2 Newhall, Settlement of Estates \u00a7 267 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Although authorization was not here obtained,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contrary to Western\u2019s contention, the defect is not one of subject matter jurisdiction. As we have indicated, in this kind of a case authorization of a probate judge may be presumed. Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent or authorization, see <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, </em>384 Mass. 123, 130 (1981), and a probate judge\u2019s authorization is merely a condition precedent to bringing an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">We consider this a case where, on request, it would be appropriate for the Superior Court judge to ask the Chief Administrative Justice to transfer the case, or the judge, or both, to the Probate Court to determine whether authorization should be granted or whether to allow the case to proceed in accordance with \u00a7 7A, where authorization by a judge is not required.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As pointed out in <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, supra </em>at 131, G. L. c. 211B expresses \u201cthe legislative intent to minimize subject matter jurisdictional concerns.\u201d A fortiori, where the concerns are less than jurisdictional, dismissal need not be the solution in cases where a transfer would \u201cpromote the orderly and effective adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>tration of the judicial system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, quoting from St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">2. <em>Failure to state a claim. </em>Western claims that Jackson did not breach the condition of his bond and, moreover, the ward did not suffer loss because Quincy paid for the damage suffered. The action against Jackson alleges that he negligently managed the property, causing damage. Such an allegation seems to fall within G. L. c. 205, \u00a7 1, par. 6, cited earlier. On this pleading, we cannot say that \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [its] claim which would entitle [it] to relief.\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977), quoting from <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Western\u2019s claim that Quincy cannot recover is unpersuasive. Western contends that Quincy stands in the shoes of the ward, and by reason of Quincy\u2019s payment the ward has suffered no loss. Thus, Jackson\u2019s obligation was met by securing or maintaining homeowner\u2019s insurance. As pointed out by Quincy, this argument would seem to preempt any subrogation efforts by an insurer against a conservator. Again, on the basis of <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, supra </em>at 98, 104, we cannot state that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">As we indicated earlier, because the appeal is interlocutory, it is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-15\">The judge did not give the reason for his dismissal of the count against Western.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Section 29 provides that actions on the bonds payable by conservators \u201cmay be put in suit by order of the probate court for the benefit of any person interested, and the proceedings in such action shall be conducted in like manner as is provided relative to actions on bonds given by executors or administrators.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b613-9\">These sections permit action without authorization of a probate judge where the fiduciary neglects upon demand to pay amounts for which there is a judgment or decree: \u00a7 20 (actions by creditors), \u00a7 21 (actions by creditors of insolvent estates), and \u00a7 22 (actions by next of kin). Quincy relies on \u00a7 20 to permit its action without authorization, but that section by its terms applies only to creditors who have recovered judgment, see <em>Long </em>v. <em>Copeland, supra </em>at 333, and Quincy has not recovered a judgment. We need not consider, therefore, whether Quincy is a creditor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Western\u2019s motion to dismiss \u2014 no answer to the complaint having been filed, see Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b), 365 Mass. 755 (1974) \u2014 did indicate that authorization had not been obtained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Since there appears to have been no final judgment, the judge, of course, may change his order dismissing the count. <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>306 Mass. 597, 601 (1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
