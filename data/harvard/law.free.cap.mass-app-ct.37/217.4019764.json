Upon the denial of his application, the landlord appealed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the Superior Court, which affirmed the board\u2019s denial. His appeal to this court is from that judgment of affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In denying the certificate of eviction, the board affirmed a hearing examiner\u2019s finding that the amount of abatement to which the tenant was entitled for substandard housing conditions exceeded the amount of the rent arrearage due the landlord. The landlord, proceeding under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claims that the board\u2019s decision was based on an error of law and was in excess of its statutory authority in so far as it adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s findings in which he calculated the nonpayment of rent based upon arrearages between May, 1989, and July, 1990, the time of the hearing, while computing the abatement for the period between January 21, 1986, the date the landlord had notice of ongoing State Sanitary Code violations, and the hearing date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The landlord also argues that the board\u2019s decision was predicated upon erroneously admitted evidence and improper procedure and was not based on substantial evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The landlord acknowledges that the board\u2019s regulation 61-02<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides an absolute defense to an eviction in the event that violations, known to the landlord, are found, but he ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>gues that the use of the words \u201cthe time in question\u201d in that regulation limits the abating conditions to the period during which the rental arrearages are claimed by the landlord. The landlord further contends that the board acted outside its jurisdiction \u2014 that it effectively created a counterclaim by interpreting regulation 61-03<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> independently of regulation 61-02 and conducting a fair value analysis<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for a period outside that of the claimed arrearages. He maintains that \u201cthe inescapable result\u201d of the board\u2019s interpretation is that the tenant could \u201cwithhold rent in futuro without risking the threat of eviction even if the premises were in perfect condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AK5A\">Without here reviewing the evidence, we conclude that the hearing examiner\u2019s finding of State Sanitary Code violations in the tenant\u2019s residential unit known to the landlord before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>and during the period of rent withholding<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and his determination that the landlord was not denied reasonable access to the premises are substantially supported by the hearing testimony and exhibits. That conclusion, coupled with our decision, discussed below, that improper hearing procedure has not been shown, ordinarily would end our analysis with an indication that the certificate of eviction properly was denied. However, since the issues extending beyond the propriety of the denial of the certificate of eviction are relevant to the amount of rent due from the tenant and potentially implicate the rights of other landlords and tenants, we discuss the landlord\u2019s argument that the board exceeded its authority by computing part of the abatement to which the tenant is entitled on the basis of the period preceding that during which rent was withheld. See <em>Altschuler </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Bd., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 452, 460 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">1. <em>The abatement period. </em>The enabling statute, in effect, requires that a landlord seeking to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent first apply to the board for a certificate of eviction which is to issue only upon proof that \u201cthe tenant has failed to pay the rent to which the landlord is entitled.\u201d St. 1976, c. 36, \u00a7 9(a)(1) and <em>(b). </em>Regulation 61-02 (see note 5, supra) requires that the landlord\u2019s application be denied in the face of a tenant defense based upon health code violations if the board makes certain findings, including that the premises were in violation of such codes \u201cduring the time in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The landlord does not contest, and in his brief implicitly concedes, the right of the board to condition rent entitlement on habitability. See <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>383 Mass. 152 (1981); <em>Altschuler </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Bd., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 452. Instead, he advocates a narrow reading of the term \u201cduring the time in question\u201d to limit abatements based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>upon code violations to the period during which rent was unpaid.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This reading not only fails to accord to the board\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations the substantial deference to which it is entitled, absent arbitrary or unreasonable construction, see <em>H. N. Gorin &amp; Leeder Mgmt. Co. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of </em>Cambridge, 18 Mass. App. Ct. 272, 276 (1984), but it also disregards other provisions in the regulatory scheme. Regulation 61-03 requires the board to order the tenant to pay rent determined on a fair value basis \u201cduring the time such condition existed\u201d if it finds that \u201cthe landlord has made reasonable efforts to repair such condition.\u201d The previous relevant reference to \u201csuch condition\u201d appears in regulation 61-02(b), which predicates the denial of a certificate of eviction on a landlord\u2019s knowing \u201cof such condition <em>prior </em>to the tenant being in arrears in rent\u201d (emphasis supplied). This regulation presumes the existence of the offending condition during a period preceding the rental nonpayment. Moreover, our reading is consonant with the general principle that a tenant is entitled to a rental abatement from the time when a landlord first learns of substandard conditions. See <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Begin, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 306 (1977). Certainly a tenant is not to be denied the full amount of such abatement by reason of her having paid rent to which the landlord may not have been entitled during part of the period in which substandard conditions existed. That the determination of an abatement entitlement might result in a tenant receiving a credit against future rental obligations to the landlord does not offend any accepted concept of fairness or the policy objective of the rent control statute of reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ulating and controlling eviction of tenants. See St. 1976, c. 36, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">2. <em>The hearing examiner\u2019s conduct. </em>The hearing examiner noted in his report that during the course of the proceedings he had ruled that the record would remain open for a period of one week following the hearing \u201cto allow the submission of certain documents by the representatives of the landlord and the tenant.\u201d Although he determined that documents submitted by the tenant within a week following the close of the hearing were unrelated to the purpose for which the record had been left open, he nevertheless concluded they were relevant and included them in his report as exhibits. After review of the evidence, the hearing examiner also determined that \u201c[b]ecause documents submitted by the landlord and tenant [] were not sufficient to make comprehensive and conclusive findings regarding the abatement claims ... a careful examination of the Inspectional Services file for the property was necessary.\u201d (The inspectional services department is an agency of the city of Cambridge.) As a result of his independent review, he included eight of that agency\u2019s documents in the record as exhibits. In a letter dated approximately ten weeks after the hearing and two months before he filed his report, the hearing examiner notified the landlord and tenant of his posthearing activities, specifically identifying the documents added to the record and afforded the parties \u201ca period of ten days ... to submit documentation or argument in rebuttal, or alternately, to request a further hearing.\u201d The landlord objected to this procedure but did not submit further documentation or argument or seek a further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">On review of the record we detect no error or evidence of bias in the hearing examiner\u2019s actions and decision. After a one-day hearing in which documentary evidence comprising, as here, approximately twenty-eight exhibits, some with multiple parts, and covering the history of a contentious tenant-landlord relationship over a four and one half year period, it is not surprising that a hearing examiner, upon review, should conclude there may be missing elements in the evidence. Faced with the regulatory imperative that \u201c[tjhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>shall be a full and fair open proceeding to determine whether . . . a certificate of eviction [shall be] issued\u201d (under the board\u2019s regulation 35-01), it was not an abuse of discretion for the hearing examiner to provide a complete and comprehensive record. Analogous regulatory systems promote hearing officer amplification of the record in the interests of completeness and fairness. See 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.02( 10)(g)(5)(1993)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.944 (1993).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The dictates of fairness were well preserved by the hearing examiner\u2019s offer, after supplementing the record, to receive further documentation, argument, or requests for a further hearing. He did not rely on secret evidence. There was no violation of the general principle that \u201c[w]hatever actually plays a part in the decision should be known to the parties and subject to being controverted.\u201d Schwartz, Administrative Law \u00a7 7.13, at 369 (2d ed. 1984). To the extent the hearing examiner\u2019s activities constituted outside consultation, he acted within the spirit of the board\u2019s regulation 36-04,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which permits such consultation outside the hearing provided the parties are given an opportunity to participate. Here, the hearing examiner issued a clear invitation to participate. Cf. <em>New York Central R.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>354 Mass. 332, 336 (1968). <em>Norway Cafe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 37 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The executive director of the board subsequently reviewed the hearing examiner\u2019s actions and determined that there was no violation of its regulations applicable to the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>examiner or the conduct of the hearing. The board, by its decision, implicitly confirmed that opinion, and again we accord considerable deference to that determination. We note that the landlord does not otherwise contest the admissibility, substantiality, or validity of the additional documentation. See <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 110, 118 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Statute 1976, c. 36, \u00a7 10(a), as amended by St. 1985, c. 399, \u00a7 3, provides in pertinent part that \u201c[j]udicial review of adjudicatory decisions shall be conducted in accordance with section fourteen of chapter thirty A of the General Laws.\u201d See <em>Amari </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge, </em>21 Mass.
