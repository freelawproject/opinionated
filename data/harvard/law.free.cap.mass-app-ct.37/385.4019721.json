On August 10, 1990, the defendant and several companions were drinking at a bar, Yesterday\u2019s Olde Tyme Tavern, in Everett. At about midnight, the victim, Michael Bolster, and two female companions, Laurie O\u2019Brien and Vicky Ciani, arrived at the bar. The defendant\u2019s girlfriend reported to the defendant that the victim made a derogatory remark to her. There was a brawl. The victim was struck with a beer bottle, which seriously cut his face. The defendant admitted at trial that he was present at the bar. He asserted, however, that he did not hit the victim with the bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">At trial, Vicky Ciani testified she saw the defendant raise a beer bottle in his hand and crash it over the victim\u2019s head. She was the only person to testify to this. None of the other witnesses at trial saw who struck the victim. Two additional witnesses to the incident, Leonard Palmer and Peter Molbeck, both of whom had been sitting with the defendant and his girlfriend in a booth, did not testify. Their anticipated testimony and the behavior of the assistant district attorney were the subject of a motion for a new trial, which is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>2. <em>The defendant's right to a fair trial. </em>At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, two prospective defense witnesses, who had not appeared at trial, testified to the following.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 1, 1991, about one month before the trial date, the prosecutor went to the bar for a view. While there, he encountered Palmer and Molbeck. Palmer and Molbeck were prepared to testify at the original trial that the defendant was not the assailant. Each stated that the prosecutor told him, \u201cYou better not show up in court,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tear you apart,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll end up putting you away too.\u201d Subsequently, Palmer and Molbeck were approached by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, and both refused to testify at trial on behalf of the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In ruling on the new trial motion, if \u201cthe original criminal proceeding was infected with prejudicial constitutional error, the motion judge has no discretion to deny a motion for a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>385 Mass. 497, 503 (1982). The defendant argues that his right to a fair trial was abridged because the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, threatening two witnesses, violated the defendant\u2019s due process right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to prepare an adequate defense. See <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95 (1972). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The judge, who also presided at the trial, found;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">\u201cEven if [he] did make the statement, \u2018If you show up at trial, I\u2019ll tear you apart and I\u2019ll end up putting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>you in jail\u2019 (which I am inclined to believe he did make with braggadocio), this was not the reason Palmer and Molbeck refused to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">\u201cPalmer refused to testify for the Commonwealth because of advice given to him by court-appointed counsel; Molbeck did not testify because he was not called and because he did not want to be convicted due to his involvement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Although he labeled the statement \u201cbraggadocio,\u201d a fair reading of the judge\u2019s conclusions is that the statement was in fact made to the prospective witnesses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s threats were not the reason the witnesses did not testify. \u201c[I]n light of the great disparity between the posture [of the assistant district attorney who had control over bringing the charges] and that of a witness in these circumstances, the unnecessarily strong terms used by the [district attorney] could well have exerted such duress on the witness\u2019 mind as to preclude him from making a free and voluntary choice whether or not to testify.\u201d <em>Webb </em>v. Texas, 409 U.S. at 98. The judge never considered the link between the threat by the prosecutor and the witnesses\u2019 fear of prosecution. That this was not considered by the judge, is made evident by his characterization of Molbeck\u2019s testimony as emphasized below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">THE COURT: \u201cYou\u2019ve given two reasons for not testifying. One because you did not want to be convicted because of your involvement, the second <em>different </em>reason because of what [the prosecutor] said to you. Now which is the reason for which you did not testify?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">THE WITNESS: \u201cFirst I was going to. I was a little worried about it but it didn\u2019t bother me. But then when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>he approached me he made me nervous so I decided to back out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Unquestionably, the witnesses\u2019 fear of prosecution is so thoroughly intertwined with the prosecutor\u2019s powerful threat of prosecution, that the fear is subsumed into the threat; the fear and the threat are not different, but are, for all practical purposes, indistinguishable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>535 F.2d 223 (3d Cir. 1976) (witnesses\u2019 refusal to testify, in response to threats from prosecutor of perjury and drug charges, deprived the defendant of his right to present evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>dence). We cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s actions did not influence the decisions of the two prospective witnesses not to testify. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colantonio, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 299, 303 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In Massachusetts, a defendant must also, in asserting a loss of his right to a fair trial, show prejudice \u2014 \u201cthat the prosecutor\u2019s actions caused a loss of material and favorable testimony.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snook, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 955, 959 (1990). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 U.S. 858, 867 (1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant has made an adequate showing that the testimony of the two witnesses would have been favorable to him. Molbeck testified at the hearing on the new trial motion that he physically held the defendant back during the altercation at the bar and heard glass break (inferentially the glass that hurt the victim) at the time he was holding the defendant. The testimony was material and exculpatory. Exculpatory evidence is material if \u201cevaluated in the context of the entire record, [it] creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vieira, </em>401 Mass. 828, 832-833 (1988). The jury were entitled to determine the facts from all of the available evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">3. <em>The remedy. </em>A prosecutor\u2019s interference with a witness could, in some instances, be \u201cso threatening that a drastic sanction of dismissal should be imposed, as a warning to other prosecutors, without regard to the witness\u2019s actual reaction or to the nature of the testimony the witness might give.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snook, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 958. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, </em>396 Mass. 194, 198-199 (1985). In the context of a defendant\u2019s delayed arraignment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the Supreme Judicial Court has mandated a two-part test to determine the propriety of imposing the extreme sanction of dismissal. The test, we think, equally suitable to these circumstances, is whether \u201c[1] a defendant demonstrates actual prejudice to his case <em>and </em>[2] misconduct on the part of the Commonwealth which was intentionally undertaken as a means of obtaining a tactical advantage or undertaken with reckless disregard for known risks to the defendant\u2019s ability to mount a defense\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perito, </em>417 Mass. 674, 681-682 (1994), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Imbruglia, </em>377 Mass. 682, 688-691 (1979). The second part of the test is amply fulfilled and requires no additional discussion. Any possible prejudice to the defendant is not irreparable and is adequately cured by retrial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, </em>396 Mass. at 198 (\u201ca showing of irremediable harm to the defendant\u2019s opportunity to obtain a fair trial\u201d is ordinarily required). The evidence is not irretrievably lost and is now accessible to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>400 Mass. 283, 290 (1987) (\u201c[T]he public has a substantial interest in prosecuting those accused of crime and bringing the guilty to justice\u201d). Thus, in this case, particularly given the nature of the testimony at issue, we think that the ultimate sanction of dismissal would be excessive. There should, however, be a new trial, at which the attorneys and the judge, aware that the threats were made, may take adequate measures to offset any damage that may have resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aci\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-16\">defendant was acquitted on a charge of mayhem. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The Commonwealth argued that the defendant\u2019s appeal should be dismissed because the defendant failed to file a notice of appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial. A single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court subsequently allowed the filing of a late notice of appeal. See Mass.R.A.P. 14(b), as amended, 378 Mass. 939 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Because we reverse on the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct resulting in a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, we do not address the defendant\u2019s second claim of error; that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Moreover, we do not address, and treat as waived, the defendant\u2019s contention, brought for the first time on appeal, that his right to a speedy trial, see Mass.R.Crim.P. 36, 378 Mass. 909-914 (1979), was violated. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 205 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b419-8\">These witnesses also submitted affidavits in support of their allegations against the prosecutor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Molbeck was originally scheduled to testify for the defendant. At trial, unaware of the prosecutor\u2019s threats, the defendant\u2019s attorney represented to the court that Molbeck would refuse to testify because of fear of prosecution. Palmer was summonsed to testify for the Commonwealth. On the witness stand, with the advice of independent counsel, Palmer invoked his right under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution not to incriminate himself. The record does not disclose whether Palmer\u2019s counsel was aware of the prosecutor\u2019s threats at the time of trial. Both the defendant\u2019s attorney and the prosecutor who ultimately tried the case (not the prosecutor who had made the threats) were unaware of the threats at the time of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b420-9\">See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass. 650, 657-659 (1979) (State interference with defendant\u2019s access to potential witnesses is constitutionally offensive).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Our conclusion is supported, particularly, by the equivocal testimony of Molbeck at the hearing on the new trial motion. It is evident by his responses that Molbeck did not perceive a difference between those questions asked him by Turner\u2019s attorney and those asked by the Assistant District Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Molbeck testified on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">Q. \u201cAs a result of the statements made to you by . . . the Assistant District Attorney, did you change your mind about testifying on behalf of Bruce Turner?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">Q. \u201cWhy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">A. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get implicated, didn\u2019t want to go to jail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-12\">Q. \u201cDid you feel threatened or intimidated by the statements made to you \u2014 by the statement by [the assistant district attorney]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-13\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-14\">Q. \u201cWere you frightened that you would also be indicted if you testified on behalf of Bruce Turner?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-15\">A. \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-16\">On cross-examination, Molbeck testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-17\">Q. \u201cWere you in fear that in fact you may have had some involvement in this particular matter and that you would be prosecuted for it; is that correct, sir?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-18\">A. \u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-19\">Q. \u201c. . .
