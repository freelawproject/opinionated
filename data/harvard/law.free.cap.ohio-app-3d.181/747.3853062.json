He ultimately entered a plea of guilty to aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping, each punishable as first-degree felonies. On appeal, Morgan asserts that his convictions must be reversed because the indictment failed to allege the requisite culpable mental state for each of the three offenses. But because Morgan waived these alleged errors in the indictment by entering his plea of guilty to the offenses, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">\n<em>Morgan\u2019s Multi-Count Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">{\u00b6 2} From the facts stated in the indictment, the bill of particulars, and the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of facts at the plea hearing, it is clear that late on the evening of January 9, 2007, Morgan and three accomplices, each armed and wearing ski masks and gloves, forcibly entered a private residence. Morgan was armed with an SKIS assault rifle. Two victims were inside the home. To move the victims upstairs, Morgan fired his weapon into the floor. He then stood guard while the other invaders forced the victims to open a safe. The four perpetrators fled with $1,700 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>{\u00b6 3} A ten-count indictment charged Morgan and the others with aggravated burglary,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> burglary,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> aggravated robbery,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> robbery,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> kidnapping,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and accompanying firearm specifications. The indictment also alleged, in two counts, that Morgan had improperly discharged a firearm into a habitation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and had possessed a weapon while under a disability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">{\u00b6 4} Count one of the indictment alleged a violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(2), which proscribes aggravated burglary. The indictment alleged that Morgan, \u201cby force, stealth, or deception, trespassed in an occupied structure * * * when another person other than an accomplice of [Morgan was] present, with purpose to commit in the structure * * * a criminal offense, and at the time, [Morgan] had a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance on or about [his] person or under [his] control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">{\u00b6 5} In count five of the indictment, Morgan was charged with aggravated robbery as defined in R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). The indictment alleged that Morgan, \u201cin attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, to wit THEFT OF UNITED STATES CURRENCY BELONGING TO [a victim], or in fleeing immediately thereafter, had a deadly weapon on or about [his] person or under [his] control, and displayed, brandished, indicated possession or used the deadly weapon, to wit: A FIREARM.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">{\u00b6 6} And count seven charged Morgan with kidnapping as defined in R.C. 2905.01(A)(2). The indictment stated that Morgan had \u201cby force, threat, or deception, removed [a victim] from the place where she was found or restrained her of her liberty for the purpose of facilitating the commission of a felony, to wit: AGGRAVATED ROBBERY or flight thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">{\u00b6 7} On September 28, 2007, Morgan entered a plea of guilty to these three counts of the indictment. In exchange for Morgan\u2019s guilty plea and his promise to testify against a co-defendant, the state had dismissed seven other felony counts plus another separate prosecution for cocaine trafficking. The parties recommended to the trial court an agreed nine-year term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>{\u00b6 8} The trial court caused the prosecutor to recite the facts surrounding the offenses. Pursuant to Crim.R. 11(C), it then conducted a thorough colloquy with Morgan to ensure that his plea had been made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. The trial court accepted the pleas, found Morgan guilty, and imposed the agreed nine-year sentence of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">{\u00b6 9} Morgan\u2019s appointed appellate counsel reviewed the record on appeal and initially filed a no-error brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. </em>California.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On April 9, 2008, the Ohio Supreme Court released its decision in <em>State v. Colon (\u201cColon I </em>\u201d), holding that \u201c[w]hen an indictment fails to charge a mens rea element of a crime and the defendant fails to raise that defect in the trial court, the defendant has not waived the defect in the indictment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">{\u00b6 10} On July 23, 2008, with leave of this court, Morgan filed an amended brief claiming, in a single assignment of error, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter a judgment of conviction because the indictment failed to charge the culpable mental state of recklessness for the offenses of aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping. Relying on <em>Colon I, </em>he contends that his convictions must be reversed. Morgan does not contest the voluntariness of his plea. Rather, the gravamen of his argument is that the indictment failed to include essential elements of each offense, and therefore it was fatally defective, was void for lack of jurisdiction, and failed to charge criminal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">\n<em>Defective Indictments Under Colon</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>Colon I, </em>the defendant had been charged with robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). But the court found that \u201cthe indictment omitted a mens rea element for the actus reus element stated in subsection (2): \u2018Inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on another.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the robbery statute did not specify a degree of culpability for the act of attempting to inflict physical harm, and because the statute did not plainly indicate that strict liability is the mental standard, the catchall culpable mental state of recklessness applied.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">{\u00b6 12} Thus, the indictment was defective because it had failed to charge an essential element of the offense. The court concluded that an indictment that \u201cfailed to state the mens rea of recklessly for robbery resulted in structural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>error.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court further held that the defendant had not waived the issue, even though he had failed to raise the defect in the trial court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">{\u00b6 13} But upon reconsideration of its decision, the Supreme Court, in <em>State v. Colon (\u201cColon II\u201d), </em>narrowed the broad sweep of <em>Colon I </em>and stated that its holding was confined to the \u201cunique\u201d facts of that case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court clarified that a \u201cstructural-error analysis * * * is appropriate only in rare cases, such as <em>Colon I, </em>in which multiple errors at the trial follow the defective indictment.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court noted that \u201c[s]eldom will a defective indictment have this effect, and therefore, in most defective indictment cases, the court may analyze the error pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B) plain-error analysis.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus \u201cwhen a defendant fails to object to an indictment that is defective because the indictment did not include an essential element of the charged offense, a plain-error analysis is appropriate.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">{\u00b6 14} The court\u2019s decision to employ plain-error analysis is consistent with its long-established vindication of the waiver doctrine. That is, errors not raised in the trial court in the first instance may not be considered on appeal. The failure to draw the trial court\u2019s attention to possible error, by objection or otherwise, when the error could have been corrected or avoided, results in a waiver of the issue for purposes of appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, as in <em>Colon II, </em>when a defendant fails to preserve objections to a defective indictment during the course of a trial, the issues are forfeited and generally must be reviewed under \u201c \u2018a claim of plain error under Crim.R. 52(B).\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">{\u00b6 15} Morgan\u2019s appellate brief, filed in the immediate aftermath of the <em>Colon I </em>decision, urges us to find structural error in this case. At oral argument, Morgan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>acknowledged the impact of the <em>Colon II </em>decision but still maintained that defects in his indictment had constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">{\u00b6 16} On appeal, Morgan first argues that the aggravated-robbery count of his indictment is fatally flawed pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. </em>Lester.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Like Morgan, Lester had been indicted for aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). Unlike Morgan, Lester was convicted following a jury trial. Like the robbery indictment in <em>Colon I, </em>Lester\u2019s aggravated-robbery indictment lacked the culpable mental state of recklessness. Applying <em>Colon I, </em>we held that because the mens rea element had been omitted, Lester\u2019s conviction was also \u201cplagued by structural error,\u201d and we reversed the conviction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Morgan urges us to apply <em>State v. Lester </em>to reverse his aggravated-robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">{\u00b6 17} The state counters that <em>State v. Lester </em>is in conflict with the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Wharf}</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The state has appealed the <em>Lester </em>decision to the Supreme Court on this basis.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In <em>Wharf, </em>the court held that \u201cit is not necessary to prove a specific mental state regarding the deadly weapon element of the offense of robbery\u201d as charged in R.C. 2911.02(A)(1).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The robbery statute provided that \u201c[n]o person, in attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall * * * [h]ave a deadly weapon on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control.\u201d The Supreme Court in <em>Wharf </em>noted that, unlike the aggravated-robbery statute (at issue in <em>Lester </em>and here), \u201cno use, display, or brandishing of a weapon, or intent to do any of the aforementioned acts, is necessary according to the plain language of the [robbery] statute. Had the legislature so intended, it certainly could have required a level of conduct more severe than it did in order to show a violation of the statute. Thus, by employing language making mere possession or control of a deadly weapon, as opposed to actual use or intent to use, a violation, it is clear to us that the General Assembly intended that R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) be a strict liability offense.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">{\u00b6 18} The state argues that there is no distinction, for mens rea purposes, between the acts of possessing or controlling a deadly weapon during a theft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>offense and brandishing, displaying, or using a deadly weapon during a theft offense. Thus, it urges us to revisit <em>Lester </em>and to adopt the conclusion of other appellate courts that the <em>Colon </em>decisions are not applicable to a conviction for aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), because \u201c[t]he Ohio Supreme Court has previously found that an (A)(1) aggravated robbery is a strict liability offense,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and \u201cbecause a violation of that provision requires no intent beyond that required for the theft offense.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">{\u00b6 19} Morgan argues that his indictment for aggravated burglary is also defective under <em>Colon </em>because it did not identify the applicable mens rea of the predicate offense of trespass. He also contends that the kidnapping count of the indictment is similarly flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">{\u00b6 20} The state responds that a <em>Colon </em>analysis is inapplicable to an indictment charging aggravated burglary.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The state asserts, moreover, that the aggravated-burglary count of the indictment was sufficient to give Morgan notice of all the elements of the offense when it specified that he had committed a trespass offense. And, the state insists, an indictment that tracks the language of the statute setting forth the charged offense does not have to separately set forth the elements of a predicate offense.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The state also argues that the kidnapping count of the indictment does not run afoul of <em>Colon </em>because the kidnapping statute \u201cdoes set forth a mens rea: any of the purposes specifically set forth in the statute\u201d and in this case, that purpose was clearly identified as facilitating the aggravated robbery of Morgan\u2019s victims.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">{\u00b6 21} The state ultimately urges this court to apply the plain-error analysis of <em>Colon II </em>and to find that Morgan was not prejudiced by whatever defects were found within the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">\n<em>Morgan\u2019s Guilty Plea Waived His Defective-Indictment Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">{\u00b6 22} But we need not resolve Morgan\u2019s assignment of error under a plain-error analysis. We hold that Morgan\u2019s guilty plea waived the alleged defects in the indictment, including a failure to allege a culpable mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>{\u00b6 23} Unlike the defendant in the <em>Colon </em>cases, Morgan waived his right to a trial and entered pleas of guilty. \u201cThe plea of guilty is a complete admission of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In entering a guilty plea, a defendant \u201cis not simply stating that he did the discrete acts described in the indictment; he is admitting guilt of a substantive crime.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">{\u00b6 24} This court has long held that \u201c[t]he entry of a plea of guilty is a grave decision by an accused to dispense with a trial and allow the state to obtain a conviction without following the otherwise difficult process of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. * * * Entering a plea of guilty is \u2018conclusive. More is not required; the court has nothing to do but give judgment and sentence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">{\u00b6 25} Thus, when the defense or right asserted by a defendant relates solely to the capacity of the state to prove a defendant\u2019s factual guilt, it is subsumed by the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. \u201cWaiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a right, and waiver of a right \u2018cannot form the basis of any claimed error under Crim.R. 52(B).\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Therefore, a criminal defendant who pleads guilty is limited on appeal; \u201c \u2018[h]e may only attack the voluntary, [knowing,] and intelligent character of the guilty plea\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">{\u00b6 26} A guilty plea acts as a \u201cbreak in the chain of events\u201d preceding it in the criminal process.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Ohio Supreme Court has additionally held that a guilty plea breaks the chain between an alleged deprivation of important constitutionally guaranteed rights and a defendant\u2019s ability to vindicate those rights on appeal. A guilty plea waives, for example, the right to claim error arising from the denial of a motion to suppress a coerced confession,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> improper jury selection and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>denial of other pretrial motions,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and the deprivation of counsel at a preliminary-hearing.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>State v. Barton, </em>the Supreme Court held that a guilty plea waives the right to claim error arising from a defective indictment.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Barton alleged that the grand jury had failed to properly indict him for the offense of having a weapon while under a disability. He claimed that because the defective indictment had posed a jurisdictional defect, the matter could be raised at any time.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The Supreme Court rejected this argument and held that Barton\u2019s guilty plea waived his right to contest the defective indictment on appeal.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">{\u00b6 28} Finally, by entering a guilty plea and foregoing a trial, Morgan\u2019s allegedly defective indictment did not result in \u201cmultiple errors\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> during a lengthy trial proceeding \u2014 the primary harm that both <em>Colon </em>decisions sought to remedy. We agree with the other Ohio appellate courts that have considered the issue that there is no indication that the Ohio Supreme Court, in either <em>Colon </em>decision, intended to abrogate the waiver doctrine with regard to guilty pleas.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In light of <em>State v. Barton </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition to employ the waiver doctrine in most defective-indictment cases like <em>Colon, </em>we hold that <em>Colon-</em>like defects to an indictment are subject to waiver or forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">\n<em>Waiver and State v. Shugars</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">{\u00b6 29} In 2006, in <em>State v. Shugars, </em>we vacated a judgment of conviction entered following a no-contest plea because the complaint had omitted a culpable mental state. We held that this defect had deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to try the defendant.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Although neither party raised the impact of <em>Shugars </em>on the resolution of this case, we feel compelled to address our own precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>{\u00b6 30} Shugars had entered a plea of no contest to violating Cincinnati\u2019s home-improvement ordinance, a second-degree misdemeanor.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> We found that since the municipal code section did not mention a specific culpable mental state, the state was required to prove that Shugars had acted recklessly.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> But the complaint had not identified any culpable mental state. We vacated the conviction and held that since \u201ca valid complaint is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a conviction[,] * * * [a] defendant cannot waive the right to challenge a charging document that fails to state an essential element, even if the defendant pleads guilty to the charged offense.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">{\u00b6 31} The Eighth District Court of Appeals certified to the Ohio Supreme Court that our decision in <em>Shugars </em>was in conflict with its decision in <em>State v. Colon.</em><footnotemark><em>49</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Resolving that conflict in <em>Colon I, </em>the Supreme Court effectively affirmed <em>Shugars, </em>holding in the syllabus paragraph that Colon had not \u201cwaived the defect in the indictment.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> But the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Colon II </em>to apply the waiver doctrine and plain-error analysis calls into question our holding in <em>Shugars </em>that \u201cbecause the charging instrument did not [include a mens rea element], the trial court had no jurisdiction to try Shugars.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">{\u00b6 32} The Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s use of the waiver doctrine and plain-error analysis in its review of missing-culpable-mental-state defective-indictment cases is inimical to decisions claiming that defective-indictment errors are jurisdictional and are never waived. Moreover, the application of the waiver doctrine to <em>Colon-like </em>cases follows the trend in recent cases, decided after the advent of the rules of criminal procedure, holding that \u201cdefects in an indictment do not deprive a court of its power to adjudicate a case.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">{\u00b6 33} Accordingly, to the extent that we held in <em>Shugars </em>that a <em>Colon </em>defect in an indictment deprives a trial court of jurisdiction, <em>Shugars </em>is overruled. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>decision whether a no-contest plea also waives <em>Colon </em>errors, we leave to another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">{\u00b6 34} A guilty plea does not foreclose all means for seeking appellate or collateral review of the case and to obtain reversal of a conviction: a defendant may seek to withdraw his plea on the grounds that it was not made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> But we hold that Morgan\u2019s plea of guilty waived the alleged defects in the indictment, including a failure to allege a culpable mental state, because the record does not demonstrate that Morgan failed to understand that, by entering guilty pleas, he was admitting that he had committed aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping. Accordingly, we overrule the assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">{\u00b6 35} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b789-8\">SUNDERMANN, P.J., Concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b789-9\">Painter, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-9\">.

Of course, the Ohio Supreme Court, having authored both <em>Colon I </em>and <em>Colon II, </em>is obviously even more confused than I am. Round and round and round it goes; where it stops nobody knows.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">{\u00b6 37} Simply structuring the indictments properly would avoid this problem. But that seems to the state too easy an answer \u2014 or maybe too hard.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
