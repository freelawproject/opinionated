Because the judgment from which appellant appeals is not a final, appeal-able order, we grant the request of defendant-appellee, Sanjeev Prakash (\u201cappellee\u201d), to dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant and appellee were divorced in 1998. They share parenting responsibilities for their minor child. Since 2006, both parties have filed numerous parenting-related motions. The trial court has held at least eight hearings and issued several orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">{\u00b6 3} On September 28, 2008, the trial court issued a decision and judgment entry, which overruled objections to a magistrate\u2019s order requiring appellant, appellee, and their child to each undergo a psychological examination. The court\u2019s decision specifically referred to appellant\u2019s motion for reallocation of parental rights and responsibilities and the guardian ad litem\u2019s motion for the psychological evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant appeals the trial court\u2019s September 28, 2008 order, and she raises the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">It is error for the trial court to grant a motion for psychological evaluation of the parties and minor child in an action to enforce parental rights without an evidentiary hearing to establish the need, scope and cost of the evaluation pursuant to Ohio Civil Rule 35(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">{\u00b6 5} Before reaching appellant\u2019s assignment of error, we must first address appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. In that motion, appellee argues that the court\u2019s September 28, 2008 judgment was not a final, appealable order. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">{\u00b6 6} Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution limits an appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction to the review of lower courts\u2019 final orders. Thus, it is well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>established that an order must be final before an appellate court has jurisdiction to review it. <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 17, 20, 540 N.E.2d 266. A final order is one that disposes of the whole case or some separate and distinct branch of it. <em>Noble v. Colwell </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 92, 94, 540 N.E.2d 1381, quoting <em>Lantsberry v. Tilley Lamp Co. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 303, 306, 56 O.O.2d 179, 272 N.E.2d 127. If an order from which an appeal is taken is not final and appealable, the appellate court must dismiss the appeal. <em>Farmers Market Drive-In Shopping Ctrs., Inc. v. Magana, </em>10th Dist. No. 06AP-532, 2007-Ohio-2653, 2007 WL 1560276, \u00b6 10, citing <em>Renner\u2019s Welding &amp; Fabrication, Inc. v. Chrysler Motor Corp. </em>(1996), 117 Ohio App.3d 61, 64, 689 N.E.2d 1015. See also <em>McClary v. M/I Schottenstein Homes, Inc., </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-777, 2004-Ohio-7047, 2004 WL 2980561, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">{\u00b6 7} The Supreme Court of Ohio has set forth a two-step analysis for determining whether an order is final and appealable. See <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co., </em>44 Ohio St.3d at 21, 540 N.E.2d 266. First, the appellate court must determine whether the order constitutes a final order as defined by R.C. 2505.02. If the order complies with R.C. 2505.02, the court must determine whether Civ.R. 54(B) language is required and, if so, whether the order contains a certification that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 2505.02(B) defines a final order as \u201c(1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment; [or] (2) An order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 9} We focus on R.C. 2505.02(B)(2), which states that an order in a special proceeding that affects a substantial right is a final order, and we consider, first, whether the action underlying this appeal is a special proceeding. A special proceeding is an \u201caction or proceeding that is specially created by statute and that prior to 1853 was not denoted as an action at law or a suit in equity.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(A)(2). The Supreme Court of Ohio has concluded that the right of divorce did not exist at common law. <em>State ex rel. Papp v. James </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 373, 379, 632 N.E.2d 889, quoting <em>Jelm v. Jelm </em>(1951), 155 Ohio St. 226, 231, 44 O.O. 246, 98 N.E.2d 401. Instead, actions for divorce, alimony, property division, and child custody have all been defined by statute. See <em>Papp </em>at 379, 632 N.E.2d 889. Accordingly, Ohio courts have held that a divorce proceeding, including any ancillary proceeding on custody-related claims, is a \u201cspecial * * * proceeding\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2505.02. <em>Papp </em>at 379, 632 N.E.2d 889, citing <em>Dansby v. Dansby </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 112, 113, 59 O.O. 129, 133 N.E.2d 358, and <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 161, 556 N.E.2d 1169 (Douglas, J., concurring in syllabus and judgment). Applying these princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>pies here, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s order arose in a special proceeding for purposes of R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">{\u00b6 10} Having determined that the trial court issued its order in a special proceeding, we consider whether the order affects a substantial right. R.C. 2505.02(A)(1) defines a substantial right as \u201ca right that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or protect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 11} Here, the trial court ordered the psychological evaluation pursuant to Civ.R. 35(A). Civ.R. 35(A) allows a court to order a party to submit to a physical or mental examination when the mental or physical condition of the party is in controversy, and the order is made on motion for good cause shown and with notice to the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 12} Appellee asserts that this court has previously held that \u201ca Civ.R. 35(A) order for a mental examination affects a substantial right when made in a custody action. Thus, this order is final and appealable.\u201d <em>Shoff v. Shoff </em>(July 27, 1995), 10th Dist. No. 95APF01-8, 1995 WL 450249. See also <em>In re Guardianship of Johnson </em>(1987), 35 Ohio App.3d 41, 43, 519 N.E.2d 655 (holding that a Civ.R. 35(A) order requiring psychiatric examination in guardianship proceeding affects substantial right); <em>Williamson v. Williamson </em>(Nov. 25, 1997), 10th Dist. No. 97APF05-629, 1997 WL 746425 (applying <em>Shoff </em>reasoning upon review of trial court order requiring psychological examination as part of ruling on motion for new trial following divorce decree).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">{\u00b6 13} We note, however, that the Supreme Court of Ohio has addressed this issue more recently, and its holding is contrary to the prior holdings of this court. In <em>Myers v. Toledo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 218, 2006-Ohio-4353, 852 N.E.2d 1176, \u00b6 1, the Supreme Court accepted the following question, certified as a conflict: \u201cIs a ruling which grants a Civ.R. 35(A) motion for a physical or mental examination made in a special proceeding such as a divorce case or worker\u2019s compensation case, a final appealable order under either R.C. 2505.02(B)(2) or R.C. 2505.02(B)(4)?\u201d The court \u201canswer[ed] the question in the negative. An order granting a physical or medical examination, made in a special proceeding, is not a final, appealable order.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 14} In reaching this conclusion, the court considered whether an order requiring a medical examination, pursuant to Civ.R. 35(A), affected a substantial right. The <em>Myers </em>court stated, at \u00b6 22:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">A party to a cause of action in which the physical condition of the party is in controversy does not have a substantial right to prevent a court from ordering a physical examination. Therefore, a court order requiring a party to submit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>to an independent medical examination, for good cause shown, does not affect a substantial right and is not a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">{\u00b6 15} Appellant asks us to distinguish <em>Myers </em>from the case before us. Appellant acknowledges that the <em>Myers </em>court certified the question whether an order granting a motion for a \u201cphysical or mental examination\u201d was final and appealable under R.C. 2505.02. Id. at \u00b6 1. Appellant points out, however, that the <em>Myers </em>holding and its substantive discussion refer only to a \u201cphysical or medical examination,\u201d and not to a \u201cmental examination.\u201d While we also acknowledge the difference between the <em>Myers </em>certified question and the <em>Myers </em>holding, we conclude that the <em>Myers </em>holding applies here, where a psychological examination is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 16} First, the court\u2019s reference in <em>Myers </em>to a \u201cmedical examination\u201d is broad enough to include a psychological examination. Second, the court accepted the <em>Myers </em>appeal based on a conflict among appellate courts, including <em>Harness v. Harness </em>(2001), 143 Ohio App.3d 669, 758 N.E.2d 793, which considered whether a trial court\u2019s order requiring psychological examinations, pursuant to Civ.R. 35(A), was final and appealable under R.C. 2505.02. Third, we discern no basis for distinguishing a psychological examination from a physical examination for purposes of R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"AqPr\">{\u00b6 17} Appellant asserts that, under certain circumstances, a psychological examination is more intrusive than a physical examination. She argues that that is particularly true here, where the court\u2019s order arose from a contempt proceeding, as opposed to an order that might arise, for example, in an action where a disagreement about the existence of a physical injury lies at the very heart of the case. While we acknowledge the intrusion a party may perceive as a result of an involuntary psychological evaluation, we do not agree that such an evaluation affects rights more substantial than those affected by the physical examination at issue in <em>Myers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 18} Here, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, the mental health of the parties and their daughter is important to the issues before the trial court. The trial court had before it a motion to reallocate parental rights and responsibilities. R.C. 3109.04 requires it to consider the child\u2019s best interest when determining the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities, and R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(e) identifies the mental health of the parents and the child as a factor in making that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">{\u00b6 19} The court also found that the \u201cplethora of pleadings, supporting memoranda and sworn affidavit(s)\u201d filed by the parties, including appellee\u2019s motion for a contempt order against appellant and appellant\u2019s response to that motion, contained allegations of parental alienation and sexual abuse. Such allegations place the mental health of the parties and their daughter squarely at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>issue and show the need for, and the importance of, psychological evaluations in resolving the issues between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 20} For all these reasons, and based on <em>Myers, </em>we conclude that the trial court\u2019s order requiring the parties and their minor child to submit to a psychological examination, pursuant to Civ.R. 35(A), is not a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). To the extent that our prior holdings in <em>Johnson, Shoff, </em>and <em>Williamson </em>are to the contrary, we overrule them.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">{\u00b6 21} Having determined that the order from which appellant appeals is not a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02, we conclude that this court lacks jurisdiction over this matter. Therefore, we grant appellee\u2019s motion, and we dismiss appellant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b622-8\">Klatt and Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
