For the reasons set forth below, we reverse her conviction for aggravated robbery, remand for entry of judgment of conviction on the lesser included charge of robbery, and remand for resentencing on the lesser charge. We also reverse the conviction for the three-year firearm specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>cation and remand for resentencing on robbery with a one-year firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">{\u00b6 2} Defendant was indicted for one count of aggravated robbery pursuant to R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), with one-year and three-year firearm specifications in connection with an alleged attempted armed robbery at the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Cleveland Heights on September 24, 2007. Defendant\u2019s cousin, Deondrae Glover, was charged with delinquency in connection with this alleged offense but later entered into a plea agreement and agreed to testify on behalf of the state in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 3} The matter proceeded to a jury trial. The state\u2019s evidence indicated that defendant worked at the Cleveland Heights Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in 2005 or 2006. After this time period, Bobby Hicks was hired as manager of the restaurant, and he discontinued various practices that he considered unsafe, such as keeping the back door open and making night money deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 4} In July 2007, defendant contacted Hicks and told him that she wanted to return to work as a restaurant manager. Hicks introduced defendant to corporate office officials, who decided to accept defendant into the manager-training program. Defendant was assigned to complete the training program at the Lakewood restaurant. She attended only two days of the five-week program, however, and then left a message for Hicks explaining that she had to go out of town.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 5} Deondrae Glover testified that defendant asked him whether he had a gun, and she indicated that she knew of a \u201csweet lick,\u201d as she believed that she could get some money at the restaurant. Glover obtained a gun from a drug dealer and notified defendant. Defendant picked up Glover, and he showed her the gun. He put the gun and bullets in a bag and placed them in the back seat of defendant\u2019s car. The two were dressed in black and had ski masks. At approximately 10:45 p.m., they parked on a street behind the restaurant. Glover waited by a low retaining wall and hid the gun in nearby bushes. Defendant waited on the opposite side of the parking lot and peered through the fence that separates the restaurant parking lot from the street. Defendant used the number-blocking feature of her cell phone to call the restaurant. She made a total of six calls and did not speak when employees answered the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 6} At approximately 11:00 p.m., a resident of this area was walking her dog and became suspicious of Glover and defendant, who were dressed in black and wearing stocking caps. She contacted University Heights Police. Defendant and Glover were subsequently arrested, and .38-caliber bullets were recovered from defendant\u2019s ear. A ski mask was found in the fence near where defendant was crouching. A short time later, police recovered a .38-caliber revolver from bushes near the retaining wall adjacent to the restaurant parking lot. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>arresting officer testified that as he patted defendant down, he asked her what was going on, and she stated that she and Glover were out for a walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 7} Glover\u2019s DNA was found on the trigger of the weapon. There was also a minor DNA contributor on the weapon, but no conclusions could be drawn about this individual. In addition, the weapon was operable.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 8} Glover made a statement to police. He stated that he and defendant were waiting to rob an employee leaving with the night deposits. He omitted all mention of the gun in this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 9} Defendant testified on her own behalf. She stated that she stopped attending the management-training program because it conflicted with her college classes and another job that she had. She also stated that she frequently wears black clothing and happened to have a ski mask in her pocket at the time of her arrest. She stated that Glover placed a bag in her car when she picked him up, but she did not know that it contained a gun. She and Glover parked behind the restaurant and were hanging out, waiting for the restaurant to close. Defendant stated that she had friends who worked at the restaurant and thought they would give her and Glover free food after the restaurant closed, but she hung up each time an unfamiliar voice answered the phone. She denied planning to rob the restaurant and stated that she was in college, that her tuition was fully paid under a grant, and that she has never been in trouble before.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 10} Defendant was convicted of the aggravated robbery and the firearm specifications. She was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment on the aggravated-robbery charge and three years for the firearm specification. She now appeals and assigns four errors for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">{\u00b6 11} For her first assignment of error, defendant asserts that her convictions are not supported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">{\u00b6 12} Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a defendant in a criminal case cannot be convicted except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he or she is charged. <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 316, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560; <em>In re Winship </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368. In analyzing claims of insufficient evidence, the court must determine whether \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560; <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 678 N.E.2d 541. An appellate court\u2019s function, when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction, is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 13} The essential elements of aggravated robbery are defined in R.C. 2911.01, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(1) Have a deadly weapon on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control <em>and either display the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it; </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 16} The essential elements of robbery are set forth in R.C. 2911.02 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(1) Have a deadly weapon on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control; * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">{\u00b6 19} A criminal attempt is when one purposely does or omits to do anything that is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime. R.C. 2923.02(A); <em>State v. Woods </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 127, 2 O.O.3d 289, 357 N.E.2d 1059, paragraph one of the syllabus. This standard focuses on overt acts of the defendant that convincingly demonstrate a firm purpose to commit a crime, while allowing police intervention in order to prevent the crime when the criminal intent becomes apparent. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">{\u00b6 20} Complicity is established under R.C. 2923.03 when one is \u201cacting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense,\u201d inter alia, aids or abets another in committing the offense. To aid and abet is \u201cto assist or facilitate the commission of a crime, or to promote its accomplishment.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 243, 754 N.E.2d 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">{\u00b6 21} Finally, we note that when the evidence is insufficient to support the greater offense, but sufficient to support a conviction on the lesser included offense, an appellate court may vacate the sentence and remand for entry of judgment of conviction and resentencing under the lesser included offense of robbery and the one-year firearm specification. <em>United States v. Lamartina </em>(C.A.6, 1978), 584 F.2d 764; <em>Jenkins v. Jago </em>(C.A.6, 1984), 746 F.2d 1477; Crim.R. 33(A)(4). See also <em>State v. McSwain, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83394, 2004-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Ohio-3292, 2004 WL 1402700; <em>State v. McCoy, </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-769, 2008-Ohio-3293, 2008 WL 2588568; <em>State v. Brown, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-601, 2006-Ohio-2307, 2006 WL 1280895; <em>State v. Frazier, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-1323, 2007-Ohio-11, 2007 WL 16778.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">(\u00b6 22} Here, robbery, in this instance, requires proof of an attempt or commission of a theft or flight immediately after the attempt or commission, with a deadly weapon on or about the offender or under the offender\u2019s control. R.C. 2911.02(A)(1). Aggravated robbery requires proof of the same elements, except the offender must also \u201cdisplay the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it.\u201d R.C. 2911.01(A). Robbery, as defined in R.C. 2911.02(A)(1), is a lesser included offense of aggravated robbery as set forth in R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). <em>State v. Schoonover </em>(Sept. 21, 1998), Adams App. No. 97 CA 647, 1998 WL 652549; <em>State v. Smith, </em>Trumbull App. No. 2005-T-0080, 2006-Ohio-4669, 2006 WL 2589802; <em>State v. Taylor, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21122, 2006-Ohio-2655, 2006 WL 1461037.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 23} In this instance, the essential elements of the lesser offense of robbery were established beyond a reasonable doubt, as the evidence demonstrated that defendant, in attempting a theft offense, had a weapon, under the law of complicity. Defendant had Glover procure a weapon, drove with him to the rear of the restaurant, and hid in wait for an employee with the nightly cash, a substantial step of robbery that was thwarted only upon police intervention. However, the offense of aggravated robbery was not established beyond a reasonable doubt, as there was no evidence that defendant, either principally or as an aider or abettor, committed the additional element needed to elevate robbery to an aggravated robbery, that is, there was no evidence that defendant did \u201cdisplay the weapon, brandish it, indicate that [she possessed] it, or use it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 24} In accordance with all the foregoing, we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for aggravated robbery, find sufficient evidence to convict her of robbery, and remand for entry of judgment of conviction for robbery and resentencing on this lesser charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 25} Likewise, in the absence of evidence that defendant did \u201cdisplay the weapon, brandish it, indicate that [she possessed] it, or use it,\u201d there is insufficient evidence to support the three-year firearm specification, and defendant must be resentenced only on the one-year firearm specification under R.C. 2941.141.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">{\u00b6 26} Defendant next claims that her conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, the court illuminated its test for manifest weight of the evidence as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>{\u00b6 28} \u201cWeight of the evidence concerns \u2018the inclination of the greater amount of credible evidence, offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other. It indicates clearly to the jury that the party having the burden of proof will be entitled to their verdict, if, on weighing the evidence in their minds, they shall find the greater amount of credible evidence sustains the issue which is to be established before them. Weight is not a question of mathematics, but depends on its effect in inducing belief.\u2019 Black\u2019s [Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990) ], at 1594.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 29} The court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses, and determines whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. See <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 30} The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional ease in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 31} In this matter, we cannot say that the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting defendant of the offense. The evidence presented by the state was thorough and credible, and it consistently established that defendant familiarized herself with store procedures and formulated a plan to rob an employee. Although defendant stated that she was simply waiting for closing time to obtain free food from a former co-worker, she did not actually speak to anyone about food, and her clothing and conduct demonstrated that she was concealing herself and lying in wait for an unwary worker. The conviction for robbery with a one-year firearm specification is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 32} For her third assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred and violated her constitutional rights in allowing the state to introduce evidence of her silence as an indication of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 33} In <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, the United States Supreme Court held that an individual must be advised of his or her constitutional rights when law-enforcement officers initiate questioning after that person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his or her freedom in any significant way. Any statement given under custodial police interrogation, without the <em>Miranda </em>warnings first being given, may later be excluded from use by the state in any resulting criminal prosecution. \u2019Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>{\u00b6 34} Further, a defendant\u2019s postarrest silence cannot be used against him at trial. <em>Doyle v. Ohio </em>(1976), 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91. Thus \u201c[a]ny comment which [implies] that the defendant is guilty because he remained silent subverts the guarantees afforded him by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1979), 64 Ohio App.2d 271, 276, 18 O.O.3d 262, 413 N.E.2d 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 35} In this matter, Officer Rogers testified that defendant was uncooperative and would not answer their questions. He explained that the failure to obtain information was the reason he decided to handcuff defendant and Glover. Moreover, the other officers testified that defendant told the police that she and Glover were out taking a walk. We therefore conclude that the isolated statement from Officer Rogers was not meant to be an insinuation of guilt based on defendant\u2019s silence. Accord, <em>State v. Johnson, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89504, 2008-Ohio-1716, 2008 WL 963128. The admission of this evidence is harmless error in light of the remaining evidence of defendant\u2019s conduct, clothing, and preplanning.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 36} For her fourth assignment of error, defendant contends that she was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 37} This court reviews a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-part test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Under <em>Strickland, </em>a reviewing court will not deem counsel\u2019s performance ineffective unless a defendant can show that his lawyer\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation and that prejudice arose from the lawyer\u2019s deficient performance. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph one of the syllabus. To show prejudice, a defendant must prove that but for his lawyer\u2019s errors, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the proceedings would have been different. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. Judicial scrutiny of a lawyer\u2019s performance must be highly deferential. <em>State v. Sallie </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 673, 674, 693 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 38} In this assigned error, defendant claims that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance when he failed to question Glover about the significant benefit he received for having his charges heard in juvenile court and his motivation to lie. Defendant also claims that her trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the reference to defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">{\u00b6 39} As to the first of these issues, we note that counsel did clearly convey to the jury that Glover had been in trouble at school, that his juvenile charges were dependent upon him testifying against defendant, and that he lied to the police by providing a statement that wholly failed to mention his actions with regard to the gun. We therefore reject this claim of deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>{\u00b6 40} As to the second issue, we have already determined that no prejudicial error occurred in connection with the brief reference to defendant\u2019s silence. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel citing this claim is therefore not well taken. See <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1988), 89 Ohio St.3d 24, 33, 528 N.E.2d 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 41} In accordance with the foregoing, defendant\u2019s conviction for aggravated robbery with a three-year firearm specification is reversed, her conviction for robbery with a one-year firearm specification is affirmed, and the matter is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-7\">Kilbane and Jones, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
