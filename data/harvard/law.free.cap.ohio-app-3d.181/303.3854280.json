On December 14, 2007, over eight months after being served with the summons and notice of appeal, appellant filed a motion for leave to file her complaint instanter. On that same date, International filed its motion to show cause and/or for judgment. Pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(2) and (3), International asserted that absent a showing by appellant of excusable neglect or other good cause, this matter should be dismissed and judgment rendered finding appellant not entitled to participate in the benefits of the workers\u2019 compensation laws of Ohio for this additional condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">{\u00b6 3} On December 28, 2007, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a memorandum contra International\u2019s motion for judgment. In the memorandum, counsel pointed out that Ms. Wilkerson was unrepresented in the underlying administrative proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>ings and because of that, she was not served with International\u2019s notice of appeal until April 9, 2007. Counsel stated that she had recently been referred Ms. Wilkerson\u2019s case on December 5, 2007, by attorney James P. Monast, who had been retained as counsel by Ms. Wilkerson on the same date. She stated she immediately contacted International\u2019s counsel to advise him she would be filing a motion for leave to file Ms. Wilkerson\u2019s complaint instanter, and she did file the motion and the tendered complaint on December 14, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">{\u00b6 4} In a single assignment of error, Ms. Wilkerson argues that the trial court abused its discretion in summarily overruling her motion for leave to file her petition and in summarily sustaining International\u2019s motion for judgment. In support of her assignment, she refers us to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Puckett </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 32, 26 O.O.2d 303, 197 N.E.2d 353, in which the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cWhere an employer perfects an appeal from the decision of the Industrial Commission and the claimant fails to timely file a petition as provided by Section 4123.519, Revised Code [now R.C. 4123.512], it is error for the Court of Common Pleas to summarily overrule claimant\u2019s motion for leave to file such petition and to grant the employer\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings.\u201d Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus. The court stated that \u201c[s]ince some claimants, at least, are not represented by counsel, they may be unaware of their obligation to file a petition on appeal. To summarily grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings where the claimant fails to file his petition would be too harsh a consequence for the failure to file a timely petition.\u201d Id. at 37, 26 O.O.2d 303, 197 N.E.2d 353. The court also held that the filing of a petition is not jurisdictional and that the purpose of R.C. 4123.512(D) is to give orderliness to the proceedings. Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">{\u00b6 6} The Supreme Court revisited this issue in <em>Zuljevic v. Midlandr-Ross Corp. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 116, 16 O.O.3d 140, 403 N.E.2d 986. There, the court held that when a plaintiff-claimant fails to file her complaint within the 30-day statutory time limit, it becomes the plaintiff-claimant\u2019s \u201cburden to show that his failure is due to excusable neglect or other good cause.\u201d Id. at 120, 16 O.O.3d 140, 403 N.E.2d 986. The court further held that \u201cit is an abuse of discretion to dismiss R.C. 4123.519 [now R.C. 4123.512] proceedings on the basis of a claimant\u2019s failure to act where he has not been given notice and an opportunity to show cause why the proceedings should not be dismissed and judgment entered against him.\u201d Id. Upon the showing of excusable neglect or good cause, a court may permit a plaintiff-claimant to file her complaint after the 30-day statutory time limit. <em>Thompson v. Reibel </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 258, 260, 27 O.O.2d 159, 199 N.E.2d 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Justice Sweeney noted on behalf of the court in <em>Zuljevic </em>: \u201cIn the case at bar the claimant was not served with a copy of the employer\u2019s motion seeking dismissal of the R.C. 4123.519 proceedings nor did the court <em>sua sponte </em>notify the claimant that his claim would be dismissed absent a showing of good cause. In the absence of such notice, the judgment of the Court of Appeals, reversing and remanding the cause to the Court of Common Pleas, must be affirmed to allow the claimant an opportunity to seek leave of court to file his complaint.\u201d <em>Zuljevic, </em>62 Ohio St.2d at 120, 16 O.O.3d 140, 403 N.E.2d 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">{\u00b6 8} We agree with the appellee that the trial court did not, in the due process sense, summarily overrule Ms. Wilkerson\u2019s motion for leave to file her complaint instanter. Ms. Wilkerson was served with a copy of the employer\u2019s motion seeking dismissal, and only after she responded with her memorandum in opposition did the trial court grant the employer\u2019s motion for judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">{\u00b6 9} Ms. Wilkerson also contended, however, in the text of her brief that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the appellee\u2019s motion because she was unrepresented after prevailing on her workers\u2019 compensation claim and the notice of appeal filed by her employer did not provide her notice that she was now required to file a petition and be required to reprove her claim. In support of this argument, Ms. Wilkerson cites the recent case of <em>Franklin v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>Lucas App. No. L-05-1244, 2006-Ohio-5620, 2006 WL 3041128. In that case, the Sixth District Court of Appeals reversed a trial court\u2019s order that granted summary judgment in favor of a defendant-employer when it found that the claimant did not have notice of the impending dismissal. Id. at \u00b6 14-15. There, Mr. Franklin, like Ms. Wilkerson, was unrepresented by counsel in the underlying administrative proceedings and was therefore unaware of his statutory obligation to file a complaint after being served with the defendant-employer\u2019s notice of appeal. Id. at \u00b6 12. The court noted that the defendant-employer\u2019s notice of appeal gave no notice that the claimant \u201cwas not only required to file a \u2018petition,\u2019 but would then be required to re-prove his claim.\u201d Id. The court concluded that the notice of appeal was insufficient to put the claimant on \u201cnotice that he was required to do anything or that, without particular action, the court would consider a dismissal in favor of the [defendant-employer].\u201d Id. This, coupled with the fact that the court issued a scheduling order that did not give Mr. Franklin notice of the court\u2019s intent to dismiss, led the Sixth District to reverse the judgment in favor of the defendant-employer. Id. at \u00b6 13-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">(\u00b6 10} We believe that the <em>Franklin </em>case is well reasoned. Here, Ms. Wilkerson prevailed in the administrative proceedings below. She could reasonably believe that since the employer appealed the administrative determination, the employer would be required to proceed first in the proceedings in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Common Pleas Court with some sort of pleading in addition to its notice of appeal. We agree that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling Ms. Wilkerson\u2019s motion for leave to file her petition instanter. The assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">{\u00b6 11} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-7\">Fain and Froelich, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
