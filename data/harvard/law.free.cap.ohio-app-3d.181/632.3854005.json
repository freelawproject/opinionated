For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the common pleas court and affirm the final order of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">{\u00b6 2} The parties stipulated to the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">{\u00b6 3} Tiffany McFee was hired by Pataskala Oaks as a licensed practical nurse on June 9, 2003. At the time of McFee\u2019s hire, and at all relevant times, Pataskala Oaks had a leave policy that permitted 12 weeks of leave for those employees with at least one year of service. The leave policy is contained in its employee handbook, which McFee received upon beginning employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">{\u00b6 4} About eight months later, on January 26, 2004, McFee provided Pataskala Oaks with a physician\u2019s note, which stated that she was medically unable to work due to pregnancy-related swelling. The physician\u2019s note stated that McFee could return to work six weeks following her delivery. McFee gave birth a few days later, on February 1, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">{\u00b6 5} Pataskala Oaks terminated her three days after the birth of her child, on February 4, 2004. McFee was terminated because she did not qualify for leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>under the leave policy, because at the time of her request for leave, McFee had been employed for less than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">{\u00b6 6} McFee was able to return to work on March 15, 2004, six weeks after giving birth. Pataskala Oaks\u2019s director of nursing contacted McFee on February 25, 2004, and left a telephone message informing McFee that a full-time day-shift position at Pataskala Oaks was available and instructed McFee to contact her if she was interested. McFee never returned the call. At all times after February 25, 2004, Pataskala Oaks would have rehired McFee; however, McFee never contacted Pataskala Oaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">{\u00b6 7} Although McFee applied for several jobs after March 15, 2004, she was unsuccessful in obtaining employment until November 19, 2004. On that day, McFee was hired as a licensed practical nurse at Adam\u2019s Lane Care Center, where she continues to be employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">(\u00b6 8} McFee filed a charge affidavit with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission on March 2, 2004, alleging that she had been unlawfully terminated due to her pregnancy. After the commission received the charge, it investigated the case and found it probable that Pataskala Oaks had violated R.C. 4112. After conciliation efforts failed, the commission issued Administrative Complaint No. 9816.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">{\u00b6 9} All relevant facts were stipulated and submitted to an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). On December 19, 2006, the ALJ recommended that the commission dismiss the complaint. The Ohio Attorney General\u2019s office filed objections to this recommendation, arguing that the ALJ\u2019s analysis was legally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">{\u00b6 10} Oral argument was held on February 1, 2007. Subsequently, the commission rejected the ALJ\u2019s recommendation and issued a final order on March 1, 2007. The commission held that the termination of McFee\u2019s employment was due simply to her need for maternity leave and that this violated Ohio\u2019s laws against pregnancy discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">{\u00b6 11} Pataskala Oaks filed a petition for judicial review with the Licking County Court of Common Pleas on April 2, 2007. After briefing, the lower court issued a judgment entry on February 11, 2008, reversing the commission. The commission filed a timely notice of appeal with this court on March 10, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">{\u00b6 12} The commission raises two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cI. The court of common pleas erred in holding that the termination of a pregnant employee solely due to her need for maternity leave is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>termination \u2018because of pregnancy.\u2019 (Judgment Entry, P. 5-8, Attachment 1 of Appendix.)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cII. The court of common pleas erred when it applied the McDonnell Douglas prima facie burden-shifting analysis in a case involving an employer\u2019s failure to satisfy its affirmative duty to provide maternity leave for a reasonable period of time. (Judgment Entry, P. 3-5, Attachment 1 of Appendix.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 15} In addressing and analyzing these assignments of errors, we must first set forth our standard of review. Because the parties have stipulated to the facts, there was no conflicting evidence before the commission requiring resolution. Rather, the issue before the commission involved the interpretation and application of law to the evidence. On the question of whether an agency\u2019s order was in accordance with law, an appellate court\u2019s review is plenary. <em>Leslie v. Ohio Dept. of Dev., </em>171 Ohio App.3d 55, 2007-Ohio-1170, 869 N.E.2d 687, \u00b6 44, citing <em>Univ. Hosp. College of Medicine v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 339, 343, 587 N.E.2d 835; <em>HCMC, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>179 Ohio App.3d 707, 2008-Ohio-6223, 903 N.E.2d 660, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 16} We will simultaneously address the legal arguments presented by the commission in both assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 17} It is the position of the commission that under Ohio law, an employer must provide reasonable maternity leave regardless of its leave policy. Pataskala Oaks contends that Ohio law allows an employer to place a length-of-service requirement on leave time provided to pregnant employees, as long as that length-of-service requirement is evenly applied. The trial court agreed with the position of Pataskala Oaks and reversed the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">{\u00b6 18} In their briefs to this court, the parties agree that the resolution of this issue depends upon the application and interpretation of R.C. 4112.02 and the implementing regulations set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-05 regarding pregnancy discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 4112.02 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cIt shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice:</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(A) For any employer, because of the race, color, religion, sex, * * * national origin, disability, age, or ancestry of any person, to discharge without just cause, to refuse to hire, or otherwise to discriminate against that person with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 4112.01 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(B) For the purposes of divisions (A) to (F) of section 4112.02 of the Revised Code, the terms \u2018because of sex\u2019 or \u2018on the basis of sex\u2019 include, but are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy, any illness arising out of and occurring during the course of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work, * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">{\u00b624} R.C. 4112.08 also requires that Chapter 4112 \u201cshall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of its purpose, and any law inconsistent with any provision of this chapter shall not apply.\u201d See also R.C. 1.11 (\u201cRemedial laws and all proceedings under them shall be liberally construed in order to promote their object and assist the parties in obtaining justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">{\u00b6 25} The parties stipulated that Pataskala Oaks is an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined by R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) and thus is subject to R.C Chapter 4112.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">{\u00b6 26} The administrative regulations carrying out the prohibition against discrimination in Ohio are set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5. The administrative regulations apply to sex and disability discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">(\u00b6 27} Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-01 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe purpose of the following rules and regulations on discrimination is to assure compliance with the provisions of Chapter 4112 of the Revised Code. These rules express the Ohio civil rights commission\u2019s interpretation of language in Chapter 4112 of the Revised Code and indicate factors which the commission will consider in determining whether or not there has been a violation of the law. Such rules apply to every action which falls within the coverage of Chapter 4112 of the Revised Code, and are not intended to either expand or contract the coverage of the Chapter 4112 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">{\u00b6 29} In regards to sex discrimination, Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-05 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(G) Pregnancy and childbirth.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(1) A written or unwritten employment policy or practice which excludes from employment applicants or employees because of pregnancy is a prima facie violation of the prohibitions against sex discrimination contained in Chapter 4112 of the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(2) Where termination of employment of an employee who is temporarily disabled due to pregnancy or a related medical condition is caused by an employment policy under which insufficient or no maternity leave is available, such termination shall constitute unlawful sex discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(3) Written and unwritten employment policies involving commencement and duration of maternity leave shall be so construed as to provide for individual capacities and the medical status of the women involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>{\u00b6 34} \u201c(4) Employment policies involving accrual of seniority and all other benefits and privileges of employment, including company-sponsored sickness and accident insurance plans, shall be applied to disability due to pregnancy and childbirth on the same terms and conditions as they are applied to other temporary leaves of absences of the same classification under such employment policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(5) Women shall not be penalized in their conditions of employment because they require time away from work on account of childbearing. When, under the employer\u2019s leave policy the female employee would qualify for leave, then childbearing must be considered by the employer to be a justification for leave of absence for female employees for a reasonable period of time. For example, if the female meets the equally applied minimum length of service requirements for leave time, she must be granted a reasonable leave on account of childbearing. Conditions applicable to her leave (other than its length) and to her return to employment shall be in accordance with the employer\u2019s leave policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (G)(1) to (G)(5) of this rule, if the employer has no leave policy, childbearing must be considered by the employer to be a justification for leave of absence for a female employee for a reasonable period of time. Following childbirth, and upon signifying her intent to return within a reasonable time, such female employee shall be reinstated to her original position or to a position of like status and pay, without loss of service credits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 37} We note that R.C. 4112.02 is similar to the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act (\u201cPDA\u201d) provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000 et seq., and the Ohio Supreme Court has held that federal case law interpreting Title VII is generally applicable to cases involving alleged violations of R.C. Chapter 4112. <em>Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Joint Apprenticeship Commt. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 192, 196, 20 O.O.3d 200, 421 N.E.2d 128. The purpose of Title VII is \u201cto achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of * * * employees over other employees.\u201d <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co. </em>(1971), 401 U.S. 424, 429-430, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (the disparate impact of facially neutral employment policies \u201ccannot be maintained if they operate to \u2018freeze\u2019 the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 38} In <em>California Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Guerra </em>(1987), 479 U.S. 272, 285, 107 S.Ct. 683, 93 L.Ed.2d 613, the U.S. Supreme Court noted that \u201cCongress intended the PDA to be \u2018a floor beneath which pregnancy disability benefits may not drop \u2014 not a ceiling above which they may not rise.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Guerra, </em>the high court analyzed a California statute that required employers to provide female employees with unpaid pregnancy disability leave of up to four months. The state agency authorized to interpret the statute, the Fair Employment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Housing Commission, construed the statute to require California employers to reinstate an employee returning from such pregnancy leave to the job she previously held, unless it is no longer available due to business necessity. In the latter case, the employer must make a reasonable, good-faith effort to place the employee in a substantially similar job.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">{\u00b6 39} A California employer and trade associations sought a declaration that the statute was inconsistent with and was preempted by Title VII. The district court agreed, finding that California state law and policies of interpretation and enforcement that require preferential treatment of female employees disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions are pre-empted by Title VII and are null, void, invalid and inoperative under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>California Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Guerra </em>(Mar. 21, 1984), C.D.Cal. No. 83-4927R, 1984 WL 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 40} The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit revei*sed. <em>California Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Guem </em>(C.A.9, 1985), 758 F.2d 390. It held that \u201cthe district court\u2019s conclusion that [the law] discriminates against men on the basis of pregnancy defies common sense, misinterprets case law, and flouts Title VII and the PDA.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Id. at 393. The court of appeals found that the PDA does not \u201cdemand that state law be blind to pregnancy\u2019s existence.\u201d Id. at 395. Because it found that the California statute furthers the goal of equal employment opportunity for women, it concluded: \u201cTitle VII does not preempt a state law that guarantees pregnant women a certain number of pregnancy disability leave days, because this is neither inconsistent with, nor unlawful under, Title VII.\u201d Id. at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 41} The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed. Justice Marshall delivered the court\u2019s opinion and noted that the California law promotes equal-employment opportunity by ensuring that women will not lose their jobs on account of pregnancy disability. <em>Guerra, </em>479 U.S. 272, 288, 107 S.Ct. 683, 93 L.Ed.2d 613. The law \u201cdoes not compel California employers to treat pregnant workers better than other disabled employees; it merely establishes benefits that employers must, at a minimum, provide to pregnant workers. Employers are free to give comparable benefits to other disabled employees, thereby treating \u2018women affected by pregnancy\u2019 no better than \u2018other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.\u2019 \u201d <em>Guerra </em>at 289, 107 S.Ct. 683, 93 L.Ed.2d 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">{\u00b6 42} Importantly, the U.S. Supreme Court also stated: \u201cThe statute is narrowly drawn to cover only the period of <em>actual physical disability </em>on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Accordingly, unlike the protective labor legislation prevalent earlier in this century, [the statute] does not reflect archaic or stereotypical notions about pregnancy and the abilities of pregnant workers. A statute based on such stereotypical assumptions would, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>course, be inconsistent with Title VII\u2019s goal of equal employment opportunity.\u201d (Footnote omitted; emphasis sic.) Id. at 290, 107 S.Ct. 683, 93 L.Ed.2d 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">{\u00b6 43} Justice Stevens wrote in his concurring opinion: \u201cIn <em>Steelworkers v. Weber, </em>443 U.S. 193, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979), the Court rejected the argument that Title VII prohibits all preferential treatment of the disadvantaged classes that the statute was enacted to protect. The plain words of Title VII, which would have led to a contrary result, were read in the context of the statute\u2019s enactment and its purposes. In this case as well, the language of the Act seems to mandate treating pregnant employees the same as other employees. I cannot, however, ignore the fact that the PDA is a definitional section of Title VII\u2019s prohibition against gender-based discrimination. Had <em>Weber </em>interpreted Title VII as requiring neutrality, I would agree * * * that the PDA should be interpreted that way as well. But since the Court in <em>Weber </em>interpreted Title VII to draw a distinction between discrimination <em>against </em>members of the protected class and special preference <em>in favor of </em>members of that class, I do not accept the proposition that the PDA requires absolute neutrality. * * * This is not to say, however, that all preferential treatment of pregnancy is automatically beyond the scope of the PDA. Rather, as with other parts of Title VII, preferential treatment of the disadvantaged class is only permissible so long as it is consistent with \u2018accomplishing] the goal that Congress designed Title VII to achieve.\u2019 \u201d (Footnotes omitted; emphasis sic.) Id. at 294, 107 S.Ct. 683, 93 L.Ed.2d 613, quoting <em>United Steelworkers of Am., AFL-CIO-CLC v. Weber </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 193, 204, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 61 L.Ed.2d 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">{\u00b6 44} In order to accomplish the goal of the PDA to protect a woman\u2019s right to both work and have a family, the commission contends that Ohio has adopted a \u201cvery sensible approach\u201d \u2014 maternity leave must be provided for a \u201creasonable period of time\u201d as set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-05(G). Specifically, the commission relies upon provision (G)(2), stated above, in concluding that Pataskala Oaks committed unlawful sex discrimination because it terminated McFee when no maternity leave was available within the first year of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">{\u00b6 45} Pataskala Oaks, on the other hand, contends that provision (G)(5) permits it to terminate McFee because she did not qualify for leave under its leave policy. Pataskala Oaks argues that the commission\u2019s reliance upon provision (G)(2) is misplaced because it had a leave policy that was facially neutral because it draws no distinction between pregnant and nonpregnant employees. Pataskala Oaks argues that had McFee sought leave for a reason other than pregnancy, she still would have been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">{\u00b6 46} We begin our analysis of the parties\u2019 positions by making the following observations: first, it is undisputed that no maternity leave was available to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>McFee in her first year of employment at Pataskala Oaks; second, McFee was temporarily disabled due to pregnancy and childbirth; and third, Pataskala Oaks did not consider childbearing a justification for leave of absence within McFee\u2019s first year of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 47} At this juncture, we are mindful of the longstanding accepted principle that a reviewing court must give deference to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rules and regulations when such an interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the plain language of the statute and rule. <em>HCMC, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>179 Ohio App.3d 707, 2008-Ohio-6223, 903 N.E.2d 660, \u00b6 24; <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 384, 2006-Ohio-5853, 856 N.E.2d 940. And, as noted earlier, the commission promulgated Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5 to \u201cexpress the Ohio civil rights commission\u2019s interpretation of language in Chapter 4112 of the Revised Code and [to] indicate factors which the commission will consider in determining whether or not there has been a violation of the law.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 48} Upon review, this court finds that the language set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-05(0 is unambiguous; therefore, we apply the plain and ordinary meaning to the words as written. The only provision in Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-05(0 that specifically applies to termination of employment is provision (G)(2). It explicitly provides that termination of an employee disabled due to pregnancy is prohibited if the employer provides no maternity leave or insufficient maternity under its employment policy. In this case, it is undisputed that Pataskala Oaks had no maternity leave available to McFee at the time of her pregnancy disability. Therefore, the commission is correct in relying on provision (G)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 49} Pataskala Oaks does not address provision (G)(2). Rather, it claims that provision (G)(5), which pertains to a woman\u2019s \u201cconditions of employment\u201d permits it to terminate McFee because she did not qualify for leave.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree. As an initial matter, we find that the common usage of \u201ctermination\u201d ordinarily is not associated with a \u201ccondition\u201d of employment. Rather, it signifies the end of employment, not the continuation of it to which any \u201cconditions\u201d would apply. Second, nowhere in provision (G)(5) is termination authorized if an employee does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>not meet a length-of-service requirement. Rather, it expressly provides that \u201c[w]omen shall not be penalized in their conditions of employment because they require time away from work on account of childbearing.\u201d Not surprisingly, Pataskala Oaks does not address this first sentence in provision (G)(5). Obviously, one of the greatest penalties in the employment relationship is termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">{\u00b6 50} We also find that the commission\u2019s interpretation is consistent with goals of the PDA and R.C. 4112.02 by promoting equal-employment opportunity by ensuring that women will not lose their jobs on account of pregnancy disability. It ensures that a female employee is not put in a position of choosing between her job and the continuation of her pregnancy, a dilemma that would never face a male employee in the first year of employment at Pataskala Oaks. Both sexes are entitled to have a family without losing their jobs; to hold otherwise would be to completely ignore the plain language of Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-05(G)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 51} Other Ohio court decisions support this same analysis. See <em>Asad v. Continental Airlines, Inc. </em>(N.D.Ohio 2004), 328 F.Supp.2d 772 (\u201cThe purpose of Title VII, including the PDA, is \u2018to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of * * * employees over other employees.\u2019 <em>Guerra, </em>479 U.S. at 288, 107 S.Ct. 683, 93 L.Ed.2d 613, [quoting <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co. </em>(1971), 401 U.S. 424, 429-430, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158.] As demonstrated by its legislative history, the PDA was enacted to \u2018guarantee women the basic right to participate fully and equally in the workforce, without denying them the fundamental right to full participation in family life.\u2019 Id. at 289, 107 S.Ct. 683, 93 L.Ed.2d 613; <em>Johnson Controls, </em>499 U.S. at 204, 111 S.Ct. 1196, 113 L.Ed.2d 158 (explaining that \u2018[w]omen as capable of doing their jobs as their male counterparts may not be forced to choose between having a child and having a job\u2019). With the PDA, Congress made evident that it was protecting the decisional autonomy of women to become pregnant and to work while pregnant. <em>Johnson Controls, </em>499 U.S. at 205-207, 111 S.Ct. 1196, 113 L.Ed.2d 158. Because the PDA is specifically designed to provide relief to working women and to end discrimination against pregnant workers, it does not preclude preferential treatment of pregnant workers. <em>Guerra </em>at 285-286, 107 S.Ct. 683, 93 L.Ed.2d 613; <em>Harness v. Hartz Mountain Corp. </em>(C.A.6,1989), 877 F.2d 1307, 1310\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 52} See also <em>Woodworth v. Concord Mgt. Ltd. </em>(S.D.Ohio 2000), 164 F.Supp.2d 978. \u201cThe Ohio Administrative Code plainly indicates that new mothers \u2018must be granted a reasonable leave on account of childbearing.\u2019 Ohio Admin. Code \u00a7 4112-5-05(G)(5) * * * Denial of maternity leave mandated by the Ohio Administrative Code \u2018is, in effect, terminating the employee because of her pregnancy.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 985, quoting <em>Marvel Consultants, Inc. v. Ohio Civ. Rights </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>Comm. </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 838, 841, 639 N.E.2d 1265. <em>Frank v. Toledo Hosp. </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 610, 617, 617 N.E.2d 774 (\u201cThe purpose of Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-05(G)(2) and (6) is clearly to provide substantial equality of employment opportunity by prohibiting an employer from terminating a female worker because of pregnancy without offering her a leave of absence, even if no disability leave is available generally to employees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">{\u00b6 53} In this case, Pataskala Oaks does not deny that McFee requested maternity leave and that it terminated McFee without providing her with maternity leave for a reasonable period of time. Pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 4112-05-05(G)(2) such termination \u201cshall constitute unlawful sex discrimination.\u201d We agree with the commission that motive is irrelevant in light of Ohio\u2019s requirement for maternity leave for a \u201creasonable period of time.\u201d Therefore, direct evidence of pregnancy discrimination has been presented by McFee, and her claim is not subject to the now-familiar burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, and revisited in <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207, which applies in cases in which claims are not premised on direct evidence of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 54} Consistent with the weight of authority, we find that the commission interpreted and applied the relevant statutes in a lawful and proper way, and its final order should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">{\u00b6 55} The commission\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b674-8\">Hoffman, P.J., and Farmer, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-15\">. Assuming a normal gestation period of 38-40 weeks, McFee was five to seven weeks pregnant at the time she began employment with Pataskala Oaks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">. Pataskala Oaks also contends that a ruling by a hearing examiner in <em>Johnson v. Watkins Motor Lines, Inc. </em>(Oct. 3, 2001), Ohio Civ. Rights Comm., authorized a similar leave policy and specifically endorses minimum-length-of-service requirements. As this court's review is plenary, we are not bound by the hearing examiner\u2019s ruling on questions of law. See also <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Public Utils. Comm., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 384, 2006-Ohio-5853, 856 N.E.2d 940, at \u00b6 42-43. Pataskala Oaks\u2019 reliance on <em>Piraino </em>v. <em>Internatl. Orientation Resources, Inc. </em>(C.A.7, 1998), 137 F.3d 987, also is misplaced. In that case, the court did not address any state laws similar to Ohio's or a state's ability to offer broader protections than the PDA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
