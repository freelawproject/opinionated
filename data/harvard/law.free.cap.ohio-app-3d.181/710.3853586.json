Appellant, Mahoning Valley Emergency Specialists, Inc. (\u201cMVES\u201d), appeals the judgment of the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas granting prejudgment interest to appellee, Steven W. Ross, administrator of the estate of Darlene Marie Ross, deceased, as well as a jury verdict entered against MVES in the amount of $754,649 in a medical-malpractice and wrongful-death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>{\u00b6 2} MVES first argues that the trial court abused its discretion by precluding one of its expert witnesses from testifying about proximate cause during the trial, warranting a new trial. Second, MVES argues that the trial court abused its discretion by granting Ross\u2019s motion for prejudgment interest and alternatively urges this court to find Ohio\u2019s prejudgment-interest statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">{\u00b6 3} Upon review of the record, all of MVES\u2019s arguments are meritless. With regard to the evidentiary matter, MVES proffered its expert as a standard-of-care witness only. As such, the trial court properly limited that expert to testifying only about medical conditions known to the defendant physician when treating the decedent. In addition, based on <em>Galayda v. Lake Hosp. Sys., Inc. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 421, 428, 644 N.E.2d 298, we cannot find Ohio\u2019s prejudgment-interest statute, R.C. 1343.03(C), unconstitutional. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding prejudgment interest in this case, as MVES failed to rationally evaluate the risks and potential liability involved in the litigation and further failed to make a good-faith monetary settlement offer or respond in good faith to Ross\u2019s settlement demand. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">{\u00b6 4} On the morning of December 15, 2002, Darlene Ross, Ross\u2019s decedent, began to experience severe back pain. She was transported by ambulance to St. Elizabeth Health Center\u2019s emergency department. Upon her arrival, Darlene\u2019s blood pressure was 208 over 89. Darlene had vomited and complained of severe pain, and she was writhing around, unable to get comfortable.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">{\u00b6 5} St. Elizabeth contracts with MVES to staff its emergency room with physicians and physician assistants. Dr. David Jackson, an MVES physician and principal, physically examined Darlene in the emergency room that morning. Based on the medical history Darlene provided at triage, Dr. Jackson knew that Darlene had a history of hypertension, kidney disease, and stroke. He also knew she took several antihypertensive medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">{\u00b6 6} Ultimately, Dr. Jackson diagnosed Darlene with a \u201cstrained back\u201d and prescribed pain medications. Darlene reported that these medications slightly relieved her pain. Without performing any additional testing or rechecking Darlene\u2019s blood pressure, Dr. Jackson discharged Darlene from the emergency department, with instructions to take her blood-pressure medications as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">{\u00b6 7} After returning home, Darlene\u2019s symptoms worsened. Later that day, she presented to Northside Medical Center with complaints of sharp, severe abdominal pain radiating to her back, along with nausea and vomiting. Upon examination, her blood pressure was elevated and her abdomen was tender. Soon after her arrival at Northside, Darlene stopped breathing and her pulse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>ceased. She died shortly thereafter. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was an acute ruptured Type B dissecting aortic aneurysm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">{\u00b6 8} Ross filed a medical-malpractice and wrongful-death complaint, alleging that MVES had negligently caused Darlene\u2019s death. Initially, St. Elizabeth was also named as a defendant; however, Ross voluntarily dismissed it from this case, without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">{\u00b6 9} Prior to trial, Ross filed a motion in limine requesting, among other things, an order prohibiting MVES from introducing any evidence or testimony from Dr. Gayle Galan regarding the existence of a condition called thrombocytopenic purpura (\u201cTTP\u201d) or the issue of survivability. The trial court overruled the motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">{\u00b6 10} The case proceeded to trial and Ross called three expert witnesses, one of whom was Dr. Robert Rhee, a vascular surgeon. Dr. Rhee opined that Dr. Jackson had deviated from the standard of care when treating Darlene and that this deviation caused Darlene\u2019s death. He testified that Darlene arrived at St. Elizabeth with a \u201ctextbook presentation\u201d of an aortic dissection, i.e., she had risk factors in her medical history, had experienced a recent hypertensive event, and was writhing or thrashing around with 10/10 level radiating pain. He further testified that a chest x-ray or a check of the pulses in Darlene\u2019s lower extremities could have led to the diagnosis of the aortic dissection, but that Dr. Jackson failed to order such tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">{\u00b6 11} Dr. Rhee also testified about treatment options for Darlene\u2019s aortic dissection, had it been discovered by Dr. Jackson. He explained that in his experience, 98 percent of patients with an acute aortic dissection are treated \u201cmedically.\u201d This means they are administered medications to slow the heart rate and lower the blood pressure, and are monitored closely until pressure to the aorta subsides. He noted that with this so-called \u201cmedical management\u201d option, the overall survival rates are about 90 percent after five years and 60-70 percent after ten years. In Dr. Rhee\u2019s opinion, nothing in Darlene\u2019s past medical history would have caused him concern about using medical-management techniques. However, he conceded that medical management would require lifetime use of medications and that strict compliance with the medication regime would be necessary for survival. Finally, Dr. Rhee testified about treatment options available for aortic dissections if medical-management techniques fail. He explained that such a situation would necessitate a rather risky surgical procedure to repair the tear in the aorta.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">{\u00b6 12} Ross presented two other expert witnesses at trial. However, their testimony is not part of the appellate record, because MVES ordered a partial transcript containing only Dr. Rhee\u2019s testimony and Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony. Dr. Galan, an emergency-room physician, was MVES\u2019s sole expert witness at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Prior to Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony, Ross renewed his motion in limine, and an in camera hearing was held. At issue was the scope of Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony, namely, whether she would provide testimony about both standard-of-care and proximate-cause issues. At the start of the hearing, the trial court first explained its concern about whether Dr. Galan was qualified to testify about surgical survivability, which is a proximate-cause issue. The court then ruled that Dr. Galan would not be permitted to testify about surgical survivability, after noting that at a sidebar moments earlier, before the trial court and counsel adjourned to chambers for the in camera hearing, counsel for MVES had represented that he did not intend to question Dr. Galan about this topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">{\u00b6 14} Then MVES started to proffer Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony about medical survivability, which is also a proximate-cause issue. After a prolonged discussion, however, MVES clearly stated that Dr. Galan would testify as a standard-of-care witness only. Ultimately, the trial court ruled that Dr. Galan would not be permitted to discuss any medical conditions that were not known to Dr. Jackson at the time he treated Darlene.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">{\u00b6 15} Following the in camera hearing, Dr. Galan testified in front of the jury. She opined that Dr. Jackson met the standard of care for an emergency physician when he treated Darlene. More specifically, Dr. Galan felt that Dr. Jackson\u2019s diagnosis of \u201cback strain\u201d was reasonable based on Darlene\u2019s presentation at St. Elizabeth. According to Dr. Galan, a patient who presents with dissecting aorta is characterized by \u201cripping\u201d chest pain and sweatiness, two symptoms that Darlene did not have. Dr. Galan concluded that Darlene\u2019s symptoms were more consistent with a strained back.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">{\u00b6 16} Dr. Galan also opined that there was no indication that Dr. Jackson should have ordered additional tests, such as a chest x-ray or CAT scan. Further, in Dr. Galan\u2019s opinion, a chest x-ray would not have been particularly useful in diagnosing the aortic dissection. Dr. Galan also addressed Dr. Jackson\u2019s failure to order medications to lower Darlene\u2019s blood pressure, despite Darlene\u2019s presentation with a blood pressure of 208 over 89. Dr. Galan felt this was reasonable on the part of Dr. Jackson, because Darlene\u2019s history of hypertension would have made it dangerous to quickly lower her blood pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">{\u00b6 17} During cross-examination, it emerged that Dr. Galan had testified as an expert in a separate, unrelated medical-malpractice case, where she was critical of an emergency-room physician who had failed to diagnose the aortic dissection of a patient who presented with symptoms similar to Darlene\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">{\u00b6 18} After four days of testimony, the jury returned a verdict in Ross\u2019s favor in the amount of $754,649. The trial court entered judgment on that verdict on October 2, 2007. Ross then filed a motion for prejudgment interest, to which MVES replied. A hearing was held, at which Ross called three witnesses: Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Jackson; Dr. Howard Dickey-White, an MVES physician and the president of MVES; and Angela Yost, a claims specialist for Pro Insurance, MVES\u2019s insurance carrier. MVES cross-examined those witnesses but did not present any witnesses of its own. Ross also presented numerous exhibits at the hearing, including a settlement demand letter for $475,000 that it had sent to MVES prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">{\u00b6 19} In a judgment entry filed on January 7, 2008, the trial court granted Ross\u2019s motion for prejudgment interest. The court found that MVES, Dr. Jackson, and their insurer failed to rationally evaluate the risks of the case and further failed to make a good-faith effort to settle. Therefore, the court found that prejudgment interest was proper pursuant to R.C. 1343.03(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Limitation of Testimony by Dr. Galan</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">{\u00b6 20} MVES asserts in its first of two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by precluding Appellant\u2019s expert witness from testifying regarding matters within the scope of her education, knowledge, and experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">{\u00b6 22} MVES asserts that it intended to elicit testimony from Dr. Galan about the following topics: (1) Darlene\u2019s failure to take her blood-pressure medication according to her doctor\u2019s orders, (2) Darlene\u2019s difficulty managing her blood pressure, (3) Darlene\u2019s medical history of a clotting disorder called TTP, and (4) the underlying cause of Darlene\u2019s prior stroke. On appeal, MVES insists that it intended to use that testimony to refute Dr. Rhee\u2019s proximate-cause opinion that Darlene\u2019s dissecting aortic aneurysm could have been easily medically managed.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">{\u00b6 23} During her deposition, Dr. Galan noted that in her initial written summary, she had provided an opinion as to standard of care only. However, she went on to state that she had subsequently formed an opinion relating to proximate cause, namely, with regard to surgical survivability. More specifically, Dr. Galan testified that a blood sample taken minutes before Darlene\u2019s death revealed Darlene had a very low platelet count, something that Dr. Galan attributed to the presence of TTP. Dr. Galan opined that the low platelet count would have made it difficult for Darlene to survive surgery for an aortic dissection. Ross\u2019s counsel then challenged whether Dr. Galan was qualified to give an opinion about surgical survivability. Ultimately, Dr. Galan admitted that she had never performed a surgery to repair a dissecting aortic aneurysm. She stated she had assisted on several such procedures, but not during the previous six or seven years. Dr. Galan admitted she does not regularly perform any kind of surgery and stated that if she diagnosed a patient with a dissecting aortic aneurysm during the course of her practice, she would refer that patient to a cardiothoracic surgeon. Further, Dr. Galan admitted she holds no certifications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>in hematology or vascular surgery and that she is certified only in emergency medicine. Notably, Dr. Galan gave no opinion during her deposition about whether TTP or any other factors would have affected medical survivability.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">{\u00b6 24} Prior to trial, Ross filed a motion in limine requesting, among other things, that the trial court prohibit Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony \u201cregarding the issue of a condition called Thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP] or the issue of survivability as it pertained to Darlene Ross on December 15, 2002.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court initially denied the motion in limine. However, prior to Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony at trial, Ross renewed the motion, and after an initial sidebar, an in camera hearing was held to decide it. The court ultimately ruled that Dr. Galan could not testify about any medical conditions that were not known to Dr. Jackson when he treated Darlene. Thus, the trial court precluded proximate-cause testimony, limiting Dr. Galan to testifying only about the standard of care. MVES contends that this limitation constitutes prejudicial error. Ross counters that MVES failed to proffer Dr. Galan as a proximate-cause witness. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cAn order granting or denying a motion in limine is a tentative, preliminary or presumptive ruling about an evidentiary issue that is anticipated.\u201d <em>State v. Grubb </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 199, 203, 28 OBR 285, 503 N.E.2d 142. As such, at trial, a party seeking to admit evidence that was the subject of a motion in limine must \u201cseek the introduction of [that] evidence by proffer or otherwise in order to enable the court to make a final determination as to its admissibility and to preserve any objection on the record for purposes of appeal.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">{\u00b6 27} Proffers are governed by Evid.R. 103. \u201cPursuant to [Evid.R. 103] a party may not predicate error on the exclusion of evidence during direct examination unless two conditions are met: (1) the exclusion of the evidence must affect a substantial right of the party, and (2) the substance of the excluded evidence was made known to the court by proffer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.\u201d <em>Orbit Electronics, Inc. v. Helm Instrument Co., Inc., </em>167 Ohio App.3d 301, 2006-Ohio-2317, 855 N.E.2d 91, \u00b6 24, citing <em>State v. Gilmore </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 190, 28 OBR 278, 503 N.E.2d 147. The first prong is not at issue in the present case; the issue is whether MVES adequately proffered the testimony at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>State v. Heinish </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 231, 241, 553 N.E.2d 1026, the Ohio Supreme Court described two different methods that may be used to proffer testimony. The first is a question-and-answer method whereby the sworn testimony of the excluded witness is taken outside the presence of the jury. The second permits the proponent of the evidence to proffer to the court the substance of what the evidence would have shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Regardless of the method chosen, \u201c[generally, an offer of proof consists of two elements. First, the offering party must inform the trial court as to the legal theory upon which admissibility is proposed. Second, an offering party must show what a witness was expected to testify to and what that evidence would have proven or tended to prove.\u201d <em>State v. Darrah, </em>12th Dist. No. CA200609-109, 2007-Ohio-7080, 2007 WL 4554952, at \u00b6 22, citing <em>Moser v. Moser </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 575, 580, 595 N.E.2d 518. Here, MVES failed to proffer the legal theory, to wit, proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">{\u00b6 30} MVES asserts that Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony about Darlene\u2019s failure to take her blood-pressure medication according to her doctor\u2019s orders, Darlene\u2019s difficulty managing her blood pressure, Darlene\u2019s medical history of a clotting disorder called TTP, and the underlying cause of Darlene\u2019s prior stroke was offered to refute Dr. Rhee\u2019s testimony about proximate cause. Specifically, MVES argues that Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony would have countered Dr. Rhee\u2019s opinion that Darlene could have survived the aortic dissection by the use of medical-management techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">{\u00b6 31} However, MVES failed to proffer to the court that Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony would go towards the legal theory of proximate cause. During the in camera hearing, MVES affirmed that it did not intend to have Dr. Galan testify about surgical survivability, which is a proximate-cause issue. MVES began to offer Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony about medical survivability, another proximate-cause issue, stating: \u201c[Y]ou will hear testimony this afternoon that\u2019s going to be very conclusive that medical management is not going to be effective on this patient based on her history.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">{\u00b6 32} However, after a prolonged discussion, MVES represented to the court that Dr. Galan was a standard-of-care witness, not a proximate-cause witness. Specifically, counsel stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cYour Honor, we are not going into long-term care of how this patient is going to be managed forever. We are going to go into standard of care. We are going to go into standard of care for an emergency physician.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">{\u00b6 34} Ultimately, the trial court made its evidentiary ruling based on MVES\u2019s proffer of Dr. Galan as a standard-of-care witness only. Since standard of care is never viewed in hindsight, the court properly ruled to limit Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony to only that information known to Dr. Jackson when he treated Darlene. See <em>Grabill v. Worthington Industries, Inc., </em>98 Ohio App.3d 739, 744-745, 649 N.E.2d 874, quoting <em>Hetrick v. Marion-Res. Power Co. </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 347, 358-359, 25 O.O. 467, 48 N.E.2d 103 (holding that \u201c[foresight, not retrospect, is the standard of diligence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>{\u00b6 35} MVES insists that even if we find that it failed to proffer the testimony, a proffer was actually unnecessary for two reasons. Both of these arguments are meritless. First, MVES argues that the limitation by the trial court concerned Dr. Galan\u2019s competency as an expert and therefore a proffer was unnecessary. MVES cites <em>Totten v. Miller\u2019s Estate </em>(1941), 139 Ohio St. 29, 21 O.O. 545, 37 N.E.2d 961, for the proposition that a proffer is unnecessary when a witness is excluded on the basis of her alleged incompetency and that such an exclusion will be deemed prejudicial. However, the holding in <em>Totten </em>is inapplicable to the case at bar because the issue was that the trial court improperly excluded the expert witness altogether. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">{\u00b6 36} Moreover, the trial court in this case did not limit Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony on the basis of her incompetency. Dr. Galan\u2019s qualifications were only called into question with regard to the issue of surgical survivability, a proximate-cause issue. However, counsel for MVES agreed that Dr. Galan would not testify about surgical survivability. The trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling at the close of the in camera hearing did not relate to Dr. Galan\u2019s competency. Rather, the court ruled that Dr. Galan could not testify about medical conditions not known to Dr. Jackson when he treated Darlene, since such testimony falls outside the scope of a standard-of-care opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">{\u00b6 37} Second, MVES argues that pursuant to Evid.R. 103(A)(2) and <em>State v. Gilmore </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 190, 28 OBR 278, 503 N.E.2d 147, a proffer was not necessary because the substance of the excluded evidence was apparent to the court from the context within which questions were asked at trial. MVES correctly states the law here. However, MVES fails to indicate precisely <em>when </em>during Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony the substance of the excluded evidence was \u201capparent to the court.\u201d A review of Dr. Galan\u2019s testimony does not reveal any point where the substance of the excluded testimony was apparent. Dr. Galan abided by the court\u2019s ruling and testified only about medical conditions that were known to Dr. Jackson when he treated Darlene. She offered only an opinion about standard of care, not one on proximate cause, either relating to surgical survivability or medical-management survivability. Thus, this argument is also merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">{\u00b6 38} In sum, MVES failed to adequately proffer Dr. Galan as a proximate-cause witness who would testify about medical survivability, instead proffering her as a standard-of-care witness only. The trial court properly ruled that Dr. Galan could testify only about those conditions known to Dr. Jackson at the time he treated Darlene, in light of Dr. Galan\u2019s proffered function as a standard-of-care witness. Accordingly, MVES\u2019s first assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Prejudgment Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">{\u00b6 39} In its second assignment of error, MVES argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by granting Appellee\u2019s Motion for Prejudgment Interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">{\u00b6 41} This assignment of error contains two parts. First, MVES argues that Ohio\u2019s prejudgment-interest statute, R.C. 1343.03(C), is unconstitutional. Second, MVES argues that even if R.C. 1343.03(C) is constitutional, the trial court nonetheless abused its discretion by awarding prejudgment interest in this case. Each of these subarguments will be discussed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Constitutionality of R.C. 1343.03(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">{\u00b6 42} MVES argues that Ohio\u2019s prejudgment-interest statute, R.C. 1343.03(C), violates its constitutional right to a trial by jury. MVES concedes that the Ohio Supreme Court rejected a similar argument in <em>Galayda v. Lake Hosp. Sys., Inc. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 421, 428, 644 N.E.2d 298, and held that R.C. 1343.03(C) is constitutional. However, MVES contends that the holdings of two more recent Ohio Supreme Court cases, when read together, somehow abrogate the holding in <em>Galayda. </em>This argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">{\u00b6 43} In <em>Galayda, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that Ohio\u2019s prejudgment-interest statute does not violate the right to a jury trial for several reasons. First, the court found that \u201cthe potential application of R.C. 1343.03 in no way precludes a defendant from insisting on exercising his right to trial by jury nor does it \u2018create a financial barrier that prevents a * * * party from taking his case to a jury.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 427, 644 N.E.2d 298, quoting <em>Kuenzer v. Teamsters Union Local 507 </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 201, 203, 20 O.O.3d 205, 420 N.E.2d 1009, fn. 6. Second, the court found that R.C. 1343.03 does not impose a penalty upon defendants for having exercised their right to a jury where prejudgment interest is awarded against them, and that actually the prejudgment-interest statute is \u201cwholly compensatory * * * in nature.\u201d <em>Galayda </em>at 427-428, 644 N.E.2d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">{\u00b6 44} Finally, the court reasoned that:</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c[I]t is the jury\u2019s function to determine the amount of damages suffered by a plaintiff. Since determining the amount of prejudgment interest awards is entirely separate and distinct from determining the amount of damages suffered by the plaintiff, and does not involve questions of fact, R.C. 1343.03 does not violate the fundamental constitutional right to a trial by jury.\u201d <em>Galayda, </em>71 Ohio St.3d at 428, 644 N.E.2d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">{\u00b6 46} However, MVES argues that <em>Galayda </em>is \u201cno longer good law\u201d based on two more recent Ohio Supreme Court cases: <em>Miller v. First Internatl. Fid. &amp; Trust Bldg., Ltd., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 474, 2007-Ohio-2457, 866 N.E.2d 1059, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>Arbino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420. Admittedly, the court in <em>Miller </em>did conclude that an award of prejudgment interest \u201crequires judicial fact-finding and the exercise of judicial discretion\u201d and \u201cthat as between damages and costs, prejudgment interest is more in the nature of damages.\u201d <em>Miller </em>at \u00b6 7. In addition, the court in <em>Arbino </em>did find that the right to a trial by jury protects a plaintiffs right to have a jury determine all issues of fact, including the amount of damages. <em>Arbino </em>at \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">{\u00b6 47} However, neither <em>Miller </em>nor <em>Arbino </em>directly addresses the constitutionality of R.C. 1343.03(C). In <em>Miller, </em>the court held that a journalized jury verdict is not a final, appealable order when a motion for prejudgment interest has been filed and remains pending. <em>Miller </em>at \u00b6 11. In <em>Arbino, </em>the court held that R.C. 2315.18 (a statute limiting noneconomic damages) does not violate Ohio\u2019s constitutional right to a jury trial, and R.C. 2315.21 (a statute limiting punitive damages) does not violate equal protection or due process. <em>Arbino </em>at \u00b6 42, 104-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">{\u00b6 48} By contrast, the court in <em>Galayda </em>directly addressed the constitutionality of R.C. 1343.03(C) and found it constitutional. <em>Galayda, </em>71 Ohio St.3d at 428, 644 N.E.2d 298. The Ohio Supreme Court has never overruled its holding in <em>Galayda, </em>and therefore that holding is still good law that this court should follow. See generally <em>Scibelli v. Pannunzio, </em>7th Dist. No. 05MA150, 2006-Ohio-5652, 2006 WL 3059876, at \u00b6 122 (noting that \u201c[pjrejudgment interest statutes have consistently been found to be constitutional by courts both in Ohio and elsewhere,\u201d and citing cases). Accordingly, we find that MVES\u2019s argument about the constitutionality of R.C. 1343.03(C) is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">{\u00b6 49} In the second part of its second assignment of error, MVES argues that even if R.C. 1343.03(C) is constitutional, the trial court\u2019s prejudgment-interest award should be reversed because it was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">{\u00b6 50} The Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Moskovitz v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 638, 658, 635 N.E.2d 331, explained that R.C. 1343.03(C) sets forth four requirements for the award of prejudgment interest: (1) the party seeking interest must petition the court no later than 14 days after the judgment, (2) the trial court must hold a hearing on the motion, (3) the court must find that the party required to pay the judgment failed to make a good-faith effort to settle, and (4) the court must find that the party to whom the judgment is to be paid did not fail to make a good-faith effort to settle the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">{\u00b6 51} Further, the court noted that \u201c[t]he statute uses the word \u2018shall.\u2019 Therefore, if a party meets the four requirements of the statute, the decision to allow or not allow prejudgment interest is not discretionary. What is discretionary with the trial court is the determination of lack of good faith.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>{\u00b6 52} Thus, an appellate court should reverse a trial court\u2019s determination as to lack of good faith only when there has been an abuse of discretion. This means that the trial court\u2019s decision \u201cwill be upheld when it is supported by some competent, credible evidence.\u201d <em>Hollobaugh v. D &amp; V Trucking </em>(May 8, 2001), 7th Dist. No. 99CA303, 2001 WL 537058, at *8, citing <em>Doyle v. Fairfield Machine Co., Inc. </em>(1997), 120 Ohio App.3d 192, 223, 697 N.E.2d 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">{\u00b6 53} In <em>Kalain v. Smith </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 157, 25 OBR 201, 495 N.E.2d 572, syllabus, the court explained, in the negative, what constitutes a \u201cgood faith effort to settle.\u201d That is, \u201c[a] party has <em>not </em>\u2018failed to make a good faith effort to settle\u2019 under R.C. 1343.03(C) if he has (1) fully cooperated in discovery proceedings, (2) rationally evaluated his risks and potential liability, (3) not attempted to unnecessarily delay any of the proceedings, and (4) made a good faith monetary settlement offer or responded in good faith to an offer from the other party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at syllabus. Further, the court held that \u201cif a party has a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that he has no liability, he need not make a monetary settlement offer.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">{\u00b6 54} In the present case, both parties agree that the first and third elements are not at issue. In other words, there are no allegations that either side failed to cooperate with discovery or unnecessarily delayed the proceedings. Rather, the only issues are whether MVES rationally evaluated the risks and potential liability and made a good-faith monetary settlement offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">{\u00b6 55} It is undisputed that MVES failed to respond to Ross\u2019s settlement offer and failed to make a settlement offer of its own. Still, MVES contends that it rationally evaluated the risk and had a good-faith, reasonable belief that it was not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">{\u00b6 56} The trial court disagreed, finding:</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cPlaintiff made a good faith effort to settle this case for an amount far below that which was awarded at trial, and * * * the defense ignored Plaintiffs demand. Defendant never made any effort to settle the case or even to engage in settlement discussions. The Court further finds that Defendant and its insurer failed to rationally evaluate the risks and potential liability faced by Defendant in adopting an unwavering position that settlement would not be considered no matter what Plaintiff had to present, and that \u2018the Doctor would receive his day in Court.\u2019 Under the circumstances of this case, neither the Doctor, nor his corporation [MVES], nor his insurance carrier rationally evaluated the risk in this case, nor did any of them engage in a \u2018good faith effort to settle the case.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">{\u00b6 58} The trial court\u2019s decision is supported by competent, credible evidence. At the prejudgment-interest hearing, Dr. Jackson testified that his written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>consent was required to settle the case. And although Dr. Jackson recognized that there was, in his opinion, \u201cminimal risk\u201d of an adverse outcome at trial, he failed to consent to even a minimal settlement offer. He testified that he reviewed the evidence that emerged during discovery, including the opinions of two doctors who believed that he fell short of the standard of care, but nonetheless adhered to his decision not to consent to settlement. When asked why he withheld consent to settle, he replied that (1) he felt he had \u201cpracticed appropriate medicine\u201d and (2) he wanted his \u201cday in court.\u201d Further, Dr. Jackson said he was aware of the $475,000 settlement demand but could not recall having any discussions with his insurance carrier about responding to the demand. Most notably, Dr. Jackson testified that it was his intention from beginning to end to maintain the position that he would not give consent to settle the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">{\u00b6 59} Dr. White also testified at the prejudgment-interest hearing. He stated that as president of MVES, it was his understanding that he had the authority to overrule Dr. Jackson\u2019s decision to withhold consent, but he chose to leave the decision to Dr. Jackson. He further testified that he did not review any discovery materials aside from the emergency-room records. He agreed that a medical-malpractice case in which a death has occurred poses a potential for serious damages. Despite those risks, he never considered settlement. Dr. White also testified that he did not recall ever discussing Ross\u2019s $475,000 settlement demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">{\u00b6 60} Finally, Angela Yost, a claims adjuster for MVES\u2019s insurance carrier, testified. She admitted that there were risks involved in going to trial but that even after reviewing all of the discovery materials, she never asked Dr. Jackson for his consent to settle. It was her understanding that Dr. Jackson \u201cwanted his day in court.\u201d Yost claimed she made a \u201cgood faith effort to settle the case,\u201d but when asked to define what that meant, she was unable to do so. She conceded that actually no efforts were made to settle the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">{\u00b6 61} Based on the above, the trial court\u2019s award of prejudgment interest was supported by competent, credible evidence. All the witnesses testified that despite the potential risks involved, settlement was never considered. Nonetheless, MVES urges us to find that the trial court abused its discretion. In so doing, it likens its case to <em>Evans v. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co., </em>4th Dist. No. 05CA800, 2006-Ohio-319, 2006 WL 199624, a case in which the court found that the trial court abused its discretion by granting prejudgment interest. In <em>Evans, </em>the court found that the defendant\u2019s position of nonliability was rational and therefore the defendant was not obligated to engage in settlement discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">{\u00b6 62} However, <em>Evans </em>is distinguishable from the present case in several key respects. First, the defendant in <em>Evans </em>did make a settlement offer. Second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the nature of the case and the potential defenses in <em>Evans </em>are quite different from this case. In <em>Evans, </em>the defendant believed it would not be found liable because it predicted the jury would find that the plaintiffs conduct was an intervening cause for which the plaintiff was more than 50 percent liable. In the end, the jury found the plaintiff 27 percent liable. Further, the defendant in <em>Evans </em>had several other viable defenses that could have obviated liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">{\u00b6 63} By contrast, MVES failed to make any settlement offer, did not respond to Ross\u2019s settlement demand, and did not have any similarly viable defenses. The case is similar to <em>Garrett v. St. Elizabeth Health Ctr. </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 610, 756 N.E.2d 698, in which this court upheld the trial court\u2019s prejudgment-interest award. The defendant in <em>Garrett </em>also failed to make a settlement offer or to respond to the plaintiffs settlement demands. Further, a risk manager for the defendant in <em>Garrett </em>testified that despite the potential risk of litigation, he decided to \u201croll the dice\u201d and go forward with the \u201cbattle of experts\u201d rather than make any attempt at settlement. Similarly, in this case, Dr. Jackson, Dr. White, and Ms. Yost all held similar attitudes towards settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">{\u00b6 64} Moreover, \u201calthough it cannot be the only factor considered, a substantial disparity between an offer and a verdict is one factor that may be considered as demonstrating whether a party made a good-faith effort to settle.\u201d <em>Burton v. Slusher, </em>7th Dist. No. 07-MA-143, 2008-Ohio-4812, 2008 WL 4325911, at \u00b6 102, citing <em>Andre v. Case Design, Inc., </em>154 Ohio App.3d 323, 2003-Ohio-4960, 797 N.E.2d 132, at \u00b6 15. In this case, the jury verdict was $754,649, and defendant refused to respond to Ross\u2019s settlement offer at all. It goes without saying that this is a substantial disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">{\u00b6 65} In sum, the trial court\u2019s award of prejudgment interest in this case was reasonable, supported by competent, credible evidence, and therefore not an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s prejudgment-interest award. MVES\u2019s second assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">{\u00b6 66} All of MVES\u2019s arguments are meritless. With regard to the evidentiary matter, MVES failed to adequately proffer the testimony at issue. MVES failed to explain during the in camera hearing that Dr. Galan would provide proximate-cause testimony relating to the issue of medical management. In addition, based on <em>Galayda v. Lake Hosp. Sys., Inc. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 421, 428, 644 N.E.2d 298, we cannot find Ohio\u2019s prejudgment-interest statute, R.C. 1343.03(C), unconstitutional. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting prejudgment interest in this case, since MVES failed to rationally evaluate the risks and potential liability involved in the litigation and further failed to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>good-faith monetary settlement offer or respond in good-faith to Ross\u2019s settlement demand. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b757-6\">Vukovich, P.J., and Donofrio, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
