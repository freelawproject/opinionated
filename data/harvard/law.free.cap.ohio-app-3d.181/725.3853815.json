Appellant, Lawrence Owens, appeals the decision of the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas that found him guilty of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity pursuant to R.C. 2923.32(A)(1) and failure to comply with the order or signal of a police officer pursuant to R.C. 2921.331, and sentenced him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-16\">{\u00b6 2} Both Owens, acting pro se, and Owens\u2019s appointed counsel, filed briefs assigning errors in this matter. Both argue that the trial court lost jurisdiction to impose a sentence upon Owens because of an unreasonable delay between the plea and the sentence. However, the two diverge in their proposed remedies for this alleged error. Counsel contends that the error should result in the reversal and vacation of Owens\u2019s sentence, while Owens argues pro se that his conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>should also be vacated. Owens assigns three additional errors in his pro se brief: (1) his trial counsel was ineffective, (2) his plea agreement was invalid because he did not properly waive presentment of an amended charge to the grand jury, and (3) the trial court denied him his right to allocution as set forth in Crim.R. 32(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 3} Upon review of the record, only counsel\u2019s assignment of error is meritorious. The delay between the plea and the sentence was unreasonable and can only be attributed to the state. The proper remedy is the one espoused by counsel, i.e., Owens\u2019s sentence must be vacated. However, Owens\u2019s remaining three pro se assignments of error are meritless. The ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is waived by virtue of Owens\u2019s knowing, voluntary, and intelligent guilty plea. Owens\u2019s challenge to the validity of his plea agreement is meritless, because the record reveals that Owens knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to presentment of the amended charge to the grand jury. Finally, Owens\u2019s fourth pro se assignment of error, which relates to his Crim.R. 32(A)(1) right to allocution, is moot based upon our decision to vacate Owens\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">{\u00b6 4} Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part and vacated in part. Owens\u2019s conviction is affirmed and his sentence is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">{\u00b6 5} On June 2, 2005, Owens was indicted by the Mahoning County Grand Jury on one count of trafficking in marijuana pursuant to R.C. 2925.03(A)(2) and (C)(3)(f), a felony of the second degree; one count of failure to comply with the order or signal of a police officer pursuant to R.C. 2921.331(B), a felony of the third degree; and one count of possession of marijuana, pursuant to R.C. 2925.11(A)(C)(3)(f), a felony of the second degree. A criminal forfeiture specification for $34,450 was attached to the trafficking and possession charges pursuant to R.C. 2925.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">{\u00b6 6} On February 23, 2006, Owens pleaded guilty to one count of failure to comply with the order or signal of a police officer pursuant to R.C. 2921.331(B) and one amended count of pattern of corrupt activity, a second-degree felony pursuant to R.C. 2923.32(A)(1) and (B)(1). The predicate acts considered for the pattern-of-corrupt-activity charge were (1) conspiracy to traffic in marijuana, in violation of R.C. 2923.01 and 2925.03(A)(1) and (C)(3)(f), which would have been a third-degree felony if independently considered, and (2) attempted funding of a drug transaction, in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and 2925.05, which would have been a fourth-degree felony if independently considered. The plea agreement contained an express waiver of Owens\u2019s right to have the amended charge presented to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>{\u00b6 7} In exchange for the guilty plea, the state dismissed the possession charge and agreed to recommend that Owens be sentenced to a total of three years\u2019 imprisonment. In addition, Owens stipulated to the $34,450 forfeiture. The trial court accepted the plea as knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">{\u00b6 8} Prior to his sentencing, and while out on bond, Owens was arrested and jailed in Mercer County, Pennsylvania. As a result, on March 10, 2006, the state of Ohio filed a motion to terminate bond and proceed with sentencing. That same day, the trial court issued a judgment entry revoking Owens\u2019s bond, and ordering him to \u201cbe transferred, by extradition if necessary and or transported * * * to effectuate appearance before this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">{\u00b6 9} Owens signed a waiver of extradition with the Mercer County Court of Common Pleas on April 6, 2006. On April 14, 2006, the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas issued an order commanding the Mahoning County Sheriffs department to transfer Owens to Mahoning County for sentencing on April 26, 2006. The court also issued a bench warrant for Owens\u2019s arrest and a warrant for removal. However, according to a June 12, 2006 docket entry, the Pennsylvania authorities returned the warrant for removal and refused to release Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 10} The record reflects that no further action was taken on Owens\u2019s case until he was apprehended by Ohio authorities on July 18, 2007, following his release from jail in Pennsylvania. A sentencing hearing was initially set for August 8, 2007, but was continued in response to a motion filed by Owens. On September 6, 2007, Owens filed a motion to dismiss the charges due to the delay between the plea and the sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">{\u00b6 11} On September 6, 2007, Owens\u2019s sentencing hearing took place. First, the trial court summarily denied Owens\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges. Then the court invited Owens to speak on the record \u201cas to why judgment and sentence shouldn\u2019t be pronounced or in mitigation of punishment.\u201d Owens gave a lengthy statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court ultimately sentenced Owens to definite terms of three years for the pattern-of-corrupt-activity count and three years for the failure-to-comply count. The court ordered those terms to be served concurrently for a total of three years in prison. The court noted that Owens may be subject to a period of postrelease control for up to three years. Additionally, the court gave Owens credit for 548 days served, which included his time jailed in Pennsylvania. The court also specified that the time served would be credited as if Owens had been confined in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">{\u00b6 13} On November 20, 2007, the case was called for a resentencing hearing. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (\u201cODRC\u201d) had notified the trial court about a problem with the original sentencing order. Namely, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>order specified that the two counts were to be served concurrently, when R.C. 2921.331(D) actually mandates that a failure-to-comply count be served <em>consecutively </em>to any other prison term imposed on an offender. As a result, the trial court amended its sentencing order to comply with that statute. However, the overall length of the prison sentence, three years, remained the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 14} In addition, the trial court changed its previous order that Owens\u2019s Pennsylvania jail time would be credited as if it was penitentiary time. The court still credited Owens with the 548 days served, as in its previous sentencing order, but specified that this was time spent in the county jail, not in the penitentiary. The court then stated that \u201call other terms and conditions of the prior sentence of September 13, 2007, other than those specifically changed above, are incorporated herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">{\u00b6 15} During the resentencing hearing, Owens renewed his argument that the delay between the plea and the sentencing was unreasonable and that the charges should be dismissed. The trial court refused to revisit that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 16} On December 18, 2007, Owens filed a pro se notice of appeal. Owens also sought appointment of appellate counsel and filed an affidavit of indigency in support. On January 17, 2008, this court sustained Owens\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and appointed the Ohio Public Defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">(\u00b6 17} On March 18, 2008, Owens\u2019s appointed counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel due to her conflict of interest with Owens as to the issues to be presented on appeal. We granted that motion and appointed substitute counsel. On June 13, 2008, counsel filed a merit brief on Owens\u2019s behalf. The state filed its responsive brief on July 11, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">{\u00b6 18} Then, on July 17, 2008, Owens sent a letter to this court, which he apparently intended to serve as a pro se brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493, and <em>State v. Toney, </em>23 Ohio App.2d 203, 52 O.O.2d 304, 262 N.E.2d 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">{\u00b6 19} In response, within a judgment entry dated August 19, 2008, we noted that an Anders no-merit brief was not warranted in this case because counsel had filed a brief listing an assignment of error. We proceeded to instruct Owens that should he desire to file his own brief listing additional errors that he may petition the court for leave, and submit the brief in the proper format, as specified by the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure, within 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">{\u00b6 20} On September 18, 2008, Owens filed a pro se motion for leave to file a supplemental brief. He then filed that brief on September 23, 2008. The state responded and Owens replied.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">{\u00b6 21} On November 11, 2008, Owens filed with this court a pro se motion for stay of execution of his sentence and request to reinstate. We declined to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>action on the motion, because Owens had not first filed it with the trial court as required by the Appellate Rules. Owens subsequently filed a motion for stay with the trial court, which was overruled on November 24, 2008. Owens proceeded to file a motion for stay with this court, which we overruled on February 3, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Delay between the Plea and the Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 22} The sole assignment of error set forth by counsel, and Owens\u2019s third pro se assignment of error make similar arguments and therefore we will discuss them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">{\u00b6 23} Counsel\u2019s sole assignment of error asserts:</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe trial court lost jurisdiction to impose a sentence upon Defendant/Appellant due to the unjustified delay between Mr. Owens\u2019 February 23, 2006, plea hearing and his September 6, 2007 sentencing hearing and therefore said sentence is void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">{\u00b6 25} Owens third pro se assignment of error asserts:</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe trial court erred when it did not grant Appellant\u2019s motion for dismissal filed September 6th, 2007. Further, without affording him a hearing and therefore his charges should be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">{\u00b6 27} An unreasonable delay between a plea and a sentencing, which cannot be attributed to the defendant, will invalidate that sentence. <em>State v. Brown, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 8, 2003-Ohio-1218, 786 N.E.2d 492, at \u00b6 31. Our holding in <em>Brovm </em>was based upon an inference from the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Neal v. Maxwell </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 201, 24 O.O.2d 281, 192 N.E.2d 782. In <em>Neal, </em>the court held: \u201cIt is well established that the time of pronouncing sentence is within the discretion of the trial court and a delay for a reasonable time does not invalidate the sentence.\u201d Id. at 202, 24 O.O.2d 281, 192 N.E.2d 782. Based upon <em>Neal, </em>this court inferred that an unreasonable delay does invalidate a sentence. <em>Brown </em>at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Brovm, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to charges in Columbiana County, but prior to his sentencing was arrested and detained in Jefferson County pursuant to a request for extradition to Colorado. He was subsequently extradited to Colorado. When Brown failed to appear in Columbiana County for his scheduled sentencing, the trial court ordered the County Sheriff to retrieve him from Colorado, and issued a bench warrant for Brown\u2019s arrest. However, Brown was not returned to Ohio, and for 20 months thereafter, neither the state, nor the trial court made any efforts to effect a valid sentence upon Brown. Finally, over three years after he had entered his guilty plea, Brown was sentenced via video conference. On appeal, we reversed Brown\u2019s sentence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>holding that the 20-month delay was unreasonable and divested the trial court of jurisdiction to render the sentence. <em>Broum </em>at \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">{\u00b6 29} As this court noted in <em>Brown, </em>\u201cappellate courts which have dealt with this issue * * * have uniformly concluded that any delay in sentencing must be reasonable in order to be valid.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 8, 2003-Ohio-1218, 786 N.E.2d 492, \u00b6 20. For example, in <em>Warren v. Ross </em>(1996), 116 Ohio App.3d 275, 277, 688 N.E.2d 3, the court held that the trial court lost jurisdiction to impose a driver\u2019s license suspension because there was an unexplained four-year delay in imposing that sentence. Similarly, in <em>Willoughby v. Lukehart </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 74, 76, 529 N.E.2d 206, the court reversed a sentence after an unjustified delay of 13 months between the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">{\u00b6 30} Further, in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2002-07-016, 2003-Ohio-6261, 2003 WL 22764425, the court, relying on <em>Brown, </em>held that a six-and-a-half year delay in sentencing the defendant was unreasonable. In <em>Johnson, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to charges; was released on bond; failed to appear at the sentencing hearing; and soon thereafter was arrested, charged and convicted of unrelated offenses in Kentucky. Both Johnson and his attorney wrote letters to the Ohio court notifying it of Johnson\u2019s whereabouts and requesting disposition of the case. However, the court failed to sentence Johnson until he was released from prison in Kentucky, over six years later. The Twelfth District held that this unexplained, unreasonable delay divested the trial court of jurisdiction to sentence Johnson, and thus reversed the sentence. <em>Johnson </em>at \u00b6 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">{\u00b6 31} In the present case, the delay between Owens\u2019s guilty plea and the sentencing was also unreasonable. The docket indicates that the Pennsylvania authorities refused to release Owens on June 12, 2006, and that for over 13 months thereafter, neither the trial court nor the state made any attempt to effect a valid sentence upon Owens, despite the fact that Owens waived extradition with the Pennsylvania court.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 32} There are several methods that the state and/or the trial court could have used to sentence Owens. They could have sentenced him by video conference, commenced formal extradition proceedings pursuant to R.C. 2963.01, or requested a waiver from Owens of his right to be physically present at the sentencing hearing. <em>Brown </em>at \u00b6 26-28; <em>Johnson </em>at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">{\u00b6 33} The state provides no reasons why none of these methods were utilized. Instead, the state makes two arguments against vacating Owens\u2019s sentence, both of which are meritless. First, the state argues that this assignment of error is moot because Owens already got a remedy, namely, the resentencing hearing. However, the remedy for an unreasonable delay in sentencing is not a resentencing hearing; rather, it is the vacation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>sentence. See <em>Brown, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 8, 2003-Ohio-1218, 786 N.E.2d 492, at \u00b6 31; <em>Johnson, </em>2003-Ohio-6261, 2003 WL 22764425, at \u00b6 18. Second, the state contends that the delay in sentencing cannot be attributed to the state or to the trial court. However, as explained above, the state and the trial court inexplicably failed to utilize the options available to them to sentence Owens within a reasonable time. Moreover, as in <em>Brown </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>the delay cannot be attributed to Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">{\u00b6 34} The dissent emphasizes the fact that Owens\u2019s location at the time of his originally scheduled sentencing hearing, that is, in a Pennsylvania jail, was not attributable to the state. However, the fact that a defendant\u2019s unavailability for sentencing was caused by his out-of-state incarceration does not necessarily mean that the delay was reasonable. See, e.g., <em>Johnson. </em>Looking at the totality of the circumstances in this case, to wit: Ohio authorities knew Owens\u2019s whereabouts, Owens waived extradition, the 13-month period in which no action was taken by the state, Owens was jailed not far from Mahoning County, and other methods were available to sentence Owens even absent extradition, we find that the delay was unreasonable, and therefore Owens\u2019s sentence is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">{\u00b6 35} Owens argues in his pro se brief that the proper remedy for this unreasonable delay is that his conviction be vacated. However, in <em>Brown, </em>we held that the remedy for an unreasonable delay is for \u201cthe sentence [to] be reversed, rather than a full dismissal of the charges.\u201d <em>Brown </em>at \u00b6 30, citing <em>Ross, </em>116 Ohio App.3d at 277, 688 N.E.2d 3, and <em>Lukehart, </em>39 Ohio App.3d at 76, 529 N.E.2d 206. See also <em>Johnson </em>at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">{\u00b6 36} Owens also argues at length in his pro se brief that the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (\u201cIAD\u201d), codified as R.C. 2963.30, governs his case and mandates that his conviction be reversed. The IAD provides a system for prisoners incarcerated in one state to be temporarily extradited to another state to face charges there.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">{\u00b6 37} However, Owens\u2019s reliance on the IAD is misplaced. The IAD does not apply to detainers placed on prisoners who have already been convicted and need only to be sentenced. See <em>Brown </em>at \u00b6 25; <em>State v. Barnes </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 351, 352-353, 14 OBR 418, 471 N.E.2d 514. Rather, the IAD applies only to \u201cuntried\u201d indictments, informations, and complaints. R.C. 2963.30, Articles 1,111(a), IV(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">{\u00b6 38} Thus, based on the foregoing, counsel\u2019s sole assignment of error is meritorious. The state and the trial court had several methods to effectuate a valid sentence upon Owens within a reasonable time, and they failed to do so. Owens\u2019s sentence is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">{\u00b6 39} In his first pro se assignment of error, Owens argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cAppellant\u2019s Trial Counsel was ineffective when he induced him into an invalid plea agreement and therefore his plea and indictment are invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cTo prove ineffective assistance of counsel an appellant must show: (1) that the trial attorney made errors so egregious that the trial attorney was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment, and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced appellant\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>State v. Kolat, </em>7th Dist. No. 07BE5, 2008-Ohio-869, 2008 WL 564881, at \u00b6 11, citing <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 686-687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">{\u00b6 42} However, \u201c \u2018[ejntry of a voluntary guilty plea waives ineffective assistance of counsel claims except to the extent that counsel\u2019s performance causes the waiver of Defendant\u2019s trial rights and the entry of his plea to be less than knowing and voluntary.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Fatula, </em>7th Dist. No. 07BE24, 2008-Ohio-1544, 2008 WL 852027, at \u00b6 9, quoting <em>State v. Kidd, </em>2d Dist. No. 03CA43, 2004-Ohio-6784, 2004 WL 2903886, at \u00b6 16. See also <em>State v. Spates </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 269, 595 N.E.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">{\u00b6 43} In this case, Owens contends that his trial counsel was ineffective in that he somehow \u201cinduced\u201d him to plead guilty to charges that stemmed from an \u201cinvalid\u201d indictment. However, there is no evidence that trial counsel induced Owens to enter the guilty plea. To the contrary, Owens\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\"> {\u00b6 44} In a criminal case, a plea must be made \u201cknowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.\u201d <em>State v. Engle </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 525, 527, 660 N.E.2d 450. Failure on any of these points \u201crenders enforcement of the plea unconstitutional under both the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution.\u201d Id. A determination whether a plea is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary is based upon a review of the record. <em>State v. Spates </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 269, 272, 595 N.E.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">{\u00b6 45} To help ensure that guilty pleas are knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made, Crim.R. 11(C) sets forth specific procedural requirements that a trial judge follows when accepting a guilty plea from a defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">(\u00b6 46} \u201c(C) Pleas of guilty and no contest in felony cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c(1) Where in a felony case the defendant is unrepresented by counsel the court shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest unless the defendant, after being readvised that he or she has the right to be represented by retained counsel, or pursuant to Crim.R. 44 by appointed counsel, waives this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>{\u00b6 48} \u201c(2) In felony cases the court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty or a plea of no contest, and shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without first addressing the defendant personally and doing all of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c(a) Determining that the defendant is making the plea voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charges and of the maximum penalty involved, and, if applicable, that the defendant is not eligible for probation or for the imposition of community control sanctions at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c(b) Informing the defendant of and determining that the defendant understands the effect of the plea of guilty or no contest, and that the court, upon acceptance of the plea, may proceed with judgment and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c(c) Informing the defendant and determining that the defendant understands that by the plea the defendant is waiving the rights to jury trial, to confront witnesses against him or her, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in the defendant\u2019s favor, and to require the state to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a trial at which the defendant cannot be compelled to testify against himself or herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">{\u00b6 52} Subsection (2)(c) sets forth various constitutional rights that the trial court <em>must </em>discuss with the defendant prior to accepting a plea. The court must explain that by entering a plea the defendant is waiving these rights. With respect to these constitutional rights, strict compliance with Crim.R. 11(C) is required. <em>State v. Ballard </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 473, 477, 20 O.O.3d 397, 423 N.E.2d 115. See generally <em>Boykin v. Alabama </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">{\u00b6 53} Subsections (2)(a) and (b) set forth various nonconstitutional rights that the trial court must also discuss with the defendant prior to accepting his plea. See <em>State v. Root, </em>7th Dist. No. 07MA32, 2007-Ohio-7202, 2007 WL 4696810, at \u00b6 14. However, with respect to these nonconstitutional rights, only \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with Crim.R. 11(C) is required. <em>State v. Nero </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 106, 108, 564 N.E.2d 474. \u201cSubstantial compliance means that under the totality of the circumstances, the defendant subjectively understands the implications of his plea and the rights he is waiving.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">{\u00b6 54} In the present case, the transcript of the plea hearing indicates that the trial court complied with all portions of Crim.R. 11(C). Owens was represented by counsel, both prior to and during the hearing. The trial court explained to Owens that by pleading guilty he would relinquish his constitutional rights to a jury trial, to have the state prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to confront adverse witnesses, and to compel the attendance of witnesses he might wish to present in his favor. The trial court also explained that Owens could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>compelled to testify against himself at trial. Owens indicated his complete understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">{\u00b6 55} The trial court also explained to Owens his nonconstitutional rights. The court informed Owens of the nature of the charges against him and the maximum penalties involved. In addition, the trial court informed Owens that upon acceptance of his plea the court could proceed to judgment and sentencing. The court did not specifically state that the offenses were nonprobational; however, the court substantially complied with this requirement by informing Owens about the statutory sentencing ranges for each count, all of which required prison time. See <em>Nero, </em>56 Ohio St.3d at 108, 564 N.E.2d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">(\u00b6 56} Owens indicated that he understood the rights he would waive by pleading guilty and that he wished to go forward with the plea. Thus, all of the Crim.R. 11 requirements were satisfied, and Owens\u2019s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">{\u00b6 57} Nonetheless, Owens makes two arguments as to why his plea was unknowing, both of which are meritless. First, as indicated earlier, he argues that counsel somehow induced him to enter a plea of guilty. However, there is simply no support in the record for this allegation. Moreover, Owens indicated during the plea hearing that he was not threatened or promised anything in exchange for his guilty plea and that he was satisfied with his counsel\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">{\u00b6 58} Second, Owens appears to argue in his reply brief that there was insufficient evidence to support the pattern-of-corrupt-activity conviction and that this somehow meant that his plea was unknowing. However, this argument is also meritless. During the plea hearing, Owens knowingly relinquished his constitutional right to have the state prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">{\u00b6 59} In sum, Owens\u2019s plea was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made, and thus his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is waived. <em>Fatula, </em>2008-Ohio-1544, at \u00b6 9. Accordingly, Owens\u2019s first pro se assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">Waiver of Presentment of the Amended Charge to the Grand Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">{\u00b6 60} In Owens\u2019s second pro se assignment of error he argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cAppellant\u2019s indictment and amended plea agreement are defective and appellate court should apply plain error review of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, (sic) 52(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">{\u00b6 62} Here Owens essentially argues that his plea agreement was invalid because it included a new charge that was never presented to the grand jury. Owens was first indicted by the grand jury on one count of trafficking in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>marijuana pursuant to R.C. 2925.03(A)(C)(3), one count of failure to comply with the order or signal of a police officer pursuant to R.C. 2921.331(B), and one count of possession of marijuana pursuant to R.C. 2925.11(A)(C)(3). He subsequently pleaded guilty to one amended count of pattern of corrupt activity, pursuant to R.C. 2923.32(A)(1), and one count of failure to comply with the order or signal of a police officer pursuant to R.C. 2921.331(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">{\u00b6 63} It is true that the pattern-of-corrupt-activity charge was never presented to the grand jury. However, Owens\u2019s plea agreement contained an express waiver of his right to have that amended charge so presented. Nonetheless, Owens contends that this waiver was invalid because he \u201cwaived rights that (in fact) he could not waive.\u201d He therefore argues that his plea agreement was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">{\u00b6 64} Owens\u2019s argument here is meritless. The Ohio Constitution does provide that \u201cno person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury.\u201d Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution. However, pursuant to Crim.R. 7(A), and R.C. 2941.021, this right may be waived. See also <em>Stacy v. Van Coren </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 188, 189-190, 47 O.O.2d 397, 248 N.E.2d 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">{\u00b6 65} R.C. 2941.021, prosecution by information, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cAny criminal offense which is not punishable by death or life imprisonment may be prosecuted by information filed in the common pleas court by the prosecuting attorney if the defendant, after he has been advised by the court of the nature of the charge against him and of his rights under the constitution, is represented by counsel or has affirmatively waived counsel by waiver in writing and in open court, waives in writing and in open court prosecution by indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">{\u00b6 67} Crim.R. 7(A), use of indictment or information, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cA felony that may be punished by death or life imprisonment shall be prosecuted by indictment. All other felonies shall be prosecuted by indictment, except that after a defendant has been advised by the court of the nature of the charge against the defendant and of the defendant\u2019s right to indictment, the defendant may waive that right in writing and in open court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">{\u00b6 69} In <em>State v. Susany, </em>7th Dist. No. 07MA7, 2008-Ohio-1543, 2008 WL 852066, at \u00b6 21-39, we held that the defendant\u2019s waiver of indictment was valid where he was represented by counsel; he was fully aware of the charges against him at the time he signed his waiver of indictment and at the time of his guilty plea; and he entered his plea knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">{\u00b6 70} In the present case, the record reflects that Owens was represented by counsel and was fully aware of the charges against him at the time he signed his waiver of indictment and at the time of his guilty plea. During the plea hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>the court explained the nature of the amended charge, i.e., pattern of corrupt activity, and Owens stipulated that he waived his right to a new indictment on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">{\u00b6 71} In addition, in the context of his written plea agreement, Owens waived presentment of the amended charge to the grand jury. Specifically, the plea agreement states:</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">{\u00b6 72} \u201c1. My counsel had advised me and I fully understand the nature of the charge(s) against me and the elements contained therein. * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">{\u00b6 73} \u201c2. I understand that by my plea I waive certain important and substantial constitutional rights, including * * * my right to have a grand jury review my case as to the amended charges herein. I also waive any and all argument that I have or may have made concerning the amendment of the charges at [sic] it relates to Criminal Rule 7 (amendment of charges to a charge with a different name.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">{\u00b6 74} Further, as explained above, the record reflects that Owens\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">{\u00b6 75} Accordingly, Owens effectively waived his right to a presentment of the amended charge to the grand jury, and therefore his third pro se assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Crim.R. 32(A)(1) Right to Allocution</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">{\u00b6 76} In his fourth and final pro se assignment of error, Owens asserts:</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">(\u00b6 77} \u201cThe trial court erred when it denied appellant his \u2018general right to allocution\u2019 set forth in Ohio Criminal Rule 32(A)(1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">{\u00b6 78} Based upon our resolution of counsel\u2019s sole assignment of error, this issue is moot, and therefore we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">{\u00b6 79} Counsel\u2019s sole assignment of error is meritorious. The delay between Owens\u2019s plea and the sentence was unreasonable and can be attributed only to the state. However, Owens\u2019s first three pro se assignments of error are meritless and his fourth assignment of error is rendered moot. First, Owens is incorrect in stating that his conviction should be vacated due to the unreasonable delay between the plea and sentence; the proper remedy for that error is vacation of the sentence only. Second, Owens\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is waived by virtue of Owens\u2019s knowing, voluntary, and intelligent guilty plea. Third, his challenge to the validity of the plea agreement is meritless because Owens\u2019s knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to presentment of the amended charge to the grand jury. Finally, Owens\u2019s fourth pro se assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ment of error is moot in light of our resolution of counsel\u2019s sole assignment of error. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part and vacated in part. Owens\u2019s conviction is affirmed, and his sentence is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Judgment affirmed in part and vacated in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b771-5\">Donofrio, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b771-6\">Vukovich, P.J., dissents with dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b771-7\">Vukovich, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ac5\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">{\u00b6 80} I dissent from the decision to vacate appellant\u2019s sentence. I would hold that the delay in sentencing was not unreasonable in this case and that the trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. This case is more similar to the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Neal </em>case than to our <em>Brown </em>case, and our holding in <em>Brown </em>actually supports the denial of appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">{\u00b6 81} In <em>Neal, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that waiting for the resolution of a related indictment and thus deferring a sentence for ten months after conviction was not unreasonable, as the severity of sentence could be affected by the other charges. <em>Neal v. Maxwell </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 201, 202, 24 O.O.2d 281, 192 N.E.2d 782 (noting that the trial court has discretion in determining the proper time for sentencing). In <em>Brown, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty in May 1998, the court issued a bench warrant to retrieve the defendant from Colorado in August 1998, and then, nothing occurred in the case until the defendant filed a motion to dismiss in March 2000. <em>State v. Brown, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 8, 2003-Ohio-1218, 786 N.E.2d 492. The trial court then waited over a month to issue a ruling that gave the state an additional one year to procure the defendant for sentencing. Over a year after that, sentencing proceeded by video.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">{\u00b6 82} Notably, the defendant in <em>Brown </em>appeared at an extradition action in Ohio seemingly indicating a desire to be sentenced for his Ohio crimes prior to any extradition to Colorado. Instead of ensuring that he was sentenced for his Ohio crimes, the court transferred him to Colorado. We focused on this fact and found that Ohio was responsible for the situation of the defendant\u2019s unavailability. We also noted that if the defendant had waived extradition to Colorado, then we would have found that his unavailability for Ohio sentencing was attributable to the defendant. Id. at \u00b6 23, 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">{\u00b6 83} Thus, it appears that our analysis in delayed-sentencing cases should include consideration of the following nondispositive factors: the amount of total delay (minus defendant continuances), the amount of delay during which no action occurred, the reason for the delay, and if absence from the state is part of the reason, the party to whom the absence is attributable.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>{\u00b6 84} Here, two weeks after his February 2006 plea was entered and while his presentence investigation was being compiled, appellant committed crimes in Pennsylvania. He was immediately arrested and jailed <em>in that state. </em>Thus, he directly caused his incarceration in Pennsylvania and his absence from Ohio. The situation is distinguishable from <em>Brown </em>on this fact alone as Brown\u2019s absence was said to be attributable to the state because even though that defendant seemed to ask to be sentenced before extradition, the Ohio court proceeded to release the defendant to Colorado prior to the Ohio sentencing hearing. The fact that appellant was jailed out of state also distinguishes this case from the two cases cited in <em>Brown </em>with shorter delays, as those defendants were sitting in the local jail awaiting sentencing with no reason for the failure to set a sentencing hearing. See <em>State v. Tucker </em>(May 2, 1989), 10th Dist. No. 88AP-550, 1989 WL 47102; <em>Willoughby v. Lukehart </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 74, 529 N.E.2d 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">{\u00b6 85} Moreover, during the Ohio trial court\u2019s timely attempts to retrieve him, appellant waived extradition in the Pennsylvania court. Despite this waiver, Pennsylvania would not honor our warrant for removal and refused the sheriffs attempt to execute the warrant. We also note that Ohio retrieved appellant immediately upon his release in July 2007, and the trial court immediately set sentencing within the month, giving him time to prepare. That hearing was continued only at his request. Thus, the sentence would have been imposed the month prior to his motion to dismiss if he had not filed a continuance of the sentencing hearing, whereas in <em>Brown, </em>the sentence was not imposed until over a year after the defendant filed his motion to dismiss for delay. The time period here is more comparable to the ten months in <em>Neal </em>than the more than three years in <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">{\u00b6 86} Furthermore, there can be no doubt that the few months leading up to Pennsylvania\u2019s refusal of Ohio\u2019s warrant constituted a reasonable time period and a reasonable initial attempt at retrieval. Similarly, there can be no question that the time between Owens\u2019s retrieval by Ohio and his original sentencing date was reasonable. As acknowledged by the majority, the only contestable time period is the 13 months after the refusal by Pennsylvania during which no attempt to sentence appellant was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">{\u00b6 87} In evaluating this delay, I note that he was incarcerated in a jail, not a prison, allowing the requesting court to infer that potential incarceration would be shorter rather than longer. In other words, if the anticipated release date is ten years away, the court might be obligated to find a way to sentence the defendant, but where the anticipated release date is not that far in the future, the court has some discretion to wait.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">{\u00b6 88} Finally, appellant not only got himself incarcerated out of state, but the holding jail refused the Ohio court\u2019s warrant for removal notwithstanding appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>lant\u2019s waiver of extradition, which procedure is not the exclusive remedy in any event. See R.C. 2963.21. To the contrary, in <em>Brown, </em>there was no indication that the trial court\u2019s warrant was refused by the other state or that any attempt was made by the sheriffs office to retrieve the defendant as was performed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">{\u00b6 89} In conclusion, no one factor is dispositive, but in balancing the factors, I find that the delay was not so unreasonable that vacation of the sentence is required under the totality of the facts and circumstances existing herein. I would conclude that after a county jail in another state refuses a warrant for removal even though the defendant waived extradition, it is not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to determine that sentencing could wait until the defendant is released from that jail, especially where there is a plan in place to immediately retrieve him from that jail upon his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">{\u00b6 90} This is particularly true where the location of the defendant at the time of the originally scheduled sentencing was not attributable to the state, as was the crux of our holding in <em>Brown. </em>Id. at \u00b6 23 (\u201cObviously, if appellant had waived extradition so that the authorities in Jefferson County were forced to deliver him into the custody of officials from the state of Colorado, he would have been responsible for any subsequent effects of that decision, such as missing his sentencing hearing in Columbiana County\u201d). See also <em>State v. Fugate, </em>6th Dist. No. F-07-003, 2007-Ohio-6126, 2007 WL 3408262, \u00b6 12 (defendant\u2019s mere act of committing crimes and becoming incarcerated in other state pending sentencing justifies a delay of one and one half years; also finding waiver of issue). Such a holding would not be inconsistent with <em>Brown. </em>Thus, I would affirm appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
