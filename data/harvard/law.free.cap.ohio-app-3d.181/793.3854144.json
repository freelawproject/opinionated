Stewart, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">{\u00b6 1} The mother, C.J., and the father, R.N., appeal from a juvenile division order that granted permanent custody of their daughter, six-year-old A.N., to the Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services (the \u201cagency\u201d). The mother complains that the court failed to adequately consider whether she had the requisite mental competency to assist assigned counsel in defending the agency\u2019s motion for permanent custody. The father complains that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to attend a number of court hearings and that the court lacked clear and convincing evidence to justify awarding permanent custody to the agency. We consolidated the separate appeals for hearing and disposition and have expedited the hearing and disposition of these appeals as required by App.R. 11.1(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b828-17\">{\u00b6 2} The mother argues that the court erred by declaring her competent to participate in the proceedings on the agency\u2019s motions for temporary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>permanent custody. She maintains that despite an expert opinion to the contrary, her well-documented history of current mental illness showed that she lacked the ability to assist counsel in the proceedings against her. The state contends that there is no requirement that the mother be competent to assist in defending custody rights in a juvenile court case, because her mental illness itself is a basis for granting permanent custody to the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">{\u00b6 3} The mother incorrectly seeks to apply her right to counsel to suggest that her inability to assist her court-appointed attorney in defending the agency\u2019s motion for permanent custody prohibited the court from going forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">{\u00b6 4} The right to counsel in proceedings to terminate parental rights is a due-process right. <em>Lassiter v. Durham Cty. Dept. of Social Serv. </em>(1981), 452 U.S. 18, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640. Ohio, however, \u201cprovides a statutory right to appointed counsel that goes beyond constitutional requirements.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Asberry v. Payne </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 44, 46, 693 N.E.2d 794. Under R.C. 2151.352, a child\u2019s parents are entitled to representation by legal counsel at all stages of the proceedings under R.C. Chapter 2151.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id. at 48, 693 N.E.2d 794; <em>In re Williams, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 398, 2004-Ohio-1500, 805 N.E.2d 1110, \u00b6 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">{\u00b6 5} Unlike criminal cases, in which the test of a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial is whether a defendant \u201chas sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him,\u201d <em>Dusky v. United States </em>(1960), 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824, there is no such test in custody cases in the juvenile court. To the contrary, the Revised Code specifically contemplates that a parent\u2019s mental illness might form the basis of a motion for permanent custody when it is \u201cso severe that it makes the parent unable to provide an adequate permanent home for the child at the present time and, as anticipated, within one year\u201d after the hearing on permanent custody. See R.C. 2151.414(E)(2). It follows that a parent\u2019s mental illness is not, by itself, a basis for finding that a parent cannot understand the nature of the proceedings in a way that would violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\"> {\u00b6 6} In any event, \u201c[t]he term \u2018mental illness\u2019 does not necessarily equate with the definition of legal incompetency.\u201d <em>State v. Berry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>St.3d 354, 650 N.E.2d 433, syllabus. Although the mother\u2019s mental illness was in large part the basis for the agency\u2019s request for permanent custody,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the parties agreed that she was competent to understand the nature of the legal proceedings. A court-appointed psychologist who interviewed the mother following the court\u2019s competency referral concluded with a reasonable degree of psychological certainty that the mother \u201cunderstands the nature of the case plan and her responsibilities\u201d and was \u201caware of the consequences of not following through with her case plan being losing permanent custody.\u201d The psychologist concluded that the mother \u201cis capable of understanding the nature of and objectives of her DCFS legal proceeding, and is minimally capable of assisting in her defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">{\u00b6 7} When the court convened the parties for a hearing on the mother\u2019s competency, her attorney said, \u201cWe\u2019ll stipulate to [the competency] report.\u201d The court issued a journal entry in which it noted that it had reviewed the psychologist\u2019s conclusions and, further noting that the mother had both legal counsel and a guardian ad litem appointed to represent her interests, found that she was \u201csufficiently competent to participate in these proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">{\u00b6 8} Given her attorney\u2019s stipulation to her competency, the mother cannot now complain that the court erred by finding her competent to participate in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">{\u00b6 9} The mother also complains that the court erred during the adjudicatory phase by accepting her admission that the child had been abused and neglected without first ensuring that she had knowingly entered that admission pursuant to Juv.R. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">{\u00b6 10} We have no jurisdiction to consider this argument because the mother did not separately appeal from that order. R.C. Chapter 2151 employs a two-stage procedure for awarding temporary custody of a child to a children\u2019s services agency: the \u201cadjudication\u201d stage, at which a child is declared, among other things, neglected or dependant, and a \u201cdispositional\u201d stage, at which the court awards temporary custody to a public children\u2019s services agency pursuant to R.C. 2151.353(A)(2). See <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 556 N.E.2d 1169, syllabus. \u201cAn appeal of an adjudication order of abuse, dependency, or neglect and the award of temporary custody pursuant to R.C. 2151.353(A)(2) must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>be filed within 30 days of the judgment entry pursuant to App.R. 4(A).\u201d <em>In re H.F., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 499, 2008-Ohio-6810, 900 N.E.2d 607, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">{\u00b6 11} The mother did not appeal within 30 days from the neglect adjudication and dispositional order that placed the child into the agency\u2019s temporary custody. We therefore lack jurisdiction to address any arguments relating to those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">{\u00b6 12} The father first argues that the court erred by granting the agency\u2019s motion for permanent custody because he participated in the court proceedings and expressed an interest in taking custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">{\u00b6 13} The court terminated the father\u2019s parental rights by finding clear and convincing evidence that permanent custody was in the best interest of the child, because after the child had been placed outside the home, the father failed continuously and repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions causing the child to be placed outside the home; the father had demonstrated a lack of commitment to the child by failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the child; and the father had abandoned the child. The court also found that the child had been in the temporary custody of the agency for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period. See R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d). The father does not dispute the court\u2019s finding that the child had been in the agency\u2019s temporary custody for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period. The question is whether the court had clear and convincing evidence to show that a grant of permanent custody was in the best interest of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">{\u00b6 14} When considering whether there is clear and convincing evidence that a child\u2019s best interest requires the court to grant permanent custody to a children\u2019s services agency, the court must consider the nonexhaustive factors set forth in R.C. 2151.414(D):</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(1) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s parents, siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any other person who may significantly affect the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(2) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(3) The custodial history of the child, including whether the child has been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period ending on or after March 18, 1999;</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>{\u00b6 18} \u201c(4) The child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the agency;</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(5) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section apply in relation to the parents and child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">{\u00b6 20} Although the court must consider all of the R.C. 2151.414(D) factors, only one of them needs to be resolved in favor of the award of permanent custody in order for the court to terminate parental rights. See <em>In re Z.T., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 88009, 2007-Ohio-827, 2007 WL 613998, \u00b6 56; <em>In re T.M., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83933, 2004-Ohio-5222, 2004 WL 2340654. \u201cClear and convincing\u201d evidence is evidence sufficient to cause the trier of fact to develop a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established. <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus. An appellate court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision on parental rights and custody unless it finds that the decision is unsupported by \u201csufficient evidence to meet the clear and convincing standard of proof.\u201d <em>In re Dylan C. </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 115, 121, 699 N.E.2d 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">{\u00b6 21} The evidence showed that the father had no presence in the child\u2019s life until after the agency obtained temporary custody of the child in July 2006. A case plan implemented by the agency required the father to establish paternity, attend parenting classes, and obtain employment. The father established paternity and attended some parenting classes, but was thereafter dismissed from the parenting class due to nonattendance. The father did not obtain employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">{\u00b6 22} The case plan also called for the father to establish suitable housing for the child. At the time the agency obtained temporary custody of the child, the father shared a two-bedroom apartment with another male. The agency considered this inappropriate housing for the child, and the father indicated that he would be willing to move in with his grandmother. The father did not, however, contact the agency to inform it whether he had obtained adequate housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">{\u00b6 23} The facts belie the father\u2019s contention that he participated in the proceedings. The agency showed that the father had a single visit with the child in November 2006. Although the visit went well, the father did not respond to the agency\u2019s later attempts to contact him' for additional visitations, and the father himself did not request any additional visitation. Apart from the November 2006 visitation with the child, the father had no further involvement in the case, despite the agency\u2019s repeated attempts to contact him. As of the October 2008 dispositional hearing, the father had not attended any court hearing, despite being served with notice at both his apartment and his grandmother\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>{\u00b6 24} The father demonstrated a lack of commitment toward the child by failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the child. Moreover, the child had been progressing well in foster care, and the foster parents had indicated their desire to adopt her. Finally, the child\u2019s guardian ad litem recommended granting permanent custody to the agency, specifically noting that he had discussed with the father the possibility of custody, but that after the father showed an initial interest, \u201che subsequently did not participate\u201d in the proceedings. These facts constitute clear and convincing evidence that a grant of permanent custody to the agency was in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">{\u00b625} Finally, the father argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his court-appointed attorney failed to attend any of the proceedings after the July 2006 hearing on the agency\u2019s motion for temporary custody. The agency maintains that the court appointed counsel solely for purposes of the adjudicatory phase and that it was incumbent on the father to request a new appointment of counsel after the agency filed its motion for permanent custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">{\u00b6 26} We find no basis for the agency\u2019s assertion that the father\u2019s legal representation terminated when the court granted temporary custody of the child to the agency. The court order appointing the father\u2019s attorney specifically referred to R.C. 2151.352. That section states: \u201cA child, the child\u2019s parents or custodian, or any other person in loco parentis of the child is entitled to representation by legal counsel <em>at all stages of the proceedings under this chapter </em>or Chapter 2152. of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As earlier noted, there are two stages in permanent-custody proceedings brought under R.C. Chapter 2151 \u2014 the adjudicatory stage and the dispositional stage. See <em>In re Baby Girl Baxter </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 229, 233, 17 OBR 469, 479 N.E.2d 257. Even though these stages are distinct in that orders rendered from them are considered final and appealable, <em>In re H.F., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 499, 2008-Ohio-6810, 900 N.E.2d 607, the fact remains that R.C. 2151.352 acknowledges the separate nature of the adjudicatory and dispositional phases by referring to \u201cstages,\u201d in the plural. This section applies with equal force to both the adjudicatory and the dispositional phases of the proceedings, so the court plainly ordered that counsel be appointed for the duration of all stages in the custody matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">{\u00b6 27} We also fail to see how the agency\u2019s argument can succeed when the record plainly shows that the mother\u2019s assigned counsel and the guardians ad litem for the mother and child continued to appear at the dispositional stage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>the proceedings without further reappointment by the court. If the mother\u2019s attorney could continue to serve without reappointment by the court or objection from the agency, the agency\u2019s argument relating to the father\u2019s attorney is wholly undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">{\u00b6 28} In any event, the record shows that the father\u2019s attorney continued aspects of representation after the court had completed the adjudicatory phase, and the court specifically recognized that fact. On January 24, 2008, counsel for the father filed motions for discovery and for permission to inspect any mental-health reports or assessments of the parties. These motions postdated the adjudicatory phase of the proceedings, so it is plain that the father\u2019s attorney continued to represent the father. We therefore find that the father\u2019s attorney remained duly appointed for all stages of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">{\u00b6 29} The father next argues that his assigned counsel was ineffective for failing to attend a number of hearings conducted by the court, including the hearing on the agency\u2019s motion for permanent custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">{\u00b6 30} We review ineffective assistance of counsel claims using the test announced in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 691-692, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674: ineffective assistance of counsel consists of (1) an error by counsel that was professionally unreasonable and (2) but for that error, the result or verdict would have been different. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">{\u00b6 31} The father\u2019s assertion that his attorney missed every hearing is not entirely accurate. The record shows that the attorney missed hearings on December 6, 2006, and March 15, May 17, and June 21, 2007, but that the court failed to offer adequate notice of the hearings to the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">{\u00b6 32} The attorney did, however, miss hearings on February 8, February 12, August 14, and October 17, 2007, and March 19, June 5, and October 21, 2008, despite having notice. Not all of these hearings specifically required the father\u2019s presence \u2014 for example, the February 12, 2007 hearing concerned the agency\u2019s motion to suspend the mother\u2019s visitation and did not directly implicate the father. Nevertheless, the court did express concerns during the October 17, 2007 hearing about the attorney\u2019s failure to attend hearings. The court stated that it would attempt to reach the father\u2019s attorney and that if it did not receive a response from him within 24 hours, the attorney would be removed and the father would have to reappear in court to request the appointment of new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">{\u00b6 33} Obviously, the court had such significant concerns about the attorney\u2019s absences that it considered removing the attorney. No extenuating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>circumstances to justify the attorney\u2019s absence from so many hearings are apparent on the record. At the very least, the attorney had the obligation to appear for the permanent-custody hearing. We therefore find that the father established that the attorney\u2019s conduct fell below a standard of reasonable representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">{\u00b6 34} Despite finding that the attorney breached an essential duty to the father by failing to attend the hearings, we cannot say that but for the attorney\u2019s failure to attend the hearings, the father would not have lost custody of the child. The father showed no commitment to retaining custody of the child and missed every single hearing held in the case, despite having notice of those hearings. Although the father did attend a few parenting classes, he was dismissed from those classes due to nonattendance. He did not complete the case-plan objectives of obtaining stable employment and establishing suitable housing. The child\u2019s guardian ad litem reported that he spoke with the father and discussed the possibility of the father\u2019s taking custody of the child and that despite the father showing an interest, the father \u201csubsequently did not participate.\u201d A social worker assigned to the case testified that the father participated in just one scheduled visitation, but that he had not asked for any further visitation, nor had he responded to repeated attempts to contact him.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">{\u00b6 35} The evidence plainly shows that the father abandoned any desire to obtain custody of the child. Moreover, he failed to attend any of the court hearings, including the hearing on the agency\u2019s motion for permanent custody, despite having notice. Under the circumstances, we see no reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s failure to attend the hearings, the father would have retained custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b835-8\">Boyle and Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-10\">.
