Verizon Wireless (\u201cVerizon\u201d), and plaintiffs-appellees and cross-appellants Craig Cowit, Daniel Statman, Barry Koblenz, and Joseph Gramada (\u201cplaintiffs\u201d) appeal from the trial court\u2019s ruling on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">{\u00b6 2} Plaintiffs, customers of Verizon, had requested certification of two distinct classes in their litigation against Verizon. Each class sought to bring separate claims regarding Verizon\u2019s allegedly deceptive and fraudulent acts. The trial court certified a \u201cno roaming service class\u201d and denied certification of a \u201croaming overcharge class.\u201d Specifically, Verizon appeals from the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>certification of the \u201cno roaming service class,\u201d and plaintiffs appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of class certification with respect to the \u201croaming overcharge class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">{\u00b6 3} We find no error in the trial court\u2019s rulings regarding class certification, and we, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">\n<em>Roaming Overcharge Class</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">{\u00b6 4} Plaintiffs requested certification of a \u201croaming overcharge class,\u201d which consisted of \u201call wireless customers of Verizon under all America\u2019s Choice Plans, from inception of the America\u2019s Choice Plans to the present, who were charged and paid roaming fees.\u201d Plaintiffs sought nationwide class certification for a breach-of-contract claim, and they further sought to certify two subclasses. One subclass consisted of all plaintiffs residing in Ohio and claiming conversion, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, unjust enrichment, and promissory estoppel. The second subclass included all plaintiffs residing in states that had adopted the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act and seeking relief under that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">{\u00b6 5} To support their motion for class certification, plaintiffs alleged that when they had subscribed to Verizon\u2019s services, they were promised that roaming charges would be assessed only for calls placed or received outside the customer\u2019s home area. The home area consisted of a specific geographic area that had been conveyed to the customers through maps created by Verizon. According to the plaintiffs, Verizon had promised not to charge roaming fees for calls placed or received while the customer was inside a home area.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">{\u00b6 6} The plaintiffs asserted that Verizon had improperly assessed roaming charges for calls placed or received while the customer was within a home area, because Verizon had been unable to determine the location of a customer at the time that a call was made. According to plaintiffs, Verizon\u2019s conduct constituted a breach of contract because, by promising to assess roaming fees only for calls made or received outside the home area, Verizon had implicitly promised that it was able to determine the location of a customer when a call was placed. But because Verizon was unable to make such a determination, all roaming charges assessed were wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court declined to grant class certification for this \u201croaming overcharge class.\u201d It determined that although the proposed class was identifiable, it was overly broad and included numex'ous persons who had suffered no injury. The court further concluded that individual issues predominated over common issues, because the court would have to make an initial determination as to which customers had been wrongfully charged roaming fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>\n<em>No Roaming Service Class</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Af1\">{\u00b6 8} Plaintiffs additionally sought certification of a \u201cno roaming service class.\u201d This class included \u201c[a]ll wireless customers of Verizon under the post-February 2005 version of the America\u2019s Choice Plans, to whom Verizon failed to provide roaming service.\u201d Plaintiffs sought nationwide certification for a breach-of-contract claim, as well as certification of two subclasses identical to those proposed for the \u201croaming overcharge class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">{\u00b6 9} In support of their request for class certification, plaintiffs alleged that Verizon had marketed its America\u2019s Choice Plans as providing the benefit of roaming service without customers incurring roaming charges. But according to plaintiffs, Verizon had provided no roaming service, and instead of receiving free roaming, plaintiffs had experienced dropped calls when they entered into areas with no coverage. Plaintiffs specifically asserted that they had been injured because all Verizon customers had paid an additional price to receive roaming services free of charge, but had never received that service.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court certified plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cno roaming service class.\u201d The court determined that because all customers had paid for a service that they did not receive, common issues predominated in this class. The court certified a nationwide class on plaintiffs\u2019 breach-of-contract claim and certified an Ohio subclass for all remaining claims, including plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">\n<em>Requirements for Class Certification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">{\u00b6 11} Before a trial court may grant class certification, certain standards must be met. First, the trial court must find the existence of an identifiable and unambiguous class.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court must also find that the named class representatives are members of that class.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">{\u00b6 12} The court must then find that the four prerequisites contained in Civ.R. 23(A) have been met. Civ.R. 23(A) provides that \u201c[o]ne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Finally, the court must determine that one of three requirements provided for in Civ.R. 23(B) has been met. In this case, plaintiffs sought class certification under Civ.R. 23(B)(3), which provides that \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">{\u00b6 14} When determining whether class certification is appropriate, a trial court must \u201ccarefully apply the class action requirements and conduct a rigorous analysis into whether the prerequisites of Civ.R. 23 have been satisfied.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">{\u00b6 15} A trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for class certification is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An abuse of discretion \u201cconnotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies an unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable attitude on the part of the court.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">{\u00b6 16} We first consider Verizon\u2019s appeal and then analyze the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">\n<em>Verizon\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">{\u00b6 17} Verizon argues in its sole assignment of error that the trial court erred in certifying the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cno roaming service class.\u201d Verizon first argues that certification was altogether inappropriate. But it further argues in the alternative that should this court uphold the class certification, the breach-of-contract claim should not have been granted nationwide certification because of differences in the law regarding breach of contract among the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">\n<em>A. Class Certif\u00edcation was Proper</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">{\u00b6 18} Verizon does not contest the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the prerequisites contained in Civ.R. 23(A). Rather, Verizon argues that class certification was inappropriate under Civ.R. 23(B) because individual issues predominate over common issues of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">{\u00b6 19} Specifically, Verizon argues that the proposed class contains numerous plaintiffs who suffered no injury at all. Under Verizon\u2019s theory, only those plaintiffs who had attempted to place a call in an area without service and had experienced a dropped call, as opposed to receiving free roaming service, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>injured. According to Verizon, the trial court would have to conduct an individualized inquiry for each plaintiff to determine whether an injury had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">{\u00b6 20} Verizon mischaracterizes the injury alleged by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs were not arguing that they had been injured by experiencing a dropped call. Rather, the injury asserted by plaintiffs was the monthly fee that they believed they had paid to receive free roaming service, a service that was never actually provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">{\u00b6 21} As we have stated, Civ.R. 23(B) provides that common questions of law or fact must predominate over questions affecting individual class members. \u201c[I]t is not sufficient that common questions merely exist; rather, the common questions must represent a significant aspect of the case and they must be able to be resolved for all members of the class in a single adjudication.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">{\u00b6 22} Verizon cites <em>Hoang v. E*Trade Group, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Linn v. Roto-Rooter, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in support of its position. In <em>Hoang, </em>plaintiff Hoang was an account holder with E*Trade, a company that provided various online services regarding securities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On several dates, Hoang had been unable to access her account due to interruptions on E*Trade\u2019s system. Hoang alleged that E*Trade had contracted to provide a continuous and reliable trading service and that it had failed to do so during the system interruptions. Hoang had sought certification of a class that included customers of E*Trade who had existing trading accounts with E*Trade on dates when the company\u2019s system had experienced interruptions and E*Trade accounts had been inaccessible.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">{\u00b6 23} The Eighth Appellate District reversed the trial court\u2019s class certification. It determined that individual injuries predominated over common injuries.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, the court stated that \u201c[although all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims arise out of the same Customer Agreement and a \u2018common course of conduct,\u2019 the trial court ignores the fact that liability as to each individual plaintiffs claims cannot be established in a single adjudication. Each of the plaintiffs claims requires proof of actual injury caused by the alleged wrongdoing.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>{\u00b6 24} <em>Linn v. Roto-Rooter </em>focused on Roto-Rooter\u2019s practice of including a \u201cmiscellaneous supplies charge\u201d on all of its customer invoices, regardless of whether a particular customer had received any of the so-called miscellaneous supplies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Linn, a Roto-Rooter customer, sought certification of a class of all persons who had been charged the miscellaneous-supplies charge by Roto-Rooter during a particular time period.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Eighth Appellate District again reversed the trial court\u2019s class certification because common questions of fact did not predominate.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court stated that \u201cRoto-Rooter\u2019s liability hinges on whether a customer actually received little or no miscellaneous supplies to establish that the charge was unjust or fraudulent.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">{\u00b625} Unlike the proposed classes in <em>Hoang </em>and <em>Linn, </em>in this case the plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not depend largely on individualized proof. In <em>Hoang, </em>not all customers had attempted to utilize their E*Trade accounts while the system was down. And in <em>Linn, </em>not all plaintiffs had been wrongfully charged for miscellaneous supplies because certain plaintiffs had actually received those supplies from Roto-Rooter. But in this case, each plaintiff had entered into a contract with Verizon with the belief that Verizon had contractually promised to provide free roaming service. And each plaintiff had paid a similar monthly fee as part of the overall contractual rate to receive that service.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">{\u00b6 26} Plaintiffs\u2019 asserted injury is Verizon\u2019s failure to provide a contractually obligated service, and all plaintiffs can prove their injury in a similar manner. Verizon\u2019s liability does not hinge on individual proof, as it did in <em>Hoang </em>and <em>Linn. </em>We note that Verizon\u2019s liability will be determined based on what the company was contractually obligated to provide, not, as Verizon posits, whether individual plaintiffs had experienced a dropped call when they believed that they were entitled to free roaming service.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">{\u00b6 27} As <em>Linn </em>noted, \u201cwhen evidence of a defendant\u2019s deceitful or fraudulent conduct is set forth in a standardized contract distributed to many and resulting in class-wide injury, then such a case is ideal for class certification.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This case contains such a scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>{\u00b6 28} The common question of fact that predominates in this appeal is whether Verizon had contractually promised to provide free roaming service to plaintiffs. This question may be resolved in a single adjudication for all.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">{\u00b6 29} We determine that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in certifying plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cno roaming service class\u201d under Civ.R. 23(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">\n<em>B. Nationwide Certification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">{\u00b6 30} Verizon further argues that the trial court should not have granted nationwide certification on plaintiffs\u2019 breach-of-contract claim because of irreconcilable differences in breach-of-contract law among the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">{\u00b6 31} Verizon specifically argues that the law on breach of contract differs among the states in the following respects: whether materiality is an element in a breach-of-contract claim and the specific definition of materiality; whether a plaintiffs performance is an element in a breach-of-contract claim; whether extrinsic evidence is admissible to determine whether a contract is ambiguous; and when the doctrine of contra proferentem is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">{\u00b6 32} Both parties presented extensive evidence to the trial court regarding the propriety of nationwide certification of a breach-of-contract claim. After reviewing this evidence, the trial court determined that differences in state law did not prevent nationwide certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">{\u00b6 33} The law is clear that \u201c[although the involvement of more than one state\u2019s law does not make a class action per se unmanageable, any variances among state laws must be examined to determine whether common questions will predominate over individual issues and whether litigation of a nationwide class may be managed fairly and efficiently.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">{\u00b6 34} The trial court in this case conducted the requisite analysis. To be certain, differences do exist in state law on the various contractual issues raised by Verizon, and the trial court will have to create subclasses to appropriately handle these legal variances. But the trial court determined that it could efficiently manage these differences in the law. The trial court would have been equally justified in reaching the opposite conclusion, and, in fact, many courts have concluded otherwise. But given \u201cthe trial court\u2019s special expertise and familiarity with case-management problems and its inherent power to manage its own docket,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in certifying a nationwide class on plaintiffs\u2019 breach-of-contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>{\u00b6 35} We conclude that the trial court did not err in granting certification to plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cno roaming service class\u201d or in certifying a nationwide class on the breach-of-contract claim, and Verizon\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">\n<em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">{\u00b6 36} In their cross-appeal, plaintiffs argue in one assignment of error that the trial court erred in refusing to certify a nationwide \u201croaming overcharge class\u201d on their breach-of-contract claim and an Ohio subclass for their remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">{\u00b6 37} As we have stated, in the \u201croaming overcharge class,\u201d plaintiffs sought to represent all Verizon customers who had been charged and had paid roaming fees. According to plaintiffs, all roaming fees assessed by Verizon were wrongful, whether they were for calls placed or received inside or outside the designated home area, because Verizon had breached its implicit contractual obligation to be able to determine the location of a customer at the time a call was placed or received.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">{\u00b6 38} With respect to this class, plaintiffs specifically asserted that they had been injured \u201c(i) [when] they were charged and paid roaming fees for calls which Verizon admittedly could not determine the location of the customers within a hundred miles, (ii) [when] Verizon failed to provide and maintain a billing system capable of charging customers in accordance with the terms of the Plan, and (iii) [when] they were charged and paid roaming fees for which Verizon had no contractual basis to impose under the terms of the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">{\u00b6 39} The trial court refused to certify the class after determining that individual issues predominated over common issues, and that the class was overly broad and contained members who had suffered no injury. On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in determining that the predominance requirement had not been satisfied. They further argue that the trial court disregarded their theory of this claim and had made an improper determination concerning the merits of their claim to the effect that customers who had not incurred roaming fees while inside a home area were not injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">{\u00b6 40} We first discuss the trial court\u2019s conclusion that common issues do not predominate in this class. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations with respect to the \u201croaming overcharge class\u201d are similar to the allegations of the plaintiff in <em>Hoang v. E*Trade Group, Inc., </em>which we have previously discussed in detail. As we have stated, Hoang had sought certification of a class of E*Trade account holders following interruptions to E*Trade\u2019s online trading system. Hoang had alleged that E*Trade had contractually promised to provide \u201ccontinuous and/or reliable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>trading services\u201d and had committed a breach of contract by allowing the system interruptions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">{\u00b6 41} Despite Hoang\u2019s assertion that the overall injury was the breach of a contractual promise, the Eighth Appellate District determined that class certification was not appropriate because \u201calthough all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims [arose] out of the same Customer Agreement and a \u2018common course of conduct,\u2019 * * * liability as to each individual plaintiffs claims [could not] be established in a single adjudication.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The court noted that while some plaintiffs may have been damaged by the inability to access their accounts, other plaintiffs might have benefited from the system interruptions. In response to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that they had been injured by the inability to access their accounts, the Eighth Appellate District stated that \u201cthe law does not provide recovery for inchoate claims,\u201d and that \u201csimple loss of services without economic loss does not create a compensable claim.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">{\u00b6 42} Just as in <em>Hoang, </em>here, not all plaintiffs in the instant case have suffered an economic loss. Plaintiffs who were improperly assessed roaming fees for calls placed or received while in a home area certainly suffered an economic loss. But those plaintiffs who were assessed roaming fees for calls placed or received while outside a home area were properly charged fees and suffered no economic loss. And because, through no fault of plaintiffs, the location of a plaintiff at the time that a roaming fee was assessed cannot be determined at the outset, the proposed class includes plaintiffs with an inchoate claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">{\u00b6 43} Just as liability in <em>Hoang </em>could not be determined absent an individual analysis of each customer\u2019s online trading history, Verizon\u2019s liability in this case cannot be determined absent individual testimony from each plaintiff concerning his or her location at the time that roaming fees were assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">{\u00b6 44} Moreover, not only did numerous members of plaintiffs\u2019 proposed class not suffer an economic injury, but the damages that were suffered vary across the board. Each plaintiffs damages would depend on the amount of roaming fees that were assessed for calls made or received in a home area, which, again, could not be established absent individual testimony. Whereas the proposed \u201cno roaming service class\u201d involved equal damages for each plaintiff based on the monthly service fee that had been paid to receive free roaming, the damages for the \u201croaming overcharge class\u201d could not be determined so simply.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>{\u00b6 45} Our reasoning is supported by the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Hamilton v. Ohio Sav. Bank </em>that \u201c[w]e have specifically held, in accordance with the overwhelming weight of authority, that \u2018a trial court should not dispose of a class certification solely on the basis of disparate damages.\u2019 This is not to say that certification may never be denied on the basis of individual damage issues. Some courts have denied certification where the calculation of damages is particularly complex or burdensome.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The instant case involves the type of burdensome analysis recognized by the Ohio Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">{\u00b6 46} Based on the foregoing considerations, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that individual issues predominate in plaintiffs\u2019 proposed class.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">{\u00b6 47} We now briefly address plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the trial court made an inappropriate determination regarding the merits of their claim because it failed to accept their allegation that all roaming fees assessed had been wrongful. While plaintiffs are correct in their assertion that a trial court may not consider the merits of the underlying claim when determining whether a class should be certified,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> we do not agree with plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the trial court in this case actually made a merit-based determination. Although a trial court may not consider the merits of a claim, \u201cit may, and must, examine the nature of the underlying claims for the purpose of determining whether common questions predominate.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">{\u00b6 48} In this case, the trial court did not make a determination on the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 case. The trial court was entitled to, and correctly did, consider the underlying claims and the injury suffered by plaintiffs to determine whether common issues predominated. And we believe that the trial court was able to make such a determination, even accepting as true plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that all charges were wrongful. Even if the charges were wrongful, not all plaintiffs had suffered an economic loss. This determination was entirely appropriate and did not result in an improper merit-based conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">{\u00b6 49} We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying class certification for the \u201croaming overcharge class\u201d because plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the requirements of Civ.R. 23(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">{\u00b6 50} The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">{\u00b6 51} In summary, because common questions of fact predominate in the \u201cno roaming service class,\u201d and because plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not rely on individual proof, but rather may be proved in a similar manner and in a single adjudication, the trial court properly granted certification for this proposed class. And given the trial court\u2019s inherent power to control its own docket, the court did not abuse its discretion in granting nationwide certification for the breach-of-contract claim brought by this class.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">{\u00b6 52} But because many members of the proposed \u201croaming overcharge class\u201d suffered an inchoate injury, and because damages for this proposed class would vary widely, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying certification for this class.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">{\u00b6 53} Both Verizon\u2019s appeal and plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal have no merit, and the judgment of the trial court is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b853-9\">Sundermann and Cunningham, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-10\">.
