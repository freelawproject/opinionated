After an evidentiary hearing on November 29, 2007, the trial court denied the appellee\u2019s motion, finding that the breath test and maintenance of the breath-testing machine were done in substantial compliance with the regulations of the Ohio Department of Health. On February 29, 2008, the appellee filed a motion to reconsider the motion to suppress and was granted a hearing on the issue concerning invalid samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">{\u00b6 4} Patrol officer Lewis is a ten-year veteran of the department and is certified as a senior operator for the BAC Datamaster. On the night in question, the appellee was taken to the Newark Police Department. After being read the BMV 2255 Form, he submitted to a breath test conducted on the BAC Datamaster. Patrol officer Lewis observed appellee for a 20-minute period prior to conducting the breath test at 3:58 a.m. During the administration of that test, patrol officer Lewis testified that he explained \u201cas best as possible in both scientific and layman\u2019s terms\u201d how to complete the test. He testified that, in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ten years of experience, it is not uncommon for someone taking the test for the first time not to understand how to correctly blow into the machine. He explained to the appellee that if the machine starts beeping, then he, the appellee, is not giving an adequate sample. In other words, he is not blowing into the machine correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">{\u00b6 5} During the first test, the Datamaster alerted patrol officer Lewis through an audible tone that appellee was not blowing sufficiently into the machine. As a result, the machine\u2019s printout read \u201cinvalid sample.\u201d Patrol officer Lewis testified, \u201cIn this case with an invalid sample it just means that the subject did not provide an adequate amount of basically what we are hunting for, deep lung air to complete the test.\u201d At the hearing on the appellee\u2019s motion to reconsider in April 2008, patrol officer Lewis again stated that the machine \u201cwent from a steady tone, to a beep, back to a steady tone,\u201d which indicated to him that the reason for the invalid sample was a \u201cdiscontinued blowing pattern.\u201d After the first invalid sample was received, patrol officer Lewis reset the machine, reentered the appellee\u2019s information, observed that the machine verified at .000, and performed a second test at 4:01 a.m. The printout of the second test displayed a blank test of .000, which indicated to the officer that the machine was in proper working order. The sample obtained from the appellee produced a result of .196.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">{\u00b6 6} At the second hearing held April 22, 2008, Dean Ward, the bureau chief for the Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Testing with the Ohio Department of Health, testified concerning a memorandum issued by the Department of Health on December 14, 1998. He testified that according to this memorandum, the Department of Health took the position that any invalid sample indication on a BAC Verifier or BAC Datamaster should be handled by initiating a new 20-minute observation period. Although this position was never adopted as a regulation by the department, Mr. Ward testified that the memorandum issued on December 14, 1998, still essentially embodies the Department of Health\u2019s position with respect to invalid sample indications.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">{\u00b6 7} However, in spite of this memorandum, Mr. Ward further testified that the sample obtained by patrol officer Lewis appeared to be a valid sample. He testified that \u201cbased on the test itself with the proper air blanks and the internal standard verified, this would be a valid test. * * * There is no indication here that the Datamaster saw anything wrong with the sample.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">{\u00b6 8} On April 30, 2008, the trial court issued a judgment entry granting appellee\u2019s supplemental motion to suppress. The court ruled that \u201cthe State has not demonstrated compliance with the Ohio Department of Health\u2019s regulations concerning the admissibility of the breath test. In particular, the ambiguous evidence regarding the reason for the invalid sample renders the State\u2019s compliance with the operational checklist to be suspect in light of the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Health\u2019s memorandum from December 1998. Because the reason for the invalid sample could not be determined, the Court finds that the officer was required to begin a new twenty-minute observation. Because this was not done, the State has not met its burden of establishing compliance with the Department of Health\u2019s regulations, which requires compliance with the machine\u2019s operational checklist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant now appeals, assigning as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cI. The trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the results of a breath test conducted on July 29, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it suppressed the results of appellee\u2019s second BAC DataMaster test on the ground that the test was rendered invalid because the officer failed to conduct a second 20-minute observation of appellee after receiving an \u201cinvalid sample\u201d on the first test attempt. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 4511.19(D) requires that the analysis of bodily substances be conducted in accordance with methods approved by the Ohio Director of Health (\u201cODH\u201d), as prescribed in Ohio Administrative Code regulations. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that absent a showing of prejudice by the defendant, rigid compliance with ODH regulations is not required as such compliance is not always humanly or realistically possible. <em>State v. Plummer </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 292, 294, 22 OBR 461, 490 N.E.2d 902; <em>State v. Morton </em>(May 10, 1999), 12th Dist. No. CA98-10-131, 1999 WL 296700. Rather, if the state shows substantial compliance with the regulations, absent prejudice to the defendant, alcohol-test results can be admitted in a prosecution under 4511.19. Id. In determining whether the state substantially complied with ODH regulations, the trial court is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 39, 610 N.E.2d 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court ruled in the case below that breath-test results could not be admitted at trial unless the state can show that the test was administered in compliance with the methods approved by the ODH. The court held in this case that the test was not administered in compliance with the directives of the ODH. The trial court relied upon a 1998 Memorandum issued by the Ohio Department of Health in ruling that the state has failed to demonstrate compliance. The memorandum instructed that a second 20-minute observation period should be used following every \u201cinvalid sample\u201d result. Specifically, the memo stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cEffective immediately an \u2018invalid sample\u2019 indication on the BAC Verifier or BAC Datamaster is to be handled by initiating a new 20 minute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>observation period. The reason for this change is due to the fact that \u2018invalid sample\u2019 may be caused by different things. The operator will no longer have to decide exactly what may have caused the \u2018invalid sample\u2019, the remedy will always be a new observation period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>State v. Bosier </em>(July 24, 2000), 12th Dist. No. CA99-11-036, 2000 WL 1050976, at *2, Craig Sutheimer, the chief of the Bureau of Alcohol and Drug testing, testified that there was \u201cno rule in place which requires officers to wait an additional twenty minutes before conducting a second test\u201d after the first test yielded invalid results. He stated, \u201c[T]he reason for the memo was to avoid the numerous requests for testimony in court about the possibility of an \u2018INVALID SAMPLE\u2019 being the result of mouth alcohol.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>State v. Steele </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 187, 6 O.O.3d 418, 370 N.E.2d 740, the Ohio Supreme Court explained the reason for the 20-minute observational period before testing. The court explained that the observational period is used to eliminate the possibility that the test result is a product of anything other than the suspect\u2019s deep-lung breath. Id. at 190, 6 O.O.3d 418, 370 N.E.2d 740. Further, since the \u201caccuracy of the test results can be adversely affected if the suspect either ingests material orally, like food or drink, or regurgitates material internally, by belching or vomiting, the suspect must be observed\u201d for 20 minutes to verify that no external or internal material causes a false reading. <em>State v. Douglas, </em>1st Dist. No. C-030897, 2004-Ohio-5726, 2004 WL 2421847, at \u00b6 9, citing <em>Steele, </em>52 Ohio St.2d at 190, 6 O.O.3d 418, 370 N.E.2d 740; <em>State v. Camden, </em>7th Dist. No. 04 MO 12, 2005-Ohio-2718, 2005 WL 1303207, at \u00b6 15. In <em>Steele, </em>the court reasoned that once the trooper demonstrated it was highly improbable that the subject ingested any item during the 20-minute period, it was up to the defendant to \u201covercome that inference\u201d with proof that she had ingested some substance. Moreover, ingestion has to be more than just \u201chypothetically possible.\u201d <em>Steele </em>at 192, 6 O.O.3d 418, 370 N.E.2d 740; accord <em>State v. Faykosh, </em>6th Dist. No. L-01-1244, 2002-Ohio-6241, 2002 WL 31528740; <em>State v. Embry, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2003-11-110, 2004-Ohio-6324, 2004 WL 2698417, at \u00b6 25; <em>State v. Rennick, </em>7th Dist. No. 02 BA 19, 2003-Ohio-2560, 2003 WL 21134848 at \u00b6 25; <em>State v. Siegel </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 562, 568-569, 741 N.E.2d 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">{\u00b6 17} Appellee introduced nothing to suggest that he did, in fact, ingest some material during the 20-minute period. A mere assertion that ingestion during the 20-minute period was hypothetically possible, without more, did not render the test results inadmissible. <em>State v. Raleigh, </em>Licking App. No. 2007-CA-31, 2007-Ohio-5515, 2007 WL 2994237, at \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cAlthough its language is unambiguous, the [1998 Memorandum issued by the Ohio Department of Health] does not represent an authoritative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>rule we are bound to enforce. Unlike the [Ohio Administrative Code], !a directive from a memorandum does not rise to the level of an administrative regulation, and is not enforceable.\u2019 <em>State v. Gigliotti </em>(Dec. 22, 2000), 6th Dist. No. E-99-081[, 2000 WL 1867265, *6]; see, also, <em>State v. Reiger, </em>5th Dist. No. 02CA30, 2002-Ohio-6673[, 2002 WL 31730986] at \u00b6 13; <em>State v. Hayes, </em>9th Dist. No. 04CA0105-M, 2005-Ohio-6607[, 2005 WL 3416189] at \u00b6 16; <em>State v. Massie, </em>2d Dist. No. 2007 CA 24, 2008-Ohio-1312[, 2008 WL 754804], at \u00b6 20. We do not deny that the trooper had the option of conducting a second test. However, appellant does not point to, nor are we aware of, any code section that would require the trooper to do so under circumstances such as this.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>Portage App. Nos. 2006-P-0101 and 2006-P-0102, 2008-Ohio-3251, 2008 WL 2586664, at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">{\u00b6 19} In the case at bar, patrol officer Lewis testified that after explaining the test to the appellee, he, patrol officer Lewis, detected a discontinued blowing pattern as the tone on the machine went from a steady tone to a beep and then back to a steady tone. He went on to further testify that had mouth alcohol been present, per his training, the machine would not \u201czero out,\u201d meaning produce a blank test of .000, after resetting the machine, and that would have prevented him from proceeding with the second test. Upon cross-examination, patrol officer Lewis testified that while there are other things that can cause an invalid sample, the fact that the machine was \u201cbeeping\u201d while the appellee was attempting to provide a sample, paired with the machine resetting without incident and providing a valid sample on the second test, confirmed his opinion that the breathing pattern was the reason for the \u201cinvalid sample.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">{\u00b6 20} Dean Ward, the Bureau Chief for the Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Testing with the Ohio Department of Health, testified that if evidence of mouth alcohol were present, the second test would have been invalidated as well. Ward testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cCorrect and if there was mouth alcohol involved in a test right after a second test it would catch it the second time as well. So what I am saying is if the first test is invalidated by mouth alcohol, if you will or the improper blowing pattern or excessive moisture in the sample cell, the instrument completes its cycle, cleanses itself through the air blanks, so the first invalid sample will be printed, the instrument with air blanks which cleanses the sample cell and it goes back to zero, then you have to run * * * press the run button for the second test then it goes through its diagnostics, its internal standards, its air blank and then it will ask for the test once again. And if mouth alcohol is involved in the second test then it would also invalidate the test for mouth alcohol. So in this particular case I don\u2019t see an indication where the air blanks are off. They are all zeros so it is if the instrument was operating properly as well.\u201d Ward further testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>that the 1998 memorandum \u201cwent out as a training recommendation and not as any kind of a regulation by us. It wouldn\u2019t stand I don\u2019t think to the muster of that without being signed anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">{\u00b6 22} In the case at bar, \u201cthough there may not have been strict compliance with the memorandum * * *, we find there was strict compliance with the regulations.\u201d <em>State v. Reiger, </em>5th Dist. No. 02CA30, 2002-Ohio-6673, 2002 WL 31730986, at \u00b6 13. By so finding, \u201cwe note our decision is in accord with our colleagues from the Twelfth District in <em>State v. Bosier </em>(Jul. 24, 2000), Clinton App. No. CA99-11-036, unreported[, 2000 WL 1050976]; the Fourth District in <em>State v. Matlack </em>(Nov. 2, 1995), Athens County App. No. 95CA1658, unreported (1995 WL 646355); the Sixth District in <em>State v. Gigliotti </em>(Dec. 22, 2000), Erie County App. No. E-99-081, unreported (2000 WL 1867265); and the Eighth District in <em>City of Rocky River v. Papandreas </em>(Mar. 23, 2000), 2000 WL 301080. As was the case in <em>Bosier, </em>the evidence in the case sub judice established the cause of the invalid sample was the appellee\u2019s failure to sufficiently blow into the machine. In both cases, the invalid sample was not believed to have been the result of mouth alcohol.\u201d <em>Reiger, </em>2002-Ohio-6673, 2002 WL 31730986, at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">{\u00b6'24} The judgment of the Licking County Municipal Court is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with our opinion and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b307-9\">Farmer, P.J., and Wise, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-14\">.
