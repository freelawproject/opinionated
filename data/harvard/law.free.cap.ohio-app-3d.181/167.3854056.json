Hazelbaker argues that in making its award to the Heatons, the trial court improperly construed an agreed entry concerning visitation as a previous shared parenting plan and then erroneously applied the best-interest-of-the-child standard, rather than the <em>Perales </em>unsuitability standard. See <em>In re Perales </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047. The Heatons contend that the court applied the correct legal standard because the agreed entry constituted a prior custody award, and thus the change-of-circumstances/best-interest standard was appropriate. Alternatively, they contend that the record nonetheless supports a finding that Hazelbaker\u2019s continued custody of B.M.P. would be detrimental to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Because Hazelbaker never lost custody of the child, either by agreement or under a court order, she retained her paramount right to custody, and the trial court had to find her \u201cunsuitable\u201d before awarding custody to a nonparent, i.e., the Heatons. Because the best-interest test is the wrong legal standard, we must reverse the judgment and remand this matter for a suitability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">I. The Procedural History and the Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">(\u00b6 3} B.M.P. was born in November 2000 and is the natural daughter of Hazelbaker and Michael Purvis. The couple lived together for some period of time, but were never married and eventually separated in April 2005. Purvis filed a complaint in April 2006 to establish child support and a parent-child relationship and attached a proposed shared-parenting plan. Shortly thereafter, however, he was incarcerated and failed to pursue his petition. Nonetheless, the trial court did not deny or dismiss this complaint. In May 2006, the Heatons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Purvis\u2019s mother and stepfather, filed a motion to intervene, which was later granted, and a motion for grandparental visitation rights, requesting \u201creasonable companionship and/or visitation rights.\u201d Hazelbaker, acting pro se, and the Heatons, who were represented by counsel, later reached an agreement on the \u201cmotion for grandparents rights.\u201d The agreed entry, dated July 27, 2006, stated: \u201cThe Defendant and grandparents have agreed to share in the parenting of the child. Defendant, Robin Hazelbaker shall retain custody of the minor child. Keith and Debbie Heaton shall have visitation with the minor child every weekend or as agreed upon by the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">{\u00b6 4} In November 2006, the Heatons filed a motion seeking to change custody to them, arguing that Hazelbaker was \u201cunfit\u201d to care for the child. Several other filings occurred, but for our purposes, the next significant event occurred when Purvis filed a motion to modify/change custody, arguing that there had been a change of circumstances and that it was in the best interest of the child to name him the custodial and residential parent. He also filed a motion for visitation, which the court granted under the provisions of its local rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">{\u00b6 5} The matter ultimately came on for a hearing on several pending motions, including the Heatons\u2019 November 2006 motion for custody. After two days of testimony, the court issued a judgment entry that designated the grandmother, Debra Heaton, as the custodian of the child. In its entry, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">This matter had originally come before the Court on motions going back to the end of 2006 and the beginning of 2007. The grandmother had moved for custody in November 2006 subsequent to an entry from July 2006 establishing the grandparents as persons who would \u201cshare in the parenting of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">The Ohio Revised Code specifies that for custody to be changed from a previous order two requirements must be fulfilled: first, the moving party must establish that there has been a change in circumstances of the custodian and secondly the moving party must establish that the change is in the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">In this case, there was considerable testimony that after the last shared parenting order in which shared parenting was awarded to mother and grandmother, there has been considerable acrimony between the parties and that on many occasions when events displeased the mother, she withheld the child from contact with the grandmother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">The Court finds that the mother\u2019s constant refusal to permit this child to have not only beneficial, but indeed Court-ordered, contact with the father and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the grandmother is an adequate change of circumstances along with the newly discovered information about her nude photographs for the Court to modify the pervious [sic] shared parenting plan and that it is in the best interest of the child be [sic] placed with the grandmother as the residential parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">The Court therefore finds that adequate circumstances have been shown to have been changed and that the best interest of the child [B.M.P.] is best served by designating the grandmother Debra Purvis Heaton as the custodian with the mother Robin Hazelbaker to have standard parenting time with the child pursuant to the local rule with the modification that the child will spend one half of the summer vacation from school with the mother and half with the grandmother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">{\u00b6 6} Hazelbaker now appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment, raising three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">{\u00b6 7} Hazelbaker presents the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\">I. In granting custody of the minor child to the paternal grandmother, the trial court erred when it faded to conduct a <em>Perales </em>unsuitability analysis and make an express finding of unsuitability on the record as required under Ohio law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-11\">II. Even if this Court finds that the trial court did not have to expressly find the parent unsuitable, the record would not support a finding that appellant is an unsuitable parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-12\">III. The trial court\u2019s application of change of circumstances and best interest test was an erroneous misapplication of R.C. 3109.04(E).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">III. The Applicable Law and Our Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">{\u00b6 8} In her first assignment of error, Hazelbaker contends that in granting legal custody of the child to the Heatons, the trial court erred when it failed to conduct a <em>Perales </em>suitability analysis and make an express finding of unsuitability on the record. See <em>Perales, </em>52 Ohio St.2d 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047. She contends that the trial court applied the wrong legal standard when it awarded custody based on the best-interest-of-the-child standard. The Heatons acknowledge that Hazelbaker did not lose custody of B.M.P. under their prior agreement. But nonetheless, they contend that because it was a prior custody order, the court could use the change-of-circumstances/best-interest test. We reject that contention and agree with Hazelbaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>{\u00b6 9} A trial court has broad discretion in determining custody matters. <em>Reynolds v. Goll </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 121, 124, 661 N.E.2d 1008. Consequently, we can sustain a challenge to a trial court\u2019s custody decision only upon a finding that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Davis v. Flickinger </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 415, 418, 674 N.E.2d 1159. When applying an abuse-of-discretion standard, we are not free to merely substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. <em>In re Jane Doe 1 </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 135, 137-138, 566 N.E.2d 1181. A deferential review in a child-custody case is appropriate because much may be evident in the parties\u2019 demeanor and attitude that does not translate to the record well. <em>Davis </em>at 419, 674 N.E.2d 1159. However, a trial court has no discretion to apply an improper legal standard in a custody dispute between a parent and a nonparent. We review such \u201cprocess flaws\u201d without deference to the trial court. See <em>State v. Nayar, </em>Lawrence App. No. 07CA6, 2007-Ohio-6092, 2007 WL 3407169, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">{\u00b6 10} In a child-custody proceeding between a parent and a nonparent, a court may not award custody to the nonparent without first determining that the parent is unsuitable to raise the child, i.e., without determining by a preponderance of the evidence that the parent abandoned the child, contractually relinquished custody of the child, or has become totally incapable of supporting or caring for the child, or that an award of custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child. <em>In re Perales, </em>52 Ohio St.2d 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047, at syllabus. The general rule in Ohio regarding original custody awards in disputes between a parent and a nonparent is that \u201cparents who are \u2018suitable\u2019 persons have a \u2018paramount\u2019 right to the custody of their minor children unless they forfeit that right by contract, abandonment, or by becoming totally unable to care for and support those children.\u201d <em>Masitto v. Masitto </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 63, 65, 22 OBR 81, 488 N.E.2d 857, quoting <em>Perales </em>at 97, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047. In <em>Bragg v. Hatfield, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 174, 2003-Ohio-1441, 787 N.E.2d 44, \u00b6 21, we noted that once custody has been awarded to a nonparent, the court will not apply the <em>Perales </em>unfitness standard to a later request for custody modification. Instead, custody modification in that situation is determined under the R.C. 3109.04 change-of-circumstances/best-interest standard. Id.; see also <em>In re Hockstok, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 238, 2002-Ohio-7208, 781 N.E.2d 971, \u00b6 21, citing <em>Masitto </em>at 65, 22 OBR 81, 488 N.E.2d 857. In other words, if a parent has custody of her minor child, a custody dispute with a nonparent is determined under the <em>Perales </em>standard; but if a custody award has previously been made to a nonparent, the party seeking to modify that award must show a change-in-circumstances/best-interest issue even if the noncustodial party is a parent and the custodial party is a nonparent. <em>Bragg </em>at \u00b6 21. Thus, once a nonparent has acquired custody, the court need not apply the <em>Perales </em>unfitness standard to a later request for custody modification. <em>In re Kovaleski, </em>Washington App. No. 05CA12, 2006-Ohio-317, 2006 WL 199549, \u00b621, citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Bragg. </em>Instead, custody modification in that situation is determined under R.C. 3109.04. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">{\u00b6 11} The trial court found that the July 27, 2006 agreed entry established the Heatons \u201cas persons who would \u2018share in the parenting of the child.\u2019 \u201d Construing the agreed entry as a shared-parenting agreement between Hazelbaker and Ms. Heaton, the court went on to find that a modification of the previous \u201cshared parenting plan\u201d was warranted due to a change of circumstances and that it was in the best interest of the child to be placed with Ms. Heaton as the residential parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 12} Clearly, the agreed entry stated that Hazelbaker and the Heatons \u201chave agreed to share in the parenting of the child.\u201d However, Hazelbaker, the natural mother, and the Heatons, as nonparents, could not enter into a shared-parenting agreement under R.C. 3109.04 as a matter of law. See, e.g., <em>In re Bonfield, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 218, 2002-Ohio-4182, 773 N.E.2d 507. R.C. 3109.04(A)(2) provides that a court may, upon determining that a proposed shared-parenting plan is in the best interest of the children, allocate parental rights and responsibilities for the care of children to both \u201cparents.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16. In <em>In re Bonfield, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio noted that R.C. 3109.04 specifically uses the term \u201cparent,\u201d and this term is defined in R.C. 3111.01 to mean a \u201cnarrow class of person who are statutorily defined as parents for purposes of entering a shared parenting agreement.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 34.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court held that while the juvenile court could make a shared-custody order between a parent and a nonparent, it did not constitute shared parenting. Thus, to the extent that the trial court found that the July 27, 2006 agreed entry constituted a previous shared-parenting plan between Hazelbaker and the Heatons, the court erred. <em>Konicek v. Konicek </em>(2001), 144 Ohio App.3d 105, 759 N.E.2d 801. See also <em>Lorence v. Goeller </em>(July 19, 2000), Lorain App. No. 98CA007193, 2000 WL 988760 (a shared-parenting decree that incoi-porates a plan between a parent and a nonparent is void ab initio).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 13} While the agreed entry cannot be a shared-parenting plan, it might represent a contractual relinquishment of Hazelbaker\u2019s pax-amount right to custody. Thus, we look to determine its impact. When examining a written instrument, the cardinal purpose is to ascex-tain and give effect to the intent of the parties. <em>Foster Wheeler Enviresponse, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Convention Facilities Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 353, 361, 678 N.E.2d 519. \u201cThe intent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the parties to a contract is presumed to reside in the language they chose to employ in the agreement.\u201d Id., citing <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 130, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">{\u00b6 14} After the Heatons filed a motion for grandparental visitation under R.C. 3109.051, which governs the modification of visitation rights, the parties reached an agreement concerning the \u201cmotion for grandparents rights.\u201d While the agreed entry indicated that the parties agreed to share in the \u201cparenting\u201d of the child, the express terms of the entry also stated that Hazelbaker \u201cshall retain custody of the child\u201d and the Heatons were awarded \u201cvisitation.\u201d Moreover, in the trial court, the Heatons did not argue that Hazelbaker had contractually relinquished her rights under the terms of the agreed entry. Rather, they contested the matter solely on the issue of suitability. And the Heatons specifically concede in their brief that \u201cthe evidence does not support nor was there a suggestion that Appellant contractually relinquished custody of the child.\u201d We agree with that conclusion. Thus, the unsuitability standard applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">{\u00b6 15} Finally, the Heatons contend that the record nonetheless supports an unsuitability finding because Hazelbaker\u2019s continued custody of the child would be detrimental to the child. However, the Supreme Court of Ohio has stressed the overriding importance of a trial court making a parental-unsuitability determination on the record before awarding custody away from a natural parent to a nonparent. See <em>Hockstok, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 238, 2002-Ohio-7208, 781 N.E.2d 971, \u00b6 22. Therefore, we sustain Hazelbaker\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">{\u00b6 16} Based on our resolution of her first assignment of error, we find that her second and third assignments of error are moot. Thus, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b207-9\">Abele and McFarland, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\">. Specifically, the court noted that \"[a] plain reading of R.C. 3111.01 indicates that there are three ways a 'parent and child relationship' can be established: by natural parenthood, by adoption, or by other legal means in the Revised Code that confer or impose rights, privileges, and duties upon certain individuals.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
