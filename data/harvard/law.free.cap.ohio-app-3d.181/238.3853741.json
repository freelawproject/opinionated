Boyle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b271-17\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Dickson &amp; Campbell, L.L.C. appeals a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas affirming an administrative decision by the Cleveland Municipal Court\u2019s Parking Violations Bureau, Photo Safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Division, finding Dickson &amp; Campbell liable for two speeding violations. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">{\u00b6 2} In early 2007, Dickson <em>&amp; </em>Campbell received two notices of liability for speeding violations pursuant to Cleveland Codified Ordinances (\u201cCCO\u201d) 413.031. The notices provided that on January 19, 2007, and January 22, 2007, a vehicle owned by Dickson &amp; Campbell committed speeding violations that were photographed by an automatic-enforcement camera.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">{\u00b6 3} Dickson &amp; Campbell appealed the notices to the parking violations bureau. In separate administrative hearings, examiners found Dickson &amp; Campbell hable for each speeding violation and imposed a $100 fine. Dickson <em>&amp; </em>Campbell appealed both decisions to the common pleas court (in a consolidated appeal) under R.C. Chapter 2506.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">{\u00b6 4} The common pleas court upheld the decisions of both hearing officers, finding Dickson &amp; Campbell liable for the two speeding violations under CCO 413.031. It is from this judgment that Dickson &amp; Campbell appeals, raising a sole assignment of error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred when it held that Dickson &amp; Campbell is liable for [the two speeding violations] pursuant to [CCO] 413.031.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">{\u00b6 6} In <em>Henley v. Youngstown Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 142, 147, 735 N.E.2d 433, the Ohio Supreme Court distinguished the standard of review to be applied by common pleas courts and appellate courts in R.C. Chapter 2506 administrative appeals. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe common pleas court considers the \u2018whole record,\u2019 including any new or additional evidence admitted under R.C. 2506.03, and determines whether the administrative order is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe standard of review to be applied by the court of appeals in an R.C. 2506.04 appeal is \u2018more limited in scope.\u2019 <em>Kisil v. Sandusky </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 30, 34, 465 N.E.2d 848. \u2018This statute grants a more limited power to the court of appeals to review the judgment of the common pleas court only on \u201cquestions of law,\u201d which does not include the same extensive power to weigh \u201cthe preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence,\u201d as is granted to the common pleas court.\u2019 Id. at fn. 4. \u2018It is incumbent on the trial court to examine the evidence. Such is not the charge of the appellate court. * * * The fact that the court of appeals, or this court might have arrived at a different conclusion than the administrative agency is immaterial. Appellate courts must not substitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>their judgment for those of an administrative agency or a trial court absent the approved criteria for doing so.\u2019 <em>Lorain City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 261, 533 N.E.2d 264.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">What Occurred Below</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">{\u00b6 9} The city claims that Dickson <em>&amp; </em>Campbell is trying to \u201cre-litigate for the third time the factual issue of whether [its] law firm was the \u2018owner\u2019 of the speeding vehicle under CCO 413.031(p)(3).\u201d It maintains that the parking violations bureau made a factual determination that Dickson &amp; Campbell was the registered owner of the speeding vehicle and that the common pleas court \u201cdid not alter this finding of fact,\u201d and therefore this court must affirm. The city, however, misstates what occurred at both the administrative hearings and at the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">A. First Notice of Liability Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">{\u00b6 10} At the hearing on the first notice of liability, Blake Dickson appeared and argued that Dickson &amp; Campbell was the lessee of the vehicle and not the owner. The hearing examiner concluded, \u201cO.K. Well, * * * we are going to go after the [lessee] then, sir,\u201d and found that Dickson &amp; Campbell was liable for the infraction and imposed a $100 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">{\u00b6 11} Thus, in the first hearing, the examiner made the factual determination that Dickson &amp; Campbell was the lessee, but held that it was liable regardless.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">B. Second Notice of Liability Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">{\u00b6 12} At the hearing on the second notice of liability, Blake Dickson appeared again and made the same arguments. The hearing examiner reviewed a printout (copy is not clear as to what it was) from the BMV that listed the license plate and the vehicle\u2019s VIN number. The top of the printout listed VW Credit Leasing, Ltd. It then listed Dickson <em>&amp; </em>Campbell under \u201cadditional owner name\u201d and gave Dickson &amp; Campbell\u2019s address.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">{\u00b6 13} Blake Dickson argued that there cannot be \u201ctwo owners legally.\u201d The hearing examiner, however, disagreed and concluded that the BMV identified Dickson <em>&amp; </em>Campbell as an additional owner, and under CCO 413.031, that was sufficient. The examiner found Dickson &amp; Campbell liable for the speeding infraction and imposed a $100 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">{\u00b6 14} Thus, the second hearing officer found that Dickson <em>&amp; </em>Campbell was an owner of the vehicle as defined under CCO 413.031.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>C. The Common Pleas Court</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">{\u00b6 15} In its judgment entry, the common pleas court held, \u201cUpon consideration of the entire record and such additional evidence as the court has admitted, the court affirms the order of the Cleveland Municipal Court\u2019s Parking Violations Bureau.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">{\u00b6 16} Disagreeing with Dickson &amp; Campbell\u2019s argument that because it is the lessee, it cannot be held liable under CCO 413.031 as the \u201cowner\u201d of the vehicle, the common pleas court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThis court disagrees. R.C. Section 4511.092(B) states that \u2018a motor vehicle leasing dealer * * * is not liable for a ticket issued for a vehicle that was in the care, custody, or control of a lessee [and] a dealer who receives a ticket for such violation shall notify whoever issued the ticket of the vehicle\u2019s lessee\u2019s or renter\u2019s name and address.\u2019 Appellant is attempting to avoid the inevitable with an argument based on semantics. If this court were to follow appellant\u2019s reasoning, then every driver of a leased car would be free from liability of speed traffic offenses simply because they do not \u2018own\u2019 the vehicle. Therefore the court finds the [Parking] Violation\u2019s Bureau\u2019s decision to be supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law as appellant had the care, custody, and control of the vehicle in question at the time of each violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">{\u00b6 18} The common pleas court did not simply affirm the factual findings of the hearing examiners \u2014 as the city claims. Instead, as the common pleas court stated in its order, it affirmed the parking violations bureau decisions \u201c[u]pon consideration of the entire record and such additional evidence as the court has admitted.\u201d Thus, the common pleas court admitted additional evidence submitted by Dickson &amp; Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">{\u00b6 19} The additional evidence consisted of several exhibits that Dickson &amp; Campbell had attached to its appellate brief to the common pleas court, including an affidavit signed by Blake Dickson and a copy of an \u201cOhio Department of Public Safety Online Vehicle/Watercraft Title Inquiry.\u201d The title inquiry listed VW Credit Leasing, Ltd. as the owner of the vehicle and indicated that the \u201cnumber of owners\u201d was \u201cone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">{\u00b6 20} The common pleas court, in considering the record <em>and </em>the additional evidence admitted, made a factual determination that Dickson <em>&amp; </em>Campbell was the lessee, not the registered owner. It then held Dickson &amp; Campbell liable for both notices of liability as the lessee of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">{\u00b6 21} The city does not argue to this court that the common pleas court erred in admitting Dickson &amp; Campbell\u2019s additional evidence (although it argued to the common pleas court that it should not consider it in its answer brief). Nonethe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>less, we briefly review whether the common pleas court erred in admitting the additional evidence under R.C. 2506.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">R.C. 2506.03/Hearing of Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">{\u00b6 22} This court recently stated that when the court of common pleas acts as the court of appeals in an administrative appeal, it is limited to a review of the transcript with the exception of certain enumerated deficiencies. <em>Ziss Bros. Constr. Co., Inc. v. Independence Planning Comm., </em>8th Dist. No. 90993, 2008-Ohio-6850, 2008 WL 5383853,\u00b6 18. R.C. 2506.03 sets forth those enumerated deficiencies entitling an appellant the opportunity to submit additional evidence to the court of common pleas. It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">{\u00b623} \u201c(A) The hearing of an appeal taken in relation to a final order, adjudication, or decision covered by division (A) of section 2506.01 of the Revised Code shall proceed as in the trial of a civil action, but the court shall be confined to the transcript filed under section 2506.02 of the Revised Code unless it appears, on the face of that transcript or by affidavit filed by the appellant, that one of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(1) The transcript does not contain a report of all evidence admitted or proffered by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(2) The appellant was not permitted to appear and be heard in person, or by the appellant\u2019s attorney, in opposition to the final order, adjudication, or decision, and to do any of the following [lists five conditions];</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(3) The testimony adduced was not given under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(4) The appellant was unable to present evidence by reason of a lack of the power of subpoena by the officer or body appealed from, or the refusal, after request, of that officer or body to afford the appellant opportunity to use the power of subpoena when possessed by the officer or body.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(5) The officer or body failed to file with the transcript conclusions of fact supporting the final order, adjudication, or decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(B) If any circumstance described in divisions (A)(1) to (5) of this section applies, the court shall hear the appeal upon the transcript and additional evidence as may be introduced by any party. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c[T]he mandatory language of R.C. 2506.03 \u2018provides for the liberal supplementation of the record when the transcript provided under R.C. 2506.02 is inadequate or incomplete.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ziss Bros., </em>2008-Ohio-6850, 2008 WL 5383853, at \u00b6 20, quoting <em>Aria\u2019s Way, L.L.C. v. Concord Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>173 Ohio App.3d 73, 2007-Ohio-4776, 877 N.E.2d 398, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>{\u00b6 32} The trial court admitted the additional evidence proving that Dickson &amp; Campbell was the lessee of the vehicle and that VW Credit Leasing, Ltd. was the owner. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s doing so because neither the hearing officer nor the parking violations bureau filed \u201cwith the transcript, conclusions of fact supporting the final order.\u201d Thus, under R.C. 2506.03(A)(5), the trial court was permitted to consider the additional evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 33} This court then must accept the common pleas court\u2019s factual determination that Dickson &amp; Campbell was the lessee of the vehicle and may review the judgment of the common pleas court only on questions of law. <em>Henley, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 147, 735 N.E.2d 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">CCO 413.031/Use of Automated Cameras to Impose Civil Penalties upon Red Light and Speeding Violators</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">{\u00b6 34} Cleveland enacted CCO 413.031 to establish \u201ca civil enforcement system for red light and speeding offenders photographed by means of an \u2018automated traffic enforcement camera system.\u2019 \u201d CCO 413.031(a). This \u201csection imposes monetary liability on the owner of the vehicle for failure of the operator\u201d to stop at a red light or comply with speed limitations. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">{\u00b6 35} Under CCO 413.031(c), \u201c[t]he owner of a vehicle shall be liable for the penalty imposed under this section if the vehicle is operated at a speed in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 433.03.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">{\u00b6 36} CCO 413.031(p)(3) defines \u201cvehicle owner\u201d as \u201cthe person or entity identified by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles * * * as the registered owner of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Lessee\u2019s Liability under CCO 413.031</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">{\u00b6 37} The crux of Dickson &amp; Campbell\u2019s argument is that as the lessee of the vehicle, it cannot be held liable as the vehicle owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">{\u00b6 38} In construing a statute, a court\u2019s paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute. <em>State v. S.R. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 590, 594, 589 N.E.2d 1319. To determine the legislative intent, a court must look to the language of the statute. <em>Provident Bank v. Wood </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 101, 104, 65 O.O.2d 296, 304 N.E.2d 378. Words used in a statute are to be given their usual, normal, and customary meaning. <em>State ex rel. Pennington v. Gundler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 171, 173, 661 N.E.2d 1049. Further, unless a statute is ambiguous, the court must give effect to the plain meaning of a statute. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">{\u00b6 39} We find nothing ambiguous about the plain meaning of the words \u201cvehicle owner.\u201d It is not difficult to decipher the difference between the \u201cowner\u201d of a vehicle and the \u201clessee\u201d of a vehicle. If Cleveland had intended to hold lessees liable under CCO 413.031, it would have included them in the ordinance as other municipalities have.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">{\u00b6 40} Moreover, the city of Cleveland contemplated and distinguished between a lessee and an owner when it enacted its parking violations ordinances, which are included in the same section of the Cleveland Municipal Code (Part Four). The parking-infraction ordinances (set forth in Chapter 459) are similar to the automated-speeding and red-light infraction ordinances because they both impose civil liabilities based on the registered owner of the vehicle without knowing who committed the actual violation. Both presume that the registered owner committed the violation unless the registered owner submits evidence showing otherwise. See CCO 413.03190) and 459.07(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">{\u00b6 41} CCO 459.04, Parking Ticket, Service, and Liability, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(d) An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but who operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner is the agent of the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in accordance with this Section * * *. The operator of a rented or leased vehicle whose act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall not be considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business of renting or leasing vehicles * * * and if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section 459.09 hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(e) Except as provided in Section 459.09 hereof, when a parking ticket is issued for a parking infraction and is served pursuant to this Section, the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued and the owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different, are jointly liable for the parking infraction and any fine, penalty, fees, and costs arising out of the parking infraction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">{\u00b6 44} CCO 459.09, Nonliability of Owner, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c(a) An owner of a vehicle is not jointly liable with an operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in a parking infraction for the parking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>infraction or any fine, penalty, fee, processing fee, or cost arising out of the parking infraction under this chapter if either of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c(2) The owner answers the charge of the parking infraction under Sections 459.05 or 459.06 hereof, the answer denies that he committed the parking infraction, the owner additionally submits evidence at that time that proves that, at the time of the alleged commission of the infraction, the owner was engaged in the business of renting or leasing vehicles under written rental or lease agreements, and the owner additionally submits evidence that proves that, at the time of the alleged commission of the parking infraction, the vehicle in question was in the care, custody, or control of a person other than the owner pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cProof that the vehicle was in the care, custody, or control of a person other than the owner pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement at the time of the alleged parking infraction shall be established by sending a true copy of the rental or lease agreement or an affidavit to that effect to the Parking Violations Bureau * * *. The submission of a true copy of a written rental or lease agreement or affidavit shall be prima-facie evidence that a vehicle was in the care, custody, or control of a person other than the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">{\u00b6 50} Reading the parking infraction ordinance in pari materia with the automated camera ordinance, we can only conclude that Cleveland did not intend to hold lessees liable under CCO 413.031. If it had intended to do so, it would have included them in the ordinance \u2014 just as it did for parking infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">{\u00b6 51} Therefore, accepting the common pleas court\u2019s factual determination that Dickson <em>&amp; </em>Campbell was the lessee of the vehicle, we cannot agree with its legal conclusion that Dickson &amp; Campbell is liable under CCO 413.031.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">{\u00b6 52} First, the common pleas court erred by relying on R.C. 4511.092(B) because this statute was not in effect at the time the notices of liability were issued for the speeding infractions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even if it had been, it would not affect our decision because it provides only that a \u201cmotor vehicle leasing dealer\u201d is not liable for a ticket from a \u201ctraffic law photo-monitoring device,\u201d but it does not impose liability on lessees.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">{\u00b6 53} Second, the common pleas court\u2019s reasoning that drivers can escape liability by leasing vehicles is inaccurate. Every driver of a leased vehicle can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>still be liable for speeding and running a red light through traditional means, namely, being cited by a police officer for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">{\u00b6 54} Finally, though \u201cappellant had the care, custody, and control of the vehicle in question at the time of each violation,\u201d appellant does not meet the criteria under CCO 413.031 to hold a \u201cvehicle owner\u201d liable. Dickson &amp; Campbell cannot be liable for the speeding infractions because it was the lessee of the vehicle and not the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">{\u00b6 55} Accordingly, we sustain Dickson <em>&amp; </em>Campbell\u2019s sole assignment of error. The judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-7\">Stewart, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b279-8\">Cooney, A.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-13\">. In addition, at least with regard to the second hearing, Blake Dickson's testimony was not given under oath (albeit by his own actions because he refused to be sworn in). Thus, R.C. 2506.03(A)(3) would provide additional support for the trial court's admitting the additional evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-12\">. For example, the city of Akron adopted a similar ordinance imposing civil liability through the use of an \"Automated Mobile Speed Enforcement System.\u201d See Akron City Code 79.01(B)(3), which defines \"vehicle owner\u201d as \"the person or entity identified by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles * * * as the registered owner of a vehicle <em>or a lessee of a motor vehicle under a lease of six months or more.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b278-12\">.

Our standard of review is limited to determining whether the common pleas court abused its discretion in finding that the administrative order is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.
