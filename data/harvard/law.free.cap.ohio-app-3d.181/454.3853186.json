Hurst, appeals from his convictions and sentences in the Licking County Court of Common Pleas on one count of pandering obscenity involving a minor, a felony of the fourth degree in violation of R.C. 2907.321(A)(5); one count of pandering sexually oriented matter involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>a minor, a felony of the fourth degree in violation of R.C. 2907.322(A)(5); and one count of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance, a felony of the fifth degree in violation of R.C. 2907.323(A)(3). Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant worked for Robertson Construction Company in Licking County during the month of April 2007. Appellant was a field employee and had been injured on the job. Accordingly, appellant was placed on light duty and assigned to work in the office during that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">{\u00b6 3} On April 25, 2007, Theresa Ruby, appellant\u2019s direct supervisor, claimed to have witnessed appellant viewing pornography on a newly added computer station. She testified that she had found appellant \u201cin the other office.\u201d When Ruby walked behind appellant, she testified that she believed she saw him looking at \u201cpictures of naked women.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">{\u00b6 4} Christian Robertson, of Robertson Construction contacted their outside computer information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) person, Richard Day, and the police. Day testified that the computer appellant had been using had been installed at Robertson Construction approximately one week prior to this incident. Day looked at the computer\u2019s hard disk drive, the \u201cC\u201d drive, in an attempt to discover whether anyone was downloading anything that he or she should not have been. His investigation did not find any physical evidence of inappropriately downloaded material or unauthorized folders created by someone using that computer workstation. However, when Day looked in the \u201ctemporary internet files\u201d folder contained on the computer\u2019s hard disk drive, he found over 20,000 pictures. Upon opening and viewing several of the pictures, Day realized they were pornographic photographs. Day \u201clocked down\u201d the computer and suggested to Christian Robertson that he contact the police. Later that afternoon, Officer Brandy Huffman arrived at the scene to collect the computer. At her request, Day made two copies of the photographs found on the computer\u2019s hard drive to a CD-ROM to be used as evidence by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">{\u00b6 5} Diamond Boggs, a forensic computer expert with the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, testified that she had specific training related to detecting \u201cvirtual\u201d children. She used this training while looking at the computer pictures at issue in the instant case. Boggs testified that the computer\u2019s hard drive contained approximately 14,000 photographs, which had been accessed April 20 through April 25, 2007. Boggs further testified that she found pictures that she believed to be child pornography or adult pornography, and some that could be either. She testified that in her expert opinion, virtual photographs of children are distinguishable from real children. She further testified that she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>not find any indication that the photographs at issue were virtual, as opposed to real, children. In fact, despite her training in the area of detecting photographs of virtual children, she testified that there was \u201cnothing that tells me that they are not real children.\u201d Boggs explained that the person who had used the computer manually typed terms into the search engine in order to search for websites associated with child pornography. In fact, in one such search the individual made a typographical error by initially typing tinyteenthungsinfo, only to have to correct it. Boggs characterized the individual\u2019s access to these types of web pages as \u201c[n]ot an accidental viewing of child pornography.\u201d Fifty pictures from the over 14,000 pictures found on the computers hard drive were selected by Boggs as possible child pornography. All of the 50 images were found in the computer\u2019s temporary internet cache folder. Those pictures were admitted into evidence at appellant\u2019s jury trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant was interviewed by the police and confessed that he had used the computer to view pornography. He admitted that 70 percent of the time that he had spent on the computer while at work he was viewing pornographic web sites. He also testified the he had \u201cvery \u2014 almost embarrassing computer skills. * * * I would have to have some basic computer skills.\u201d Appellant claimed that his co-workers told him, \u201cJust get on it and play with it. It will come to you.\u201d Appellant testified that he \u201cwasn\u2019t aware of what a site was at the time. I would just click on an image and another page could come up.\u201d Appellant did not know any of the web page addresses. However, appellant testified that his wife caught him viewing pornographic websites on his home computer approximately eight years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant testified that he did not know any of the web-page addresses. Appellant also testified that the pages he visited would have \u201c[pictures in an array arranged] 10 by 10 which would be 100 per page per screen\u201d and that he did not look at all of the pictures on every screen. Appellant testified that three times \u201c[web] pages would start to come up so fast and overlap that I couldn\u2019t stop them, so I would go up to the corner where the little x is and I would keep clicking on it, and it didn\u2019t stop it at all, so I crawled under the desk to unplug it [the computer].\u201d Appellant further testified \u201chundreds and hundreds if not thousands and thousands\u201d of websites or pages came up and he did not see the content of any of these pages. At trial, appellant specifically denied seeing any nude children or children engaged in sexual acts on the computer. Finally, appellant testified, \u201csomehow child pornography ended up on. that computer. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>don\u2019t know how it got there and obviously other people don\u2019t know how it got there either.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">{\u00b6 8} In his interview with the police, appellant described his affinity to pornography and attempted to downplay it:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cIt <em>* </em>* * it\u2019s never been to a point of touching a kid or any kid that I see, you, you know. There\u2019s no attraction or any, you know, uh-young lady. Um * * * always been, you know * * * viewing pictures. * * * I am more a viewing thing, than an actual physical thing, you know.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 10} On or around July 24, 2008, appellant and his counsel signed a pleading titled \u201cDefendant\u2019s Agreement to Amendment of Indictment,\u201d which was filed July 25, 2008. The agreement purported that appellant understood that his indictment was defective and that a \u201creckless\u201d mental state was not present in the indictment. Appellant also agreed to waive his appellate rights with respect to the indictment defect and consented to an amendment of the indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant was convicted by the jury on all three counts in the indictment. The trial court sentenced appellant to 15 months on the charge of pandering obscenity involving a minor, 15 months on the charge of pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor, and nine months on the charge of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance, with all three sentences running consecutively, for an aggregate sentence of 39 months. Appellant was also classified as a Tier 1 sexual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant timely appeals, raising the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cI. Appellant\u2019s conviction for illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material was void as a matter of law for failing to state a culpable mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cII. Appellant\u2019s conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence and/or was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">{\u00b6 15} Appellant argues in his first assignment of error that the indictment in this case failed to charge all the essential elements of the offense of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance because the indictment failed to charge the mens rea required for the crime. Accordingly, appellant maintains that he did not receive a constitutional indictment or trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>and therefore the defective indictment in this case resulted in structural error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">{\u00b6 16} <em>State v. Colon, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, concerned an indictment for robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cNo person, in attempting or committing a theft offense * * * shall do any of the following: * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(2) Inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 19} The <em>Colon </em>court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cR.C. 2911.02(A)(2) does not specify a particular degree of culpability for the act of \u2018inflict[ing], attempting] to inflict, or threatening] to inflict physical harm,\u2019 nor does the statute plainly indicate that strict liability is the mental standard. As a result, [pursuant to R.C. 2901.21(B),] the state was required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant recklessly inflicted, attempted to inflict, or threatened to inflict physical harm.\u201d <em>Colon, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">{\u00b6 21} Relative to this assignment of error, appellant in this case was indicted in Count III of the indictment on illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance, a felony of the fifth degree, in violation of R.C. 2907.323(A)(3), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(A) No person shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(3) Possess or view any material or performance that shows a minor who is not the person\u2019s child or ward in a state of nudity, unless one of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(a) The material or performance is sold, disseminated, displayed, possessed, controlled, brought or caused to be brought into this state, or presented for a bona fide artistic, medical, scientific, educational, religious, governmental, judicial, or other proper purpose, by or to a physician, psychologist, sociologist, scientist, teacher, person pursuing bona fide studies or research, librarian, clergyman, prosecutor, judge, or other person having a proper interest in the material or performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(b) The person knows that the parents, guardian, or custodian has consented in writing to the photographing or use of the minor in a state of nudity and to the manner in which the material or performance is used or transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"Aet\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>(\u00b6 28} In <em>State v. Young </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 249, 257, 525 N.E.2d 1363, reversed on other grounds by <em>Osborne v. Ohio </em>(1990), 495 U.S. 103, 110 S.Ct. 1691,109 L.Ed.2d 98, the Supreme Court of Ohio concluded that \u201crecklessness\u201d is the culpable mental state required to constitute a violation of R.C. 2907.323(A)(3). Citing <em>State v. Colon, </em>appellant argues that because the indictment fails to expressly charge the mens rea element of the crime of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance under R.C. 2907.323(A)(3), the indictment is fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 29} As this court noted in <em>State v. Vance, </em>Ashland App. No.2007-COA-035, 2008-Ohio-4763, 2008 WL 4286633, the Supreme Court reconsidered <em>State v. Colon (\u201cColon I\u201d) </em>in <em>State v. Colon (\u201cColon II\u201d), </em>119 Ohio St.3d 204, 2008-Ohio-3749, 893 N.E.2d 169. In <em>Colon II, </em>the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cApplying structural-error analysis to a defective indictment is appropriate only in rare cases, such as <em>Colon I, </em>in which multiple errors at the trial follow the defective indictment. In <em>Colon I, </em>the error in the indictment led to errors that \u2018permeate[d] the trial from beginning to end and put into question the reliability of the trial court in serving its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence.\u2019 Id. at \u00b6 23, citing <em>State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, at \u00b6 17. Seldom will a defective indictment have this effect, and therefore, in most defective indictment cases, the court may analyze the error pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B) plain-error analysis.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 8. The court noted the multiple errors that occurred in <em>Colon I:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cAs we stated in <em>Colon I, </em>the defect in the defendant\u2019s indictment was not the only error that had occurred: the defective indictment resulted in several other violations of the defendant\u2019s rights. 118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, \u00b6 29. In <em>Colon I, </em>we concluded that there was no evidence to show that the defendant had notice that recklessness was an element of the crime of robbery, nor was there evidence that the state argued that the defendant\u2019s conduct was reckless. Id. at \u00b6 30. Further, the trial court did not include recklessness as an element of the crime when it instructed the jury. Id. at \u00b6 31. In closing argument, the prosecuting attorney treated robbery as a strict-liability offense. Id.\u201d <em>Colon II </em>at \u00b6 6. See also <em>Vance </em>at \u00b6 51-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">{\u00b6 32} Unlike <em>Colon I, </em>the four prongs necessary to establish structural error are not met in this case. First, the appellant had notice that recklessness was an element of the crime of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance. In fact, a formal agreement to have the indictment amended was filed by the appellant. Second, at trial, the jury was properly instructed on the appropriate mens rea of recklessness. Finally, the state argued that the appellant\u2019s conduct was reckless.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Accordingly, this is not a case where the omission in the indictment permeated the trial from beginning to end and put into question the reliability of the trial court in serving its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence. Id. at \u00b6 27. In the case at bar, appellant did not object to the indictment or to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, and therefore, failed to preserve his claim that the indictment against him was constitutionally defective. See <em>State v. Ellis, </em>Guernsey App. No. 2007-CA-46, 2008-Ohio-7002, 2008 WL 5427980, at \u00b6 26. As structural error is not present in this case, this court may analyze the error in this case pursuant to the Crim.R. 52(B) plain-error analysis. <em>Colon II, </em>at \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 34} Crim.R. 52(B) provides that \u201c[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d \u201cNotice of plain error under Crim.R. 52(B) is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus. In order to find plain error under Crim.R. 52(B), it must be determined that, but for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. Even if the defendant satisfies this burden, an appellate court has discretion to disregard the error and should correct it only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240; <em>State v. Long, </em>paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 35} Under the circumstances of the case at bar, there is nothing in the record to show that the appellant was prejudiced. Where the defendant had notice through the arguments of counsel that recklessness was the mens rea for the crime charged, the state did not treat illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance as a strict-liability offense, the trial court correctly informed the jury as to the definition of \u201crecklessness\u201d and the defendant did not object, the defendant fails to establish that \u201cbut for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>State v. Long, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus. See also <em>State v. McMillen, </em>Stark App. No. 2008-CA-00122, 2009-Ohio-210, 2009 WL 131901, at \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 36} We find that any error in the indictment was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 37} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">{\u00b6 38} The appellant next claims that all three of his convictions are improper as being supported by legally insufficient evidence and/or against the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>{\u00b6 39} When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, our inquiry focuses primarily upon the adequacy of the evidence, that is, whether the evidence, if believed, reasonably could support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (\u201csufficiency is a test of adequacy\u201d); <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492. The standard of review is whether, after viewing the probative evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560; <em>Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 273, 574 N.E.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 40} The issue of the weight of the evidence addresses the evidence\u2019s effect of inducing belief. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, at \u00b6 25-26. \u201cIn other words, a reviewing court asks whose evidence is more persuasive \u2014 the state\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s? * * * [E]ven though there may be sufficient evidence to support a conviction, a reviewing court can still reweigh the evidence and reverse a lower court\u2019s holdings.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 26. However, an appellate court may not merely substitute its view for that of the jury, but must find that \u201c \u2018the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

The inference permits, but does not require, a fact-finder to infer the age of the person depicted in an image. <em>Tooley </em>at \u00b6 35; <em>State v. Brady, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 375, 894 N.E.2d 671, 2008-Ohio-4493, at \u00b6 34. In <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition </em>(2002), 535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403, the Supreme Court expressed doubt that images of actual children and simulated children were indistinguishable:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cIf virtual images were identical to illegal child pornography, the illegal images would be driven from the market by the indistinguishable substitutes. New pornographers would risk prosecution by abusing real children if fictional, computerized images would suffice.\u201d 535 U.S. at 254, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 62} In the case at bar, the actual images were submitted to the jury. Further, as previously noted, Diamond Boggs, a forensic computer expert with the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, testified that she did not find any indication that the photographs at issue were virtual, as opposed to real, children. In fact, despite her training in the area of detecting photographs of virtual children she testified that there was \u201cnothing that tells me that they are not real children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 63} The fact-finder in this case, the jury, was capable of reviewing the evidence to determine whether the state met its burden of showing that the images depicted real children. <em>Tooley, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 366, 2007-Ohio-3698, 872 N.E.2d 894, at \u00b6 54. With respect to the images supporting the convictions, this court has also viewed them and has concluded that real children were involved. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">{\u00b6 64} We therefore hold that the state presented sufficient evidence that the children depicted were real children to support appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">{\u00b6 65} Appellant next argues that the state failed to show that he had the required mens rea for the respective offenses. Appellant claims that the images were automatically stored by the web browser in the computer\u2019s temporary cache files; there is no evidence that he accessed or viewed the pornographic materials stored therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">{\u00b6 66} We note that recklessness is the requisite mens rea for pandering obscenity involving a minor, in violation of R.C. 2907.321(A)(5), and illegal use of a minor In nudity-oriented material or performance, in violation of R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>2907.323(A)(3). <em>State v.

Polizzi </em>(E.D.N.Y.2008), 549 F.Supp.2d 308, 343, 347, the court highlighted how computers and the internet can create a quagmire for the prosecution of cases involving child pornography:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cOnline child pornography (or any other electronic image) is typically received and viewed via email, downloading, or file sharing, or viewed on an Internet website. Unwanted or unsolicited emails, popularly termed \u2018spam,\u2019 are transmitted daily in the billions. See <em>United States v. Kelley, </em>482 F.3d 1047, 1055-56 (9th Cir.2007) (Thomas, J., dissenting). Many carry commercial messages, are dubious or disguised in nature and origin, and contain pornographic images, including child pornography, or links to pornographic websites. Id. at 1056. In one study, \u2018 \u201cmore than 40 percent of all pornographic spam either did not alert recipients to images contained in the message or contained false subject lines, thus \u2018making it more likely that recipients would open the messages without knowing that pornographic images will appear.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 Id. (quoting United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, S.Rep. No. 108-102, at 4 (2003), 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2348, 2351).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cOpening files \u2014 whether received by email or available on a website \u2014 in order to view the images may be automatic or manual. Files deliberately downloaded from the Internet and intentionally saved by the user should be distinguished from files automatically stored by the web browser in temporary cache files. <em>See generally </em>Ty E. Howard, <em>Don\u2019t Cache Out Your Case: Prosecuting Child Pornography Possession Laws Based On Images Located in Temporary Internet Files, </em>19 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 1227 (2004). \u2018The term \u201cdownloading\u201d generally refers to the act of manually storing a copy of an image on the hard drive for later retrieval.\u2019 <em>United States v. Romm, </em>455 F.3d 990, 993 n. 3 (9th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 1150, 127 S.Ct. 1024, 166 L.Ed.2d 772 (2007). In contrast, \u2018[t]he internet cache * * * is an area [on the hard drive] to which the internet browser automatically stores data to speed up future visits to the same websites.\u2019 Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cWhile you surf the Internet, the computer\u2019s \u2018web browsers keep copies of all the web pages that you view, up to a certain limit, so that the same images can be redisplayed quickly when you go back to them.\u2019 Id. at 993 n. 1 (quoting Douglass Downing, et ah, Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms 149 (Barron\u2019s 8th ed. 2003)). It is possible for sophisticated computer users to access and even \u2018delete\u2019 the automatically stored internet cache files, but computer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>forensic experts are often able to discover any files so deleted. <em>See Howard, </em>supra, at 1228; Steve Silberman, <em>The United States of America v.

Some offenders have been sent to jail for \u201cpossessing\u201d images that only a computer-forensics technician can see.\u2019). <em>But cf </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(c) (providing for the limited affirmative defense discussed below).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">{\u00b6 71} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cOnce a computer receives an illicit image by any method, whether spam email, intentional downloading, loading of a CD-ROM, file sharing, etc., the computer user possesses \u2018matter\u2019 containing child pornography, even before viewing the electronic screen. The images are in the computer and available for viewing. When he or she intentionally or unintentionally sees the child pornography pictures, the user \u2018knowingly possesses\u2019 them \u2014 even if the images were unsolicited, unwanted, or a complete surprise. The possession charged is purely passive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">{\u00b6 73} Unlike the federal statutes prohibiting possession of child pornography, Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme does not contain any \u201caffirmative defenses\u201d or \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions for the accidental or unintentional access to forbidden material. For example, Section 2252(c), Title 18, U.S.Code, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cIt shall be an affirmative defense to a charge of violating paragraph (4) of subsection (a) that the defendant\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">{\u00b6 75} \u201c(1) possessed less than three matters containing any visual depiction proscribed by that paragraph; and</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">{\u00b6 76} \u201c(2) promptly and in good faith, and without retaining or allowing any person, other than a law enforcement agency, to access any visual depiction or copy thereof\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">{\u00b6 77} \u201c(A) took reasonable steps to destroy each such visual depiction; or</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">{\u00b6 78} \u201c(B) reported the matter to a law enforcement agency and afforded that agency access to each such visual depiction.\u201d See also <em>Polizzi, </em>549 F.Supp.2d at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">{\u00b6 79} The court in <em>Polizzi </em>detailed the conundrum created in criminal law by attempting to engraft traditional notions of what constitutes \u201cpossession\u201d and \u201creceipt\u201d upon this emerging electronic technology:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cDoes looking at online child pornography, for instance, automatically entail possession? Receipt? <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>247 F.Supp.2d 459, 484 n. 12 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (\u2018Whether the [child pornography] statute reaches mere internet \u201cbrowsing\u201d is something of an open question. The statute does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>criminalize \u201cviewing\u201d the images, and there remains the issue of whether images viewed on the internet and automatically stored in a browser\u2019s temporary file cache are knowingly \u201cpossessed\u201d or \u201creceived.\u201d \u2019); <em>Howard, </em>supra, at 1266-68. Does receipt of illicit images via computer automatically result in possession? <em>See United States v. Kamen, </em>491 F.Supp.2d 142, 152 (D.Mass.2007) (establishing that possession is a lesser included offense of receipt of child pornography as a matter of law). Or does possession result in receipt? <em>See United States v. Romm, </em>455 F.3d at 998 (\u2018[W]hether [defendant] \u201creceived\u201d the images in his cache depends on whether he knowingly took possession of them.\u2019). What is the difference, if any, between possession and receipt? Must the pictures be saved or downloaded to the hard drive to establish possession, or can they be stored temporarily on internet cache files? <em>Compare United States v. Stulock, </em>308 F.3d 922, 925 (8th Cir.2002) (defendant could not be \u2018guilty of possession for simply having viewed an image on a web site, thereby causing the image to be automatically stored in the browser\u2019s cache, without having purposely saved or downloaded the image.\u2019) <em>ivith Romm, </em>455 F.3d at 999 (upholding conviction based on forty deleted images from the internet cache). Does possession continue after the computer user deletes \u2014 out of revulsion for the images \u2014 all normally accessible (but perhaps not all inaccessible hard drive) computer files? Application of the statute requires an exceptionally high appreciation of the abstract concepts involved, one not likely to be within the ken of the average layperson.\u201d <em>Polizzi, </em>549 F.Supp.2d at 351-352.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">{\u00b6 81} The distinction between \u201cviewing\u201d and \u201cpossession\u201d has been characterized in a variety of ways. For example, in <em>Commonwealth v. Simone, </em>63 Va.Cir. 216, 2003 WL 22994238, the court used the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cBy analogy, one might consider the following hypothetical. If a person walks down the street and notices an item (such as child pornography or an illegal narcotic) whose possession is prohibited, has that person committed a criminal offense if they look at the item for a sufficient amount of time to know what it is and then walks away? The obvious answer seems to be \u2018no.\u2019 However, if the person looks at the item long enough to know what it is, then reaches out and picks it up, holding and viewing it, and taking it with them to their home, that person has moved from merely viewing the item to knowingly possessing the item by reaching out for it and controlling it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 83} As noted by Ty E. Howard, \u201cThere are two conceptual approaches to determining whether cached images constitute knowing possession. The first approach places legal significance on the images found in a cache, and it holds that the presence of those images within the cache constitutes actual knowing possession of child pornography at the time the images are found (hereinafter \u2018the Present Possession approach\u2019). The second, alternative approach places <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>legal significance on the images that the computer user sought out and placed on his computer screen. This approach holds that the copies of images found in a cache constitute evidence of some prior (but no less real) knowing possession (hereinafter \u2018the Evidence Of approach\u2019). No court has discussed which conceptual approach it was following. To the contrary, it appears from the format and substance of the analyses that every court has defaulted to the Present Possession approach without even recognition of other conceptual models.\u201d 19 Berkeley Tech.L.J. at 1254-1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 84} Howard suggests that the \u201cEvidence Of\u2019 approach is more suited to take into account the automatically stored internet cache files. Accordingly, under this approach, \u201cthe most difficult and incongruous defense facing prosecutors \u2014 lack of knowledge \u2014 -is rendered irrelevant. Thus, the focus of child pornography possession is no longer the cached files as contraband themselves, but rather their evidentiary value to prove the previous possession of contraband\u2014 the actual images on the user\u2019s screen.\u201d Id. at 1271-1272. Thus, \u201cknowledge of the cache operation is irrelevant because criminal liability arises not from the cached images themselves, but rather from the images that the user originally searched for, selected, and placed on his computer screen.\u201d Id. at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 85} Applying the foregoing to the facts adduced at trial in appellant\u2019s case, we conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence to establish that appellant sought out the images and exercised dominion and control over them. In this case, there is evidence that the images on appellant\u2019s computer did not appear by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">(\u00b6 86} The state introduced evidence of the search terms and file names associated with appellant\u2019s computer activity. Boggs testified that the appellant\u2019s use of the computer involved included actually typing in search terms to search for websites. These search terms and file names included \u201camazing preteen; elite preteens; family incest tree; free young; young porn; innocent youth; preteen angels; and shameless preteens, little angels, top ten Lolita nude and pixyoung.com, teentray.com, tinyteenthongsinfo.\u201d Boggs testified that these search terms were commonly used in attempts to locate child pornography on the Internet. In fact, access to some of these pages was repeated, thus making it clear to a reasonable juror that an \u201caccidental\u201d viewing was not taking place.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 87} The jury further heard evidence of appellant\u2019s admissions. The following exchange appears in his interview with Det. Robert Huffman of the Newark Police Department:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cRH: Ok. Would you agree that some of the sites that you viewed did have children\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cMH: Yes, yes there did\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>{\u00b6 90} \u201cRH: Underage children?</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cMH: \u2014 but I, yes. Uh I did not know that just a click and a punch was, was illegal but it obviously is and um\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cRH: Ok. But you, the click and the punch lead to you viewing these photos.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 93} \u201cMH: Right, right. I mean they came up yes when I clicked and punched, these pictures came up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 94} Appellant\u2019s use of search terms to certain types of websites demonstrates his affirmative actions to obtain certain images and place them on his computer screen. The search terms themselves are further evidence of appellant\u2019s knowledge of the content of those images. The evidence shows that appellant voluntarily reached out for and brought to his computer screen the images in question. Therefore, his knowledge, or lack thereof, of the cache operation is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">{\u00b6 95} After reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant recklessly possessed the material in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">{\u00b6 96} We hold, therefore, that the state met its burden of production regarding each element of the crimes and, accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">{\u00b6 97} \u201cA fundamental premise of our criminal trial system is that \u2018the <em>jury </em>is the lie detector.\u2019 <em>United States v.

Determining the weight and credibility of witness testimony, therefore, has long been held to be the \u2018part of every case [that] belongs to the jury, who are presumed to be fitted for it by their natural intelligence and their practical knowledge of men and the ways of men.\u2019 <em>Aetna Life Ins.
