For the following reasons, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">{\u00b6 2} In July 2006, Bellamy pleaded guilty to one- count of forgery and one count of misuse of a credit card. The trial court sentenced him to three years in prison on each count, to be served concurrently with each other and concurrently with a one-year sentence Bellamy had received in Clark County. According to Bellamy, he had served seven months of his Clark County sentence when he was sentenced in Champaign County.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">{\u00b6 3} On January 7, 2008, Bellamy filed a motion for resentencing with the Champaign County court. In his supporting memorandum, Bellamy stated that the Department of Corrections would not give him credit for the seven months that he had served on his Clark County case before he was sentenced in Champaign County. Bellamy asked the trial court to resentence him, giving him credit for those seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-17\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court overruled Bellamy\u2019s motion. The court reasoned: \u201cThe [Cjhampaign County sentencing order that was concurrent with Clark County is not retroactive. It does not apply to time served before the Champaign County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>sentence was imposed. It appears that the Department of Corrections is properly applying State law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 5} Bellamy appeals from the denial of his motion for resentencing, raising two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cI. Trial court abused its discretion when it refused to grant appellant time he served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">{\u00b6 7} In his first assignment of error, Bellamy claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for resentencing and failed to reduce his sentence by the seven months that he had served on his Clark County conviction prior to the imposition of his Champaign County sentence. Bellamy argues that \u201c[p]art of the plea agreement was that Clark County and Champaign County time would run concurrent and Appellant would only serve 29 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">{\u00b6 8} The state responds that the trial court properly denied Bellamy\u2019s motion, because the motion constituted an untimely petition for postconviction relief, which the trial court had no jurisdiction to consider. The state further argues that even if the trial court had jurisdiction, the trial court\u2019s denial of Bellamy\u2019s motion was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">{\u00b6 9} As an initial matter, we decline to construe Bellamy\u2019s motion as a petition for postconviction relief, pursuant to R.C. 2953.21. R.C. 2953.21 governs challenges to a defendant\u2019s conviction or sentence based on violations of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 158, 679 N.E.2d 1131, syllabus; <em>State v. Spencer, </em>Clark App. No. 2006 CA 42, 2007-Ohio-2140, 2007 WL 1297171, \u00b6 7-8. Bellamy did not assert any constitutional challenges in his motion for resentencing; he merely requested that he be given credit for time previously served on the concurrent Clark County sentence. Although Bellamy suggests on appeal that his plea was involuntary because it was premised on serving only 29 months on the Champaign County charges, Bellamy did not raise the constitutionality of his plea before the trial court. Accordingly, Bellamy\u2019s motion will not be construed as a petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">{\u00b6 10} Nevertheless, we agree with the state that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to alter Bellamy\u2019s sentence. In general, the trial court does not have authority to reconsider its own valid final judgment in a criminal case. <em>State ex rel. Cruzado v. Zaleski </em>111 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-5795, 856 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 18; <em>State v. Sanner, </em>Greene App. No. 2007 CA 13, 2008-Ohio-1168, 2008 WL 697738, \u00b6 11. Absent a clerical error or a void sentence, the trial court may not amend or modify a criminal sentence once it has been executed. <em>Cruzado </em>at \u00b6 19; <em>State v. Sharp, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21958, 2008-Ohio-1618, 2008 WL 867736, \u00b6 4; <em>State v. Simpkins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-1197, 884 N.E.2d 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The trial court\u2019s final judgment is valid on its face, and there is no indication that it contains a clerical error concerning the length of Bellamy\u2019s term of imprisonment. Bellamy attached to his motion for resentencing what appears to be an excerpt of the sentencing-hearing transcript. The excerpt reveals that the trial court sentenced Bellamy to three years of imprisonment for the forgery and misuse-of-credit-card charges, to be served concurrently with each other \u201cand concurrent to the Clark County charge.\u201d There is no statement that Bellamy was to be given credit for the seven months that he had previously served on the Clark County sentence. Because Bellamy\u2019s sentence was valid and no clerical error was apparent, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to reduce Bellamy\u2019s sentence by seven months, as requested in Bellamy\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 12} Moreover, the trial court properly determined that Bellamy\u2019s Champaign County sentence did not implicitly include credit for the time Bellamy had previously served on his Clark County sentence. \u201c[T]he imposition of a concurrent sentence normally means that the sentence being imposed is to run concurrently with the <em>undischarged </em>portion of the previously imposed sentence.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Bianco v. Minor </em>(June 6, 2003), M.D.Pa. No. Civ.A. 303CV0913, 2003 WL 21715347. See also <em>Richards v. Eberlin, </em>Belmont App. No. 04-BE-1, 2004-Ohio-2636, 2004 WL 1152863, \u00b6 20-22 (stating that concurrent sentences mean that \u201ca person need not finish serving the first sentence before the time for the second sentence can be served, as is the case with consecutive sentences\u201d). As the Eleventh Circuit explained regarding federal criminal sentencing:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cWhatever else the word [concurrent] means with regard to the second sentence, however, it does not mean that the two sentences \u2018hav[e] the same starting date because a federal sentence cannot commence prior to the date it is pronounced, even if made concurrent with a sentence already being served.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coloma v. Holder </em>(C.A.11, 2006), 445 F.3d 1282, 1284, quoting <em>United States v. Flores </em>(C.A.5, 1980), 616 F.2d 840, 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">{\u00b6 14} Using the common understanding of the term \u201cconcurrent,\u201d the trial court\u2019s sentence indicates that the two concurrent three-year terms in Champaign County were to run concurrently with the portion of Bellamy\u2019s sentence that remained to be served in Clark County.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">{\u00b6 15} In reaching our conclusion, we make no findings as to whether the trial court had authority under Ohio law to order retroactive concurrent sentences. Even assuming that such authority exists, however, we would not presume that the court had imposed retroactive concurrent sentences in the absence of clear and unambiguous statements from the trial court expressing its intent that the start dates of the newly-imposed concurrent sentences were to relate back to the start date of the previously imposed sentence. Neither Bellamy\u2019s sentencing entry nor the transcript excerpt contains any such statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Bellamy\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cII. Trial court refuse[d] to grant appellant a copy of transcripts at state expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 18} In his second assignment of error, Bellamy claims that the trial court erred in refusing to provide him with a transcript of the sentencing hearing at the state\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 19} According to appendix B to Bellamy\u2019s appellate brief, on April 2, 2008, Bellamy filed a \u201cStatement, Praecipe, and Notice to Court Reporter\u201d seeking a transcript of his July 18, 2006 sentencing hearing. On April 14, 2008, the trial court \u201cdecline[d] to order preparation of the transcript of the sentencing hearing on an indigency basis.\u201d We find no fault with the trial court\u2019s ruling for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">{\u00b6 20} First, Bellamy filed his notice of appeal on February 20, 2008, prior to his request for a transcript and the trial court\u2019s denial of that request. Thus, the trial court had only the excerpt of the sentencing hearing transcript attached to Bellamy\u2019s motion when it denied Bellamy\u2019s motion for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">{\u00b6 21} Courts of appeals generally may not supplement the record and resolve an appeal based on evidence that was not before the trial court. See <em>State v. Ishmail </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 8 O.O.3d 405, 377 N.E.2d 500, at paragraph one of the syllabus. This is true even when the trial court failed to consider a transcript in resolving a petition for postconviction relief, where constitutional arguments were raised. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus (\u201cWhere a trial court, in denying a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to R.C. 2953.21, does not consider a transcript of proceedings of the hearing at which the guilty pleas were entered, a Court of Appeals cannot add that transcript to the record before it and then decide the appeal on the basis of matter disclosed by the transcript\u201d). Considering that we would have been unable to supplement the record and consider Bellamy\u2019s sentencing hearing transcript even if his motion for resentencing were construed as a petition for postconviction relief, we see no basis for supplementing the record with Bellamy\u2019s sentencing hearing transcript under the circumstances before us, where Bellamy\u2019s motion for resentencing raised no constitutional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">{\u00b6 22} Second, as noted above, Bellamy attached an excerpt of the sentencing hearing transcript to his motion for resentencing. Thus, the record reflects that a transcript had been prepared and that Bellamy has had access to a transcript of the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>{\u00b6 23} Finally, to the extent that Bellamy\u2019s first assignment of error concerns the meaning of the term \u201cconcurrent,\u201d that issue presents a question of law, for which a transcript is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 24} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 25} Having overruled the assignments of error, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b248-8\">Brogan and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
