Brian Haney, appeals from the November 15, 2007 and April 30, 2008 judgments of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in four consolidated cases involving attempts by Haney and plaintiff-appellee, Olive Branch Holdings, L.L.C. (\u201cOlive Branch\u201d), to subject certain patents owned by defendant-appellee, Smith Technology Development, L.L.C. (\u201cSmith Technology\u201d), to the satisfaction of money judgments against Smith Technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">{\u00b6 2} On April 27, 2004, the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas confirmed an arbitration award in favor of Haney and against Smith Technology in the amount of $1,238,443.11, plus interest, and entered judgment accordingly. See <em>Haney v. Smith Technology Dev., L.L.C., </em>Franklin Cty. C.P. No. 03CVH12-13231 (the \u201cconfirmation action\u201d). On November 15, 2004, in the confirmation action, Haney filed a motion to apply property on execution under R.C. 2333.21 (the \u201cR.C. 2333.21 motion\u201d). In his motion, Haney requested an order that ten identified patents owned by Smith Technology be applied toward satisfaction of his judgment. The R.C. 2333.21 motion did not include a certificate of service as required by Civ.R. 5(D) and Loc.R. 19.01 of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, General Division (\u201cLoc.R. 19.01\u201d), although Smith Technology admits that it became aware of Haney\u2019s motion on November 30, 2004, after receiving a copy that Haney mailed on November 23, 2004, eight days after filing his motion with the clerk of courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">{\u00b6 3} Without holding a hearing, and despite the absence of a certificate of service, the trial court granted Haney\u2019s R.C. 2333.21 motion on December 7, 2004, and ordered that the patents be applied toward satisfaction of Haney\u2019s judgment. The order authorized and directed Haney\u2019s attorney, Richard D. Rogovin, to execute and deliver, \u201cas the duly authorized representative of [Smith Technology],\u201d instruments to effectuate the assignment of the patents to Haney or his assignee. The following week, Rogovin executed assignments of the patents from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Smith Technology to Haney\u2019s assignee, Matthew 6 Foundation (\u201cMatthew 6\u201d), and filed the assignments with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The December 7, 2004 order neither assigned a value to the patents nor provided for their sale as a means of reducing Haney\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">{\u00b6 4} On January 11, 2005, Smith Technology filed a motion to vacate the December 7, 2004 order, arguing that R.C. 2333.21 may not be used to subject a patent to satisfaction of a judgment, that Haney failed to properly invoke R.C. 2333.21, and that Haney failed to comply with the requirements of Civ.R. 5(D) and Loc.R. 19.01 by not filing a certificate of service with his motion. After conducting a hearing on January 14, 2005, the trial court vacated the December 7, 2004 order, stating: \u201cAs no certificate of service was filed with regard to [Haney\u2019s] motion, said motion was never properly before the Court.\u201d Upon stipulation of the parties, however, the court ordered that the patents remain in Matthew 6\u2019s possession and enjoined all parties from disposing of or taking any action against the patents. The court also scheduled a hearing for January 19, 2005, regarding the applicability of R.C. 2333.21 to the patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 5} Over the next year, Smith Technology and Haney entered into a series of agreed orders, by which the trial court continued the scheduled hearing, left the patents in Matthew 6\u2019s possession, and maintained the injunction prohibiting the parties from taking action against the patents. Each agreed order stated that it should not be construed, as an admission or waiver of any claim or defense by either party. The final agreed order, filed February 2, 2006, continued the hearing regarding the proper statutory procedure for subjecting the patents to the satisfaction of Haney\u2019s judgment, including the applicability of R.C. 2333.21, to March 28, 2006, although it does not appear from the record that the scheduled hearing occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 6} On January 19, 2006, during the period encompassed by the agreed orders, Olive Branch obtained a judgment against Smith Technology in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Thereafter, on January 20 and 24, 2006, to satisfy its own judgment, Olive Branch filed actions in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas for a creditor\u2019s bill and for a writ of execution relating to the ten patents identified in Haney\u2019s R.C. 2333.21 motion. See <em>Olive Branch Holdings, L.L.C. v. Smith Technology Dev., L.L.C., </em>Franklin Cty. C.P. No. 06CVH01-935 (the \u201ccreditor\u2019s bill action\u201d); <em>Olive Branch Holdings, L.L.C. v. Smith Technology Dev., L.L.C., </em>Franklin Cty. C.P. No. 06EX01-47 (the \u201cexecution action\u201d). On April 7, 2006, with the agreement of the parties, the trial court consolidated Olive Branch\u2019s creditor\u2019s bill and execution actions into the confirmation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 7} On May 3, 2006, the trial court ordered the parties to file simultaneous briefs regarding the proper procedure for subjecting the patents to satisfaction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the judgments against Smith Technology and regarding who should hold the patents pending final determination of the parties\u2019 actions. On May 26, 2006, Haney, Smith Technology, and Olive Branch filed memoranda setting forth their positions and legal arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">{\u00b6 8} On May 16, 2007, Haney filed a creditor\u2019s bill complaint to reach an 11th patent owned by Smith Technology. See <em>Haney v. Smith Technology Dev., L.L.C., </em>Franklin Cty. C.P. No. 07CVH05-6644. Haney also filed a motion in the consolidated action to apply the 11th patent on execution pursuant to R.C. 2333.21. On September 24, 2007, the trial court consolidated Haney\u2019s creditor\u2019s bill complaint with the other consolidated cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">{\u00b6 9} On November 15, 2007, the trial court issued its decision and entry on the proper method of execution on patents and an order to transfer possession of the patents to Smith Technology. The court noted that since vacating the December 7, 2004 order, it had not made any determination as to Haney\u2019s right to the patents under R.C. 2333.21 or as to whether Matthew 6\u2019s possession of the patents conferred any ownership rights on either Matthew 6 or Haney. The court then stated: \u201cDue to the uncertainty surrounding the valuation of the patents at bar, and upon historical precedence, the court finds that the proper method for executing patents is a creditor\u2019s bill filed pursuant to R.C. 2333.01 [and] that execution on the patents pursuant to R.C. 2333.21 and 2327.09 [is] not proper.\u201d Discussing the parties\u2019 priorities, the court determined that Olive Branch has the first and best lien on the ten originally identified patents by virtue of its January 20, 2006 creditor\u2019s bill complaint and that Haney has the first and best lien on the 11th patent by virtue of his May 15, 2007 creditor\u2019s bill complaint. The trial court rejected Haney\u2019s argument that his attempt to reach the patents through R.C. 2333.21 gave him priority, as the most diligent creditor, over Olive Branch, with respect to the first ten patents. Finally, the court ordered that the patents be transferred back to Smith Technology, as the current and rightful owner, pending final resolution of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 10} Subsequent to the trial court\u2019s decision and entry, Haney filed several motions, including a motion for leave to file a creditor\u2019s bill counterclaim and cross-claim instanter and a motion for the addition of Civ.R. 54(B) language and to stay the November 15, 2007 decision and entry pending appeal. Haney also refiled his R.C. 2333.21 motion, this time with a certificate of service, and argued that the refiled motion should relate back to the filing date of his original R.C. 2333.21 motion. The trial court disposed of Haney\u2019s motions in a decision and entry filed April 30, 2008. The trial court denied Haney\u2019s motion to refile his R.C. 2333.21 motion with relation back to the original November 15, 2004 filing date and denied Haney\u2019s request that Matthew 6 be permitted to retain the patents pending appeal. The trial court granted Haney\u2019s motion for leave to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>a creditor\u2019s bill counterclaim and cross-claim with respect to the ten originally identified patents to preserve his rights on appeal and his priority as to other creditors, but the court declined to readdress the issue of priority between Haney and Olive Branch. Finally, the court granted Haney\u2019s motion for the addition of Civ.R. 54(B) language and issued a new judgment entry, incorporating a certification that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay\u201d into its November 15, 2007 decision and entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">{\u00b6 11} Haney filed a notice of appeal on May 29, 2008, and he asserts the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">I. Assignment of Error # 1: The trial court erred when it found that a creditor\u2019s bill is the only way to attach a patent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">II. Assignment of Error # 2: The trial court erred when it determined that * * * Haney was not the most diligent judgment creditor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">III. Assignment of Error # 3: The trial court erred when it refused to allow * * * Haney to refile his motion to apply patents on execution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">IV. Assignment of Error # 4: The trial court erred when it found the patents must be assigned back to Smith Technology.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">(\u00b6 12} As an initial matter, we consider the argument made by Smith Technology and Olive Branch that the trial court\u2019s addition of Civ.R. 54(B) language to its November 15, 2007 decision and entry was insufficient to create a final, appealable order. Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution limits an appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction to the review of final orders, and if an appeal is taken from an order that is not final and appealable, the appellate court must dismiss the appeal. <em>Farmers Mkt. Drive-In Shopping Ctrs. v. Magana, </em>Franklin App. No. 06AP-532, 2007-Ohio-2653, 2007 WL 1560276, \u00b6 10, citing <em>Renner\u2019s Welding &amp; Fabrication, Inc. v. Chrysler Motor Corp. </em>(1996), 117 Ohio App.3d 61, 64, 689 N.E.2d 1015; <em>McClary v. M/I Schottenstein Homes, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-777, 2004-Ohio-7047, 2004 WL 2980561, \u00b6 15. Therefore, we must assess our jurisdiction over these appeals before considering the merits of Haney\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">{\u00b6 13} A trial court\u2019s order is final and appealable only if it meets the requirements of R.C. 2505.02(B) and, if applicable, Civ.R. 54(B). <em>Denham v. New Carlisle </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 594, 596, 716 N.E.2d 184, citing <em>Chef Italiano Corp. v. Kent State Univ. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 86, 88, 541 N.E.2d 64. The Supreme Court of Ohio has established a two-step analysis for determining whether an order is final and appealable. See <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 17, 21, 540 N.E.2d 266. First, the appellate court must determine whether the order constitutes a final order. Id.; <em>Wisintainer v. Elcen Power Strut Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 352, 354, 617 N.E.2d 1136. To be final, an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>must fit into at least one of the categories set forth in R.C. 2505.02(B). <em>Noble v. Colwell </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 92, 96, 540 N.E.2d 1381. R.C. 2505.02(B) defines a final order as: \u201c(1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment; [or] (2) An order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment.\u201d A final order is one that disposes of the whole case or some separate and distinct branch of the case. <em>Noble </em>at 94, 540 N.E.2d 1381, citing <em>Lantsberry v. Tilley Lamp Co. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 303, 306, 56 O.O.2d 179, 272 N.E.2d 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">{\u00b6 14} If an order satisfies R.C. 2505.02(B), the court must then determine whether Civ.R. 54(B) language is required. <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. </em>at 21, 540 N.E.2d 266. Civ.R. 54(B) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">In the absence of a determination that there is no just reason for delay, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties, shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">When, as here, an order adjudicates fewer than all claims in a case, it must meet the requirements of both R.C. 2505.02(B) and Civ.R. 54(B) to be final and appealable. <em>Noble </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\"> {\u00b6 15} It is well established that when an order is not final under R.C. 2505.02(B), the addition of Civ.R. 54(B) language will not transform it into a final, appealable order. See <em>R &amp; H Trucking, Inc. v. Occidental Fire &amp; Cas. Co. of North Carolina </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 269, 271, 2 OBR 298, 441 N.E.2d 816 (inclusion of Civ.R. 54[B] language did not create a final, appealable order where the trial court did not adjudicate the single claim for relief, but only limited the type of damages available). However, Civ.R. 54(B) language can transform a final order into a final, <em>appealable </em>order and permit the separation of claims for purposes of appeal, within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Wisintainer, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 354, 617 N.E.2d 1136. See also <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St.2d 158, 159, 3 O.O.3d 174, 359 N.E.2d 702. Because they contend that the addition of Civ.R. 54(B) language did not convert the November 15, 2007 decision and entry into a final, appealable order, appellees\u2019 argument seems to be that that entry did not constitute a final order under R.C. 2505.02(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">{\u00b6 16} Appellees cite <em>Downtown Properties v. Meyers, Hentemann &amp; Rea Co., L.P.A. </em>(Sept. 13, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 78192, 2001 WL 1075716, in support of their assertion that the addition of Civ.R. 54(B) language did not create a final, appealable order. In that case, Downtown Properties filed a complaint for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>breach of contract, breach of lease, and recovery on account against Myers, Hentemann &amp; Rea Co., L.P.A. (\u201cMHR\u201d). Key Bank National Association (\u201cKey Bank\u201d) subsequently filed a creditor\u2019s bill against MHR to collect on a previous cognovit judgment. The trial court consolidated Key Bank\u2019s creditor\u2019s bill action with Downtown Properties\u2019 action, appointed a receiver for MHR\u2019s assets, and determined that Key Bank had priority in payment over Downtown Properties and MHR\u2019s other creditors. Although it had not determined any of Downtown Properties\u2019 claims against MHR, the trial court added Civ.R. 54(B) language to its judgment entry regarding the parties\u2019 priority. On appeal, the Eighth District concluded that it lacked jurisdiction because the addition of Civ.R. 54(B) language to the trial court\u2019s judgment entry did not convert that entry into a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">{\u00b6 17} In its opposition to Haney\u2019s request for Civ.R. 54(B) certification, Smith Technology argued that pursuant to <em>Downtown Properties, </em>Civ.R. 54(B) language cannot convert a decision regarding the priorities of competing creditors into a final, appealable order. The <em>Downtotm Properties </em>holding is not as broad as Smith Technology asserts, however. The Eighth District concluded that there was no final, appealable order in <em>Downtown Properties, </em>not because the trial court\u2019s opinion decided the issue of priority, but because \u201c[t]he claims for relief presented by the plaintiffs in this case have not been adjudicated; the trial court merely determined which party has priority in receiving payment from MHR at the conclusion of the lawsuit.\u201d Thus, no individual claim or distinct branch of that action had been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 18} Like the trial court in <em>Downtown Properties, </em>2001 WL 1075716, the trial court here issued an order establishing the parties\u2019 priorities for payment, but it also, by contrast, fully adjudicated Haney\u2019s application for relief under R.C. 2333.21. The trial court\u2019s determination that Smith Technology\u2019s patents cannot be reached via R.C. 2333.21 prevents any judgment in favor of Haney on his attempt to apply the patents on execution to satisfy his judgment. Thus, the trial court\u2019s November 15, 2007 decision and entry essentially closed the door to any relief, pursuant to R.C. 2333.21, the only affirmative relief Haney had requested with respect to the first ten patents. Therefore, <em>Downtown Properties </em>is easily distinguishable and does not preclude the existence of a final, appealable order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 19} During oral arguments, appellees agreed that Haney\u2019s R.C. 2333.21 motion, had been fully and finally adjudicated as of November 15, 2007. While appellees also suggested that the trial court only considered Haney\u2019s attempt to invoke R.C. 2333.21 as a consideration in the lien contest within Olive Branch\u2019s creditor\u2019s bill complaint, the actions of the parties and the court belie that suggestion. Although the trial court vacated its December 7, 2004 order granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Haney\u2019s R.C. 2333.21 motion, the court did not determine the ownership of the patents or the proper method for subjecting the patents to payment of a judgment against Smith Technology. Indeed, the trial court continued proceedings and scheduled a hearing in the confirmation action to determine those very issues. Moreover, the parties\u2019 agreed orders, which repeatedly continued the scheduled hearing and left the patents in Matthew 6\u2019s possession, suggest an understanding that outstanding issues remained to be determined in that ease, with respect to the applicability of R.C. 2333.21. This is especially true with respect to the agreed orders filed before Olive Branch initiated its own actions, when no other proceeding was pending before the trial court. Finally, in its November 15, 2007 decision and entry, the trial court clearly considered and determined the applicability of R.C. 2333.21 as its own claim, separate and apart from the issue of priority under Olive Branch\u2019s creditor\u2019s bill action. The trial court specifically delineated its discussion of the applicability of R.C. 2333.21 from its discussion of lien priority and issued separate determinations on those distinct branches of the consolidated actions. Because the trial court\u2019s order denied the only requested relief in the confirmation action and prevented any judgment in favor of Haney under R.C. 2333.21, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s November 15, 2007 decision and entry constituted a final order under R.C. 2505.02(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">{\u00b6 20} We must next determine whether the trial court\u2019s entry complied with the requirements of Civ.R. 54(B), the purpose of which is to balance the strong policy against piecemeal litigation with the possible injustice of delayed appeals in special situations. <em>Noble, </em>44 Ohio St.3d at 96, 540 N.E.2d 1381. When cases are consolidated, they become \u201cone single action subject to the requirements of Civ.R. 54(B) and R.C. 2505.02.\u201d <em>Gilligan v. Robinson, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-1028, 2006-Ohio-4619, 2006 WL 2575569, \u00b6 41, citing <em>Tadmor v. Hunt ington Natl. Bank, </em>Summit App. No. 22760, 2006-Ohio-1046, 2006 WL 544516, \u00b6 14. In <em>Mezerkor v. Mezerkor </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 304, 638 N.E.2d 1007, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the absence of a Civ.R. 54(B) certification in an entry of summary judgment relating to fewer than all the claims and parties in two consolidated cases prevented the immediate appealability of the summary-judgment decision. Here, however, the trial court\u2019s April 30, 2008 entry incorporated a certification that there is no just reason for delay, pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B), into the November 15, 2007 decision and entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe phrase \u2018there is no just reason for delay\u2019 in Civ.R. 54(B) embodies an essential principle that a trial court must assess \u2014 whether the interest in the administration of justice permits a case to proceed to the appeal level and avoid delay where there are parties or claims outstanding.\u201d <em>Tadmor, </em>2006-Ohio-1046, 2006 WL 544516, at \u00b6 16. Whether a court certifies a judgment, pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B), is within its sound discretion. <em>Noble </em>at 97, 540 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>1381, fn. 7. A trial court\u2019s determination that there is no just i-eason for delay is essentially a factual determination- \u2014 -\u201cwhether an interlocutory appeal is consistent with the interests of sound judicial administration, <em>i.e., </em>whether it leads to judicial economy.\u201d <em>Wisintainer, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 354, 617 N.E.2d 1136. The trial court is entitled to the same presumption of correctness that it is accorded regarding other factual findings, and an appellate court must not disturb such a determination where some competent, credible evidence supports it. Id. \u201c[W]here the record indicates that the interests of sound judicial administration could be served by a finding of \u2018no just reason for delay,\u2019 the trial court\u2019s certification determination must stand.\u201d Id. at 355, 617 N.E.2d 1136.

Ryan, </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-231, 2008-Ohio-1216, 2008 WL 714070, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">{\u00b6 22} In this case, the trial court did not act reflexively in certifying that there was \u201cno just reason for delay.\u201d Rather, the court acted only after Haney moved for Civ.R. 54(B) certification and after considering the parties\u2019 arguments and the ramifications of its certification decision. The trial court understood the import of its certification and reasoned that an immediate appeal might ultimately render further proceedings in the trial court moot. Because we agree with the trial court that its decision to certify could result in judicial economy, we discern no error in the court\u2019s decision to add a Civ.R. 54(B) certification to its November 15, 2007 decision and entry. Accordingly, we conclude that these appeals are taken from a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 23} Turning now to the merits of Haney\u2019s appeals, we note that Haney\u2019s arguments under his first and second assignments of error are interrelated. Therefore, we will address them together. By his first assignment of error, Haney asserts that the trial court erred by finding that a creditor\u2019s bill is the only appropriate means to subject a patent to satisfaction of a judgment. By his second assignment of error, Haney contends that the trial court erred by determining that he was not the most diligent judgment creditor and was, therefore, not entitled to priority over Olive Branch. Both assignments of error revolve around the applicability of Haney and Olive Branch\u2019s chosen procedures to subject Smith Technology\u2019s patents to the satisfaction of their judgments. Because these assignments of error involve purely legal issues, we review the trial court\u2019s resolution of those issues de novo, without deference to the trial court\u2019s conclusions. See <em>Graham v. Drydock Coal Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 311, 313, 667 N.E.2d 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 24} It is undisputed that a judgment creditor may reach patents owned by a debtor as a means of satisfying its judgment. The United States Supreme Court has emphasized that the patent act, \u201csecuring a sole and exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>right to the patentee, [does] not exonerate the right and property thereby acquired * * * from liability to be subjected by suitable judicial proceedings to the payment of * * * debts.\u201d <em>Ager v. Murray </em>(1881), 105 U.S. 126, 128, 26 L.Ed. 942. The question remaining, however, is the nature of the \u201csuitable judicial proceedings\u201d by which a creditor may reach its debtor\u2019s patents to satisfy a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">{\u00b6 25} Haney argues, first, that a creditor\u2019s bill was not a proper proceeding by which Olive Branch, as a judgment creditor, could reach Smith Technology\u2019s patents, an argument we reject. A creditor\u2019s bill is \u201c[a]n equitable suit in which a judgment creditor seeks to reach property that cannot be reached by the process available to enforce a judgment.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.1999) 376. See also <em>Terry v. Claypool </em>(1945), 77 Ohio App. 87, 92, 32 O.O. 353, 65 N.E.2d 889 (defining a creditor\u2019s bill as an equitable proceeding available \u201cwhen the creditor is unable to satisfy his claim at law, either on account of insufficiency of legal assets, or other circumstances rendering legal remedies inadequate\u201d). Simply, a creditor\u2019s bill enables a judgment creditor to secure a hen on those assets of the judgment debtor that mere execution of the judgment at law cannot reach. <em>Huntington Ctr. Assoc. v. Schwartz, Warren &amp; Ramirez </em>(Sept. 26, 2000), Franklin App. No. 00AP-35, 2000 WL 1376524, citing <em>Union Properties v. Patterson </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 192, 28 O.O. 111, 54 N.E.2d 668; <em>Lakeshore Motor Freight v. Glenway Industries </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 8, 2 OBR 8, 440 N.E.2d 567, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>Ager, </em>105 U.S. 126, 26 L.Ed. 942, the United States Supreme Court endorsed the use of a creditor\u2019s bill in a creditor\u2019s attempt to satisfy a monetary judgment against an individual who owned no real or personal property subject to execution at law, but who owned an interest in certain patents. The judgment creditor filed a creditor\u2019s bill, and the lower court, exercising its equity powers, ordered that the debtor\u2019s patents be sold, that the debtor execute an assignment of the patents to the purchaser, and that if the debtor failed to execute an assignment, a trustee be appointed to execute the assignment. The Supreme Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 27} Having concluded that patents are subject to payment of a creditor\u2019s judgment, the Supreme Court noted the difficulties \u201cof seizing and selling a patent * * * upon an execution at law, which is ordinarily levied only upon property * * * that has itself a visible and tangible existence within the jurisdiction of the court and the precinct of the [executing] officer.\u201d <em>Ager </em>at 130-131, 26 L.Ed. 942. The Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding from <em>Stephens v. Cady </em>(1852), 55 U.S. (14 How.) 528, 531, 14 L.Ed. 528, that \u201c \u2018the incorporeal right, secured by the statute to [a copyright or patent holder], * * * being intangible, and resting altogether in grant, is not the subject of seizure or sale [on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>execution], \u2014 certainly not at common law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ager </em>at 129-130, 26 L.Ed. 942, quoting <em>Stephens </em>at 531, 14 L.Ed. 528. Thus, the Supreme Court held that a debtor\u2019s interest in patents, although property, assignable by him, cannot be taken on execution at law. Id. at 131, 26 L.Ed. 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">{\u00b6 28} The court went on, however, to note that the difficulties of subjecting incorporeal property to a seizure and sale on execution at law do not attend decrees of a court of equity. Id., citing <em>Massie v. Watts </em>(1810), 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 148, 3 L.Ed. 181. Indeed, the court stated, \u201cit is within the general jurisdiction of a court of chancery to assist a judgment creditor to reach and apply to the payment of his debt any property of the judgment debtor, which by reason of its nature only * * * cannot be taken on execution at law.\u201d <em>Ager </em>at 129, 26 L.Ed. 942. The court quoted from <em>Stephens, </em>\u201c \u2018[n]o doubt the property may be reached by a creditor\u2019s bill, * * * the court compelling a transfer and sale * * * for the benefit of creditors.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 130, 26 L.Ed. 942, quoting <em>Stephens </em>at 531, 14 L.Ed. 528. While reaffirming the unavailability of a writ of execution at law to reach a judgment debtor\u2019s patent rights, the Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the lower court\u2019s decree was within the court\u2019s equity powers, upon a suit for a creditor\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 29} Ohio courts have long recognized the availability of an equitable creditor\u2019s bill. For example, in 1855, the Supreme Court of Ohio mentioned the \u201cwell known equitable remedy\u201d of \u201c[a] bill to reach property not liable to legal process, and subject it to the payment of a <em>judgment,\u201d </em>noting that such a remedy needed no statute to support it. (Emphasis sic.) <em>Joseph Bowry &amp; Sons v. Odell &amp; Bro. </em>(1855), 4 Ohio St. 623, 626. The remedy of a creditor\u2019s bill is now incorporated within R.C. 2333.01, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">When a judgment debtor does not have sufficient personal or real property subject to levy on execution to satisfy the judgment, any equitable interest which he has in real estate as mortgagor, mortgagee, or otherwise, or any interest he has in a banking, turnpike, bridge, or other joint-stock company, or in a money contract, claim, or chose in action, due or to become due to him, or in a judgment or order, or money, goods, or effects which he has in the possession of any person or body politic or corporate, shall be subject to the payment of the judgment by action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">R.C. 2333.01 has been said to preserve the pre-existing equitable remedy of a creditor\u2019s bill. <em>Morgan Bank, N.A. v. Security-Connecticut Life Ins. Co. </em>(Dec. 5, 2001), Summit App. No. 20594, 2001 WL 1545657, citing <em>Brusman v. Susanjar </em>(1960), 113 Ohio App. 544, 546, 18 O.O.2d 181, 179 N.E.2d 125. While it codified a proceeding by which a creditor could obtain the relief previously available through a creditor\u2019s bill, \u201c[i]t was not the intention of the Legislature by the enactment of section 11760, General Code [the predecessor to R.C. 2333.01], to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>take away any rights that existed at common law in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill.\u201d <em>Culp v. Hecht </em>(1932), 43 Ohio App. 430, 432, 183 N.E. 437; <em>Akron Chapter No. 300, Am. Ins. Union v. Read </em>(1927), 24 Ohio App. 192, 194, 157 N.E. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">{\u00b6 30} Despite the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Ager </em>at 131, 26 L.Ed. 942, that an interest in a patent is assignable property, \u201cwhich cannot be taken on execution at law,\u201d and its recognition that such an interest may be reached through a creditor\u2019s bill, Haney argues that a creditor\u2019s bill was an inappropriate means of reaching Smith Technology\u2019s patents. Haney suggests that the Supreme Court\u2019s endorsement of a creditor\u2019s bill in <em>Ager </em>does not refer to the same proceedings authorized by R.C. 2333.01, which was not in effect at the time. Given the General Assembly\u2019s intent to preserve the pre-existing equitable remedy of a creditor\u2019s bill, we discern no basis for distinguishing the \u201ccreditor\u2019s bill\u201d at issue in <em>Ager </em>from that in present-day practice in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">{\u00b6 31} Haney also argues that a creditor\u2019s bill is inappropriate because the patents themselves constitute personal property subject to levy upon execution, thus rendering R.C. 2333.01 inapplicable. In part, Haney argues that the patents are subject to levy on execution based on the Supreme Court\u2019s holding, in <em>Ager, </em>that a court in equity, on a creditor\u2019s bill, could order an assignment of the debtor\u2019s patents. However, unlike the equitable procedure affirmed in <em>Ager, </em>a levy on execution is a proceeding at law. See <em>Michigan State Industries v. Fischer Hardware Co. </em>(1934), 50 Ohio App. 153, 155, 2 O.O. 171, 197 N.E. 785 (levying execution provided adequate remedy at law, precluding equity jurisdiction); Ste<em>rn v. Columbus Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1931), 39 Ohio App. 498, 500-501, 177 N.E. 923 (contrasting remedies at law, i.e., levy or execution, with equitable remedy in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill). It is precisely that legal remedy that the <em>Ager </em>court found inapplicable to patent rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">{\u00b6 32} Haney next argues that a creditor\u2019s bill applies only when the debtor\u2019s property is held by a third person. Because Smith Technology itself possessed the patents, Haney argues that he could not utilize a creditor\u2019s bill to reach them. While R.C. 2333.01 does apply to a debtor\u2019s property held by \u201cany person,\u201d its application is not limited to property held by a third party. In <em>Lakeshore Motor Freight, </em>2 Ohio App.3d 8, 2 OBR 8, 440 N.E.2d 567, the court held that a judgment creditor could reach a debtor\u2019s pending breach-of-contract action against a third party only through a creditor\u2019s bill under R.C. 2333.01. Although the court held that the creditor\u2019s bill did not extend to the right to prosecute the breach-of-contract action, it subjected the anticipated proceeds of the action to an equitable lien. There, the debtor, and not a third party, held the chose in action and the equitable interest in the proceeds of that action. While Haney attempts to distinguish <em>Lakeshore Motor Freight, </em>arguing that the debtor there, unlike Smith Technology, had no personal property from which the creditor\u2019s judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>could be satisfied, this court has stated that a chose in action is, itself, personal property. <em>Grothaus v. Warner, </em>Franklin App. No. 08AP-115, 2008-Ohio-5563, 2008 WL 4712816, \u00b6 20, citing <em>Burns v. Daily </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 693, 704, 683 N.E.2d 1164. Thus, like Smith Technology, the debtor possessed personal property, albeit intangible property, subject to a creditor\u2019s bill. <em>Lakeshore Motor Freight </em>does not stand for Haney\u2019s proposition, nor do we find other authority for the proposition, that a creditor\u2019s bill is inapplicable when a debtor, himself, is in possession of the subject property or equitable interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">{\u00b6 33} For the foregoing reasons, we find that a creditor\u2019s bill is an appropriate method by which a judgment creditor may subject its debtor\u2019s rights in a patent to satisfaction of a judgment. Here, Olive Branch commenced its creditor\u2019s bill action by filing a complaint on January 20, 2006, and perfecting service of process on the named defendants. Upon commencement of a creditor\u2019s bill, the judgment creditor not only acquires a lien on the debtor\u2019s equitable assets, but also achieves priority over creditors of the judgment debtor without specific liens upon the debtor\u2019s interest in the property. <em>Morgan Bank, </em>2001 WL 1545657; <em>Huntington Ctr. Assoc. v. Schwartz </em>(Sept. 26, 2000), Franklin App. No. 00AP-35, 2000 WL 1376524. Accordingly, upon the proper commencement of its creditor\u2019s bill action, Olive Branch obtained a lien upon the ten patents identified in its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 34} While we conclude that a creditor\u2019s bill is an appropriate means of collecting on a monetary judgment by reaching patents owned by a judgment debtor, it does not necessarily follow that a creditor\u2019s bill is the <em>exclusive </em>means for doing so. Thus, we must also assess Haney\u2019s attempt to reach the patents in November 2004 through his R.C. 2333.21 motion. R.C. Chapter 2333, entitled \u201cProceedings in Aid of Execution,\u201d sets forth the following four methods of enforcing a judgment: (1) an action in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill, pursuant to R.C. 2333.01, (2) a garnishment proceeding on affidavit and notice, limited to certain judgments against a railroad company, pursuant to R.C. 2333.02 through 2333.08, (3) proceedings for the examination of the debtor, pursuant to R.C. 2333.09 through 2333.27, and (4) attachment of the debtor upon a judgment not for the recovery of money or real property, pursuant to R.C. 2333.28. At least one Ohio court has described R.C. Chapter 2333, in its entirety, as \u201cgoverning a creditor\u2019s proceeding in equity to satisfy a judgment.\u201d <em>Russ Fin. v. Greenberg </em>(Apr. 23,1976), Erie App. No. 3-75-38, 1976 WL 188313.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">(\u00b6 35} Haney maintains that R.C. 2333.21 provides, at least, an alternative to a creditor\u2019s bill for subjecting Smith Technology\u2019s patents to the satisfaction of its judgment. R.C. 2333.21, which is contained within the statutory procedures for examination of a debtor, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The judge may order any property of the judgment debtor that is not exempt by law to be applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment, but the earnings of the judgment debtor for personal services shall be applied only in accordance with sections 2329.66 and 2329.70 and Chapter 2716. of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Haney argues that R.C. 2333.21 applied because the patents constitute \u201cany property\u201d and are \u201cnot exempt by law.\u201d Ultimately, we need not decide whether R.C. 2333.21 provides a valid, alternative method for subjecting Smith Technology\u2019s patents to the satisfaction of Haney\u2019s judgment, because Haney did not properly invoke the remedy provided by that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 36} R.C. 2333.21 appears within the debtor-examination provisions, which begin with R.C. 2333.09. Pursuant to R.C. 2333.09, \u201c[a] judgment creditor shall be entitled to an order for the examination of a judgment debtor concerning his property, income, or other means of satisfying the judgment upon proof by affidavit that such judgment is unpaid in whole or in part.\u201d An order under R.C. 2333.09 may be issued by a probate judge, a judge of the court of common pleas of the county in which the judgment was rendered or in which the debtor resides, or a duly appointed referee. R.C. 2333.10 similarly provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">On proof by the affidavit of the judgment creditor, or otherwise, to the satisfaction of a judge of the court of common pleas, or a probate judge, of the county in which the debtor is found, that the judgment debtor has property which he unjustly refuses to apply toward the satisfaction of the judgment, such judge, by order, may require the debtor to appear at a time and place in such county to answer concerning it. Such proceedings thereupon may be had for the application of the property of the debtor toward the satisfaction of the judgment, as are prescribed by sections 2333.09 to 2333.27, inclusive, of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">An \u201corder requiring a judgment debtor to appear and submit to the examination provided for by sections 2333.09 to 2333.27 of the Revised Code, shall be in writing, signed by the judge who makes it, and served as a summons.\u201d R.C. 2333.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 37} Olive Branch and Smith Technology argue that Haney did not properly invoke proceedings for an order pursuant to R.C. 2333.21. They maintain that R.C. 2333.09 through 2333.27 operate as a discrete and unified method for subjecting a judgment debtor\u2019s property to enforcement of a judgment. Thus, they argue that a judgment creditor must obtain a court order, which must be served as a summons, requiring the debtor to appear and answer concerning his property as an absolute prerequisite to any order under R.C. 2333.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">{\u00b6 38} Haney, on the other hand, argues that he was not required to initiate proceedings for a judgment-debtor examination before moving for an order under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>R.C. 2333.21 when, as here, he was aware of specific property owned by the debtor. Haney contends that although R.C. 2333.09 entitles a judgment creditor to an order for the examination of a judgment debtor, a judgment-debtor examination is permissive, not mandatory. Haney is correct that a judgment-debtor examination is permissive in the broad context of enforcing a judgment. Nevertheless, when a judgment creditor elects to take advantage of the proceedings in aid of execution set forth in R.C. 2333.09 through 2333.27, which expressly provide for examination of the debtor, the judgment creditor may not simply move for an order that property be applied on execution and ignore the other relevant statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">{\u00b6 39} The language of the statutory provisions within R.C. 2333.09 through 2333.27 confirms that the provisions set forth a unified proceeding in aid of execution. Describing the requirements of a written order of examination and the requirements for service thereof, R.C. 2333.25 explicitly describes R.C. 2333.09 through 2333.27, inclusive, as providing for a judgment-debtor examination. This is consistent with the subtitle of R.C. Chapter 2333 applicable to those sections, \u201cBY EXAMINATION OF DEBTOR.\u201d Further, R.C. 2333.10 provides that after a debtor has been ordered to appear and answer concerning his property, \u201c[s]uch proceedings <em>thereupon </em>may be had for the application of the property of the debtor toward the satisfaction of the judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Additionally, the reference in R.C. 2333.21 to \u201c[t]he judge\u201d suggests the prior initiation of an action and refers back to the procedures established by R.C. 2333.09 and 2333.10, which specify the judges and courts that may conduct proceedings in aid of execution by examination of the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">{\u00b6 40} The Supreme Court of Ohio has directed courts to read statutes relating to the same subject matter together, in an attempt to arrive at a reasonable construction, giving proper force and effect to each statute. <em>D.A.B.E., Inc. v. Toledo-Lucas Cty. Bd. of Health, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 250, 2002-Ohio-4172, 773 N.E.2d 536, \u00b6 20. While Haney argues that a judgment-debtor examination is unnecessary when the creditor is aware .of the debtor\u2019s property, R.C. 2333.10 provides for a judgment-debtor examination in just this circumstance, when \u201cthe judgment debtor has property which he unjustly refuses to apply toward the satisfaction of the judgment.\u201d Indeed, were a judgment creditor permitted to simply file a motion under R.C. 2333.21, without first obtaining a judgment-debtor examination and without serving the judgment debtor as provided in R.C. 2333.25, on the basis that the judgment debtor has property that he unjustly refuses to apply toward satisfaction of the judgment, R.C. 2333.10 would be rendered practically meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">{\u00b6 41} Here, Haney did not obtain an order for examination of Smith Technology pursuant to R.C. 2333.09 or 2333.10. Instead, he simply filed a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>apply Smith Technology\u2019s patents toward satisfaction of his judgment and demanded the absolute and immediate transfer of the patents from Smith Technology to Haney. Smith Technology was not served in the manner prescribed for service of a summons with either Haney\u2019s motion or with a court order directing it to appear and answer concerning its property. Based on Haney\u2019s failure to obtain a written order for a judgment-debtor examination and to serve that order upon Smith Technology, we conclude that even if R.C. 2333.21 could be utilized to apply Smith Technology\u2019s patents toward satisfaction of a judgment, Haney did not properly invoke that remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">{\u00b6 42} We now turn to the trial court\u2019s determination that Olive Branch has priority over Haney with respect to the ten patents identified in both Haney\u2019s R.C. 2333.21 motion and Olive Branch\u2019s creditor\u2019s bill complaint. The trial court concluded that Olive Branch obtained a valid lien on the patents by the filing of its creditor\u2019s bill complaint in January 2006 and also obtained priority over other creditors who had not previously acquired a lien over the assets in question. The trial court further concluded that although Haney had previously attempted to initiate proceedings, pursuant to R.C. 2333.21, he failed to correct a fatal defect in his motion prior to Olive Branch\u2019s perfection of its lien. The court stated that \u201c[a] creditor, even if acting first in time, is not excused from complying with due process and statutory requirements.\u201d Therefore, the court determined that Olive Branch was the first judgment creditor to properly obtain a lien on the patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 43} On appeal, Haney maintains that he is entitled to priority over Olive Branch\u2019s lien because he acted first with respect to the patents. Haney asserts that the filing of his R.C. 2333.21 motion placed a lien on the patents in his favor, fixed the status of all judgment creditors, and prevented Olive Branch, by its subsequent creditor\u2019s bill action, from gaining priority with respect to the patents. To the contrary, Olive Branch argues that Haney\u2019s failed attempt to invoke the procedures set forth in R.C. 2333.09 through 2333.27 created no lien on the patents at all. It maintains that neither Haney\u2019s R.C. 2333.21 motion, the trial court\u2019s December 7, 2004 order, which the court subsequently vacated, nor the assignment of the patents from Smith Technology to Matthew 6 by Haney\u2019s counsel, provided Haney with a lien on the patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 44} Haney relies on <em>Cowen v. Wassman </em>(1939), 64 Ohio App. 84, 92, 17 O.O. 408, 28 N.E.2d 201, for the proposition that the most diligent creditor is awarded first priority. There, the Supreme Court of Ohio quoted <em>Brazee v. Lancaster Bank </em>(1846), 14 Ohio 318, 320, 321, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">\u201cNow it will be observed, as to these judgment liens, they are equal in extent. They attach to the entire land, or to the entire interest of the judgment debtor in the land. They [the competing judgment liens] are all of equal validity, and the only question in regard to them is as to priority. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>every other respect they are equal, and there is no injustice, no impropriety in giving the preference to that creditor who is the most diligent in the pursuit of his remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><em>Cowen, </em>however, is inapposite because, here, the court was not faced with judgment liens of equal validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 45} We discern no merit in Haney\u2019s argument that he is the most diligent judgment creditor and is, therefore, entitled to priority over Olive Branch. Liens may be created only by agreement or by a fixed rule of law. <em>Great Am. Ins. Co. v. Thompson Trust, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-040127, 2006-Ohio-304, 2006 WL 199751, \u00b6 13, fn. 5. While it is undisputed that Haney was the first party to attempt to reach Smith Technology\u2019s patents, Haney\u2019s misguided attempts left him without a lien on the patents when Olive Branch filed its creditor\u2019s bill action.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">(\u00b6 46} If, as appellees argue, R.C. 2333.21 is inapplicable to reach Smith Technology\u2019s patents, Haney\u2019s attempt to utilize that statute would not have created a lien upon which Haney could claim priority. See <em>In re Estate of Mason, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 532, 2006-Ohio-3256, 849 N.E.2d 998. Moreover, even if R.C. 2333.21 may be used to reach a debtor\u2019s patents to satisfy a judgment, Haney\u2019s actions did not a create a lien in his favor when he failed to invoke the proceedings in aid of execution under that statute. Rather than obtaining an order for Smith Technology to appear and answer concerning its property, and serving that order on Smith Technology as a summons, Haney simply filed a motion requesting that the court immediately and absolutely transfer the debtor\u2019s property to him. Contrary to Haney\u2019s assertion, such an action neither commenced a proceeding levying upon the patents nor demonstrated Haney\u2019s diligence as a judgment creditor. Haney\u2019s actions, in complete disregard of the statutory requirements under R.C. 2333.09 through 2333.27, did not give rise to a lien in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 47} Although Haney was aware, from early January 2005, of Smith Technology\u2019s arguments regarding the invalidity of his attempt to reach the patents, and despite the trial court\u2019s January 7, 2005 finding that his R.C. 2333.21 motion was fatally flawed, Haney took no further action to protect himself against claims of other creditors. The agreed orders between Haney and Smith Technology expressly reserved all defenses to Haney\u2019s purported action and did not preclude Haney from either filing a creditor\u2019s bill action or otherwise correcting the fatal defects in his attempt to invoke R.C. 2333.21. Neither the fact that Haney recorded his interest in the patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, pursuant to a subsequently vacated judgment entry, nor the parties\u2019 agreed orders providing that the patents remain in Matthew 6\u2019s possession, demonstrates the existence of a lien in favor of Haney.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>{\u00b6 48} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule Haney\u2019s first and second assignments of error. Because Haney failed to properly invoke the proceedings in aid of execution set forth at R.C. 2333.09 through 2333.27, we need not decide whether those proceedings provide an alternative method by which a judgment creditor may apply a debtor\u2019s patent toward satisfaction of a judgment. Ultimately, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that Olive Branch has the first and best lien on the ten patents identified in Olive Branch\u2019s creditor\u2019s bill complaint. Accordingly, we proceed to Haney\u2019s remaining two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">{\u00b6 49} By his third assignment of error, Haney contends that the trial court erred in denying his refiled R.C. 2333.21 motion with relation back to November 15, 2004. On December 10, 2007, after the trial court issued its decision regarding the applicability of R.C. 2333.21 and the parties\u2019 respective priorities, Haney filed a refiled motion to apply property on execution under R.C. 2333.21, substantively identical to his November 15, 2004 motion. The refiled motion contains a certificate of service, and Haney claimed, with no supporting authority, that the motion related back to November 15, 2004. On April 30, 2008, the trial court rejected Haney\u2019s proposition that the refiled motion related back to November 15, 2004. Based on our determination that Haney failed to properly commence proceedings in aid of execution specified in R.C. 2333.09 through 2333.27, the failure of Haney\u2019s attempt to reach the patents extends far beyond the absence of a certificate of service, and any refiled motion would have been a futile act. Accordingly, we discern no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of the refiled motion, and we overrule Haney\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">{\u00b6 50} By his fourth and final assignment of error, Haney contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion to stay the November 15, 2007 order to transfer the patents back to Smith Technology. Haney\u2019s contention is premised on his belief that he was entitled to a first lien on the patents and that he was, therefore, entitled to preserve his interest in the patents during the course of these appeals. Haney has no legal basis for retaining the patents, given the trial court\u2019s vacation of the judgment entry upon which the transfer was premised. Upon the proper vacation of that judgment entry, there remained no basis for the assignment of the patents to Matthew 6. Having rejected Haney\u2019s contention as to his lien priority, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit Matthew 6 to retain possession of the patents pending appeal. Accordingly, we overrule Haney\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 51} In conclusion, we overrule Haney\u2019s four assignments of error and affirm the judgments of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b531-8\">Klatt and McGrath, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
