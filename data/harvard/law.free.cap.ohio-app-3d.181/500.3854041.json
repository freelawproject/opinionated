The city of Alliance is plaintiff-appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">{\u00b6 2} On September 12, 2007, Lieutenant William Morris of the Alliance Police Department was working a sting operation in the restroom area of ButlerRodman Park. The operation was a result of several complaints of lewd activity in the restrooms and on trails behind the restrooms at the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">{\u00b6 3} Lieutenant Morris testified that on that day, there were no sporting activities in the park, nor were there any reunions or gatherings at the park. He first observed appellant\u2019s car around 1:00 p.m. when he was sitting in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>unmarked car just north of the restrooms on the west side of the park. Lieutenant Morris first observed appellant as appellant drove by in his car. According to Lieutenant Morris, appellant looked at him and nodded. Lieutenant Morris nodded back as appellant drove past him. He looked in his side mirror and observed appellant slow down his car and pump his brakes repeatedly. He testified that the pumping of brakes is one of the signals that people use when they are interested in getting together with each other in a park.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 4} Lieutenant Morris exited his car and entered the bathroom, which had a \u201cNo Loitering\u201d sign near the entrance. As he entered the bathroom, appellant drove his car around the parking lot and parked his car perpendicular to the painted lines, as Lieutenant Morris had.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 5} Lieutenant Morris stated that he was in the restroom approximately two minutes before appellant entered the restroom. When appellant entered the restroom, he immediately went to a stall and urinated. After leaving the stall, the two men engaged in a brief conversation, and appellant asked Lieutenant Morris, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u201d Lieutenant Morris responded, \u201cNothing much,\u201d and the two men walked out together. Lieutenant Morris then asked appellant, \u201cAre you looking to get together?\u201d to which appellant hesitated and responded, \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 6} Lieutenant Morris then furthered the conversation by asking, \u201cHere in a restroom or would you like to go into the woods?\u201d Lieutenant Morris testified that that is normally what occurs. Appellant responded, \u201cNo, it\u2019s too risky.\u201d According to Lieutenant Morris, appellant then said, \u201cI own a business down the road.\u201d Lieutenant Morris then offered to follow appellant to the business, and appellant agreed and gave him directions to the business. At that point, Lieutenant Morris identified himself as an undercover police officer and arrested appellant pursuant to A.M.O. 941.06(h) for disorderly conduct for loitering in or near a toilet building.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">{\u00b6 7} On February IB, 2008, appellant challenged the constitutionality of the statute, arguing that the law was unconstitutionally void for vagueness and that it was overbroad. On that same day, the trial court denied his motion. Appellant exercised his right to trial on February 14, 2008, and a jury found him guilty of disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant raises three assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cI. Alliance Municipal Ordinance 941.06(H) violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Section 1 Article 1 of the Ohio Constitution, because it is unconstitutionally void for vagueness by failing to give fair notice of the proscribed conduct and failing to set forth minimum standards to prevent arbitrary enforcement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201cII. Alliance Municipal Ordinance 941.06(H) violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and Section 1 Article 1 of the Ohio Constitution because it is overbroad and adversely impacts the rights of association and free speech encompassed within the First amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIII. Appellant\u2019s conviction for one count of disorderly conduct in the parks is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u2022I &amp; II</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 12} In appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error, he challenges the constitutionality of A.M.O. 941.06(h), arguing that it is both vague and overbroad and therefore violates the Due Process Clause of both the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 13} Statutes enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality, and a party seeking to have a statute declared unconstitutional must prove its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Brayden James, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 420, 2007-Ohio-2335, 866 N.E.2d 467, at \u00b6 13; <em>State v. Anderson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 168, 171, 566 N.E.2d 1224. An appellate court\u2019s review of the constitutionality of a statute is de novo. <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 411, 700 N.E.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA municipality\u2019s power to pass ordinances to promote the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public is broad, and not subject to precise definition.\u201d <em>Whitehall v. Khoury, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-711, 2008-Ohio-1376, 2008 WL 787670, citing <em>Columbus v. Truax </em>(1983), 7 Ohio App.3d 49, 51, 7 OBR 60, 454 N.E.2d 184. A city\u2019s police power is not unlimited, however, and a municipal ordinance \u201c \u2018must not be arbitrary, discriminatory, capricious or unreasonable and must bear a real and substantial relation to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Cincinnati v. Correll </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 535, 26 O.O. 116, 49 N.E.2d 412, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">I. VAGUENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\"> {\u00b6 15} In considering a challenge to an ordinance or statute as void for vagueness, a court is required to determine whether the enactment \u201c(1) provides sufficient notice of its proscriptions to facilitate compliance by persons of ordinary intelligence and (2) is specific enough to prevent official arbitrariness or discrimination in its enforcement.\u201d <em>Norwood v. Horney, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-3799, 853 N.E.2d 1115, at \u00b6 84. A statute is not void for vagueness simply because it could have been worded more precisely or with additional certainty. Rather, the \u201ccritical question in all cases is whether the law affords a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>individual of ordinary intelligence fair notice and sufficient definition and guidance to enable him to conform his conduct to the law.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant contends that A.M.O. 941.06(h) is void for vagueness both on its face and as it applies to him. In order to determine what constitutes loitering for the purposes of the ordinance, appellant claims that there is no guidance as to what is legal and not legal conduct, and accordingly, the law is unconstitutional as written because it reaches a wide range of innocent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 17} The freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is a recognized liberty in the United States that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Chicago v. Morales </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 41, 119 S.Ct. 1849, 144 L.Ed.2d 67. The Supreme Court has specifically held that this \u201cright to remove from one place to another according to inclination\u201d is an \u201cattribute of personal liberty\u201d protected by the Constitution. Id. at 1858, 119 S.Ct. 1849, 144 L.Ed.2d 67, citing <em>Williams v. Fears </em>(1900), 179 U.S. 270, 274, 21 S.Ct. 128, 45 L.Ed. 186. \u201c[A]n individual\u2019s decision to remain in a public place of his choice is as much a part of his liberty as the freedom of movement inside frontiers that is \u2018a part of our heritage.\u2019 \u201d Id., citing <em>Kent v. Dulles </em>(1958), 357 U.S. 116, 126, 78 S.Ct. 1113, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cIt is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. * * * Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. * * * Third, but related, where a vague statute \u2018abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms,\u2019 it \u2018operates to inhibit the exercise of [those] freedoms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Akron v. Rowland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 374, 381, 618 N.E.2d 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 19} The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that loitering and vagrancy laws \u201chave a long and troubling history in Anglo-American jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Rowland, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 377, 618 N.E.2d 138. See also <em>State v. Griffin </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 490, 728 N.E.2d 1097 (courts generally disfavor loitering laws, as they have the potential to punish persons who use public streets innocently or when exercising constitutional rights). In the 1970s and 1980s, most American vagrancy laws were held unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, most famously in <em>Papachristou v. Jacksonville </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 156, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110. In <em>Papachristou, </em>the court considered a vagrancy law that penalized \u201crogues and vagabonds,\u201d \u201cdissolute persons who go about begging, common gamblers, persons who use juggling or unlawful games or plays, common drunkards, * * * persons wandering or strolling around from place to place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>without any lawful purpose or object, [and] habitual loafers * * *.\u201d Id. at 156-157, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110. Determining that the ordinance was vague, the court held that enforcement of the ordinance violated due process. Specifically, the court held that the Jacksonville ordinance \u201cmakes criminal activities which by modern standards are normally innocent.\u201d Id. at 163, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110. The court determined that the ordinance was vague because it did not give ordinary people notice of what conduct was prohibited and because it gave the police unfettered discretion to make arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">{\u00b6 20} A decade later, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Papachristou. </em>See <em>Kolender v. Lawson </em>(1983), 461 U.S. 352, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903. In <em>Kolender, </em>the court declared a California statute unconstitutional that made it illegal for a person to \u201cloiterf ] or wander[ ] upon the streets or from place to place without apparent reason or business and * * * refuse} ] to identify himself and to account for his presence when requested by any peace officer so to do, if the surrounding circumstances are such as to indicate to a reasonable man that the public safety demands such identification.\u201d Id. at 353, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903. The court determined that the California law gave too much discretion to police. Specifically, the court stated, \u201cAn individual, whom [sic] police may think is suspicious but do not have probable cause to believe has committed a crime, is entitled to continue to walk the public streets \u2018only at the whim of any police officer\u2019 who happens to stop that individual.\u201d Id. The court concluded that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it encouraged arbitrary enforcement by \u201cfaffing to describe with sufficient particularity what a suspect must do in order to\u201d commit a violation. Id. at 361, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 21} While new loitering laws are more narrowly tailored than the older vagrancy laws, as the Ohio Supreme Court has stated, \u201cThis generation of loitering ordinances, however, sought \u2018to wrap the same unconstitutional law in a prettier package that was more likely to receive judicial sanction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rowland, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 379, 618 N.E.2d 138, quoting Comment, The Third Generation of Loitering Laws Goes to Court: Do Laws That Criminalize \u201cLoitering With Intent to Sell Drugs\u201d Pass Constitutional Muster? (1993), 71 N.C.L.Rev. 513, 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Rowland, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that an Akron loitering ordinance was void for vagueness. That ordinance stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(A) No person shall loiter in or near any thoroughfare, place open to the public, or near any public or private place in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose to engage in drug-related activity contrary to any of the provisions of R.C. Chapter 2925.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(B) Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such purpose is manifested are:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>{\u00b6 25} \u201c(1) Such person is a known unlawful drug user, possessor or seller * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(2) Such person is currently subject to a court order prohibiting his presence in a high drug activity geographic area;</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(3) Such person behaves in such a manner as to raise a reasonable suspicion that he is about to engage in or is then engaged in an unlawful drug-related activity, including, by way of example only, such person acting as a lookout or hailing or stopping cars;</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(4) Such person is physically identified by the officer as a member of a gang or association which has as its purpose illegal drug activity;</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(5) Such person transfers small objects or packages in a furtive fashion;</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(6) Such person takes flight or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself upon the appearance of a police officer;</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(7) Such person manifestly endeavors to conceal any object which reasonably could be involved in an unlawful drug-related activity;</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(8) Such person possesses any instrument, article, or thing whose customary or primary purpose is for the sale, administration, or use of controlled subjects [sic] * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(9) The area involved is by public repute known to be an area of unlawful drug use and trafficking;</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(10) The premises involved are known to the defendant to have been reported to law enforcement as a place of drug activity pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2925;</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(11) Any vehicle involved is registered to a known unlawful drug user, possessor, or seller, or a person for whom there is an outstanding warrant for a crime involving drug-related activity.\u201d Akron Codified Ordinance (\u201cA.C.O.\u201d) 138.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">{\u00b6 36} The Ohio Supreme Court held that A.C.O. 138.26 was unconstitutionally vague because the ordinance did not even require proof of the specific intent to engage in drug-related activity. The 11 circumstances in the ordinance were only \u201camong the circumstances which may be considered.\u201d A reasonable person could not figure out what constituted innocent loitering and criminal loitering, especially because most of the circumstances listed in the ordinance are considered to be legal acts. The court determined that it was too hard to determine what a police officer would consider circumstances manifesting a purpose to engage in drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>{\u00b6 37} In this case, A.M.O. 941.06(h) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cNo person shall loiter in or near toilet buildings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 39} The term \u201cloiter\u201d is not defined anywhere in the Alliance Municipal Code. Nothing in A.M.O. 941.06(h) requires that a crime actually be committed in order to support an arrest or conviction. This law is \u201cclearly designed to nip crime \u2018in the bud.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rowland, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 379, 618 N.E.2d 138, quoting <em>Papachristou, </em>405 U.S. at 171, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110. A criminal statute must be reasonably clear and definite and there must be identifiable standards of guilt on which citizens, courts, and the police may rely in order for the law to comport with due process. <em>Rowland </em>at 381, 618 N.E.2d 138. \u201cA person cannot be punished simply because the state believes that he or she is probably a criminal.\u201d Id. at 382, 618 N.E.2d 138. \u201cIt is a constitutional imperative that the dividing line between the lawful and the criminal be clear to all and not subject to conjecture.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 40} Upon review, we hold that A.M.O. 941.06(h) is unconstitutionally vague on its face because it does not give people of ordinary intelligence reasonable notice to know what conduct is prohibited. \u201c \u2018Loitering\u2019, alone, is not a crime and cannot constitutionally be punished. \u2018A presumption that people who might walk or loaf or loiter or stroll or frequent houses where liquor is sold, or who are supported by their wives or who look suspicious to the police are to become future criminals is too precarious for a rule of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rowland, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 382, 618 N.E.2d 138, quoting <em>Papachristou, </em>405 U.S. at 171, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process.\u201d (Citations omitted). <em>Rowland, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 383, 618 N.E.2d 138. If the average person read A.M.O. 941.06(h), he could not be sure whether having a conversation in a public bathroom would constitute criminal loitering. Accordingly, the ordinance must fail, in part, because it provides citizens with inadequate notice of what conduct is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 42} We further hold that the ordinance, as applied to appellant, is so vague that he could not reasonably know the dividing line between innocent loitering (engaging in a conversation after using the toilet facilities) and criminal loitering. Appellant drove into a park, went into the bathroom, immediately went into a stall and urinated, and then came out of the stall, where Lieutenant Morris was waiting for him and engaged him in conversation. None of these acts are per se illegal. Thus, without being able to read the officer\u2019s mind, appellant cannot be expected to know that his actions were criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>{\u00b6 43} A person who has a legitimate purpose to be in a particular place may not always be able to make that purpose known to a casual observer. \u201cFor example, a person waiting to hail a taxi, resting on a corner during a job, or stepping into a doorway to evade a rain shower has a perfectly legitimate purpose in all of these scenarios; however, that purpose will rarely be apparent to an observer.\u201d <em>Chicago v. Morales </em>(1997), 177 Ill.2d 440, 452, 227 Ill.Dec. 130, 687 N.E.2d 53, 61. \u201c \u2018Merely stopping someone to talk to them cannot be characterized as hindering, obstructing, or impeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Griffin </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 490, 497, 728 N.E.2d 1097, quoting <em>State v. Smith </em>(Dec. 23, 1993), 8th Dist. No. 64506, 1993 WL 536068. Moreover, the \u201cSupreme Court has rejected observations of minimal public activity such as \u2018wandering\u2019 as too subjective to provide probable cause to arrest for a violation of a \u2018suspicious person\u2019 statutes.\u201d Id., citing <em>Columbus v. Thompson </em>(1971) 25 Ohio St.2d 26, 31-32, 266 N.E.2d 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 44} Similarly, in <em>Pennsylvania v. Asamoah </em>(Pa.Super.2002), 809 A.2d 943, the court struck down a loitering ordinance, holding that the ordinance failed to define or specify what acts demonstrated an intent to enter into an illegal drug transaction in violation of the ordinance. In <em>Asamoah, </em>the ordinance at issue prohibited a person from loitering \u201cin any public or private place at a time, or under any circumstance or in such a manner as to: Commit acts that demonstrate an intent or desire to enter into or encourage third parties to engage in a drug transaction.\u201d Codified Ordinances of the City of York, General Offenses Code, Section 713.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 45} The defendant in <em>Asamoah </em>was observed standing on a public sidewalk holding money in his hand. He was standing near another person, who had his back to the police officer who made the arrest in that case. As the officer approached, the defendant turned and walked away. The person who had been standing next to the defendant walked in a different direction and threw down a plastic baggie that contained an off-white substance that was not crack cocaine. The officer and his partner circled the block in their squad car and observed the defendant on a different street, still holding money in his hand. The police officer arrested the defendant pursuant to the loitering ordinance for committing acts demonstrating an intent or desire to enter into a drug transaction. The defendant was not convicted of possessing contraband substances, nor was he observed possessing any contraband substances, according to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 46} <em>Asamoah </em>held that the antiloitering ordinance provided \u201cno guidance as to what constitutes an act demonstrating the \u2018intent or desire to enter into a drug transaction.\u2019 Thus, police officers are free to order any person to \u2018move on or disperse,\u2019 as they please, pursuant to subsection (c) of the ordinance. The ordinance, therefore, constitutes a \u2018vague\u2019 law because it impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to police officers for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>basis.\u201d <em>Asamoah, </em>809 A.2d 943 at \u00b6 11.

Bright </em>(1988), 71 N.Y.2d 376, 526 N.Y.S.2d 66, 520 N.E.2d 1355 (holding that a statute that merely prohibits loitering, without more, is unconstitutionally vague).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cA law is also impermissibly vague when it \u2018delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 383-384, 618 N.E.2d 138, quoting <em>Grayned v. Rockford </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 104, 108-109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222. Like the ordinance in <em>Rowland, </em>A.M.O. 941.06(h) gives police and courts unfettered discretion to determine whether a person\u2019s conduct constitutes criminal loitering. \u201cWhen a legislative body enacts a law that fails to provide minimal guidelines, it has in effect authorized police officers, prosecutors, judges, and jurors to limit another\u2019s freedoms according to their own personal prejudices and predilections * * *; it has authorized rule by whim rather than law.\u201d Id., quoting <em>Timmons v. Montgomery </em>(M.D.Ala.1987), 658 F.Supp. 1086, 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 48} We also determine that A.M.O. 941.06(h) permits police to make an arrest before any crime has occurred. They do not need to have any evidence that a crime has occurred or is about to occur; rather, they can make a subjective determination to arrest a person based solely on their suspicion of criminal intent. \u201cThe fact that conduct occurs in a \u2018high crime area\u2019 does not eliminate the requirement that law enforcement must have probable cause to arrest a person. Law enforcement personnel cannot rely on their own \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy to arrest people for pretextual loitering law violations in high crime areas for the purpose of conducting a fishing expedition for evidence of other crimes.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>133 Ohio App.3d at 495, 728 N.E.2d 1097. In this case, such a subjective intent formed the basis for appellant\u2019s arrest.

What do you understand to be the meaning of the word, \u2018loitering\u2019?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cA [Lieutenant Morris]: Loitering, to me, to engage in activity other than the purpose of it, is a.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cQ: Okay.

And there was no unusual delay in him leaving the restroom was there?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cA: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>{\u00b6 57} \u201cQ: And the reason he may have delayed leaving the restroom is because you were in a conversation with him, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cA: As he was leaving, he actually struck up conversation again with me.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cQ: And it\u2019s not against the law to strike up a conversation?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cA: Absolutely not.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cQ: Nor is it against the law to be in the park?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cA: Nope.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cQ: Or to use the public restroom in the park?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cA: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cQ: Or to drive around the island in the park before you park?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cA: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cQ: So he hasn\u2019t done anything illegal other than your decision that he loitered in and about the toilet area?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cA: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">{\u00b6 69} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b544-17\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cQ: Okay. Did we arrest everyone that visited the restroom?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-18\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cA: No, absolutely not.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-19\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cQ: Cause I was \u2014 I was kind of wondering what the criteria was to not get arrested if you entered the restroom. If I entered the restroom and talked to you, am I getting arrested because I loitered?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-20\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cA: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-21\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cQ: Okay, then why did he get arrested because he loitered?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-22\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cA: From the onset when we first made contact, the nod was just a social nod. The slowing down and pumping of the brakes is a protocol that\u2014 there\u2019s actually a website. We were informed of this by Canton PD who had an investigation and a problem in their parks and they told us to go to this site because specifically Butler Rodman was listed. And in that protocol was the tapping of the brakes, the backing in with your parking lights on during the daytime. Several different indicators of * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b544-23\">{\u00b6 76} \u201cQ: Okay. And all that protocol does nothing more than call your attention to someone, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-24\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cA: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-25\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cQ: Okay. But it\u2019s not a cause to arrest him?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>{\u00b6 79} \u201cA: That\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cQ: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 81} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cQ: The protocol you\u2019re talking about, that we have no knowledge of anyone other than apparently the police is that when somebody nods at you, happens to pump their brakes, and backs their car in with their lights on, that means that * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cA: The protocol * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cQ: * * * that they want to have sex with you?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cA: The protocol that I\u2019m referring to is, is it\u2019s public information. It\u2019s on the website. It\u2019s a site called cruisingforsex.com. It\u2019s very crude and it\u2019s, it\u2019s not a gay site. It can be either. But the point is that they loiter. They\u2019re called \u2018Cruisee Parks,\u2019 \u2018Cruisee Spots,\u2019 \u2018Cruisee Adult Bookstores.\u2019 Butler Rodman Park is rated four star. It\u2019s on the site and it has the protocol. I didn\u2019t write the protocol. People who patronize these places write the protocol.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cQ: But apparently, you\u2019ve read all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cA: One at a time, they are not illegal. The totality of the circumstances leads me to believe that that\u2019s why your client was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cQ: Okay, But the totality of the circumstances are that still all those things put together aren\u2019t illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cA: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">{\u00b6 90} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cA: As I\u2019m standing there and he\u2019s walking out unobstructed, he made a comment to me. \u2018So what\u2019s going on?\u2019 I believe is what he said, or words to the effect of, \u2018So what\u2019s going on?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cQ: Anything wrong with that?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">{\u00b6 93} \u201cA: Absolutely not.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-19\">{\u00b6 94} \u201cQ: Okay. And from there the conversation talks about getting together, you know, not a conversation uncommon at a baseball field as 6:00 o\u2019clock at night between a man and a woman, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-20\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cA: I\u2019m sorry.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-21\">{\u00b6 96} \u201cQ: Okay. If I was out watching my kid play baseball at Butler Rodman Park at 6:00 o\u2019clock at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-22\">{\u00b6 97} \u201cA: Uh-huh.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>{\u00b6 98} \u201cQ: And I\u2019m talking to a single mother, and I\u2019m a single male and I say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s get together.\u2019 There\u2019s no crime committed there, is there?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 99} \u201cA: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 100} \u201cQ: Okay, so there\u2019s no crime committed there when he may have said to you, \u2018Let\u2019s get together sometime.\u2019 Right?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 101} \u201cA: And I asked, \u2018Do you want to get together in a restroom or in the woods.\u2019 * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">{\u00b6 102} \u201cAnd he said, \u2018It\u2019s too risky.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">{\u00b6 103} On redirect, the prosecutor asked Lieutenant Morris to clarify what he believed the definition of loiter was, and Lieutenant Morris responded, \u201cI go to the park and we go, maybe for a picnic. I coach softball. We play ball there. Our purpose is to go there for a park activity, to play, to play ball, to run, to walk a dog. I don\u2019t go to Butler Rodman or Memorial or Silver Park solely to use the restroom. There\u2019s another purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">{\u00b6 104} The prosecutor clarified, stating, \u201cOkay. So you\u2019re saying that it\u2019s because the purpose was not to use the park, it was to do something else,\u201d to which Lieutenant Morris responded, \u201cCorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">(\u00b6 105} On recross, defense counsel asked Lieutenant Morris:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">{\u00b6 106} \u201cQ: But all this purpose stuff is your perception. I mean people do use the park restrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">{\u00b6 107} \u201cA: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">{\u00b6 108} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b546-15\">{\u00b6 109} \u201cQ: Okay. And you know, I don\u2019t want to bore the jury with my bathroom experiences, but you know, when we travel we frequently stop at parks and use the bathrooms because they\u2019re generally clean. Okay. At our national parks or wherever, you know. I think that it is, it\u2019s \u2014 you won\u2019t disagree with me that it\u2019s perfectly legal to use the park\u2019s restroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">{\u00b6 110} \u201cA: I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">{\u00b6 111} \u201cQ: Okay. And that the purpose for him going in the restroom is to use the restroom, then he fulfilled the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-18\">{\u00b6 112} \u201cA: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-19\">{\u00b6 113} \u201cQ: He actually did go to the bathroom. We can hear it on the video.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-20\">{\u00b6 114} \u201cA: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-21\">{\u00b6 115} \u201cQ: Okay. And let\u2019s assume the worst possible case scenario that he was there for exactly the purpose you think he was there for. Okay. He didn\u2019t commit a crime. Right? His discussion with you was not criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>{\u00b6 116} \u201cA: The discussion was not criminal, no.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">{\u00b6 117} \u201cQ: Okay. So, and you didn\u2019t charge him with a criminal activity with regard to solicitation or sex?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 118} \u201cA: That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">{\u00b6 119} \u201cQ: Okay. So now I guess we\u2019re just looking at the time frame that he was there. Did he fulfil his purpose? Yes, he went to the bathroom. And he was there for somewhat less than two minutes. I mean there\u2019s a number of reasons, would you agree, when someone parks their car that they may not immediately get out of the car. Maybe they have a cell phone call. Maybe they\u2019re looking at some paperwork. Maybe there\u2019s a song on the radio they like to listen to. So since you\u2019re not there, since you\u2019re twenty, thirty feet away, forty feet away, whatever it was, you don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t get out of the car. You\u2019re just speculating. Correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">{\u00b6 120} \u201cA: The entire incident was about five minutes. And do I know that he was listening to a radio, cell phone? I don\u2019t know that.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">{\u00b6 121} \u201cQ: You don\u2019t know. Right? So you can\u2019t say for sure why he didn\u2019t immediately hop out of his car and run holding himself to the restroom to go to the bathroom, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">{\u00b6 122} \u201cA: Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">{\u00b6 123} \u201cQ: Okay. And again, the nod as explained by you, he could have just been courteous.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">{\u00b6 124} \u201cA: Sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">{\u00b6 125} \u201cQ: He could have known you. You could\u2019ve lived down the street from him at some point. And he could have nodded at you cause he recognized you. You know, there\u2019s times when people pump their brakes. Maybe he didn\u2019t want to go in the restroom if you were in there. Maybe when he saw you start to pull away, he stopped and wanted to come back. Who knows? But did you ever inquire of him why he pumped his brakes?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">{\u00b6 126} \u201cA: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">{\u00b6 127} \u201cQ: No. You just assumed it was a signal to meet me in the bathroom, buddy? Right? Cause that\u2019s what your protocol told you to do?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">{\u00b6 128} \u201cA: It was an indicator, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">{\u00b6 129} \u201cQ: In your opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">{\u00b6 130} \u201cA: In my opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>{\u00b6 131} Lieutenant Morris\u2019s testimony focused only on his subjective conclusions that appellant had loitered in or near the toilet area based on a two-minute conversation after appellant used the toilet facilities to urinate.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 132} The plain language of A.M.O. 941.06(h) does not give police or courts an objective standard to enforce this law, and this vagueness led to arbitrary enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 133} Accordingly, we hold that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">II. OVERBREADTH</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">{\u00b6 134} Appellant next contends that A.M.O. 941.06(h) is overbroad. Specifically, Appellant argues that the prohibition against loitering encompasses a wide range of constitutionally protected activity, \u201cspecifically the Freedom to Associate and Freedom of Speech\u201d and that \u201cthere are no limitations within the statute to explain what constitutes loitering in or near a toilet building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">{\u00b6 135} In general, \u201c[a]n overbreadth challenge is predicated on the proposition that \u2018[a] clear and precise enactment may nevertheless be \u201cover-broad\u201d if in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Akron v. Molyneaux </em>(2001), 144 Ohio App.3d 421, 426, 760 N.E.2d 461, quoting <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 114-115, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222. In considering an over-breadth challenge, a court must determine \u201cwhether the ordinance sweeps within its prohibitions what may not be punished under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d <em>Rowland, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 386, 618 N.E.2d 138, quoting <em>Grayned </em>at 115, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">{\u00b6 136} In order to demonstrate facial overbreadth, a party challenging a law must show \u201cthat its potential application reaches a significant amount of protected activity.\u201d <em>Rowland, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 386, 618 N.E.2d 138. Moreover, even if a criminal statute has a legitimate application, it can still be held facially invalid if it makes a substantial amount of lawfully protected conduct unlawful. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">{\u00b6 137} A.M.O. 941.06(h) can readily implicate \u201ca person\u2019s status, associates, mere presence or otherwise innocent behavior.\u201d Id. Therefore, the ordinance encroaches on a \u201csubstantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d (Citations omitted). Id. \u201cThe case law is legion that people cannot be punished because of their status, the company they keep, or their presence in a public place.\u201d Id., citing, e.g., <em>Roberts v.

Texas </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 47, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (arrest cannot be based on \u201csuspicion\u201d alone); <em>Papachristou, </em>405 U.S. at 169, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>(\u201cArresting a person on suspicion, like arresting a person for investigation, is foreign to our system, even when the arrest is for past criminality\u201d); <em>Robinson v.

United States </em>(1961), 367 U.S. 203, 224-225, 81 S.Ct. 1469, 6 L.Ed.2d 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">{\u00b6 138} <em>Rowland </em>referenced a Richmond, Virginia ordinance that prohibited loitering for purposes of prostitution. The Richmond court had stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">{\u00b6 139} \u201cUnder the provisions of the Richmond ordinance, a person once convicted of prostitution could be arrested and convicted for window-shopping. A hitchhiker could be arrested and convicted because she waved and beckoned to cars though she said not a word regarding solicitation or prostitution. The ordinance may force people to curb their freedom of expression and association or risk arrest. Even if the hitchhiker or former prostitute were acquitted due to lack of evidence of intent, an arrest would be justified under the statute, and the arrest itself chills first amendment rights.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Coleman v. Richmond </em>(1988), 5 Va.App. 459, 465, 364 S.E.2d 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">{\u00b6 140} Additionally, in <em>Silvar v. Nevada </em>(2006), 122 Nev. 289, 129 P.3d 682, a Nevada court struck down a loitering ordinance as overbroad. The ordinance stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">{\u00b6 141} \u201cIt is unlawful for any person to loiter in or near any public place or thoroughfare in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose of inducing, enticing, soliciting for or procuring another to commit an act of prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">{\u00b6 142} \u201cAmong the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such purpose is manifested are that such person repeatedly beckons to, stops, attempts to stop or engages persons passing by in conversation, or repeatedly stops or attempts to stop motor vehicle operators by hailing, waving of arms or any other bodily gesture. No arrest shall be made for a violation of this section unless the arresting officer first affords such person an opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>explain such conduct, and no one shall be convicted of violating this section if it appears at trial that the explanation given was true and disclosed a lawful purpose.\u201d <em>Silvar, </em>129 P.3d at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">{\u00b6 143} The court, in striking down the law as being overbroad, held that the ordinance criminalized constitutionally protected conduct. \u201cBecause CCO 12.08.030 chills [ ] conduct, the ordinance is substantially overbroad in relation to its \u2018legitimate sweep.\u2019 The ordinance\u2019s provision for an opportunity to explain one\u2019s conduct does not mitigate this chilling effect. Second, the ordinance contains no specific intent element; therefore, it cannot make constitutionally protected conduct criminal.\u201d <em>Silvar, </em>129 P.3d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">{\u00b6 144} Similarly, A.M.O. 941.06(h) chills First Amendment rights, as it sweeps within the prohibitions of the law many things that may not be constitutionally punished under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This ordinance prevents citizens from enjoying their complete constitutional rights and deprives ordinary citizens of their rights to exercise speech, association, and privacy based on their presence or innocent behavior in a public place.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">{\u00b6 145} In summary, we hold that A.M.O. 941.06(h) contravenes both the federal and Ohio due process clauses because it is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">{\u00b6 146} In his third assignment of error, appellant challenges his conviction, claiming that it is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Due to our disposition of appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error, the third assignment of error is moot, and we decline to address it. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">{\u00b6 147} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and appellant\u2019s conviction is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Judgment reversed and conviction vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b550-12\">Hoffman, P.J. and Edwards, J. concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
